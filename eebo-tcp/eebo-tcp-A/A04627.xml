            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:20090:4"/>
Yee ſee, my deere Countrymen, how the
Lord hath afflicted us; and doubtleſſe the cauſe is
our ſinnes. It ſhall therefore be our wiſedome to
examine our ſelves narrowly, wherein wee have
tranſgreſſed; and then to returne into the path
of Gods Commandements, that hee may have
mercy upon us, and remove his judgements from
us.</p>
            <p>Now behold the judgements of God have
long hovered over our land: Wherefore as
<hi>Ieremy</hi> then called the Iews to ſearch their waies;
ſo is it ſeaſonable for every Miniſter of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
among us, to call his people to examination
of their wayes, that the feirce wrath of God may
be turned from us.</p>
            <p>And for my part at this time I am called to
make a viſitation Sermon: yee ſee the <hi>Viſitors</hi> are
come to inquire concerning all our wayes. What
fitter exhortation then can I make, than this of
the wiſe Prophet? <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes,
and turne againe to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this exhortation I obſerve two parts; the
firſt ſtands in ſearching and trying our wayes:
the ſecond, in turning againe to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Concerning the former part in thoſe words, <hi>Let
us ſearch and try our wayes,</hi> I note three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, who be the perſons ſummoned in the
particle <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly the act, which is twofold, <hi>ſearch, and
try.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly the object to bee ſearched and tryed,
<hi>our wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:20090:4"/>
Touching the firſt, the perſons ſummoned in
the particle, <hi>us;</hi> No queſtion but <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeakes
to the body of the Iewes, including himſelfe.
For though he was a righteous man, yet he knew
as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 143. 2. That in Gods ſight,
no man living is juſtified.</hi> To the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Iſrael therefore doth <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeake, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
himſelfe when he ſaith, <hi>Let us ſearch, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner at this time, doe I direct my
ſpeech to the whole Deanery of the Iſle of
Wight, not excluding my ſelfe, or any of my
brethren of the Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Nay more, including you alſo right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that are come to viſite us, and all your officers
from the higheſt to the loweſt; yea and all that
have any hand in this daies viſitation, as Church-wardens
and ſidemen, Plainetiffes, Defendants,
and witneſſes, all that prove Wills, or take upon
them the adminiſtration of other mens goods: in
a word, to you all that heare me this day, as alſo
to my ſelfe, doe I ſay in the word of the Lord,
<hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes.</hi> For though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome among us are not ſuch heinous ſinners
as others; yet we cannot but confeſſe if wee will
ſpeake the truth, that <hi>in many things we ſinne all:</hi> and
therefore have juſt cauſe every one to <hi>ſearch and
try our wayes;</hi> wherefore I ſay againe and againe,
Let us all and every one of us, ſearch and try our
wayes.</p>
            <p>I doe not deny but it is the part of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and the duty of the Miniſter, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens,
and all ſwornemen, to ſearch and try
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20090:5"/>
the wayes of all that are committed to their
charge; and woe be unto them if they doe not:</p>
            <p>But yet it is laid as a burden upon every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſon to ſearch himſelfe, according to
that 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 28. Let a man, i.</hi> every man, <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
him ſelfe,</hi> and againe, <hi>Let every man prove his
owne worke, Gal.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
            <p>Neither ſhall we thinke it ſtrange, that every
man is called to the ſtrict examination of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
if we marke the reaſon.</p>
            <p>For firſt, they to whom the care of others is
committed, many times are careleſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no man can take notice of all ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wandrings; <hi>The heart is deceit full above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
who can ſearch it? Ier.</hi> 17, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Every one of us ſhall give account to God
of himſelfe, Rom. 14, 12. Every man ſhall beare his
owne burden, Gal. 6. 5.</p>
            <p>Tis true, if the Magiſtrate, and Miniſter, and
other overſeers, warne not the wicked whom
they eſpie, but let them goe on in ſinne, <hi>God will
require their blood at their hands;</hi> but yet they <hi>ſhall
dye in their ſinnes,</hi> and beare their owne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Ezec.</hi> 33. 8. Which being ſo, every one that
is wiſe will ponder his owne paths; Every one
that hath underſtanding will ſearch and try his
owne wayes.</p>
            <p>So ye have the firſt particular, every man, high
or low, rich or poore, learned or unlearned, bond
or free, muſt ſearch and try his owne wayes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particular to bee conſidered is the
Act, which is twofold, <hi>ſearch, and try.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:20090:5"/>
By ſearching, wee muſt underſtand a narrow
looking into our courſes by taking ſpeciall view
of them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> expreſſes the meaning when hee ſayes,
<hi>Pſal. 119. 59. I conſidered my wayes,</hi> that is, as other
tranſlations have it, <hi>I thougt on my wayes,</hi> or, I
called all my wayes to my remembrance. So
then being in my text commanded to ſearch our
wayes, tis as if we had beene enjoyned to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all our wayes, or to call to our remembrance,
as much as wee can, all our by-paſt thoughts,
words, and deeds.</p>
            <p>Moreover when we have ſearched, or taken
ſpeciall notice of all our wayes, we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the ſecond place to try them, that is, to
weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and
prove them by the touch-stone of Gods word,
whether they be good and current, or not.</p>
            <p>Behold then thy Duty, whoſoever thou art.
Thou muſt often enter into ſerious examination
and conſideration of all thy wayes: thou muſt
every day ponder with thy ſelfe, whether thy
converſation be ſutable to Gods will or not.</p>
            <p>Concerning this ſearching and trying in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matters, we are for the moſt part very wiſe: he
that hath a flock of ſheepe, will have a ſhepheard
to handle them dayly. He that hath much land,
will have a bay liffe to overſee it continually. Yee
need not bid the merchant try his ſilver &amp; gold,
and ſearch his other commodities. Who doth
not often talke and inquire concerning the eſtate
of his body?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:20090:6"/>
               <hi>But concerning the eſtate of our ſoules, wee
are too too negligent. I may ſay of our dayes as</hi>
Ieremy 8. 6. I hearkned and heard, but they ſpake not
aright, no man repented him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying,
what have I done? Every one turneth to his courſe as
the horſe ruſheth into the battell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnto whom ſhall I compare the men of this
generation? certainely they are like the people of</hi>
Laiſh: Iudg. 18. 27. The children of Dan came unto
Laiſh, a quiet people and without miſtruſt, and ſmote
them with the edge of the ſword, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Even ſo, though wee heare daily, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<hi>like a roaring Lyon goes about ſeeking whom hee
may devoure, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and that our luſts daily
<hi>warre againſt our ſoules, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11. and that <hi>the
whole world lyes in wickedneſse, 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 19. yet we lie
ſtill ſnorting in our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Yea more, though it be moſt apparant that the
Lord hath whet his ſword, and prepared inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of death, as the plague, famine, and the
ſword, which have in our country and among
our neighbours, devoured many thouſands, and
ten thouſands within theſe few yeares, yet we are
not moved hereby to ſearch and try our wayes:
Wee ſleepe like a man upon the top of a Maſte.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the ſecond particular, the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
act, <hi>ſearch and try.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come to the third particular, which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
or what we muſt ſearch and try, namely, <hi>our
wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by this word <hi>wayes,</hi> we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
our thoughts, words, and works: So they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20090:6"/>
are often termed in the Scripture, <hi>Gen. 6. 12. All
fleſh had corrupted his way, i.</hi> all mankind had pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
their manners, they were growne diſſolute
in their thoughts, words, and deeds.</p>
            <p>Now, our thoughts, words and deedes are
termed our wayes, becauſe by them we walke as
twere to heaven or hel, as by the Kings high way
we paſſe from towne to towne. Hee that thinkes
good thoughts, ſpeakes good words, and doth
good workes, is walking in the way to heaven.
<hi>Bona opera ſunt via regn: i.</hi> good works are the way
to the kingdome of heaven; <hi>Which God hath ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that wee ſhould walke in them, Ephe.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>Hee that thinkes evill thoughts, ſpeakes evill
words, doth evill deeds, is walking in the way
to hell. <hi>Prov. 7. 27. Salomon</hi> ſaith <hi>The houſe of a
whore is the way to hell: i.</hi> whoremongers and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
are walking in the ready way that leades to
hell.</p>
            <p>The like may bee ſaid of the practiſe of any
ſinne, in thought, word, or deed; tis the way to
hell.</p>
            <p>So then, whereas the Prophet ſayes, Let us
ſearch and try our wayes, Tis as if he had ſayd,
Let us examine our thoughts, words and deeds;
Let us conſider wherein we have tranſgreſſed the
Commandements of God, or done ought againſt
his will.</p>
            <p>And here it is to be noted that he ſaies <hi>our wayes,</hi>
not other mens wayes: In this ſearch wee muſt
have an eye to our owne thoughts, words and
deedes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:20090:7"/>
This is a ſingular point of wiſedome; But ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many of us fayle moſt groſly therein. We are
for the moſt part like thoſe whom St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 10.
Confeſſ. calls, <hi>Curioſum genus hominum ad Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcendum
vitam alienam, deſidioſum ad Corrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
ſuam:</hi> Wee are curious in ſearching other
mens wayes, negligent in correcting our owne.</p>
            <p>I doe not deny but a man may take notice of
his neighbours wandrings, and rebuke him too;
tis the Lords owne Commandement, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.
17. <hi>Thou ſhalt freely rebuke thy neighbour, and not
ſuffer ſinne upon him.</hi> And verily we have all much
to anſwere for, becauſe wee have not ſeaſonably
reproved our offending neighbours.</p>
            <p>But the courſe that I now tax, is, that many are
ſo buyſie in ſearching other mens waies, that they
neglect their owne: and yet they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
wiſe men. But a wiſer than the wiſeſt ſaith,
<hi>Prov. 9. 12. If thou beeſt wiſe, thou ſhalt bee wiſe for
thy ſelfe.</hi> Yea the heathen man <hi>Platarch de Curioſit.</hi>
ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
Tis the end of Philoſophy, to
know a mans owne evills. And the Orator
ſaith very well, <hi>Ne quicquam ſapit qui ſibi non
ſapit,</hi> He is wiſe in vaine, that is not wiſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Wherfore let us carefully hearken to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of the wiſedome of God, which ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi>
4. 25. <hi>Let thy eye lids direct thy way before thee; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the path of thy feet: And let all thy wayes be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
aright.</hi> And whereas he ſayes, <hi>Let all thy wayes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20090:7"/>
be ordered,</hi> it gives me occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to put you in mind,
that he that will make a true ſearch, muſt ſearch
all his wayes, and try all his thoughts, words,
and deeds. Tis not ſufficient to examine ſome,
or many of our wayes: but we muſt ponder all
our wayes. If a Shippe ſpring three leakes, and
onely two bee ſtopped, the third will ſinke the
Shippe. If a man have two greevous wounds in
his body, and take order to cure onely one, that
which is neglected will kill him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quidve exempta juvat ſpinis de pluribus una?</hi>
Even ſo if we having divers luſts which fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our ſoules, do mortifie but ſome of them,
tis to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>God cannot indure theſe halfe-services. Hee
that will be a man after Gods owne heart, muſt
with <hi>David, Pſ. 119. 104. utterly abhor all falſwais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Phariſes</hi> were very preciſe in manythings;
yet Chriſt calls them <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and cryes woe
unto them, becauſe they walked not circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
in all their wayes.</p>
            <p>The truth is, he that unfeinedly bends his mind
againſt any one ſinne, hates all ſinnes; and hee
that favours himſelfe in any one ſinne never ſo
ſmall, never ſo ſecret: this man hates no ſinne
heartily, what ſhew ſoever hee makes. He may
perhaps eſchew ſome ſinnes, for ſome ſiniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
as namely becauſe they will not ſort with
his ordinary courſes; or are not ageeable to his
complexion; or would hinder him more ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; or becauſe he is taken up of ſo many
other uncleane ſpirits, that give him no leaſure
for theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:20090:8"/>
Who will contend the covetous Crib, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
prodigality, and exceſſe in meat, drinke, and
apparrell? Who knowes not that he hence reaps
no ſmall advantage?</p>
            <p>What conſiderate man will thinke the better
of a prodigall ſpend thrift, becauſe he heares him
rayle againſt this or that miſerable Churle?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> was angry at the waſte of the box of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
oyntment, and ſaid it might have bin ſold
and given to the poore: But twas not becauſe he
loved the poore, or hated waſte, but becauſe hee
carried the bag and was a theefe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phariſes</hi> were very ſtrict in tything Mint,
Anniſe &amp; Cummin, but if they had done this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
they would not have neglected the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
matters of the Law. For hee that lookes to
ſome of his waies in obedience unto Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
for the ſame reaſon muſt and will
looke unto all: And he that hath not an eye to all
his wayes, in truth regards none.</p>
            <p>So then let all that heare me this day, take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
notice that we are all ſummoned this day, to
ſearch and try all our wayes: I ſay againe; wee
are all bound and commanded, to ſearch and try
all our wayes. Though in regard of ſome of
our courſes we are applauded in the world, and
know that we have done worthily; yet wee muſt
proceed further, and narrowly ſearch and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
all our whole converſation, and all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of our life. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 13. when <hi>Saul</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the ſlaughter of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> he ſaid
vnto <hi>Samuel, Thou bleſſed of the Lord, I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20090:8"/>
the commandement of the Lord:</hi> And yet yee
know, he had ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and the fat
cattell, contrary to the commandement.</p>
            <p>In like manner there bee very many in theſe
dayes, who thinke themſelves good Chriſtians,
becauſe they have done &amp; do many good things,
and eſchew many evill wayes: They heare the
word preached, they pray, they come to the
Lords table, they give almes; they are no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
adulterers, theeues; Hereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
as <hi>Saul</hi> did, they have performed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of the Lord: whereas if they would
ſearch and try all their wayes, they would ſee
that they come farre ſhort in other points. For
though they heare Gods word duly, they hate to
be reformed: though they keepe ſome part of
the Lords day holy, they ſpend ſome other part
prophanely: though they often call upon Gods
name devoutly, they oftner take his name in vain
moſt fearefully. Though they ſteale not their
neighbors good, they rob him of his good name:
though they will not ſtrike with the ſword, their
hearts are full fraught with murderous and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thoughts.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe we muſt ſearch and try all our
wayes; we muſt ſuffer no one to eſcape without
due examination.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if upon ſound tryall of our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
wayes, we be able to ſay truely with <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah,
Iſay</hi> 38. 3. we have walked before God <hi>in
truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> and have <hi>done that
which is good in his ſight,</hi> &amp; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18. 23.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20090:9"/>
               <hi>have kept our ſelves from our owne iniquitie;</hi> yet we
muſt not here ceaſe ſearching; we muſt proceed
to ſearchand try all the wayes of thoſe that are
committed unto our charge, becauſe we muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
unto God for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> was a man perfect and upright, and <hi>one that
feared God and eſchewed evill,</hi> by Gods owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
<hi>Iob</hi> 1. 8. yet <hi>Iob</hi> thought not this enough,
but continued ſanctifying his children, and <hi>offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſacrifice for them, Iob.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>Goe thou and doe likewiſe. Thou muſt bee as
carefull in ſearching and trying all the wayes of
thy ſervants and children, &amp;c. as thine owne;
wherein becauſe <hi>Eli</hi> fayled, hee was fearefully
plagued by the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, if thou be a private
man, thou muſt not prie into the wayes of thy
neighbours: but concerning thoſe abominations
which are openly committed in the land, thou
art bound with them, <hi>Ezech</hi> 9. 4. to bewaile the
ſame: But if thou art a Magiſtrate, thou muſt
ſearch out and reforme all abuſes in thy quarter:
thou muſt not <hi>beare the ſword in vaine: For thou
art the Miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath
upon him that doth evill, Rom.</hi> 13. 4.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, though this courſe of ſearching and
trying our waies, muſt be taken principally when
God viſiteth us with any plague: or when the
Civill, or Eccleſiasticall Magiſtrate (as now)
comes to inquire concerning our wayes; yet
ought it to be daily and continually uſed, becauſe
we are apt to go aſtray continually, &amp; to wander
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20090:9"/>
every moment. But the moſt convenient time,
for this ſearching and trying all our wayes, by
St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and others, is thought to be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
evening.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed unto you a point of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
wiſdome, to be put in practiſe every day by all
men, all the dayes of their lives.</p>
            <p>Many therefore of this generation, are not ſo
wiſe as they would be accounted, becauſe either
altogether, or in part, they neglect this duty of
ſearching and trying their wayes.</p>
            <p>Some (let all things go how they will) paſſe
their dayes in ſottiſh ſecurity, and never ſay to
their owne ſoules ſo much as, <hi>What have I done,</hi>
untill with the rich glutton, they bee ſuddenly
plunged into hell.</p>
            <p>Others, though they be earneſtly exhorted to
ſearch and try their wayes, will by no meanes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
any counſell in this kind, but go on reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
as they have done.</p>
            <p>In this ranke ſtand, firſt our recuſant Papiſts,
who will doe as their Fathers and Grandfathers
have done, tell them what ye can.</p>
            <p>Secondly of this number are very many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
wretches, which ſeeme to hate inſtruction,
and put off all admonition with a ſcoffe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here alſo may be ranged much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
men and women, who having entered into
ſome unlawfull courſe, wherein they find, either
pleaſure, as <hi>Herod</hi> in his brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife, <hi>Luk.</hi>
3. or profit, as the Craftsmen in making Shrines
for the Temple of <hi>Diana, Acts</hi> 19. 25. or honour,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20090:10"/>
as <hi>Naaman</hi> in going with his Mr. to his idolatrous
houſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. cannot indure to heare, that
they muſt ſearch and try their waies, becauſe they
are reſolved whatſoever they heare not to change
their courſe.</p>
            <p>Such are in theſe dayes our common Stage-players,
gamehouſekeepers, miniſtrells, jeſters,
typlers, ſtewes, vſurers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All theſe abhor this ſearching and trying of
their wayes. They will not indure to have
the lawfullneſſe of their courſes called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>Others there are which performe this duty
but onely in part, and of theſe there are divers
ſorts; firſt, are they which doe but talke of it, as
<hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. 25. who when <hi>Paul</hi> preached of
righteouſneſſe, temperance, and judgement to
come, trembled, but ſaid, <hi>Go thy way, and when I
have a convenient time, I will ſend for thee:</hi> but hee
never ſent.</p>
            <p>Even ſo many in theſe dayes, when they heare
a ſearching Sermon, ſay here is good Doctrine,
tis pitty but it ſhould be followed, but after that
time never thinke upon it againe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſome are almoſt perſwaded to
ſearch their wayes, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> who ſaid to <hi>Paul,
Acts 26. 28. Almoſt thou perſwadeſt mee to bee a
Chriſtian.</hi> But this almoſt will not ſerve the
turne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſome ſearch and try their wayes, but
friendly as <hi>Ahab, 1 Kings</hi> 21. 27. when he heard
<hi>Elias</hi> threatning, <hi>rent his clothes and put on ſackcloth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20090:10"/>
and faſted, &amp;c.</hi> But as ſoone as the ſtorme was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
he was the ſame man: Even ſo now, when
God ſends any judgement, publicke or private,
there be many that will caſt downe their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and ſpeake humbly, and mournfully; but
when God ceaſes the plague, their ſubmiſſion is
ended.</p>
            <p>Fourthly ſome ſeeme to ſearch and try their
wayes ſoundly, but tis onely ſome of their waies;
others muſt not be touched. We have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Herod, Mark. 6. 20. Herod</hi> when hee heard
<hi>Iohn did many things</hi> at his preaching: But when
<hi>Iohn</hi> told him of his inceſt with his brothers wife,
hee could no longer beare, but caſt <hi>Iohn</hi> into
priſon.</p>
            <p>Even ſo now, there are not a few which are
perſwaded to ſearch and try many of their waies,
but they will by no meanes examine all: And
among theſe, firſt, ſome ſearch onely great and
groſſe ſinnes, as may appeare, becauſe they
uſually ſay, I am no whore, nor theefe, I am
no murderer, no adulterer; and yet they abound
with leſſer ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſome ſtraine at a gnat, and ſwallow
a Camell: they are very preciſe in ſearching out
ſome ſmall faults, and yet ſuffer grand ſinnes to
reigne without controll.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſome are zealous for the firſt table;
they abhor Atheiſme, they hate Idols, they will
not ſweare, nor breake the Sabbath: but they
little regard the ſecond table: for they oppreſſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20090:11"/>
defraud and wrong their neighbours many waies
without ſcruple.</p>
            <p>Fourthly ſome will ſtand upon their Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they deale juſtly and charitably with
all men; but yet make no bones of taking Gods
name in vaine, or breaking the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, ſome ſeem ſo to look to their waies, that
they cannot greatly be taxed for the open breach
of the firſt or ſecond table, as they concerne God
&amp; their neighbour: but touching their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
they are very irregular; they walke not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
temperately, humbly; but proudly, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly,
or riotouſly.</p>
            <p>In the fift place, ſome ſearch and try all their
owne wayes, but they are negligent in ſearching
and trying the waies of thoſe that are committed
to their charge.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, ſome ſeeme fully to put this
precept in execution; they ſearch and try all their
wayes, and the wayes of their friends and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and ſet all in a good courſe: but on a ſudden,
upon ſome temptation of wealth, pleaſure or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
they ſtart backe &amp; with <hi>Demas</hi> embrace this
preſent world.</p>
            <p>Thus yee ſee how many are defective in the
due performance of this maine, and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
duty of ſearching and trying their wayes.
What remaines but that I exhort every one of
you, to take ſpeciall notice of the ſore of his owne
heart; I meane the particular caſe wherein he hath
offended, touching this ſearching and trying
of his wayes, that ſo for the time to come, he may
better performe the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:20090:11"/>
I preſſe this duty of ſearching and trying our
waies the rather, becauſe I find that many among
the heathen have done it very diligently. <hi>Cicero
de ſenectute,</hi> brings in <hi>Cato</hi> ſaying, <hi>Quid quoque die
dixerim, audierim, egerim, commemoro veſperi, i.</hi>
What I have ſaid, heard, done, every day, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
at evening. <hi>Seneca lib. 3. de Ira, cap.</hi> 36. ſaies
that <hi>Sextius</hi> was wont every night to call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to a reckoning, ſaying, <hi>Quod hodie malum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ſanaſti, i.</hi> what evill of thine haſt thou cured
this day? Againe, <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, that
he was wont without faile, every night to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
himſelfe upon his bed, concerning the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
day. I might cite many more, but others
have done it; and theſe are enough to cry ſhame
upon us Chriſtians, if wee will not practiſe ſuch
an excellent duty, which hath ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
promiſes, and threatnings in the
Scripture.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is no courſe in the world which
is more avayleable, either to bring us into Gods
favour, or to keepe us from wandring, than this
daily ſearching and trying of our wayes.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, one ſayes very well, <hi>Illam ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
diligit Deus quae ſe ſineceſſatione conſiderat, et
ſine ſimalatione judicat,</hi> God loves that ſoule, which
without ceaſing ſearches it ſelfe, and without
guile judges it ſelfe: and if we would thus <hi>judge
our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi>
11. 31.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ther's no better meanes to keepe us
from wandring, than this daily ſearching &amp; try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20090:12"/>
our wayes. If wee would ſtand upon our
watch, &amp; daily examine all our thoughts, words
and deeds, only concerning theſe two queſtions,
whence they come, and whither they tend; tis
impoſſible we ſhould fall into ſinne, at leaſt lye in
ſinne as we commonly doe.</p>
            <p>For want of this ſearching and trying their
wayes, it is, that all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> fall ſo
foully.</p>
            <p>Nay, if <hi>Eue</hi> had tryed the words of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
or <hi>Adam</hi> conſidered the gift of his wife;
neither the one, nor the other had eaten the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Cain</hi> had but ſaid to his ſoule, when he went
about to kil <hi>Abel,</hi> what art thou now about to do?
he would never have done it.</p>
            <p>If <hi>David</hi> had tryed his ſtrange luſt, when hee
firſt ſaw <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife, he would have made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with his eyes as <hi>Iob</hi> did.</p>
            <p>All the fearefull falls of the children of God
when they were negligent, are ſo many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that without this daily ſearching and trying
our wayes, we cannot be ſafe, and no marvell.
For no ſinne appeares at the firſt in its owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hue, but maſked, and in the likeneſſe of ſome
vertue. If therefore we neglect this point of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
I meane, if wee doe not daily ſearch and
try our wayes, wee muſt needs entertaine ſome
vice in ſtead of vertue.</p>
            <p>For neglect of this ſearching &amp; trying, it comes
to paſſe that in theſe dayes, there bee ſo many
drunkards, fornicators ſwearers, &amp;c. The drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20090:12"/>
ſaith to his mates, Come ſirs, ſhall we goe
play the good fellows? he will not ſay for ſhame,
ſhall we goe and be drunke? then few but would
ſeeme to abhor the motion.</p>
            <p>The fornicator, that he may compaſſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
comes to a mayd, and promiſes her present
marriage. How many have beene thus deluded?
and yet few will take heed.</p>
            <p>The ſwearer alleages for himſelfe, that either
he is conſtrained to ſweare, or that hee ſweares
nothing but the truth.</p>
            <p>In like manner, all other ſinnes come ſtealing
upon us under vertuous names: Pride in appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
and building, will bee ſtiled neatneſſe; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
thrift; riotous behaviour and filthy
talke, merriment; malice, a good ſtomach; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
courage; prodigality, a kinde heart, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If therefore we be not carefull to ſearch and
try all our wayes, yee ſee how eaſily we may be
deceived.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if we daily and truely ſearch
&amp; try every courſe that is propounded to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee adventure upon it, we ſhall be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from many ſinnes, as we may ſee by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Ioſeph, Gen. 39. 7. Ioſephs</hi> Maſters wife,
an honorable woman, caſt her eyes upon <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> &amp;
ſhee ſaid, lie with me. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> trying and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the motion, anſwers <hi>v.</hi> 9. how can I do this
great wichedneſſe, and ſinne againſt God?</p>
            <p>In like manner if we would try &amp; examine all
motions which are made to us, we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
from great offences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:20090:13"/>
But perhaps ſome will ſay unto mee as <hi>David</hi>
doth, <hi>Pſal. 19. 12. Who can underſtand his errors?</hi>
if wee cannot underſtand them, how ſhall wee
ſearch and try them?</p>
            <p>I anſwere, when I ſay that every man muſt
ſearch and try all his wayes, I doe not imagine
that every one can preſently underſtand all his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
Satan by his ſubrilty will ſo blinde us; the
world by evill cuſtomes will ſo ſway us; the
fleſh by her ſweet allurements will ſo be witch us,
that though we be never ſo circumſpect in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
ſome ſmall faults will eſcape a long time.</p>
            <p>But if wee heartily pray for the pardon of all
ſecret faults, and continue daily to uſe all whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
meanes to find them out, God will accept
our honeſt endeavour.</p>
            <p>But yee will ſay further, what meanes muſt
wee uſe in ſearching and trying our wayes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Philoſophers make reaſon, the
touchſt one of all our actions. To reaſon alſo ſome
of the Fathers ſeeme to aſcribe too much. But
the truth is, humane reaſon is ſo corrupt ſince the
fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that it is not fit to be the cheife in
this buiſneſſe.</p>
            <p>But thankes be to God wee have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>a more ſure word,</hi> as tis called 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. to
this <hi>if we take heed we doe well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This word was given by inſpiration,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.
21. <hi>This word is</hi> pure, inlightning the eyes, Pſal. 19.
8. <hi>Tis</hi> a light unto our paths, Pſal. 119. 105. <hi>Tis</hi> able
to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, 2 Tim 3. 15. <hi>Tis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20090:13"/>
for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for
inſtruction in righteouſneſse, v. 16. <hi>In a word,</hi> The
word of God is quick, and powerfull, and ſharper than
any two edged ſword, peircing even to the deviding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder
of the ſoule and ſpirit, and is a diſcerner of the
thoughts &amp; intents of the heart, Heb. 4. 12. <hi>Laſtly, we
ſhall be judged by the word, at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Ioh. 12. 48. Ro. 2. 16. <hi>All which conſidered,
tis moſt plaine, that the word of God is the beſt
light and rule to ſearch and try all our actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now if all wee, which are here gathered
together, ſhould examine our waies by this word
of God, certainly many of them would be found
very crooked.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible for me in the ſhort ſpace allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for this exerciſe, to touch all our wayes: I
will therefore meddle onely with thoſe, which
are moſt properly inquirable at this viſitation
Court.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the meſſenger of God, muſt bee
as God himſelfe, no reſpecter of perſons, I will
begin with the cheife and mine owne Coate, and
tell them wherein their wayes are thought, not
to be agreeable to Gods word.</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>Right Worſhipfull,</hi> you and your
officers, come to inquire what fame there goes of
us, I thinke it very requiſite, to informe you firſt
what fame goes of your ſelves, that yee may take
occaſion to ſearch and try your owne wayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye meddle with others.</p>
            <p>This then is the common fame of the country,
that, whether it be through the fault of the cheife
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20090:14"/>
Magiſtrate, and his officiall, Commiſſary, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates,
or Regiſter, or Sumners; offenders are
not ordinarily cenſured, according to the nature
of their offence. And that the great and rich, get
through your Eccleſiaſtical nets, as eaſily as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
through the ſpiders webbe. But that the
poorer ſort ſtand excommunicated a long time,
though they be never ſo penitent, onely becauſe
they have no money to pay.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that in your viſitation Courts, moſt
of you are more greedy of gaine, than ſollicitous
for reformation, which is the maine end of theſe
aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that in your Conſiſtory, you and the
Procters prolong trifling cauſes, for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of fees: and that factious plaintiffes, which
wage law for the vexation of their neighbours,
find too favorable entertainement.</p>
            <p>Now for my part, I doe not accuſe any man,
but if theſe reports bee true: then I muſt needes
admoniſh you in the word of the Lord, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 8.
that yee <hi>clenſe your hands, and purifie your hearts, &amp;
be afflicted, and mourne and weepe.</hi> And I pray you
remember as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. that you
<hi>beare not the ſword in vaine.</hi> Remember alſo what
the rock and God of Iſrael ſaid to <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi>
23. 3. <hi>Hee that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling
in the feare of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore as good</hi> Iehoſaphat <hi>said to his Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
2 Chron. 19. 6. Take heede what yee doe: for yee
judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you
in judgement; wherefore now let the feare of God bee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20090:14"/>
upon you, take heed and doe it. For there is no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor
taking of Gifts.</p>
            <p>Gifts, <hi>as God ſaith,</hi> Deut. 16. 19; blinde the eyes
of the wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, to all the officers of this Court, I ſay
in the name of the Lord, as</hi> Iohn Baptiſt <hi>ſaid to
the Publicans,</hi> Luke 3. 13. Exact no more than is
appointed you, remembring that extortion is a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſinne. And what ſhall it profit a man to winne the
whole world, and looſe his owne ſoule? <hi>ſayes Chriſt</hi>
Mat. 16. 26.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, touching us Miniſters,
there bee many complaints that wee doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word of the Lord, take heed to our
ſelves, and the flocks, over which the holy Ghoſt
hath made us overſeers.</p>
            <p>Some of us are careleſſe touching our owne
lives; wee are not examples to our people, as the
Spirit commands, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 12, in word, in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</hi> Yea
tis verified of ſome of us which was ſpoken, <hi>Hoſ.</hi>
4.9. <hi>There ſhall be like people, like Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, though the Spirit charge us all, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4, <hi>before God and the Lord Ieſus, to preach the word,
and be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon; to reprove, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
exhort:</hi> Yet divers of us, are more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in feeding our ſelves, than in feeding our
flocks.</p>
            <p>But above all, we are ſaid to be generally defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
in that moſt neceſſarie part of our office,
Catechiſing, whereunto wee have of late yeares
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20090:15"/>
bene ſo often exhorted, both by our <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Biſhops.</hi> I know what moſt doe alleadge, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Maſters, will not cauſe their children
and ſervants to come to bee Catechiſed; but I
know withall, that if we had beene as zealous in
the Lords cauſe, as wee are for the moſt part for
our owne Commodities, we might have done a
great deale more good this way than wee have
done.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, my deere brethren, I beſeech you
all in the name of the Lord Ieſus, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
his lambes, as well as his ſheepe to our
care; let us all with one heart, and with all our
might, ſet upon this moſt laudable and profitable
exerciſe of Catechiſing; without which, we ſhall
doe little good by our preaching.</p>
            <p>The third ſort of people that are agents in this
viſitation Court, are the Church-wardens and
Sidemen, who are bound by oath to preſent unto
the Iudge all offenders.</p>
            <p>But except there bee ſome notorious crime
which they thinke cannot ly hid, they uſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>omnia bene;</hi> and herein they thinke they deale
very wiſely. For as I have heard ſome of them
ſay, we ſhall bring fees to the Court, and nothing
ſhall be the better.</p>
            <p>But I pray you conſider, in the meane time ye
forſweare your ſelves, and incurre the heavy
wrath of God. For God will not take it for an
excuſe that ye ſay, though we ſhould preſent, the
Iudge will not reforme. The Iudge ſhall beare
his owne burden; and what a fearfull thing it is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20090:15"/>
for you to fall into the hands of the living God,
by that abominable ſinne of perjury?</p>
            <p>Wherefore what conceit ſoever ye have had here
tofore, touching theſe viſitation Courts. Now
I admoniſh you in the name of him who ſhall
judge both quick and dead, preſent all offenders
againſt the Canons without fear or favour: ye are
ordained as the eyes and watchmen of the Iudge
in every pariſh. And if yee were carefull accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your oath, wherewith you binde your
ſoules every viſitation, to preſent drunkards, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
raylers, ſcolds, ſlanderers, ribaudes, ſowers
of diſcords, fornicators, adulterers, Sabbath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
&amp;c. Doutleſſe iniquity would not abound
in every pariſh as it doth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I may ſay to the whole Congregation,
and to every ſort and degree, from the higheſt to
the loweſt, that if we would ſearch and try our
wayes by the rule of Gods word, they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
very irregular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea more, thoſe things
wherein we walke moſt ſutable to Gods will, tis
to be feared, we do them only ſuperficially, &amp; for
forme and faſhion, rather than for conſcience and
obedience to God and his word. We which are
Gods Miniſters, for the moſt part preach for
forme, and ye which profeſſe your ſelves to bee
Gods people, heare for forme. For when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is ended, we all depart, and thinke upon it
no more, as if we had fully done our dutie in
ſpeaking, and yee in hearing, and there were no
more required at our hands.</p>
            <p>This is the cauſe why though there be ſo much
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20090:16"/>
Preaching in the land daily, yet there is very
ſmall progreſſe in piety.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo, what remaines, but that I
admoniſh you all and my ſelfe alſo, in the words
of the ſecond part of my text, to turne againe to
the Lord?</p>
            <p>This is the onely courſe for all that have gone
aſtray, as you may ſee, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12. 13. there the
Lord exhorts the ſinnefull Iewes, and all that
have ſinned as they did, ſaying, <hi>Turne yee even to
mee withall your heart, and with faſting, and with
weeping, and with mourning, and rent your hearts &amp;
not your garments, and turne to the Lord your God: for
he is gracious, and mercifull, ſlow to anger, and of great
kindneſſe, and repenteth him of the evill. i.</hi> If wee
weepe and rent our hearts for all our wandrings,
and turne from all our by-pathes to ſerve the
Lord, in ſobriety, righteouſneſſe, and godlineſſe,
God will remove from us, all the plagues and
judgements which he hath ſent or threatned. But
if we goe on in our evill wayes, then the Lord
will powre downe his vialls of indignation upon
us: <hi>God will wound the hairy ſcalp of ſuch as go on ſtill
in their treſpaſſes, Pſal.</hi> 68. 21. Wherefore I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
for a concluſion, let us throughly ſearch
and try all our wayes, and whiles tis called to day
begin to turne to the Lord our God with all our
hearts, and with faſting, and with weeping, and
with mourning: Oh let us rent &amp; teare our ſoules
with godly ſorrow for all our tranſgreſſions of
Gods ordinances, and eſpecially at this time, for
our formall and perfunctory uſage of theſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20090:16"/>
Courts, which are ordained meerely, for
the reformation of the faults of the Country; ſo
ſhal not iniquity be our deſtruction: for the Lord
deſires not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he
ſhould repent and live.</p>
            <p>This repentance unto life he give us, who gave
himſelfe for us, even Ieſus Chriſt our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
To whom with the Father, and the holy
Ghoſt, be honour and power everlaſting, <hi>Amen.</hi>
