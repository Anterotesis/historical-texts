         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Vindication</hi> of Sir <hi>IOHN STAWELLS Remonstrance,</hi> against a Scurrilous <hi>Pamphlet</hi> written by Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashe,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I HAVE in my <hi>Remonstrance</hi> formerly made a Profession to fixe my selfe upon that truth which should be avowed upon <hi>The Faith of a Christian, and Honour of a Gentleman,</hi> and I can with much confidence affirme, that I have not been wanting in the least point to that profession; <hi>And I engage my selfe again,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the same course in the ensuing <hi>Narrative,</hi> wherein, when I shall have demonstrated by clear proofes, and arguments, <hi>the wicked, and malicious Practises</hi> which Mr. <hi>Iohn Ash</hi> hath used against me, thereby, involving me in those great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and miseries which I have undergone for many years, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating that private tye of Freindship which he pretends, and duty of a person publickly entrusted by the Parliament, I doubt not but the Reader will beleive, I had more cause to have expected that Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> would rather have acknowledged by his thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the moderation I used in the relating of those passages, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was concerned in my <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> then have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as he hath lately done) by a scurrilous Pamphlet published in his name, to asperse me with the Writing of many fashoods in severall Pages of it, and by a faigned discourse, as <hi>Void of Truth, as of Civility,</hi> perswade the Reader. <hi>First,</hi> That I never had any intention to compound upon my Articles. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he had alwayes studiously performed the Office of a Faithfull Freind unto me.</p>
            <p>Now these two points have been already cleered by solemne Judgments in two great and honourable Courts, constituted by Authority of Parliament; who having both of them declared, that I submitted to a Composition according to my Articles, and performed al things which were on my part requisite towards my obtaining the benefit of them, have therein also by a necessary consequence resolved, that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> (by whom I was refused to be admitted to my Composition when I first tendred it) had not performed either the Office of a Freind, or duty of a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son towards me, so that it may appear superfluous to give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Answer to it, which was the cause I had at first some thought <pb n="2" facs="tcp:119494-01:3"/>
to let it passe, as being a thing which deserved not the trouble of an answer; yet afterwards having more seriously weighed what ill impressions so many <hi>Shamelesse and notorious Falshoods</hi> might make in those, who are but strangers unto the former proceedings in my Cause, if they perceived them passe in silence without an Answer; to the great prejudice of Truth, and of the Justice of those two honourable Courts who have already cleared them by their Judgments, I have thought fit upon these grounds, and for my own vindication from those scandalls, wherewith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Pamphlet hath therin <hi>Falsely and maliciously</hi> aspersed me, to publish an exact <hi>Narrative</hi> of all his Actings in relation to my business, from the 15th. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1646. (which was the day of my first coming to <hi>London</hi> upon the Articles of <hi>Exeter</hi>) untill this time, that so it may appear how shamelesly he hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to abuse the Reader by that most false and scandalous Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>And therefore I shall in the first place represent clearly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein I stood at my first coming hither after the granting of those Articles, being breifly thus.</p>
            <p>Upon the rendring of <hi>Exeter</hi> to the Lord Generall <hi>Fairfax,</hi> there were some Articles agreed upon between his Lordship, and the Governour, dated the 8th. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> 1646. which were upon the 6th. of <hi>May</hi> following, read and approved of by the House of Commons, and afterwards by both the Houses on the 4th. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1647. the 12. 13. and 21. of which Articles, together with the Votes and Orders made in confirmation of them, do follow in these words.</p>

            <p>I was comprised within these Articles, and accordingly the Lord General on the fourth day of <hi>April,</hi> 1646. gave a Certificate under his hand and Seal, therby signifying, that I was in the said City at the surrender therof, and was to have the benefit of those Articles which were then agreed upon, which Certificate I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to insert here, because it is recited in my <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> and hath been proved upon my several Tryals in the High-Court of Justice, and the Court of Articles. And consequently (not being <hi>excepted</hi> from Pardon or Composition by the Parliament) was <hi>absolutely admitted</hi> to compound without any limitation of time, wherin to make a tender of it.</p>
            <p>But having upon due consideration resolved to submit unto the Parliament, accept the benefit intended to me by those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and spend the residue of my daies in peaceable obedience unto the Government established, I thought it best to put this speedily in execution, and after some time spent in the Country, to fit my selve for such a Journey, I came to <hi>London</hi> on the 15th. day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1646.</p>
            <p>I was no sooner come, but Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> (taking it seems notice of my arrival) came the next day being the 16th. day of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1646. early in the morning, whilst I was a bed to welcom me to the Town, and to bestow a Visit on his good Master (for by that name he pleased to call me.)</p>
            <p>And here begin the <hi>Series</hi> of those Untruths, which he hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and published as an Answer to my <hi>Remonstrance</hi> in the said fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious Pamphlet, wherin he doth (by way of Introduction) assure the Reader, that he hath written an exact <hi>Narrative</hi> of all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and passages in my Cause, from the time of my first coming to <hi>London,</hi> unto the time I was arraigned at the High-Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and this, he saith, he wrot upon the first sight of my <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:119494-01:4"/>
but then forboreto publish it upon some reasons which he pretends did hinder him from setting out that large discourse.</p>
            <p>First, in regard that he had answered all the particulars which did concern him before the High Court of Justice to their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and my <hi>confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> because the scandalls he pretends, were mentioned in my <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> were so apparantly false, that every one might easily perceive therin a confutation of those things were charged upon him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>thirdly,</hi> Because <hi>in his respect unto my family</hi> he was willing to be silent, least otherwise in giving answer unto the scandalls, wherewith he doth pretend himself to be aspersed (by saying he did clandestinely obstruct my composition) he might doe that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he doth now conceive himself obliged unto; <hi>viz.</hi> Prove that <hi>I never intended to compound, but resolved the contrary,</hi> flattering my self with hopes of seeing the late King restored unto his power and greatness, from whom I might receive not only my whole Estate, but also a great reward for my suffering, in owning and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cause beyond any of his party.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding these reasons, since he hath heard that a Committee was appointed to examine the matter of Fact in my Petition, he is so set upon the working of my ruine, that he is now resolved to add falsehood and impudence unto his malice, by publishing this Fiction of his own, in answer to the Scandals which he pretends were fixed on him by my <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> least o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <hi>his testimony against me might be impeached,</hi> and he should be mis-represented to those who were strangers to his Actions.</p>
            <p>Now in regard I have resolved in this Discourse to render an exact <hi>Narrative</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> his carriage and actings in relation to my business, wherby the many falsehoods contained in that his Pamphlet will be made evident, I hold my self obliged before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of them, to shew the <hi>falsehood, frivilousness,</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> of those his Reasons.</p>
            <p>Now as to the <hi>first</hi> of them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer unto the reasons</hi>
               </note> I cannot but admire the boldness of this affirmation, which is not only contrary to truth, but also to the very Judgment of the High-Court of Justice, in the sole point examined by them: For being brought to tryall for my life before that Court, I had no other matter to alledge for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, but that I was comprised within the Articles of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and had performed all that on my part was required for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling my self unto the benefit of them; That all my troubles had their rise from Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> who contrary to justice and his duty refused my Petition to compound, when I first tendred it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Articles, and afterwards caused me to fall into the Parliaments displeasure, by the undue practises hereafter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (which are the Subject of the ensuing <hi>Narrative</hi>) To prove the contrary wherof Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> was produced a Witness on the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119494-01:5"/>
Common-wealths behalf, and did with great malice and virulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, endeavour to have justified his own proceedings, by proving that I had forfeited the benefit of my Articles: But the Court ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon full hearing declared the contrary, did consequently and by implication adjudge his Answer no way satisfactory as to the clearing of himself from those hardships towards me, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I charged him upon my defence, and <hi>this point also hath been since decreed by solemn Iudgment of the Court of Articles</hi>; So as this first reason is a notorious untruth, declared to be so by two ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Courts, and is besides injurious to them, since they could not in justice have acquitted me, without censuring the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> against me, as unjust, and tending to the violation of the said Articles.</p>
            <p>As for his <hi>second Reason,</hi> it is, besides the falsehood of it, so vain and frivolous, that I can see nothing of <hi>reason</hi> in it, but the name, for if those things wherwith I charged him be true (as I shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently shew they are) then the improbability of them is a <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi> only of his own brain, which can no where have a subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, except it be in his fictitious Pamphlet, <hi>the worthy Issue of such a Parent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for his <hi>third Reason,</hi> who sees not the absurdity therof, for if he truly had any respect unto my <hi>Family</hi> (which he hath rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) and had for that consideration forborn to publish that, wherby it might appear I never had intention to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded (as he surmiseth:) This motive of respect unto them would have been much more powerfull with him, when upon my Petition to the late Parliament, he saw that a Committee was appointed for the re-examining of my Cause (on the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess wherof depended their fairest hopes) then whilst they could not be prejudiced by that discovery: (The High-Court of Iustice and the Court of Articles having resolved in my Case, that I had really submitted unto a Composition according to the Articles of <hi>Exeter.</hi>) Therfore sor this man to do this unasked or called for, meerly to preserve himself in a capacity to be a Witness against me, and therby the better to be enabled <hi>to ruine and destroy them,</hi> is a <hi>kindness</hi> so suitable unto the truth of all his other Allegations, that I must leave it to the Reader to determine, whether he hath <hi>in these three Reasons</hi> given a larger testimony of his <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> or of his respects unto my family.</p>
            <p>His three reasons being thus answered, I shall now proceed in my relation which upon that occasion was interrupted, and shall inform the reader of what passed between us upon our first meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ashe <hi>his first vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit.</hi>
               </note>This first visit from Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> (who was in those dayes a man of power and usually Chair-man of the Comittee at <hi>Goldsmiths Hall,</hi> (with whom I was to make my Composition) gave me an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension that I might by his favour reap some considerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119494-01:5"/>
in the perfecting of it, and therfore after words of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and congratulation had passed between us (such as are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall amongst friends upon their meeting after a long absence) I failed not to acquaint him with my business, letting him know that I was come to <hi>London,</hi> with an intention to compound for my Estate upon the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and did desire his furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the doing of it, which he did very freely promise, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me that he would imploy his best interest to serve me in all things.</p>
            <p>And now having thus happily (as I thought) gotten a friend,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, made by Mr.</hi> Ashe, <hi>touching Dean and Chapters Lands.</hi>
               </note> who could better then any other assist me in the prosecution of my business, I did then upon further discourse, acquaint him with a difficulty, I apprehended, in being able to raise money for payment of my Composition, telling him, I had heard in the Country, that Deans and Chapters Lands were by the Parliament appointed to be sold at ten years purchase, and therfore it was probable the price of other Lands would fall on that occasion; wherby the two years value, which by my Articles I was to pay for my Composition, would be intruth the same to me as four years value, because I should for raising of it, be forced to sell Fee-simple Lands at ten years purchase, which at another time would sell for twenty.</p>
            <p>This was in truth a Report mistaken in the Country, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Bishops Lands were about that time appointed to be sold (which was the occasion therof) yet Deans and Chapters Lands were not exposed to sale till some years after: But it is certain, that I had heard so in the Country, and did accordingly upon this ground relate the same to Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> who (though he could have rectified my error in this particular) forbore to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause having (as since appeared) some covetous design on my Estate, he thought whilst I continued in that Error, I might be drawn to sell my Land a better penny worth then otherwise I should have done.</p>
            <p>And that his thoughts were then <hi>projecting</hi> some such thing, appears clearly by his after actings and discourse to me, when being sent for by the House of Commons, I was (as I have mentioned formerly in my <hi>Remonstrance</hi>) put into the little dark corner upon the left hand of the entring in of the outermost door of the House, wherof I shall hereafter have occasion to speak more largely.</p>
            <p>But whatsoever Mr. <hi>Ashes</hi> thoughts then were,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>My sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription as</hi> Guild-Hall.</note> I (who had then a thought on nothing more then the perfecting of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) having upon inquiry heard, that all persons comprised within Articles, who should repair unto the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> should within four daies after their coming, repair to <hi>Guild-Hall London,</hi> and there produce their Passes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Articles engage themselves not to bear Armes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119494-01:6"/>
against the Parliament; or wilfully do any Act prejudiciall to their Affairs, whilst they remained in their Quarters) I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the said Order make such subscription and promise on the 17th. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1646.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The time I preferred my Petition to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</hi>
               </note> and coming to the door where the Committee sate, I desired the Door-keeper to acquaint Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> that I was without, and had a Petition to present, who brought me word that as soon as Sir <hi>Henry Berkleyes</hi> business was over, I should be next, and accordingly about half an hour after I was called for, <hi>and none of those who were without admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come in with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being come in, I tendred my Petition to the Committee, and delivered it into Mr. <hi>Ashes hands,</hi> who having read it, threw it down upon the Table, saying, it was a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> and not a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119494-01:7"/>
and put it from him towards me as far as he could reach for me to receive again, wherupon I told him, I had brought that for him, and had a Copy of it for my self, and so <hi>left it upon the Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He told me, I must confess my <hi>Delinquency,</hi> before I could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Composition, and I replyed that I came thither to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for my Estate according to my Articles which did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to confess my <hi>Delinquency,</hi> and withall told him that I had born Armes for the King, and that I did so by his command; and I said (<hi>by his command</hi>) not that I stood upon my justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) but to entitle my self to the Articles of <hi>Exeter</hi>) which did excuse me for Acts done relating unto the unhappy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
            <p>He then asked me if I had taken the Negative Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and I answering that I had not, he told me that before I could be admitted to Composition I must take them both.</p>
            <p>J replyed, that by my Articles, J was freed from taking any Oathes; And J do well remember, that (as J have set it down formerly in my <hi>Remonstrance</hi>) he pressing me to take those Oathes, and to acknowledge my Delinquency, J did at last make him this answer; Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> J have known you long, and my good friend, and do desire to preserve you so, and for these Gentlemen that are of the Parliament (for J did not then know but that they had been so) there was very great reason that my Judgment and Opinion should subscribe to theirs; but as for my Estate it was my Servant, and J had a power to command it, but my Conscience was my Master, and had power to command me, and therfore J must yeild obedience to it; And since these Oathes you offer me are contrary to my Articles, and repugnant to those J have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken, J desire you will excuse me, if J refuse them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> willed me to withdraw, and being called for in again, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> told me J was but lately come to Town, and therfore they would allow me some time to consider of the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Oath and Covenant, of which, it might be, I had not yet taken notice.</p>
            <p>But unto this my Answer was, that I did not desire any time to consider of what was a right which did belong unto me by my Articles, and of which if I should accept, and make them the same Answer as now, they might conceive that by the acceptation of time, I had abused their expectations w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I was unwilling to do.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I was again willed to withdraw, and attended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, till the Committee rose, not knowing whether they might have any thing more to say unto me; but having not then heard any more from them, after they were risen I departed home unto my lodging.</p>
            <p>I have set down this conference at large though I have formerly related it in my <hi>Remonstrance</hi> because the Reader may observe by it, that I did never in the <hi>least kind declare</hi> that I had no intention

                        <p>Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> being Called in, after the company were withdrawn, and asked whether there were any private discourse at the Committee, to Sir <hi>John Stawells</hi> prejudice.</p>
                        <p>HE saith, that Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> being without the door, <hi>the Chairman</hi> went out, and on his return told this Examinant, <hi>that Sir</hi> John Stawell <hi>was a great enemy, had raised Arms against the Parliament, drew the first blood in the West of</hi> England, <hi>that his Petition was not valid, he acknowledged no Delinquency, had not taken the Negative Oath,</hi> and saith that the Committee pressed him to it, and upon refusall <hi>gave him time, till his Articles were out, because then they knew how to deal with him,</hi> and saith that the Committee <hi>did not meddle</hi> with subscriptions, for that was to be done by a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Committee separated from them,</hi> because that (concerned Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents

stay in town: but only to see that they did take the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Oath and Covenant; and further sayth, that the <hi>second day</hi> that Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> appeared, Mr. <hi>Stephens was in the Chair,</hi> as he remembers.</p>

            <p>My Composition being thus foyled when I first tendered it, and the Committee disaffected to me by the misinformation, and covert practices of Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> I who was ignorant of his designs, (and took him for my freind, as he professed himself to me in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique) expected that the Committee, after they had considered that I was by my Articles excused from taking the Negative Oath and Covenant (which was the only cause for which they had refused me:) when they had better considered of the Articles, would again have called for m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And that I did not herein go upon mistaken grounds, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear plainly by a solemn Judgment and decree in the Court of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles given in Mr. <hi>Newcourts</hi> Case, wherin, the Court, upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Certificate made unto them by the Commissioners for Compounding, and of the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> resolved, that he was to be suffered to make his Composition upon those Articles, though he had not tendered the same <hi>till neer</hi> 3. <hi>years</hi> after the date of them, and that the limitation of four moneths did concern only the excepted persons, wherof I was none: The Copy of which Certificate, together with the Judgment and Decree of the said Court, follow in these words.</p>

            <p>The charge brought in by him doth rest on severall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, some of which are to be taken only on his own Credit, being of moneys he pretends to have expended in the Service of the Parliament, and others which he alledgeth were by him lent and paid in at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> and <hi>Goldsmiths-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of those which depend upon his own word, cannot be here examined by me; in regard they are put down generally

                  <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Ashes</hi> testimony.</note>That I do not remember the precise words contained in that Paper, which Sir <hi>John Stawell</hi> then presented to the Committee for his Petition: but I do remember that the Committee did reject the said Paper, telling Sir <hi>John Stawell</hi> that it was a Remonstrance, not a Petition, <hi>wherin</hi> he rejected the Parliaments mercy offered him in the Articles, and did put a contempt upon the Authority of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>That in short time after Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> a Member of that Committee, did report the same unto the House of Commons, and in that Report infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the House that the opinion of that Committee was, that Sir <hi>John

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>So as it is most cleer, that all my wrongs have had their rise from hence: That Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> by a wilfull mistake interpreted my Petition to be admitted unto a Composition, to be a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, contrary uuto the sence and title of it. And Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> (by his Instructions) re-ported to the House, that my desiring to be excused from the Negative Oath and Covenant, according to my Articles (which at that very time were approved by the House of Commons) was a refusing of the Parliaments Mercy contained in those Articles, a contempt of their Authority, and a forfeiture of the benefit of the said Articles.</p>
            <p>I have here given a true relation of what was acted in my Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness until my first Commitment to <hi>Ely</hi> House by that Committee; And therfore shall desire the Reader to observe how far from truth or probability those particulars are, which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> alledgeth to the contrary, and doth premise as fully cleared in a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which he pretends was written by him, <hi>Videlicet,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That although I appeared at <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Hall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The things premised by Mr.</hi> Ash</note> yet I never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to compound, and did often declare my resolution to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>That I did wholly depend upon the late Kings being restored to his power, and upon this confidence neglected my Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and refused the benefit of <hi>Exeter</hi> Articles.</p>
            <p>That himself did never hinder my Composition, but did with all reality and faithfulness endeavour to perswade me unto it; yet I refused to follow his advice.</p>
            <p>And that all those things I have mentioned in my Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, touching him, are meer fictions and never heard of, till the Parliament had ordered I should be tryed at the High Court of Justice, and that he should attend there as a witness against me.</p>
            <p>For can it fall into the heart of any reasonable man to think,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The answer therunto.</hi>
               </note> that I who (notwithstanding all his uncivill censures) had (by his own confession) studiously endeavored to gaine the reputation of a stout and prudent man, after a resolution taken not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, but to depend upon the late Kings being restored unto his power, for the re-gaining of my Estate, and after the avowing of this Resolution to Mr. <hi>Ash, would on the next day after</hi> (not being forced unto it by any necessity, because my tendring of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position was <hi>not limited</hi> (as I have shewed before) <hi>to four moneths time,</hi> and without any ground or motive which might induce me unto the alteration of that design) qnit the party for whom I professed so highly, and engage my self by a Subscription not to act any thing which might be prejudiciall to the Parliament, and within <hi>seven daies after</hi> would tender my Petition at <hi>Goldsmiths
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119494-01:16"/>
Hall,</hi> to be admitted to a Composition for my Estate, according to the Articles in a <hi>voluntary</hi> way? Must not the levity and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of these Actions have made me necessarily forfeit that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> acknowledgeth I had with so much stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy laboured to acquire in all my Actions? And what opinion so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was had of me, can it be thought that Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> who conceives himself much injured, if we imagine he should do any thing but what befits <hi>a wise judicious</hi> man, would on <hi>the very next day</hi> after his conference with me, have become a Suitor unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to grant him my Composition towards the satisfaction of the Debts wherin he stood engaged, and reparation of his losses by the War; if I had then assured him that I intended not at all to make it, wherby those Debts, Disbursements and Ingagements, must rest unsatisfied, and he for his particular should loose 5000 <hi>l.</hi> as he affirmeth he hath done by my not compounding?</p>
            <p>Is it not certain that he would by making such a suit, have just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merited the censure of a wilfull madness, wherewith he doth endeavour to asperse me by his Pamphlet, which is an Errour, whereof he doth desire the Reader to esteem hee is no way capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And therefore since I have demonstrated that all those things were really performed by both of us in pursuance of the discourse he had with me at <hi>that first visit</hi> he was pleased to make me, the Reader must conclude, if he conceive us to be reasonable men, that all the goodly things which he pretends to be fully proved, are meer Fables contrived by Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> himself, who hath imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Height of Malice</hi> to invent them, and an <hi>Excess of Impudence</hi> to publish them. Whereas it is in Truth most evident, that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> having understood from me the resolution I had to compound for my Estate, &amp; finding that I conceived the price of Lands were like to fal, by reason of the sale of Dean &amp; Chapters Lands, which <hi>I had in the Country heard, were to be sold at ten yeares purchase</hi>; Did thereupon put my name into his Petition, and desired the Grant of my Composition, together with that of those other Gentlemen whom I have formerly named for satisfaction of his Engagements and Losses. And this being granted unto him by the Parliament, he took a Resolution to put me off from the right of Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his greater benefit, as I have formerly related, and by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and foul practises, expose me unto the eminent danger of loosing both my life and my Estate together; For can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> who had made me a visit, and received one from me, and had at both those times engaged himself to befreind me what he could in making my Composition, who had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me when the Committee sate, and promised me his presence to that purpose, would (notwithstanding his Professions of freindship to me, if he had intended to assist me in it, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends he did with all reality) before I had appeared or presented my Petition to the Committee, have spoken to my <hi>Disadvantage,</hi> and given such a Character of me, that the Committee were all of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119494-01:16"/>
them inflamed against me before they saw me? and after when I had admittance, could any man have taken the Petition which I delivered into his hands, the Copy wherof you have already read, to be a <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi> and not a <hi>Petition,</hi> when there was nothing in it but a Request that I might be admitted to compound according to my Articles w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the only <hi>Formall</hi> and <hi>Essentiall</hi> thing of a Petition, unless he had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to obstruct my Composition upon the Articles? And is it not most evident that he was much in liking with this design, when, for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of it, he took the boldness to cause the Order, or Warrant of the 4. of <hi>August</hi> to be entred upon Record as an Act of the Committee, without the knowledge or privity of all, or the most part of those of the Committee who were then present, as will be testified by Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Irby,</hi> and Sir <hi>David Watkins,</hi> persons of honour and quality, who were both of them Members of the Committee, and are suggested to have been present at the granting of that Order? Especially since the matter of it was, to the knowledge of the Committee, an apparant fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: And howsoever, could not by possibility have judicially appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before them, because the Committee appointed to take Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was a distinct Committee from them particularly appointed for that purpose, as appears by the examination of Sir <hi>Anthony Irby.</hi> And since in making of it, they took upon themselves, and did exercise a Jurisdiction no way belonging unto them, they being intrusted by the Parliament to compound with all Delinquents, and were not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire who did neglect to make their appearance before them, or any other Committee of Parliament, with whose actions they had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to intermeddle. And <hi>lastly,</hi> Since there was no present use made of it, the same not being then, nor at any time after served upon me, but only entred to remain there upon Record, that it might serve as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against me, if I were questioned upon the Ordinance of the 13. of <hi>Novem</hi>: (which that relates to) as a <hi>Spy by Martiall Law,</hi> or else in any other manner, and therby either fright me out of part of my Estate for preservation of my life, or deprive me of the whole, whensoever he should please to question me; And if he had (as he pretends) given me time to consider whether I would take the Negative Oath and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; in favour of me, would he have signed the Warrant for my Commitment the 12 of <hi>August</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Leech</hi> in his examination before the High Court of Justice hath sworn) when my appearance before the Committee at <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Hall upon their Summons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony taken in short hand by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the High Court of Iustice.</hi>
               </note> was not to be untill the next day after: And when at last I was committed only for refusing to take the Negative Oath and Covenant, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee would have enforced upon me, and I desired to be excused from taking, as a benefit allowed unto me by my Articles: Is it not som<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thing more then probable, that a desire of compliance with Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> his private Interest, caused Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> in his report unto the House to represent, that my insisting to have the benefit of my Articles allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me (which at that very time the House of Commons had by <hi>Vote</hi> approved) was <hi>a forfeiture of those very Articles wherof I craved the benefit, and a contempt of that Authority which gave a confirmation to them?</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119494-01:17"/>
And to conclude, is it not plain, that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> declared sufficiently what his drift was, in these his covert practises against me; When be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the <hi>Lobby</hi> about nine of the Clock in the morning, I was put into a dark corner by the outermost door, where my two Keepers attending, permitted none to come unto me, but Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> who during my stay there, which was betwixt <hi>nine, and three</hi> in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, was with me <hi>four or five severall times,</hi> expecting that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension I should have of my approaching danger, would have made me propose the parting with my Land unto him, to free my self from further trouble. And at his last coming, perceiving that I did not mention it to him, he did himself propose it, and offered to help me to a Chapman who should give 4000 <hi>l.</hi> for <hi>Aubury,</hi> being not half the money it had cost me, as I have formerly related in my <hi>Remonstrance</hi>: To which if I would then have condescended, it is most probable, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of my close keeping</hi>: that I had not been brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bar, as may be necessarily inferred by what he spake unto Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> to whom he came severall times after his coming from me, and told him, that he could not bring me to conformity, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be brought unto the Bar, which notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Ashes</hi> confident avowing of the contrary in his Pamphlet, will be testified by Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> against him.</p>
            <p>Who sees not, that all this machination against me is a Chain of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wherin Self-interest, Malice, and breach of Trust are by their complication raised to so <hi>high a pitch of wickedness,</hi> that they can scarce be matched by any thing; But the dissimulation and craft he used to cheat me out of my Petition at <hi>Newgate,</hi> when I had nothing else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to save either my life, or my Estate from utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>But in regard this discourse which passed in private between our selves, being one of those two things which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> hath undertaken to answer in his Pamphlet, is denyed by him, and therfore only rests for proof upon our <hi>single disagreeing testimonies,</hi> I shall desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to suspend his Judgment touching the truth of our two severall Allegations, untill he hath read my answer unto the other, and then I doubt not but he will perceive how little credit is to be given to Mr. <hi>Ashes</hi> affirmations, upon which terms I quit the further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion of this point, observing only these three things to the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in answer to Mr.</hi> Ashes <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in his Pamphlet,</hi> page 4. <hi>and</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the generall answer he pretends to give in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, for proof wherof he doth affirm so boldly, that he hath more then one hundred witnesses, is altogether false. As I shall evidence, when I have given you the substance of that <hi>Romance</hi> which he so formally delivers, being this.</p>
            <p>That when I was brought to the High Court of Justice, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then present as a Witness, Mr. Attorney Generall was pleased to acquaint the Court, that at my first appearance there, I had cast out some words reflecting upon Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> and I had filled the Town with talk of the great matters I would charge him withall, if he appeared in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119494-01:17"/>
the Court, and therfore Mr. Attorney prayed, that since he was there present, I might openly declare what it was wherwith I meaned to charge him; That the Court liked the motion, and willed me to speak that which I had to say against him; That I condescended therunto, &amp; then related some headless Stories, and that when I had done, Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney told the Court that I had sure much more to say, in regard that which I had now spoken did not reflect at all on Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> nor answer the reports about the Town, and therfore pressed me again and again to speak all that I had to say; &amp; when J replyed that J had spoken all, the Lord President spake, letting me know, the Court had with much patience heard me tell a long story, though no way pertinent to the matter before them; the substance being that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> advised me to sel my Farm at <hi>Aubury,</hi> and with that money to pay my Composition. But the Lord President demanded whether he, or any for him, treated with me for buying of it, or whether he discovered a desire to buy the Farm at <hi>Aubury:</hi> That J answered his Lordship he did not, and therupon the Lord President demanding how the Story could then reflect upon Mr. <hi>Ash</hi>? J answered, that J beleived Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> intended to buy the Farm, because he had advised me to sell it.</p>
            <p>This is in short the substance of his relation, if at least that may be said to have <hi>a substance,</hi> which is nothing, only <hi>an invention</hi> of his own: But Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> is very just in this particular, and hath not only perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is according to the Proverb, <hi>better then his word.</hi> For having as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured me (when I reproached him with his covetousness in the da<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k corner) that he would deny all that discourse, if I should charge him with it. He hath not only made this good, but hath invented also this formall Story to give a countenance to his denyall; And this J shall most cleerly prove, not by the boldness of an affirmation (as he hath done) but by the undeniable Evidence of the Proceedings in the High Court, where, whatsoever was read or spoken, was taken at first in short-hand by Mr. <hi>Pococke,</hi> a person authorized therunto, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards written at large for information of that Court; And is by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Court of Articles, and by consent of Mr. Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and my Counsell, admitted as indifferent Evidence.</p>
            <p>By this it doth appear, that Mr. Attorney Generall upon the first sitting of the Court, acquainted them that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> did both of them appear that day, being the first time that they came to be examined as witnesses in my Cause, and without mentioning any thing in the least kind of what is here affirmed by Mr <hi>Ash,</hi> desired they might be sworn to give their Evidence, and they were sworn accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and did deliver what they had to say before J spoke at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> his carriage: But when upon my answer to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, J had in part laid open these his practises against me; Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney Generall was then so far from taking notice to the Court that what J spake did not at all answer to the reports about the Town, as that <hi>he appealed unto the Court, whether that so much as a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mr.</hi> Ash <hi>was spoken before, that he was then present in the Court and gave his Evidence.</hi> For proof wherof J shall insert here what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

by Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> at the first entring into the business of the day, and what he after urged when they had given their Evidence, and I had made an answer to them, which followes as it is in the aforesaid Record <hi>Verbatim</hi> thus expressed.<note place="margin">

            <p>And therfore having fully cleered by this Record, how grossely he hath erred in his relation, I leave it to the Readers judgment, what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is to be given unto him touching discourses passed in private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, who hath the <hi>Impudence</hi> to forge and publish this as a thing that passed in publike in the Court; And that he had for proof ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a hundred Witnesses, when as unto a thing that is so evident, there is no doubt but every one of all those Witnesses will upon the reading hereof assent unto the truth of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> notwithstanding his impudence to deny the truth, doth yet confess <hi>that he did move me to sell</hi> Aubury <hi>for payment of my Fine,</hi> &amp; though he doth deny that he had an intention to buy it, yet it appears by Sir <hi>Edward Bayntons</hi> discourse unto Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> mentioned in his Examination aforesaid, that Mr. Ash <hi>himself was the person who was to be the Purchaser of that Mannor,</hi> which is the substance of that wherewith J charge him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:119494-01:18"/>
               <hi>And thirdly,</hi> That he doth not so much as once alledge among his good advises to me, that he perswaded me unto a <hi>Composition</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Articles of <hi>Exeter</hi> (that being the thing wherof I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous) but to acknowledge my <hi>miscarriage</hi> at <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Hall, where I have shewed already, that I had not at all offended, and therfore could not acknowledge this, or crave the pardon of the House (as Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> advised me) without confessing of a Crime, wherof I was not guilty, and subjecting my self unto the censure of the House, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who had affronted the Committee imployed under them. So as if I had been remitted to <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Hall to make a Composition; they must have needs according unto Justice ordered the Committee to have received a Fine from me, not only in relation to my Articles, but also for that pretended contempt of their Authority, which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> had a desire I should confess for his own private benefit, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly begg'd my Composition, he was in hope that this might have been super-added unto it, so as this being one of the main things wherwith I charge Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> is here acknowledged by him.</p>
            <p>But two continue the Naration which I have upon this occasion interrupted: Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> after the proposition which he made for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of my Land at <hi>Aubury,</hi> was not above a quarter of an hour gone from me, but I was brought to the Bar where being commanded to kneel, I desired, that before I received any mark of their displeasure, I might know my Offence, wherupon I was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and these following Resolves, and Orders passed against me.</p>

Whereupon he told me that he had a very earnest request unto me, and prayed me that I would not deny it, which was, that he might have the honour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my Petition for me; and if it were so that I would trust him with it, if he did not give me a very speedy account therof, and that if he did not use his utmost endeavours to accomplish so much as I should therin desire, he would give me leave wheresoevr I saw him, or spake of him, to say, <hi>My servant</hi> Ash <hi>was an arrant Knave,</hi> I told him; that although I did intend to deliver a Petition, yet it was not

my purpose to have troubled him with it; but since he had so freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited me therunto, he should have it, he prayed mee speedily to draw it, I told him that I would, he told me then hee would come the next morning to me for it, and accordingly he did so; but not liking the Petition, for that I had expressed therin, that I had the benefit of the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and that I had accordingly submitted unto my Composition, and that I was refused only for denying to take the Negative Oath and Covenant, and therfore did pray that <hi>I</hi> might be referred unto my Composition, and restored to my Liberty, he told me that this Petition did too much expostulate with the Parliament (for so he termed it) that was highly displeased with me; and that I should not Petition in that way but draw up an humble Petition, that should shew that I was very sorry that I had incurred their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures in refusing to kneele when they Commanded me, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse that offence in the best manner that I could, and to beg their pardon for the same, and this he told me would be sufficient to take off the prosecution of my Indictments which was the first thing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be done, the Assizes being so neer at hand in the Country.

               </note> for so long, and no longer, he saies, he had my Petition in his Custody, sent his Letter to me to give me notice of it, and desiring my directions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose hands he should put it, whilst he was absent,</p>

               <hi>That Mr.</hi> Hollis <hi>told him it was such a one, as would, if it had been delivered, have more incensed the House against me, in regard I desired nothing by it, but my removall to a better prison, and Mr.</hi> Ash <hi>asking where the Petition was, Mr.</hi> Hollis <hi>told him, he had sent it back to me with this direction, that I should draw another, humbly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my miscarriages, craving pardon for them, and desiring to be remitted unto</hi> Goldsmiths Hall <hi>to make my Composition, and to receive the benefit of</hi> Exeter <hi>Articles, and further letting me know, that if I would send him such a Petition, he would not only deliver it himself, but engage all his freinds, that my desires should be granted</hi>: That Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> demanding of him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had taken his advice, <hi>He replied no, adding withall, that I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly either mad, or had lost my wits, I was so obstinate</hi>; upon which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> said, that had been also his advice, and of some others of his freinds, but I rejected their Councills, and he concludes with an affirmation that hee never received other Petition from me, then that which hee hath mentioned.</p>
            <p>This is the substance of the Narrative, which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> hath in his Pamphlet published, as an answer to this passage in my <hi>Remonstrance</hi> and this he doth affirm,<note place="margin">

            <p>And first, whereas he doth alledge that he came to me upon the earnest desire, and solicitation of my wife at nine or ten a Clock at night; I shall desire the Reader to observe the want of Ingenuity there is in Mr. <hi>Ashes</hi> relation, notwithstanding his profession of an exact truth &amp; plainess; For <hi>I affirme with confidence,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> did, as I have before alleadged, come of himself <hi>unsent for by me,</hi> about three a Clock in the afternoon, within three or four dayes after I was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and did <hi>Officiously,</hi> (<hi>or debasedly</hi> as he would have it by his

Pamphlet) Court me to have the honour (as I have said in my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance</hi>) to preferre my Petition for me: And this passage which he relates with so much Circumstance, as the first time when he came to me, was not till some time after he had been with me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Petition, and pretended to waite an opportunity for the presenting of it; Now the occasion upon which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> was by my wife desired, to come into the Prison to me at that late hour, was onely this; My eldest Son <hi>Iohn Stawell,</hi> lay then sick in <hi>Bathe,</hi> and being in Arrear for his expences in Dyet and Physick, she had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Letter from Mr <hi>Boyse</hi> at whose house he lay, wherby he let her know, that unless 50. or 60 <hi>l.</hi> (as I remember) were speedily sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for discharge of those scores, he would not entertain him lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but would remove him thence into the Country, where he could not have that conveniency for such remedies to recover him as were then used about him: Now my Wife having received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unwilling to loose time, did with the tender care of a Mother on behalf of her Son, importune Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> to come unto me, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting either me, or Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> with the occasion, for which she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his coming to confer with me, untill she brought us both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then she did acquaint us with the Letter which Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> did read as well as my self, and earnestly desired the furtherance and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> for the procuring of that Summ from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his means, upon this urgent and extream necessity: My E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state being then, and long before totally sequestred, nothing let us, and no allowance at that time set forth either to wife or Children: I joyned with her in this request, and Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> did promise us to use his best endeavour in it: But whether it were that he did move in it and could not prevail, or that he never stirred in it according to his promise; The success was, that the money being not procured in time, he was removed thence into the Country, to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his health, considering his weak and languishing condition; And this was the only business, which at that time was treated of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: So as I cannot but admire his boldness in framing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging of this Story to mislead the Reader, by making him beleive it was then, that J engaged him to undertake the presenting of my Petition, which, <hi>before that time</hi> he had received from me, contrary to truth and his own knowledge.</p>
            <p>Now, wheras he pretends that the Petition which I sent him, was only <hi>for my removall unto a better Prison,</hi> and that he did himself amend the first I drew in many places with his Pen, this is so impudent a falsehood, that it is wonderfull with what face he can alledge it. I have the <hi>individuall paper</hi> in my custody, not corrected or interlined at all by him, or any other, and that was drawn according to my own sense, it being to inform the House, that I was comprised within the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and to desire my enlargement, and to be remitted to <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Hall to make my Composition there, according to my Articles: The Copy wherof follows in these words.</p>

And here he hath related so many particulars, that it can hardly be imagined but some of them will be made good to prove the story which he so formally delivers; As <hi>First, his care in coming early to the House, his earnestness in the uncivil interrupting of Mr.</hi> Hollis <hi>to deliver the Petition to him, his solicitude in the enquiry after it from Mr.</hi> Hollis <hi>as soon as he returned, and the affection he expressed in consulting with Mr.</hi> Hollis <hi>how to do me good,</hi> by whom (it seems) all his advices were approved, and <hi>I condemned</hi> for <hi>madness</hi> and <hi>obstinacy</hi>; and yet it is most certain, that this Narration, with all its circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is an invention of his own brain, <hi>disavowed by Mr.</hi> Hollis, <hi>and contradicted by himself,</hi> in a Letter which he sent unto me upon his going out of Town, to give me an account of the disposal of my Petition, both which Letters follow in these words.</p>

                  <p>By these it doth appear, That all the formal story, published with so large a dress of circumstances by Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> is a meer fiction invented by himself; for he confesseth in his letter, <hi>That he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it himself to Mr.</hi> Hollis,<note place="margin">Pray observe how different this is from Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi>'s affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in his Pamphlet.</note> 
                     <hi>but recommended it unto him by a Letter that very day, on which he now alledges that he had given it into the hands of Mr.</hi> Hollis, <hi>in the morning before the sitting of the House.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if he did at all commend it to him by a Letter, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the trust of such a Messenger, as never yet delivered it to Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> who consequently could not, nor did at all return it to me with his friendly counsel, nor could there be occasion ministred for the discourse invented by Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> and published him as a thing that passed between them two, wherein he hath suggested, Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> did concur with him in censuring of me.</p>
                  <p>Why should I longer dwell upon this passage, having already proved by <hi>Witnesses,</hi> by <hi>Arguments,</hi> by his <hi>own Letters,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the strange boldness which he hath used in publishing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119494-01:23"/>
this fiction, there is not <hi>one true word</hi> throughout the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of it; so as by grounding the credit which he would have given to his other allegations, upon the proof he pretends to make of this particular, he leaves the Reader to admire his confidence in the avowing of a slander, without the least ground of truth, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability for the maintaining of it; and therefore I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, as I did formerly at the High Court of Justice, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Ashe, <hi>by the professions of love and kindness which he made to his good Master</hi> (for so he called me) <hi>got the possession of my Petition, and did ingage himself to deliver the same unto the Parliament, but did mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously and wilfully fail in performing his engagement</hi>: By which failer, and breach of Trust, he did (according to Mr. <hi>Ashe's</hi> inference) <hi>Iudas-like betray his Master.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly, the consequences of this breach of Trust fell heavily upon me; for I was shortly afterwards Indicted, first at <hi>Taunton</hi> Assizes, where the Bill of High Treason was found; next at the Sessions at <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> where there was an <hi>Ignoramus</hi>; and last of all at <hi>Charde,</hi> where three Indictments were found, one for High Treason, and two for Murther, for killing of <hi>Osborn</hi> at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals Elme,</hi> and for execution of <hi>Viccary,</hi> when I was Governor of <hi>Taunton,</hi> many of the Grand Jury being the Inhabitants of <hi>Taunton,</hi> and such who had recovered Judgements for great summes of mony against me, and have since purchased a good part of my estate, which Indictments were afterwards removed by <hi>Certiorari</hi> into the then Kings Bench, where the 12. and 13. of <hi>May,</hi> 1649. I was arraigned upon the Indictment of High Treason, in levying War against the King, upon the Statute of the 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and upon my moving to plead specially, the Court ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, That I should bring in my special Pleading the first day of the next Term, and did assign me Counsel for that purpose, but I was never brought to plead further to that Indictment.</p>
                  <p>The 18. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1649. an Act was printed and published, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>An Act for relief of all such persons, as have been, are, or shall be sued, molested, or any way damnified, contrary to Articles, or Conditions granted in time of War.</hi> In which Act Commissioners were nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hear, and determine Cases concerning Articles, according to the powers of the said Act.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I did address my self by Petition unto that Court to be relieved upon my Articles, which Petition was read the 10. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1649. and is <hi>verbatim</hi> printed in my Remonstrance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I spare here to insert it.</p>
                  <p>But upon this Petition, no proceedings were made by the said Court, whose Authority determining with the said Act, was on the 10. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1650. renewed for six months, by Act of Parliament; and then ended by expiration only.</p>
                  <p>And here, before I mention any thing of the proceedings against me at the High Court of Justice, which happened more then a

year after, I shall desire the Reader to observe the falshood of Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> his Pamphlet in two particulars which hee suggesteth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That I did not upon any Trial at the then Kings Bench Bar, claim the benefit of the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ashe's</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</note> and did not at any other time after challenge the benefit of them by Petition to the Parliament, nor any Committee from them.</p>
                  <p>As to the first of these; The falshood of it is apparent; for that upon my motion to plead specially,<note place="margin">My Answer to them.</note> the Court allowed it to me, and ordered me to bring in my special Plea on the first day of the next Term, and did assign me Counsel for that purpose; but I was never called upon to plead further to that Indictment; so as it is impossible for Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> to know what I would have pleaded had I been called; and I can with much confidence affirm, That albeit my Counsel might advise me, to offer in the first place to that Court such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Law as were more proper for them to judge upon, yet I was resolved, both according to my own sense, and the opinion of my Counsel, not to plead any Plea, which might deprive me of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of my Articles, as being resolved to insist upon them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever my Counsel should advise me it was seasonable to demand the allowance of them.</p>
                  <p>And for the second; It appears manifestly false by the Petition before mentioned, which I preferred unto the Commissioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Parliament, for relieving persons upon Articles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 10. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1649. which was at least seventeen months before that I was brought unto the Bar at the High Court of Justice, and was as soon as the House had appointed any Court to relieve such as were agrieved upon Articles; and that I did not make any application to the Parliament upon my first Committal, was no default in me, but in himself, who having then perswaded me to alter my Petition to them, and after kept it either by fraud, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice from their sight, doth now charge that upon mee as a crime, whereof himself is only guilty.</p>
                  <p>But that I may conclude this long Narration, The power of those Commissioners being (as I have said before) expired, upon the 26. of <hi>March</hi> following, the High Court of Justice was established, and on the 9. of <hi>Iuly</hi> next after, an Act was published for the trial of me,<note place="margin">My Trial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> and of some others for our lives before them. The 20. of the same month, I was by order of the said High Court removed in order to my trial from Newgate to the Tower of <hi>London</hi>; And on the 17. of <hi>December</hi> following, I was brought unto the Bar of the said High Court, there to abide a Trial for my life.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, there is no man, who had but the least spark of generosity, or humanity, but would bee moved with some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and afford his just assistance unto a person reduced to that extreme degree of danger wherein I stood. <hi>That very Iudas</hi> (to whom he doth with so much scorn fancy himself to be resembled)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119494-01:24"/>
when he saw his Master voted guilty by the Jews, and that he was to be presented before <hi>Pilate,</hi> there to receive his last Tryal, felt some remorse, and coming to the Princes and the Elders, confessed his Treachery in the betraying of him; But Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> in this sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent whereunto I had been brought by him, was so far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right unto me by his testimony, that concealing my appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before the Committee at Goldsmiths-Hall, and the presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of my Petition there, which I had put into his hands, he came to justice that most false Record entered in his presence the 4th. of <hi>August,</hi> which proved, that I had not appeared either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Committee at Goldsmiths-Hall, or any other Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee at the time when that Record was entred. And to the end it might not be inferred that I had claimed the benefit of <hi>Exeter</hi> Articles before them by that clause of the Record, which saith, <hi>That I pretended to come in upon those Articles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In the Book of Short-hand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by order of the High Court of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> the same was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally left out in the Copy produced before the High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and notwithstanding sworn as a true copy of the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                  <p>This evidence was much insisted on, and strongly urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me during the greatest part of my Trial; and it was in vain that I produced persons of quality and honor, Sir <hi>Iames Thinne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Paulet</hi> as witnesses for me, to prove the tender of my Petition, for they could onely swear, that I was there with them in <hi>Iuly</hi>; that I had a Petition in my hand, which I told them I did intend to present unto the Committee, and that I was called in a while after into the Room where the Committee sate, staid there some time, and at my coming out told them I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my Petition to the Committee; but in regard they were not suffered to come in when I was called, they were not able to swear that I had given my Petition into the hands of Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> as I alledged, and therefore this being no concluding Evidence for the delivery thereof, it was pressed, that my Averment in this case was not to be received against the said Record, which did posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirm that I had not on the 4th. of <hi>August,</hi> or any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, appeared before them.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, that High Court, notwithstanding their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, would have condemned me by their Justice, had it not pleased God in his infinite Providence and mercy to me, to put into my mind, that Sir <hi>Henry Berkley</hi> (whose business was heard immediately before mine) had by meer accident, contrary unto the usual course, staid in the Room whilst his Mittimus was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and whilst I tendred my Petition to Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi>; I made this known unto the Court, and they were honorably pleased to give me time for the producing of him, <hi>at which time of Sir</hi> Henry Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <hi>appearance, that individual Petition, formerly delivered to Mr.</hi> Ashe <hi>(the tender whereof was so stifly denied) was then, and not before, produced in Court, and Mr.</hi> Ashe <hi>appearing the same time.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119494-01:25"/>
used his utmost skill to incense the Court against me,</hi> plainly shewing the intention of entering that false Record was, to deprive me of my life whensoever I should be called to Trial for it, as a person who had neglected my time, and thereby forfeited my Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The book of Short-hand proves this.</note>This foul practice in a person so highly trusted by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with Mr. <hi>Leeches</hi> Oath, <hi>which did expresly aver the Record of the fourth of</hi> August <hi>to be entred by the Committees ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> was surely ill resented by the Court, although they made no mention thereof in their Proceedings, because it never came judicially before them; But in my Case, after mature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and several Debates, they all resolved, and did accordingly certifie unto the Parliament, <hi>That I was comprised in the said Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of</hi> Exeter, <hi>did personally appear within four months, according to truth</hi> (although my Articles, as I have formerly said, required not the same) <hi>and presented a Petition to the Committee at Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths-Hall, for a Composition, in relation to the said Articles, which they resolved was a submission to Composition, according to the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of</hi> Exeter, Thereby implicitly condemning M. <hi>Ashe</hi> of Injustice, in denying to admit my Composition tendred with all due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which on my part I was to do, and of a foul conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against my life, in countenancing a false Record unduely entred, to stand against me as an Evidence, and be a ground for the condemning of me, contrary to the truth, and his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>My Life being thus, by the blessing of Almighty God, and the Justice of that honorable Court, preserved, my Estate was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding on the 16th. of <hi>Iuly</hi> following, adjudged by Act of Parliament to be sold, and accordingly was purchased by several persons from the Trustees at <hi>Drury</hi>-house.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 29th. day of <hi>September</hi> 1652. the House was pleased to pass an Act for reviveing of the former Act made for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of persons upon Articles, and nominated Commissioners for that purpose, rejecting <hi>two Provisoes</hi> tendred to the Act on the 28. and 29. dayes of <hi>September,</hi> before the passing of it, <hi>which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the limitation of that benefit which the House was honorably pleased to grant and allow unto such persons as should claim relief by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>; requiring, that the Judgement and Orders of the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners be obeyed and observed by <hi>all Courts, Committees, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and other persons concerned, any Law, Order, or Ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 14th. of <hi>October</hi> following, I exhibited my Petition to the said Court, craving relief upon my Articles, where, after witnesses examined, publication granted, and a full hearing of all parties, the Commissioners did solemnly declare and adjudge that I was fully capable of the relief intended upon the said Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, constituting that Court, and that I ought to be admitted
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119494-01:25"/>
to compound for my whole estate, according to the Tenor of my said Articles, as appears by the Judgement, and Proceedings in that Court, mentioned at large in my Remonstrance, which Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I forbear in this place to insert, because I shall hereafter have occasion to mention it. Neither are they questioned at all by Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> who notwithstanding hee hath been formerly examined against me in the High Court of Justice, and that testimony of his, taken in the Book of Short-hand, was afterwards read and made use of in the Court of Articles upon the hearing of my Cause, according to the said Order, allowing the Book of Short-hand to be made use of as indifferent evidence on both sides, and notwithstanding the solemn Judgement of those two Honourable Courts who have plainly declared the refusal of my Petition for a Composition when I tendered it, to be a violation of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, is yet so passionately pressed against me, that without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth and modesty, he hath divulged this scandalous and scurrilous Pamphlet to asperse me only (as himself professeth) that he might be received as a Witness to swear against me, before a Committee appointed to examine my Petition by the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom he had hoped to have mis-led, by his false allegations, whereby he hath occasioned all my miseries and losses.</p>
                  <p>And for the better countenancing of his Fables, there is with it come out, in the name of the Purchasers of my estate, a Re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all the matters formerly moved, heard, and determined in my former hearings, which for that reason, I forbear to answer, as deeming it unfit to submit the things already cleered, and judged by two such Honorable Courts, as it were unto another Trial and Examination, to satisfie the fancies and pleasures of I know not whom.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Reader, I have here given a true and an exact account of all that Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> hath acted in my business, from my first coming to <hi>London</hi> after the surrender of <hi>Exeter,</hi> until the sentence given for me in the Court of Articles, by which it appears plainly, that my Remonstrance is not only true in all those passages touching Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> which I have there set down, but also that I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, out of a Christian respect, and charity (whereof he hath made me but an ill requital) forborn to publish that foul practice he hath used to take away my life, and my estate, the which I had not now divulged, were I not compelled to do it for my own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against those false and malicious slanders, which he hath sought to fix upon me, by his shameless Pamphlet, which was most maliciously published at the very time when by my Petition (<hi>which made no mention of him</hi>) I sued unto the Parliament for my relief.</p>
            <p>I have most cleerly proved, not by a feigned Utopian Discourse, but by <hi>undoubted evidence, the testimony of witnesses, persons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and integrity, by his own Letters, by Records, and by the solemn
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119494-01:26"/>
Iudgements of two great and Honorable Courts,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in broken all those tyes that are most sacred, as being the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> is here considered in a twofold capacity.</note> wherein doth rest as well the private, as the publick conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of men, not to be violated, without the general confusion of all Laws Divine and Humane; For if you shall consider Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> as a private person, you will find him a man pretending friendship, who having promised assistance to his friend in those indearing terms that might beget a mutual confidence,<note place="margin">As a private person.</note> and being the sole man who was relied upon for favor, did afterwards, without offence, or provocation, for his own private benefit, inveigh against the person that trusted in him, whom he presented to the Committee (who were his Judges) under so foul a Character, that before they saw him, they began their knowledge of him by the hatred of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, and person; You see him afterwards publickly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct that Composition he had promised to further with his best assistance, and when by breach of that publick trust which was reposed in him by Parliament, he had procured unto me their displeasure, you see him then resume the person of a friend, that he might cheat me of my Petition, when I had nothing else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to preserve either my life, or estate; and having gotten the possession of it, to keep it by him, and neither offer it himself unto the House, or put it into the hands of any other, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have done, upon his going into the Country, after which time he never more came neer me, as I have formerly said in my <hi>Remonstrance.</hi> What can be added unto the malice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousness of this, being all acted under the colour, and pretence of love and friendship?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">As a publick person.</note>But if we look upon him as a publick person, then this miscarriage appears in him much fouler; for we must then consider Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> as a man most highly trusted by his Country, when they returned him to serve them as a Member of Parliament, and most particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly favoured by that great Assembly, by nominating him a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Committee, who were intrusted to dispence their Justice granted in the Articles of War made by their Armies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the strict performance whereof, <hi>the publick faith and honor of the Armies, the Parliament, and the whole Nation in general, were by the Law of God and Nations, ingaged in a most eminent and particular manner</hi>; and upon this depended <hi>the lives and fortunes</hi> of a considerable number of their fellow-subjects, who were ingaged for the late King in those unhappy differences, whom they were to admit to Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition upon the terms prescribed unto them by their several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, so as they were appointed <hi>Iudges</hi> over things which are above all other of the highest consequence and most concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to wit, <hi>The publick Faith and Honor, the Estates, the Lives and Liberties of their Country-men and Fellow-subjects</hi>; And among all these persons, there was more than ordinary confidence reposed in Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> who was the Chair-man of the said Committee; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119494-01:26"/>
for such a man, thus qualified, advanced, and trusted, first to obtain the Grant of a Fine unto his own particular use, which was to be assessed before himself; For the obtaining whereof he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited unto the Parliament, a cheating false Account, claiming Sums which he not at all disbursed, as I have formerly expressed; To play the Orator, and falsly to calumniate a person to his fellow Judges, who was a stranger to them, and <hi>did appear before them an humble Petitioner</hi> to obtain the benefit intended to him by his Articles, having engaged himself to favor his Petition; To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude Oathes and Covenants upon him, from which he was to be exempted by his Articles, and for that reason to deny this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position when it was tendered. To be present and assistant unto the entry of a Record, the Contents whereof were false, to his own knowledge, and did no way belong to his Cognizance, or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; To give direction for the making of a Report unto the House of Commons, as from the whole Committee (without their Warrant or Directions) That I had contemned the Parliaments au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and forfeited my Articles; And lastly, To appear, and by his Testimony to countenance that false Record when it was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against me at my Tryal, thereby to take away my Life and Estate together; All these are, in a <hi>publick Officer,</hi> crimes of so high a nature and concernment, that if we find not presidents touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the punishments due to them, we must conclude, it is because himself was the first man that ever had presumption to commit them.</p>
            <p>But although our Histories have not examples of the like mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in an Officer so immediatly intrusted by the High Court of Parliament, as Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> yet notwithstanding our Laws are very clear and positive in the inflicting of great and exemplary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on persons trusted with the execution of the Law, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Justice of the Land, if they shall violate their trust, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of far less concernment, than what was recommended to Mr. <hi>Ashe.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>If a Jury who are the Judges in all matters of fact, which come in issue before the Judges in the Courts of Common Law, give a false Verdict contrary to their evidence, this is a crime so odious in the eye of the Law, that being attainted of it they shall suffer the VIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANOUS JUDGEMENT.<note place="margin">L. <hi>Cook.</hi> 3d. part of his Instit. p. 222.</note> And the <hi>same Iudgement is also given in a Conspiracy, upon the false conspiring to deprive a man of life, by an Indictment at the Common Law,</hi> which Judgement is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> to consist in five several punishments.</p>

Secondly, <hi>Nor never be received as Witnesses in any Cause.</hi> Thirdly, That they shall never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of the Kings Courts, but make Attorneys, if they have any thing to do there.</p>
            <p>And this is called a VILLANOUS JUDGEMENT, because of the <hi>villany</hi> and <hi>infamy</hi> which they deserve against whom it is given. <hi>And all is inflicted by the common Law, for that the Offenders by false conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, under the pretext of Law,</hi>

               <hi>by Indictment of Treason, or Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and legal proceedings thereupon, sought to do the greatest Injustice, by false conspiracy to shed his blood, who afterwards is thereof</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimo modo acquietatus.</p>
            <p>But if these crimes are singly punished with so much rigor by the Laws in our <hi>inferior</hi> Magistrates and persons; what shall we say of Mr. <hi>Ashes</hi> guilt, who hath himself taken the boldness to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them all?</p>
            <p>In acting the several parts, <hi>First,</hi> Of a <hi>malicious, unjust Iudge,</hi> when I first tendred my Petition to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of a <hi>corrupt Iuror,</hi> in his direction for the report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me to the House.</p>
            <p>And <hi>thirdly,</hi> Of a <hi>false Conspirator,</hi> by countenancing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of that pernicious Record, which was produced and sworn against me at my Trial; especially, being <hi>in breach of an immediate Trust</hi> committed to him by Authority of Parliament (the supreme Court of Law and Justice, whereof the others are but Rivulets) and who have in all ages punished the <hi>want of Truth</hi> in all those Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were brought unto them, with so much rigor, that by the Statute of 37. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">37 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</note> It is Enacted, That those who shall make <hi>false Suggestions</hi> against any one before the King and his Council (who were then the Supreme Power) <hi>shall prove their suggestions, or else in our the same pain the other should, in case he were attainted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, if they have punished with this great severity those who presumed to mis-inform them by <hi>Petition</hi> or <hi>Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereby the person against whom complaint is made receives no other prejudice but onely to be brought unto an <hi>answer,</hi> we cannot well conceive the greatness of that punishment, which they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119494-01:27"/>
would in their Justice have inflicted on any person that should dare to have abused the power and trust they had committed to him (as Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> hath done) by acts of high injustice in his judgement, and extreme falsehood in the informations he hath directed to be made unto them. But I forbear to heighten his offence, because I have in writing this Discourse intended my own Vindication, not his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
            <p>I had here given a conclusion to this Discourse concerning Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> did not the Artifice which he hath in his Pamphlet used, to avoid the Testimonies of Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> and Sir <hi>David Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> persons of honor and quality, whose Depositions you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready read, and that great want of Civility and respect he hath shewed to them, inforce me to say some thing in answer to it.</p>
            <p>The thing which Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> doth first except against, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to answer, is,<note place="margin">Answers to the Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Irbys,</hi> and Sir <hi>David Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> The relation Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> hath given of my Deportment, <hi>at both those times</hi> I appeared before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee at Goldsmiths-Hall, which he declares to have been such, <hi>as that he for his part took no offence at it, nor doth he think there could be any justly taken.</hi> This is confirmed, not onely by Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> but also by the concurring Testimony of Sir <hi>David Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In answer unto this, it is alleged by Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> that Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> was the principal man of the Committee that took excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at my Petition, and moved that it might be rejected, and that it was he principally who pressed the making of the Report against me.</p>
            <p>Here is <hi>a flat denial</hi> of the Testimonies <hi>of two concurring Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, persons of great integrity and worth</hi>; but if wee look for proof of his Assertions, he can produce no other but his own affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and therefore we must take it as <hi>a slander</hi> cast upon those worthy Gentlemen, in the inventing whereof he shews great <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and in the publishing, <hi>much weakness,</hi> to think that his bare word should pass as proof against them, being produced as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent persons, to testifie their knowledge before a Committee of Parliament, in my case: Especially considering, that Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> (among the Questions which he sets down, and which he moved the Committee he might ask Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi>) had a care not to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion any thing <hi>touching my carriage,</hi> because Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> both could and would have proved the falseness of his Allegations.</p>
            <p>But in regard it is pretended by Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> that in the Answers made to these three questions, Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> had some way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted what he had formerly delivered, I will set down <hi>the Questions</hi> and <hi>the Answers,</hi> that so it may appear how <hi>truly</hi> he infers out of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whether Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> were present the first and second time that I appeared before the Committee at Goldsmiths-Hall? To which he answered, he was present. And Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> might well
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119494-01:28"/>
have spared the labour of that Question, because it is one of the first things affirmed by him in his Letter, and in his Examination before the Committee of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second,</hi> Whether the Committee (taking offence at my behavior and language) did order Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> to report the same to the Parliament; this Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> acknowledgeth, and this is not the thing Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> insists on.</p>
            <p>But on <hi>the third</hi> Whether Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> himself consented, and gave his Vote in the affirmative, for making of the said Report; And hereunto Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> answered, he did, after some pause, wherein it is supposed by Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> he contradicted what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said in the justification of my civil language and fair deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>What ground or reason Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> can have for this his suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall refer unto the Readers judgement, when I have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stated the matter of Fact, as it appears out of the Letter of Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> which he pretends to answer, and his Examinations before the Committee, being this. When I first tendred my Petition to the Committee to be admitted unto my Composition, which was disliked and rejected, as you have heard, Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> took <hi>no exception at my carriage, nor did he think justly there could be any,</hi> and then declared his opinion, <hi>That I ought to compound, there being want of money, The House of Commons having confirmed the Articles of</hi> Exeter, <hi>by which I was exempted from the taking of Oathes.</hi> At my second appearance before them, he was <hi>also of the same opinion</hi>; But seeing others were not of his mind, but height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my offence, and took exceptions at my carriage and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and would have it reported to the House, he gave way to it, and passed his Vote in the affirmative, That <hi>the whole matter should be reported to the House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I shall desire the Reader to observe, if any thing herein do contradict in the least kind what hath been formerly said by Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> in justification of my deportment.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">So certified by Mr. <hi>Baily.</hi>
               </note>For admit (although in truth no question was put, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Vote could pass, as appears by Mr. <hi>Baylies</hi> Certificate, who keeps the Records of that Committee, which makes it more then probable that Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> very much mistakes in this Relation) Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> had given his Vote, That <hi>my denial of the Negative Oath and Covenant (which I refused by vertue of my Articles) and my carriage (which he conceived was fair and civil)</hi> should be reported to the House, That they might <hi>thereupon</hi> declare their pleasures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should be continued under restraint for refusing the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Oath and Covenant, or be admitted to Composition without taking them (notwithstanding his opinion, <hi>That the House had by the granting of these Articles dispensed with the taking of them</hi>;) <hi>which was the onely thing; then in dispute amongst them,</hi> as appears by their Order then entred, and was as much as Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> had in direction to report unto the House.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:119494-01:28"/>Can any man suppose Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> by passing his vote in the affirmative for this end, did give consent, that it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the House, <hi>I had rejected, or forfeited the benefit of my Articles, and contemned the Authority of the House, which confirmed them?</hi> Or was there any Warrant for Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> by this order, to report as he hath done, by the directions of Mr. <hi>Ashe, That I had fleighted and contemned the Authority of the present Parliament, and forfeited their mercy contained in the Articles of</hi> Exeter; And in the close of his Report to say, THAT IF THE PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT DID NOT MAKE SIR <hi>IOHN STAWELL</hi> A TRAYTOR, SIR <hi>IOHN STAWELL</hi> HAD MADE THEM TRAYTORS, <hi>as Mr.</hi> Ashe, <hi>in the conclusion of his Pamphlet, affirms he did?</hi> which was a most false, bold, and malicious infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and could not be collected from any thing that I had spoken, or he, by the Committees Order, was Authorised to deliver; and this without stating the matter <hi>truly</hi> unto the House, and desiring their opinion and direction therein, which was the <hi>final end,</hi> for which that Order was made.</p>
            <p>Who sees not, that this same is quite another thing, from what, by Order of the Committee, Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> was to have performed? so as if Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> did make <hi>some pause</hi> before he gave an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Question, it was, for that he made <hi>some doubt</hi> within himself, whether he should not, before he answered thereunto, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Committee, in the Star-Chamber, of the whole truth, as I have now expressed it, or leave it (as it seems he did) unto their further Examination.</p>
            <p>And surely Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> was very cautious what questions he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> for fear his practices might have more cleerly been brought to light, or otherwise (being so much my friend as he pretends) he would have then denied <hi>the ill offices he did me, unto the Committee, before I was called in before them,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> had charged him, and he would also have sought to cleer himself touching the entry of <hi>that false Record of the fourth of</hi> August, which is suggested to have been made when that Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> was present at the Committee, though Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> was altogether ignorant of the making of it: But Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declined the asking of these questions, did plainly shew these charges were so cleerly true against him, that though he sought a colour for the rest, yet he could find out nothing to palliate his guilt in these, and therefore sought to pass them over in silence, without making any mention of them.</p>
            <p>The thing which Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> did next except at, is the relation given by Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> touching his intention to buy a Mannor of me, which lay neer him, and this Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> in his Examination before the Committee of Parliament sets forth <hi>was told unto him by Sir</hi> Edward Bainton, who did acquaint him, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Ashe <hi>was he that would have bought the Mannor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:119494-01:29"/>Here Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> puts in a <hi>Note,</hi> and would perswade the Reader to beleeve that I had invented this story, and published it at the High Court of Justice, which coming to Sir <hi>Edward Baintons</hi> hearing, he told it Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> who now makes use of it to justifie what he had written, whereas if Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> his passion had not deprived him of his judgement, he would have easily observed, that Sir <hi>Edward Bainton</hi> gave a relation to Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> not of a thing which he had heard after my Trial at the High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but of a matter treated with him before I fell into my troubles, for the relation he made was, That a Gentleman (<hi>whom he declared to be Mr.</hi> Ashe) would have bought a Mannor of me, wherein he had some interest, and he had offered, That if I would sell my part, he also would sell his, for which Sir <hi>Edward Bainton</hi> after said that hee was <hi>sorry,</hi> as conceiving it <hi>to be the original of all my troubles</hi>; so as you see Sir <hi>Edward Bainton</hi> declares that Proposition to have been made unto him before I was refused to be admitted to Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or else it could not have been <hi>the original of all my troubles,</hi> and consequently, it could not be a thing which he had heard only after my Trial, as Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> would (without any ground but his own <hi>impudence</hi>) perswade the Reader.</p>
            <p>In the last place it is observed by Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> that what Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Irby</hi> hath called a <hi>Mannor,</hi> and said, it lay neer him, I call a <hi>Farm,</hi> and lay in <hi>Abury,</hi> about <hi>sixteen miles</hi> (as he allegeth) from his dwelling, and thereupon (according to his <hi>breeding</hi> and <hi>discretion</hi>) he blames Sir <hi>Anthony Irby'</hi>s memory, which he conceives must here have failed him.</p>
            <p>I shall desire the Reader to observe, that Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> doth here make a relation of what was told him in discourse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must judge of it according to the usual way of speaking, and not to the construction of the Law. I have already shewed, that Farm at <hi>Abury</hi> cost me about 9000 l. and certainly whether it were a <hi>Mannor,</hi> or a <hi>Farm,</hi> it was notwithstanding such a proportion of land as is in usual discourse stiled by the appellation of a Mannor, and it is no way considerable, as to the matter, whether it were the one, or the other: And although we shall admit that Land to lye <hi>sixteen miles</hi> from his dwelling in the Country, yet certainly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common way of speaking, he must be said to be a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to it; so as in these Exceptions, it appears, That Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> hath declared only his own <hi>want of Civility</hi> towards Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> and his <hi>indiscretion</hi> in urging things so weak and senseless, to avoid his testimony.</p>
            <p>As for the Certificate of Sir <hi>David Watkings,</hi> he urgeth no new thing against it, only to shew his wit, without any part of his judgement, he doth suppose, that in regard it was in the heat of Summer, when I first came to Goldsmiths-hall, he being an old Gentleman, might then be nodding, or that his memory through age doth fail him, it being neer eight yeers since these transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119494-01:29"/>
were at Goldsmiths-Hall. This surely is an ending extremely suitable to all the other parts of that his Pamphlet, which being begun through <hi>malice</hi> unto me, and continued with great <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>falsehood,</hi> could not more properly conclude then with a <hi>scoff at old age,</hi> declared venerable by the opinion of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how fierce and barbarous soever; Promised by God, as a Reward to those that shall observe his Law, in giving due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Parents; Which Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> enjoyes, with health, strength convenient, and a perfect sense and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as a blessing sent him by God, the plentiful bestower of all good gifts; whilst Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> (perhaps for a punishment of this, and of his other crimes) is subject to those pains, sickness, and diseases, <hi>now in the vigor of his age,</hi> from which Sir <hi>David Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, notwithstanding his great years,</hi> is still exempted.</p>
            <p>I am now at the end of Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> his Pamphlet,<note place="margin">The Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> his Report, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> where he takes notice, that it might be expected he should give answer to that wherewith I seem to charge him in my <hi>Remonstrance, viz.</hi> That the Report made by Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of my behavior before the Committee at Goldsmiths-Hall, was no other then what he had received from Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi>; which I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from this, because the Report which Mr <hi>Stephens</hi> made to the Parliament is the same with Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> his Testimony given at the High Court of Justice, and Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> by way of answer, doth with his usual confidence deny it, affirming, that Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> Reported nothing to the Parliament, touching my ill behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, but what <hi>he heard from my own mouth,</hi> which was so much as moved him to make that cloze to his Report, I before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz. That if the Parliament did not make Sir</hi> John Stawell <hi>a Traytor, Sir</hi> John Stawell <hi>had made them Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> might have informed the Reader <hi>truly,</hi> and let him have known the reason, why I gathered Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Instructions from Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> for making his Report, was not onely by the testimony of Mr. <hi>Ashe under his hand,</hi> agreeing with the Report, but also more especially by the Deposition of Mr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> taken in the High Court of Justice,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> his examination in the High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, 18. of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1650.</note> wherein he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, he was not present when I first appeared before the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee at Goldsmiths-hall, and consequently he could not report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which was transacted in his absence, but by order of the Committee, or by the relation of some other, who did inform him, whom I collected to be Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> because his Deposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in substance with the Report of Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon what Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> (<hi>though falsly</hi>) affirmes to have been the opinion of the Committee at my first appearance before them, when I tendred my Petition, there being no such thing at all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or spoken by the Committee at my last coming before them, when Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> was in the chair; which appears plainly, if we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119494-01:30"/>
consider in the first place, What the Report was according unto Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> his Testimony, before recited, which saith, that Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> in his Report, informed the House, that the opinion of the Committee was, <hi>I had slighted and contemned the Authority of the present Parliament, and forfeited their mercy contained in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of</hi> Exeter.</p>
            <p>Now it is evident, that Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> had no direction from the Committee, at his being there, to report that unto the House, as their opinion, by the <hi>Order before recited,</hi> which was no more, but that he should report unto the House <hi>my refusing the Negative Oath and Covenant, my committal for it, my carriage, and my desire for an allowance of maintenance</hi>; But they declared no opinion at all touching my <hi>carriage,</hi> nor did ever put it to the Question. So as I must now leave it to the Readers judgement, whether of us two speaks truth, and whether this be an idle aspersion (as <hi>the worthy Gentleman</hi> is pleased to stile it.) Either Mr. <hi>Stephens, who was not present the first day of my appearance</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> and himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) and consequently could not know what was then spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but as he was informed, must have his Instructions from the Committee, or from Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> the Chair-man: But from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee he had no such Instructions to report, <hi>That Sir</hi> John Stawel <hi>had sleighted and contemned the Authority of the present Parliament, and forfeited their mercy contained in the Articles of</hi> Exeter, as appears by their Order, and from thence to infer, <hi>That if the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament did not make Sir</hi> John Stawel <hi>a Traytor, Sir</hi> John Stawel <hi>had made them Traytors.</hi> Therefore this must needs proceed from Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> who (as it seems by what is said before) did put his own words into Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> his mouth, or otherwise Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> must have spoken what he did, without any ground or authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; And this I suppose Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> will be very unwilling to acknowledge of his good friend, who hath so faithfully served him, to my ruin and destruction.</p>
            <p>Reader, Here I conclude this <hi>Vindication of my self, and my Remonstrance,</hi> against that false and <hi>scurrillous Pamphlet,</hi> published by Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashe,</hi> to justifie himself, and asperse me.</p>
            <p>I have most clearly proved, that all his actings in my business have proceeded out of <hi>malice, self-interest, perfidiousness towards me,</hi> and <hi>breach of Trust towards the publique.</hi> That all his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in his Pamphlet, published for his excuse, are full of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi> and <hi>falsehood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not take much pains to justifie my self, or trouble the Reader with that <hi>Quaere</hi> which he hath frivolously inserted in the Margent of his Pamphlet, as though I had got Lands from M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi>. <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi> by a cheat, but give this short Answer.</p>
            <p>Either my Wife had a power to dispose of her Fathers Estate, or she had not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:119494-01:30"/>
               <hi>If she had,</hi> What wrong could it be to M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi>. <hi>Basset</hi> for her Mother to dispose of what was properly her own?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If not,</hi> Then surely, what my Wife hath done, is a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi>. <hi>Basset,</hi> who hath received 3000 l. above twenty years since, as a portion from me, her Right (if any) being still preserved.</p>
            <p>But this is onely the <hi>foul mouth</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> who hath abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all regard of <hi>Modesty</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> that he might fix some stain upon me; Yet I forbear to follow my just Resentments, in decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his falsehoods, and shall (notwithstanding the high provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he hath given me) wish him a due sense of his most <hi>wicked practises,</hi> and a <hi>sincere repentance</hi> for them.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note>WHereas Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> hath exhibited his Petition into this Court, thereby (amongst other things) setting forth, That he is comprized in the Articles made upon the surrender of the City and Garrison of <hi>Exeter,</hi> bearing date the eighth of <hi>April,</hi> 1646. and afterwards confirmed by Parliament; By the twelfth of which said Articles it was agreed, That no person therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized should be questioned or accountable for any act past by them done, or any other done by their procurement, relating unto the unhappy Differences betwixt the late King and the Parliament, they submitting themselves to reasonable and moderate Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their Estates, which the then General Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was really to endeavor with the Parliament, that it should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed two years value of any mans real Estate respectively, and for personal, according to the ordinary Rules, not exceeding the proportion aforesaid: Which Composition being made, they should have Indempnity for their persons, and injoy their Estates, and all other Immunities, without payment of fifth or twentieth part, or any other Taxes or Impositions, except what should hereafter be charged upon them in common with other Subjects, by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament. And by the 21 Article it was further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, That no Oath, Covenant, Protestation, or Subscription relating thereunto, shall be imposed upon any person whatsoever comprized within the said Articles, but onely such as should bind all persons aforesaid, not to bear Arms against the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> nor wilfully do any act prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to their Affairs, whilst they remain in their Quarters. That he had a Certificate under the Hand and Seal of the then General, dated the 14. of <hi>April</hi> 1646. signifying, that he was to have the benefit of the said Articles. That the 15. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1646. he came to <hi>London</hi> to make his Composition, and according to an Order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the second of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1646. and within the time therby limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, undertook by a subscription under his hand, not to bear Arms against the Parliament, according to the intention of the said Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and 21 Article. And upon the 24. of the same <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1646. he preferred his Petition in person to the Committee at <hi>Goldsmiths-hall</hi> for compounding with Delinquents, desiring to compound according to the said Articles; But was not admitted, because he refused to take the Negative Oath and Covenant: And was the 13 of <hi>August,</hi> 1646. for such his refusal onely, committed first to <hi>Ely</hi>-House, afterwards by Order of the then House of Commons,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119494-01:33"/>
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> for High-Treason, in levying war against the Parliament, where he continued almost four years, and in that time was several times Indicted for Treason, and twice arraigned for his life at the then Kings Bench Bar: And that Judgements are obtained against him in personal Actions for seven thousand pounds in Damages; And all this for acts relating to the Differences between the late King and the Parliament, and before the Date of the said Articles. That in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1650. he was by Order of the High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice removed from <hi>Newgate</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there kept in close custody; and the seventeenth of <hi>December,</hi> 1650. and divers days after, tried for his life before the said High Court, who after many daies trial, examination of Witnesses, and strict inquiry into his actions, and the performance of the Articles on his part, did not proceed to sentence, but certified their proceedings to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; a copy of which Certificate was annexed to this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That ever since the said Trial he was a prisoner, and from the Date of the said Articles his Estate sequestred, by which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Debts, and felling his Woods and Timber, he hath lost near Thirty thousand pounds in his Estate, besides his imprisonment, and hazard of his life. That his Estate, by an Act of the 16 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1651. is (amongst others) declared for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited for Treason, and hath been since sold accordingly. That neither he, nor his Sons, or Servants, have ingaged against the Parliament in any act of hostility since the said Articles, nor hath he lost the benefit thereof, by any default of his; and therefore prays, That the said Certificate of the High Court of Justice may be considered, and the liberty of his person, and the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Estate, may be granted to him, discharged of such Judgements, Executions, Sales and Incumbrances, as are contrary to the meaning of the said Articles, and free from Composition, in regard the profits of his Estate for seven years have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the use of the Commonwealth. Unto which Petition several Pleas and Demurrers were put in, by Mr. Attorny Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, on the behalf of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Council for the Trustees for sale of Estates forfeited for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, on the behalf of the same Trustees; the effect whereof was, It appearing that the Parliament had interposed in the case of the Petitioner, both in respect of his imprisonment, and in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tryals for his life, and the selling of his Estate, as by them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be confiscated for Treason; Therefore, that as to his Imprisonment, and possession of his Estate, the Court could not take cognizance of the complaint, or examine or give any relief thereupon, as by the said Pleas and Demurrers, reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto being had, may more at large appear: Which Petition, Pleas, and Demurrers coming regularly to hearing before this Court, after long debate and mature deliberation had of and upon the same, this Court upon the 31. of <hi>December</hi> last past, declared their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119494-01:34"/>
opinion; That the said Pleas and Demurrers (which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent admitted the state of the Fact to be such as is set forth in the said Petition) did not contain in themselves sufficient matter to preclude this Court from proceeding upon the said Petition, and did therefore resolve and adjudge the same to be over-ruled, and set aside; and appointed the Solicitor for the State, attending the Court, to acquaint the Councel for the Commonwealth, and the said Trustees, with this Resolution, to the end they might set forth such other cause as they had to alledge (if there were any) on the States behalf, by way of Plea, or Answer to the said Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition: And the Court also, at the prayer of the Petitioner, issued forth summons to such persons as were by the Petitioner named Defendants, and certified by the Trustees aforesaid to have been Purchasers of the Lands and Estate of the Petitioner, to plead or answer to the Complaint of the said Petitioner. Hereupon the Councel for the Commonwealth put in an Answer, wherein they say, they know not that the Petitioner was comprized in Articles, nor that he was in the City of <hi>Exeter</hi> at the surrender, nor an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant there seven Months before the said Articles; and that if he were comprized, he knew not that the said Petitioner did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto, or make Composition for his Estate, acording to the true meaning of the said Articles, and as he ought to have done; and avers, that the Petitioner had not performed such of the said Articles as on his part were to be performed, but had wilfully broken and infringed the same. That he hath been ingaged in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counsels since the said Articles, against the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted other acts since the Articles, whereby he hath forfeited the benefit of the same Articles, through his own default: And by way of Answer, further also sets forth the same matters of Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly insisted upon in his said Plea and Demurrer, whereupon this Court had formerly delivered their Judgements as aforesaid. The said Trustees also put in their Answer, and say, That by the said Act of the 16. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1651. the Petitioners Estate was setled in them upon Trust, to convey the same as the said Act directed; and that in pursuance thereof they have sold to several persons all the said Estate, and do believe that a great part of the purchase-Mony is paid; and claim no other interest in the said Estate, than as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons intrusted as aforesaid; neither know, nor are concerned, why the <hi>Parliament</hi> have enacted the Petitioners Estate to be sold.</p>
                        <p>Several persons, named Defendants by the said Petitioner, did also appear, and put in Answers to the said Petition: In particular <hi>Matthew Coker of Lincolns-Inne,</hi> Gent. saith, That he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the said Trustees part of the Mannor of <hi>Priestley,</hi> being parcel of the Lands of the said Petitioner, and hopes to have back his mony and charges before he surrender: and then he sayes he shall be alwayes ready to do the same. <hi>Iohn War</hi> and <hi>Iohn Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radale</hi> say, That they have joyntly contracted with the said Trustees
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119494-01:34"/>
for the Demeasnes of <hi>Bewley</hi> in the County of <hi>Somerset,</hi> part of the estate of the said Petitioner. That how far the Petitioner is concerned in the pretended breach of the Articles of <hi>Exon,</hi> concerns not them to look at, the Parliament having, as they conceive, sufficiently weighed and determined the interest of the said Petitioner in the said Articles before they exposed his Lands to sale. <hi>Nicholas Battely, Iohn Farwell, Edward Bushell,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gorges,</hi> by their several Answers severally say, That they have contracted for the Lands respectively mentioned in the subscription of the Petitioner to the Order of this Court of Summons of the eighth of <hi>December</hi> last, with those who they conceive had authority to do the same; and each of them freely offers to submit to what Authority shall do therein. Unto which Answers of the Councel for the Commonwealth, and the said Trustees, and of the said other Defendants, the Petitioner Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> replied, avering the truth of his said Petition; and the cause being at perfect issue, Witnesses were examined, and their Depositions published, and by the consent both of Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General, and of the Councel for the Petitioner, the whole evidence taken before the late High Court of Justice, upon the Trial of the said Petitioner before them, was agreed to be made use of by either party at the hearing of the cause. The Court ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving also received the Answer of the present Commissioners for compounding, &amp;c. sitting at Habberdashers-Hall, <hi>London,</hi> certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, That they have no further matter against the Petitioner, than what hath been already signified to the said High Court upon his Trial, by vertue of their Order in that behalf, did appoint this day for the hearing of the whole cause. Now upon full hearing of Mr. <hi>Latch,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Amhurst,</hi> on the behalf of the said Petitioner, and of Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Attorney <hi>Hall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hurst,</hi> on behalf of the Commonwealth, together with Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> on the behalf of the said Trustees; and upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said Answers of the said other Defendants, purchasers of part of the Petitioners said Estate, they, nor any of them appearing, nor any for them, although due notice had been given unto each of them of the time appointed for the hearing of this cause (whereof Oath is made) the Court proceeded therein; and upon the hearing of the Evidences and Witnesses, produced on the behalf of the said Petitioner, and of the Commonwealth, and consideration had of what stands admitted and proved before this Court; they do find, and are cleerly of opinion, That Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel</hi> is within the Articles of <hi>Exeter</hi> confirmed by <hi>Parliament</hi>; by which no persons therein comprized, and submitting to reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Composition for their Estates, are to be accountable or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned for any act past by them done, relating unto the unhappy Differences between the late King, and the <hi>Parliament</hi>; That the Petitioner personally appeared before the Committee of the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and subscribed according to an Order in <hi>Parliament</hi> of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119494-01:35"/>
second of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1646. not to bear Arms against the <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor wilfully do any act prejudicial to their affairs, whilst he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in their quarters; which we find to be agreeable to the 21. of the said Articles. That he also personally appeared the 24. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1646. being within four months after the said Articles, and presented a Petition to the Committee of <hi>Goldsmiths-Hall</hi> for Compositions, mentioning therein his Estate to be sequestred, and humbly praying they would please to admit him to Composition, according to the said Articles, and the then Generals Certificate, rendering him capable of that agreement, but his said Petition was rejected. That Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel'</hi>s tender of that Petition in the manner proved before this Court, was a submission to Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition according to the said Articles of <hi>Exeter.</hi> That he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Warrant of the said Committee of the 13. of <hi>August,</hi> 1646. committed to <hi>Ely-house,</hi> for refusing to take the Negative Oath and Covenant, injoyned by the Ordinances of Parliament of the fifth of <hi>April,</hi> 1645. and first of <hi>November,</hi> 1645. That since that Commitment he hath been continued prisoner in several Gaols, and during that restraint, hath been several times indicted, and brought in question for his life, for acts relating to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Differences, supposed by him to be done before the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said Articles. That it appeareth not to this Court, that he hath by any act or default of his, lost, or forfeited the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his said Articles, which we find to be approved by the then House of Commons the sixth of <hi>May,</hi> 1646. and by both Houses of Parliament the fourth of <hi>Novem.</hi> 1647. who Ordered that Approbation of theirs to be published, and all Committees, Judges, Officers, and other persons concerned, to take notice thereof, and observe the same, any Orders or Ordinances to the contrary notwithstanding. That since his said submitting to compound, the profits received forth of his Estate being ever since until the late sale under Sequestration, and the Damages thereby by him sustained, appear to amount to above 25000 l. That by the Trustees Answer in this case, it appears they have sold all his Estate, by reason of the Act for Sale wherein he is included: And the Defendants, <hi>Matthew Coker, Iohn Warr, Iohn Borradale, Edward Bushel, Iohn Farwel, Nicholas Batteley,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gorges,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they have bought of them the said Trustees several parcels of the said Estate. That the said Petitioner Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel,</hi> being tried for his life before the late High Court of Justice sitting in the years 1650, and 1651. that Court finding him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the said Articles, and that he had submitted to Composition, thought not fit to proceed to sentence, but to certifie his Case to the Parliament: Upon which Articles this Court finds not any Judgement to be since given, but discern themselves impowred, authorized, and required by Parliament, to give relief to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons wronged through breach of Articles, in such sort as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119494-01:35"/>
by the Acts made in that behalf. All which this Court having taken into their serious consideration, and how far the Faith of the <hi>Army,</hi> and Honor and Justice of the Parliament and Nation are concerned in this, and the like cases, that right be done, and no violation of Articles permitted, after many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and mature deliberation had thereupon; and being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in their judgements and consciences, that the Petitioner Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> is fully capable of the Relief intended to persons within Articles, by the Acts directing and authorizing the same, and constituting this Court; Do in order thereto, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the power and trust to them committed in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <hi>Resolve, Declare, and Adjudge,</hi> That the Petitioner Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> hath good right, and by his said Articles ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to compound for his whole Estate, real and personal, according to the tenor of the same Articles, notwithstanding any the Settlements, Sales, or Contracts before-mentioned, at such rates, and in such manner, as others comprized within the said Articles have done; and the Commissioners for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding with Delinquents, are hereby inabled, authorized, and required, to permit the said Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> to compound for his whole Estate, as aforesaid: And in respect of those great Losses and extreme Damages which the said Petitioner hath sustained by the Sequestration and Detention of his Estate, and the profits received out of the same for above seven years last past, and by the felling of his Woods and Timber, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for want of being admitted to a timely Composition; This Court doth order and direct, That the said Commissioners for compounding do cause an exact account to be made of the Rents, Issues, and profits, received for, or out of the Petitioners Estate, since he first submitted to Composition, and was not admitted thereunto, and do recommend to their consideration the proofs thereof already taken in this Cause, Copies whereof, attested by the Register of this Court, are for that purpose to be presented to them: And if the said Commissioners shall find the same to amount unto, or exceed the Fine or Composition which the said Petitioner ought to pay, according to the rates prescribed, and allowed by the said Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> That then the same be allowed, accepted, and taken in lieu, and full satisfaction of such Fine or Composition so imposed upon, or to be satisfied by the said Petitioner Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell,</hi> according to his Articles; otherwise the defect (if any happen to be) is to be supplied by him the said Petitioner: And if any surplusage or overplus remain, the said Commissioners for compounding are hereby ordered and desired to certifie the same unto this Court. And upon such computation, and satisfaction made as aforesaid, the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners are hereby directed and authorized to give their Order for such acceptance of the Petitioners Fine and Composition,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119494-01:36"/>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:119494-01:37"/>NOw that they have in the proceedings of my Cause used all diligence,<note place="margin">The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proved to have been given by the Court in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of their Trust and Power.</note> and precaution needful and possible for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of the truth, appears by the Decree it self, wherein the same are briefly mentioned, and that in the relief they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by been honorably pleased to afford unto me, they have pursued the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> committed to them, appears by the said Acts of Parliament, before recited, <hi>whereby when there shall appear any right due to the party complaining by vertue of such Articles, and yet denied, and not duely performed, or any violation thereof made, they are in every such case authorized to give unto the party complaining, relief and redress, so far as in Iustice they ought to have by the said Articles, by restitution in</hi> specie <hi>of what hath been taken, recovered, or with-held, but without charging any further costs or dammages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Common-wealth, or against any person or persons against whom the Complaint is made</hi>: And it is thereby further Enacted, <hi>That their Certificates, Orders, and Awards, shall be binding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive unto, and be obeyed and observed by all Courts, Committees, Commissioners, Magistrates, Officers, person and persons, who are by the said Act injoyned and required to observe the same, any Law, Order, or Ordinance to the contrary in any wise notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the express words of this Act, whereby the said Commissioners have power, when it appears unto them that the party had right, to give redress so far as in Justice he ought to have by the said Articles; and by them I was to be admitted to my Composition <hi>at two years value,</hi> and upon making of it, to have <hi>Indempnity</hi> for my <hi>person,</hi> and injoy my <hi>Estate,</hi> and all other <hi>Immunities,</hi> which is a benefit my Articles allow unto me: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly they were by the words of the said Act impowred to decree this unto me, by <hi>restitution in specie,</hi> as they have honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and justly been pleased to do; Which Judgement and Order of theirs is by the Authority of the said Act <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>conclusive</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ought to be <hi>obeyed</hi> by all <hi>Courts, Commissioners, Committees,</hi> and <hi>persons,</hi> any <hi>Law, Order</hi> or <hi>Ordinance</hi> (and consequently, the said <hi>Act</hi> for sale of my Estate, which is <hi>a Law</hi>) to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>You see by this, that the said Commissioners for giving relief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Articles, have, in giving their Judgement and Decree before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, <hi>strictly</hi> pursued the Power and Trust committed to them by the said <hi>Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this will yet appear more plainly, if we consider what was the <hi>intention</hi> of the House, who where the makers of them, by those <hi>Provisoes</hi> before-mentioned, which were inserted <hi>into,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>out</hi> of the said several <hi>Acts,</hi> according to that general maxim,
<q>
                  <l>Exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis,</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:119494-01:37"/>And first to begin with the <hi>Provisoes</hi> inserted <hi>into</hi> the said Acts; By that which is added in the bottom of the said first Act; It is provided, that nothing therein contained should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued to controle an Order or Ordinance dated the 9. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1643. touching <hi>Lin Regis,</hi> and the Articles agreed to at the rendring thereof; But that the said Order or Ordinance should be as good and effectual in Law, as if that Act had not been made.</p>
            <p>Is it not clear by this Proviso, That the House conceived the said Commissioners had power to controle and make void that Ordinance (which had the same vigor as a Law, at least whilst the said Parliament was sitting) and therefore put in this Proviso to restrain their power in this particular? Thereby, according to the said Maxime, confirming it unto them in all other cases. Nay, is it not as clear, that by the latter words of that Proviso, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they do provide, <hi>That Ordinance, and the proceedings thereupon, should be as good and effectual in the Law, as if the Act had not been made,</hi> they did sufficiently declare their <hi>Intentions</hi> to be, That by the same Act, they did themselves <hi>revoke</hi> all Acts and Ordinances made to the prejudice of any persons that were comprised in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and the Commissioners by their Decrees were only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that remedy to the particular persons who were capable of the relief which was most honorably granted by the Parliament, unto all persons who had right unto it, by <hi>repealing all the Laws, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and Orders made to the contrary?</hi> Whereby it will then follow, that the Act made for sale of my Estate, the 16. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1651. is by the said Act of the 29 of <hi>September,</hi> 1652. <hi>repealed</hi> and <hi>void,</hi> as unto me, and in my Case.</p>
            <p>Is it not also plain by the last Proviso in the said Act of the 29. of <hi>September,</hi> which provideth, That where a question riseth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them upon Articles <hi>not confirmed</hi> by Parliament, the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners shall resort to the Parliament, for their Resolution, before they proceed therein, further than to stay proceedings at Law, or stop the sale of their Estates; That in all other cases where the Articles <hi>are confirmed</hi> by Parliament, the said Commissioners have power, not onely to stop the sale of their Estates, but also to <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> the sale of them, and award <hi>restitution in specie</hi> unto the party claiming relief upon the Articles, according to the <hi>express</hi> words of the Act? Especially considering the House <hi>rejected</hi> the said two Provisoes tendred to restain them in this particular Case, and did thereby sufficiently declare their <hi>intentions</hi> to be, that they should put that power in execution where they saw cause.</p>
            <p>It being therefore evident, that the Commissioners have in their proceedings and sentence given for me, pursued the Trust and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er committed to them by the Parliament, it must then follow of necessity, That Mr. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> by saying they <hi>are parties, and not Iudges; That their Orders and Certificates ought to have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119494-01:38"/>
or credit, that they mis-stated the Case, and have not been indifferent or equal in their proceedings,</hi> with other <hi>scandals</hi> therein mentioned, hath been mis-guided by his <hi>passion,</hi> and hath, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a <hi>Reason,</hi> published a <hi>false, malicious,</hi> and <hi>scandalous Libel</hi> against those Honorable and worthy persons, who are Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, trusted and imployed in this and other weighty Affairs, which are of great concernment to the publique, whose <hi>just, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,</hi> and <hi>indifferent proceedings</hi> he doth therein traduce, seeking petulantly <hi>for his own private interest,</hi> to weaken the authority of their proceedings, by the defaming of their persons.</p>
            <p>I pass over many of his Reasons, wherein he doth alledge onely those things that were in issue, and have been judged already in the High Court of Justice, and the Court of Articles, where I have proved them to be onely <hi>surmises</hi> and <hi>scandals</hi> cast upon me. But I esteem my self obliged to give an answer unto the <hi>slanders</hi> which he himself hath first invented, and now indeavors with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to fix upon me by those Reasons; Wherein he hath suggested, <hi>That I received from his Father more for a Lease of what he purchased, than the inheritance was worth; That he was totally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of my pretending to the benefit of Articles, though he requested me to give him notice and directions; That I have miserably and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally depopulated the whole parish of</hi> Cotheleston <hi>in</hi> Somerset, <hi>and by force, fraud, and terror expelled them, their Wives, Children and Families, to swim through their own tears to new plantations; That to restore me, would be to sacrifice unto my rage and revenge all the well-affected people of fifteen or sixteen great Mannors whom I would total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extirpate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These charges are very high and heinous in themselves, and therefore it would surely have been just and fitting, this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman should not have vented his <hi>spleen</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> in such a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique way against me, without producing some proof of what he hath so confidently written; But I intend not to return an Answer to him by a <hi>bare denial,</hi> but I shall desire the Reader to observe how little cause there was for him to publish this <hi>false invective,</hi> when he hath first perused the <hi>Certificate</hi> of two substantial, grave, and consciencious Gentlemen, Uncles to Mr. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> signed by them, and intended to be presented to the Committee of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but came a few days too late.</p>

                  <head>To the Honorable, the Committee appointed by Order of Parliament, in the case of Sir <hi>John Stawell,</hi>

                  <p>We whose names are here under written, Uncles to <hi>William Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of <hi>Edenborough</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> and Brothers to his deceased Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having seen a printed paper Intituled, <hi>Mr.</hi> Lawrences <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, together with Reasons thereunto annexed, why the Petitioners Purchase ought not to be questioned by Sir</hi> Iohn Stawell, do, at the request of Sir <hi>John Stawell,</hi> and in favor of truth, thus humbly certifie your Honors.</p>
                  <p>THat our Father was Tenant,<note place="margin">The Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> his Uncles:</note> and many years a Servant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sir <hi>Iohn Stawells</hi> Grand-father, who throughout all his time was never other than a kind and loving Master unto him, and did intrust him with the management of his Estate and Lands in <hi>Dorset.</hi> where he lived, and was a very great support unto him, being a Father of many children, and to whose Name and Posterity we cannot but pay all thankful acknowledgements; We do also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That we are not a little troubled at those mis-representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which our Nephew Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> hath made in the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Petition; having known Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell,</hi> that now is, from a Child, and how kind and friendly he hath been to our Name and kindred, who are many of us his Tenants, and have ever found him in an especial manner regardful of us. And in particular, I <hi>Robert Lawrence</hi> do testifie, that I was intrusted, with others, in the managing of Sir <hi>Iohn Stawells</hi> Estate divers years, during his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, by the power of his Grand-fathers Will, and since was his Servant and Officer, untill his Estate first fell under Sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And whereas it is by the Petition suggested, That my Brother, the Petitioners Father, gave far more for an Estate by Lease unto Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell,</hi> than the whole Inheritance is worth; The Petitioner in those days was young, and it seems not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the truth of things: But I well remember that the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners Father did purchase of one <hi>Dunning,</hi> part of a Farm cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Wraxal</hi> Farm, being the Inheritance of Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell,</hi> which the said <hi>Dunning</hi> held for certain years, determinable upon his own life, being then, I beleeve, about forty years of age, for which he paid 300<hi>l.</hi> And the same is now valued and esteemed to be worth three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and ten pounds by the year above the Rent; and did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few years after purchase of one Mr. <hi>Anthony Stawell</hi> a Farm called <hi>Rampisham</hi> Park, adjoyning to the aforesaid Farm called <hi>Wraxal</hi> Farm, wherein the said <hi>Anthony Stawell</hi> had then an Estate for nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine yeers, determinable upon three lives, which were then all living (being the Inheritance also of the said Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi>) which Farm is esteemed to be worth by the year two hundred and twenty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119494-01:39"/>
pounds at the least besides the rent, for which he paid Thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; and being so settled in the said two Farms, after Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> came to the age of one and twenty years (for he was in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when these bargains were made) the said Petitioners Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married, and having a Wife and Children, became an earnest Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto the said Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel,</hi> to exchange those Estates by which he held those two Farms, and to settle them upon his own lives, concerning which there were divers parlies between them, and my self did indeavor to gain it for him, and the Bargain was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that for Seven hundred pounds, and surrendring the former Estates, he should have both Farms granted unto him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Lease for Ninety nine years, if three lives named by him should live so long, which was performed accordingly; whereas I beleeve he would have given Eight hundred pounds for it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he would have left it; and by this Bargain the Lease then granted is enjoyed by the Petitioner.<note place="margin">This was no hard bargain.</note> And so upon the whole matter it cost the Petitioners Father, but Two thousand three hundred pounds to have this Estate of near Three hundred pounds by the year thus settled. And as touching Depopulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> in the parish of <hi>Cothelestone,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the aforesaid Petition; I well know (having been the most part of my time a near neighbour unto that place) that Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> did give full satisfaction to all such Tenants whose Estates he redeemed, being for the inlargement principally of his Courts, Orchards, and Gardens about his House, and for such as wanted houses, and had no other dwellings, he either bought or gave them houses in other places to their full content, who were better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with their Bargains, and such Exchanges, then with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Estates; And that the Depopulations complained of, may the better be understood, pray give me leave to inform you, that there were but five small Tenements which were so compounded for, worth about thirty pounds by the year in the whole, and there are yet remaining in the said Parish ten several Tenements and Cottages, which are injoyed by estates by him granted, which are worth above one hundred pounds by the year, and the Demeasns of <hi>Cothelestone</hi> lying within that Parish were never known to be less worth then Two hundred and seventy pounds by the year, and with those additions complained of, they are not now worth (as is conceived) above three hundred pounds by the year, as they are annexed to Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> principal House. Besides this, there hath been four hundred Acres of land by estimation, divided into thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Acre Tenements by Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell,</hi> and are annexed unto the Mannor of <hi>Cothelestone,</hi> upon many of which Tenements, houses are built, and Familes do live, which in former times had not a house standing upon it, and inlargeth that Mannor much more than it was before.</p>
                  <p>And whereas in the said Petition it is thus expressed, that it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119494-01:39"/>
would be a very great cruelty and injustice, by not making good publick Sales, to sacrifise to his Rage and Revenge all the well-affected people of fifteen or sixteen great Mannors: I cannot conceive any reason of this expression; For Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> Tenants are so well affected unto him, as I have not heard (five only excepted, whereof the Petitioner is one) that any have bought a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in his Lands, then what hath been of his own granting; and I suppose, it will be conceived a great mercy unto them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to him, who hath ever been a good Land-lord unto them, and stands obliged to the making good of their former Estates.</p>
                  <p>And I <hi>Iohn Lawrence</hi> do likewise say to that part of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that avers, That the Petitioner was totally ignorant of the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> or any pretence of the said Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> to the same, he is very much mistaken, for that I my self told the Petitioner, That Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell</hi> had right to the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and that the truth thereof was known to most men by the publick Trial he had received for his life at the High Court of Justice, where his Articles were pleaded, allowed, and his life thereupon preserved, and did advise him not to proceed further in his Purchase intended.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we the Petitioners Uncles, do humbly conceive, That his Petition in many things wanteth a good foundation, That it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth no right to the memory of his deceased Father, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth great unthankfulness unto <hi>Sir John Stawell,</hi> who hath been alwayes kind to our Name and Kindred.</p>

And what opinion soever he hath of my Right and Title; Truly, I would not give consent, that any Friend of mine <hi>imployed by me,</hi> should put so mean a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> of the Parliament, Armies, and the whole Nation <hi>ingaged</hi> for the performance of my Articles, as to become Purchasers of any part thereof at <hi>ten years</hi> Purchase, considering, That I am to be restored unto it upon the payment of <hi>two years</hi> value by my Articles: The performance whereof Mr. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> hath surely no just reason to oppose, with so much <hi>Passion, Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> as he hath done, that he might keep unto himself a part of my Inheritance; Unless he hath some wayes abused the Commonwealth in the said Purchase, and is therefore loath to receive a satisfaction in value from them, which could be no prejudice at all unto him, if he hath given a full consideration for the same.</p>

               <note place="margin">The objection touching the Act of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>The last thing, and which is most insisted on by Mr. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> is, the Act of the 13. of <hi>October,</hi> 1653. made by the Little Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for confirming and establishing the sales made of my estate, or goods, in the possession of the Purchasers: And for the better strengthing of it, many reasons are therein offered of <hi>profit</hi> to the State, and of <hi>convenience</hi> unto the Purchasers, why the Purchase made by the Petitioner, and others, of my Estate, should not be questioned: Unto all which I give this Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Act before mentioned is meerly void in it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And secondly,</hi> The same is Repealed and Declared absolutely void by the Fortieth Article of the present Government: Of both which points, I shall speak briefly as they lye in order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is a Case adjudged, and reported by the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. <hi>Cook</hi> 8. Rep. Dr. <hi>Bonhams</hi> Case.</note> That where an Act of Parliament is contrary to common Righr and Justice, The Common Law doth in that Case controle an Act, and makes it void; whereof many examples are there mentioned. Now this Act made by the Parliament (a body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick) who by the confirming of my Articles, were parties to them, is contrary to <hi>common Right</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> because by confirming the sale of my Estate unto the Purchasers (which according to the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Parliament were in Honor and Justice
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119494-01:40"/>
ingaged to restore unto mee upon a Composition) They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all Articles, whose very Essence and Being consists in this, That they are binding, and conclusive to both parties, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee avoided, but by a mutual consent, and consequently they have therein opposed <hi>Common Right,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> upon which the mutual bond of Articles is grounded, whereby their Act, according to the said Judgement, reported by my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> is meerly void.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And secondly,</hi> The same is void, because the right of Articles is a Contract grounded upon the Law of Nations, which being a Law <hi>Paramount</hi> and <hi>Superior</hi> to that of any particular Country or Nation, controles all Laws, and Ordinances made in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to it.</p>
            <p>But if the said Act bee not for these Reasons void in it self (as I do in some cleerness conceive it is) Yet nothwithstanding it is <hi>absolutely void by the fortieth Article of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; Whereby it is Provided and Declared, <hi>That the Articles given to, or made with the Enemy, and afterwards confirmed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, shall be performed, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

And the said Commissioners do also insist upon an Ordinance made by your Highness and Council the <hi>10.</hi> of <hi>February, 1653.</hi> by which they say they are not impowred to compound with any Delinquents, save onely with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons named in the last additional Act for sale, and with such Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents as shall discover any part of their Estates not being under Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Upon serious consideration and debate whereof, this Court being satisfied that by the Fortieth Article of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment produced in Court, confirming Articles of War made with,

            <p>I will conclude this Point with one example drawn from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is the best Authority, and ought to be the guide of all our actions.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Josh chap. 9.</note>WE read in <hi>Ioshua,</hi> That God himself by his Decree (infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more just and binding, than any Act of Parliament) had appointed all those Nations who dwelt within the <hi>Land of Promise</hi> to be destroyed root and branch, and given their Lands unto the <hi>Israelites; Ioshua</hi> was sent by God, to put this his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in execution, with an Army; The <hi>Gibeonites</hi> (who were one of those Nations that were to be extirpated) sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and by a cunning slight (which in the Scripture is expressed at large) deceived <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and procured Articles by surprize from him, for preservation of their lives, which <hi>Saul</hi> after some hundreds of years infringed, by killing many of them for the accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Israelites</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.</note> God was pleased himself to take in hand their Quarrell, and punished the whole Land with a great Famine for that offence, which did not cease untill that breach was expiated by the execution of seven male persons of his Family.</p>
            <p>Here we are taught by a divine example, how strictly hee requires from us the due performance of all Articles, since God himself (who is above all Laws) was well contented to dispense with his immediate command, rather than to permit a violation of them, that we might thereby know by his proceedings, that <hi>the breach of Articles</hi> is a foul crime, which cannot be <hi>advised</hi> without <hi>impiety,</hi> nor <hi>put in execution</hi> without <hi>punishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THese great and weighty considerations of <hi>Honor, Publique Faith,</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> (whereof perhaps the <hi>narrow heart</hi> of Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> is not capable) induced the Noble Army in their Petition to the late Parliament of <hi>August</hi> 12. 1652. to make it one of the weighty Clauses of their Request, <hi>That the Articles of War made unto the Enemy, might be made good according to the intent of them</hi>; Which Petition by order of the Council of War was presented by six Honorable Officers of the Army, and had a very favorable and gracious Answer. And upon these motives it was that the late Parliament was pleased to pass those Acts, whereby <hi>the Court of Articles was constituted and impowred to give relief to all that should be damnified, or molested, contrary to Articles,</hi> who in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, have by their <hi>just</hi> and <hi>honorable sentence</hi> adjudged that I should be admitted to Composition, and be restored to my estate, which hath been also since <hi>confirmed by the Fortieth Article of the present Government, and promised by his Highness, who hath obliged

It is by their two sentences, that I conceive my Innocency is eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced sufficiently to your Justice, and it is only from your Goodness, that I expect to reap the fruit of their Judgements, when you shall be gratiously pleased to impower the Commissioners sitting at <hi>Haberdashers-Hall,</hi> to receive me to Composition, which being denied unto me by the Committee at <hi>Goldsmiths-Hall,</hi> when I first tendered it, I am now, by Decree of the Court of Articles, inabled to make before them.</p>
            <p>The summe of my humble Petition to your Highness (now lying before your Councel) is, not that you would exercise a <hi>Legislative power</hi> in favour of me, by repealing the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for the sale of my Estate, or of that Act which after past for the confirming of the Purchasers Estates (in respect the first of them is already declared void by the solemn Judgement of the Court of Articles, and the objection touching the latter of them, is removed by their Certificate formerly presented to your Highness, <hi>grounded</hi> upon the Fortieth Article of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government, <hi>confirming</hi> Articles of War, made with, or granted to the Enemy, and afterwards <hi>confirmed by Parliament, any thing in that Writing,</hi> or <hi>otherwise,</hi> to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) but that you would be pleased by you <hi>Order or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> to Authorize those Commissioners to compound with me for a Fine now belonging to your Highness, by the form of Government, and to the making of which, I am to be received
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119494-01:44"/>
according to my Articles, and the Judgement given thereupon (to the strict observation of which, your Highness hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared your Honourable intentions, in taking a <hi>solemn Oath</hi> to observe that Instrument without violation, into which this Article is inserted) leaving me for further relief, to the said Court, according to your former Reference.</p>
            <p>Your Highness will in doing this, not only follow the bent of your own inclinations, but also exercise an act of highest charity and goodness, towards <hi>an oppressed miserable person</hi>: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, among those actions which our humanity is capable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, there can be none that carries in it self a stamp of the <hi>Divinity</hi> so perfect, as when an eminent person imployes the full extent of his whole power in relieving graciously the miseries of humane kind: How great and weighty soever your Highnesses occasions may be at present, I doubt not but some small time will be found out for this, when you shal consider how conformable this action wil be unto <hi>his goodness,</hi> who doth in a peculiar manner appropriate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himself the name of being <hi>God of the afflicted,</hi> and <hi>who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes to look down from his high Sanctuary upon the earth, That he may hear the mourning of the prisoner, and deliver the children ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, I shall with great assurance hope, that your Highness will not abandon me, and mine for ever in the shades of death, but imitate so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious an example,</hi> by giving an end to all our sufferings; That being declared capable of my Estate, by Iudgement of the Court of Articles, I may obtain the actual possession of it by the assistance of your Favour and Iustice.</p>

            <opener>SIR,</opener>
            <p>UNderstanding by you the other day, when I met with you accidentally in the Temple,<note place="margin">This Letter of Sir <hi>Anthony Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> and reply of Sir <hi>David Watkins,</hi> came not so timely unto me as to be inserted in a proper place.</note> that you had an intention shortly to publish something to vindicate your Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance against a Pamphlet written by Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashe,</hi> and finding that he hath also therein made me a co-partner with you in his displeasures; I shall acquaint you with an Answer to so much as concerns my self, and all men else if you think fit to publish it; Although I regard not much what such men as himself do either say or write in their own Cases; especially, having done such acts, which if he did not endeavor to make good by writing (which is too common now adayes) being the least he can do to <hi>boulster out his Cause,</hi> would undoubtedly <hi>lye very heavy upon his Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Pamphlet <hi>Entituled, An Answer of the Purchasers of the Lands late of Sir</hi> John Stawel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> page 53. and 54, is related the Testimony I gave to the <hi>Committee</hi> sitting in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> with my Answer to the cross Examinations, I think truly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>which I do avow to be truth, and will maintain to be so on any ground in the three Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which, in pag. 56. they are pleased to make some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations; <hi>First, That if Sir</hi> Anthony <hi>means the Calender time, he says true, for Sir</hi> John Stawel <hi>appearing first the sixth of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, <hi>came within the time limitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I do aver that Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel petitioned</hi> the Committee sitting at <hi>Goldsmiths-Hall,</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1646. <hi>and so his first coming was before the sixth of</hi> August, and so my Testimony is <hi>true, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I say, that he came within the time limitted by his Articles</hi>; Which Sir <hi>David Watkins also testifies,</hi> and streightens it to a <hi>lunary moneth,</hi> which I had no reason to do, being a thing so long passed, and might have slipt out of a better memory than mine; Neither doth Mr. <hi>Michael Herring,</hi> in his Examination, in pag. 38, and 39, affirm any thing to the contrary; so there is no <hi>Gens contra Gentem,</hi> as is <hi>falsely</hi> alleadged in pag. 56.</p>
            <p>But for the allegations in pag. 66. <hi>That Sir</hi> John Stawel <hi>did not appear untill the sixth of</hi> August, there lieth <hi>a foul treachery</hi> under that, <hi>which Mr.</hi> John Ashe <hi>can never wipe off,</hi> which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrates his early intentions <hi>to ruin you</hi>; And that was, in a <hi>Clandestine</hi> Order or Warrant (as I may justly call it) made <hi>the fourth of August,</hi> 1646. expressed in p. 26. of the same Book, which there saith in the body of that Order or Warrant, <hi>(Now forasmuch as you have neglected to make your appearance to the said Committee, or to any other Committee of Parliament, notwithstanding the time allowed by the Articles of</hi> Exon, <hi>upon which you pretend you come in, are expired:)</hi> Now consider, the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>falsehood</hi> of this <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Warrant</hi>; I do beleeve, few or none of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119494-01:45"/>
knew of it; I have spoken with several of them, since the publishing of the aforesaid Pamphlet, and they <hi>deny</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of it, and <hi>I protest so do I,</hi> best known to Sir <hi>Iohn Stawels great friend,</hi> and <hi>framed</hi> by him out of the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> he did bear to his <hi>old Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>False</hi> it must needs be; for how could it say, that <hi>Sir</hi> John Stawel <hi>had neglected to appear before this, or any other Committee,</hi> when Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel</hi> had <hi>appeared</hi> at, and <hi>petitioned</hi> to the <hi>same Committee the week before</hi>?</p>
            <p>And further, how could it <hi>truely</hi> say, that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the benefit of his Articles for not appearing before the fourth of</hi> August, when in the page 56. <hi>it is acknowledged, That the sixth of August,</hi> (which was two days after according to the <hi>Calender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>) was <hi>within the time of his Articles</hi>? I have heard this <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Warrant</hi> was like to have <hi>cost you dear</hi> at your <hi>Trial</hi>; But this was the <hi>Child</hi> of your <hi>loving Servants brain,</hi> the <hi>man</hi> who <hi>most favored you at the Committee,</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> the <hi>violentest man of all against you,</hi> knew nothing of it; And therefore <hi>again,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Irby disownes</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Warrant of the fourth of August,</hi> as not <hi>true,</hi> and so by this, Sir <hi>Anthony Irby the Commissioner,</hi> and Sir <hi>Anthony Irby the Witness,</hi> agrees very well, and full together, though <hi>most falsely otherwise related</hi> in page 56.</p>
            <p>And whereas in the same page afterwards, they say in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations upon Sir <hi>Anthony Irbyes Letter</hi> or <hi>Testimony,</hi> wherein is expressed, <hi>We gave him eight, or ten days, or a fortnights time, that by that time, the time given him by his Articles would be out, that we might deal with him the better</hi>; They charge Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> to be <hi>too severe in his Iustice,</hi> or rather <hi>unjust,</hi> neither can he be excused of casting <hi>snares</hi> in Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> way, to satisfie <hi>his passion</hi> (Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> being <hi>the violentest man</hi> of all against him) though to the <hi>breach</hi> of the <hi>Faith of the Army</hi> aud <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer to which, I say, <hi>First,</hi> It is onely their <hi>bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> that I was the <hi>violentest man</hi> against Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel,</hi> and no <hi>proof</hi> at all, and therefore my <hi>No,</hi> is as good as their <hi>Yea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why should that be imputed or charged upon <hi>me,</hi> more than upon the <hi>rest</hi> of the Committee? why might not I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel</hi> (having so good an Estate to compound for) might within that time submit to that they propounded, and so compound for his Estate, or in that time the House of Lords might pass the Articles of <hi>Exon,</hi> and so might without any scruple be admitted to Composition, without taking the Oath or Covenant, or the Negative Oath? But Sir <hi>Anthony Irby</hi> admireth, that Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> or any other should charge <hi>severity</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> upon him as aforesaid, that framed or consented to that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or <hi>Warrant</hi> (term it what you will) of <hi>the fourth of</hi> August, 1646. expressed in page 26. There you have an <hi>habemus reum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitentem,</hi> and Sir <hi>Anthony Irbies Testimony</hi> touching Sir <hi>Iohn
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119494-01:45"/>
Stawels carriage at the Committee,</hi> sufficiently <hi>confined</hi>; there you have him <hi>violating</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> and so <hi>mutato nomine de se narratur fabula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir, to Answer that which that <hi>honest Gentleman Mr. Iohn Ashe</hi> saith, in a book written, annexed to the former Book, p. 17. where his <hi>Iustice</hi> dealeth with me as formerly concerning that part of my Testimony wherein I mention what passed betwixt Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bainton</hi> and my self at Sir <hi>Abraham Williams</hi> his house; That I should call that a <hi>Mannor,</hi> which he saith is but a <hi>Farm</hi>; I confess I might be mistaken in that; for truely in our poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, you shall scarce meet with a <hi>Farm</hi> of near that value; and I dare say, many a considerable <hi>Mannor</hi> would be bought with that mony in our parts; for (if I be not mistaken) it cost 9 or 10000<hi>l.</hi> But <hi>the Ashe is grown so great now,</hi> as things of 9 or 10000<hi>l.</hi> are but <hi>Farmes</hi> with him; My <hi>gains</hi> have been such (after all my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) that I can shew no such <hi>Farms bought, or offered to be bought by me,</hi> though I have been as serviceable as he hath been.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> About a week or ten dayes after my Depositions were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before the Committee of Parliament, I was sent for to set my hand to what I had testified there; accordingly I did attend them, and was called in; and as soon as I came in, Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> made a Speech to the Committee (being one of them himself). and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them how well he <hi>affected</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel,</hi> and what <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and <hi>love</hi> there was betwixt them; That Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> called him <hi>Servant,</hi> and he Sir <hi>Iohn, Master,</hi> what <hi>care</hi> he had of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> when he came to <hi>London,</hi> and how that <hi>I</hi> was the <hi>onely bitter man</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel</hi> had <hi>at the Committee,</hi> with much more to the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>To which in brief I made answer (<hi>I am sure the Committee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent will affirm as much</hi>) That I came thither by their <hi>Order,</hi> to set my hand to my Depositions, and not to make a reply to Mr. <hi>Ashe,</hi> for it was but his <hi>Yea,</hi> and it would be my <hi>No</hi>; That I had not so forfeited my Credit with them or any body else, but that it stood as clear, and my words were to be beleeved as well as Mr. <hi>Ashes</hi>; That what I had <hi>testified</hi> before them was <hi>truth,</hi> which I would <hi>justifie</hi> by setting my <hi>hand</hi> to it, and if they had power to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, I would willingly take my <hi>Oath</hi> of it, or otherwise <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it upon any English ground</hi>; and thereupon I came and set my <hi>hand</hi> to my <hi>Depositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I was going away, Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> desired that he might aske me a Question or two, which the Committee gave leave unto.</p>
            <p>The first was, <hi>Whether I was not present at</hi> Goldsmiths-Hal <hi>the first and second time Sir</hi> John Stawel <hi>appeared there</hi>? I answered, <hi>I was,</hi> pag. 16.</p>
            <p>The second was, <hi>Whether the Committee did order Mr.</hi> Stephens <hi>to make a Report to the Parliament</hi>? I Answered, there was such an Order, but those words in his Pamphlet, p. 16. inserted in the body
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119494-01:46"/>
of this Question, in a Parenthesis, <hi>viz.</hi> (<hi>Taking offence at Sir</hi> John Stawells <hi>language and mis-behavior there</hi>) was no part of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> to me, but <hi>falsly</hi> put into his Book, as he entred the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the fourth of <hi>August,</hi> and done here with the same <hi>malice</hi> both to Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> his <hi>Master,</hi> and to me his <hi>Friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third <hi>Question</hi> was, <hi>Whether to the making of the Order for Mr.</hi> Stephens <hi>his Report, I did give my Vote in the affirmative</hi>?</p>
            <p>My <hi>Answer</hi> was, There was <hi>no negative,</hi> for <hi>in truth,</hi> there was <hi>no Question</hi> put; and that was the reason of my Answer.</p>
            <p>And wereas Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashe</hi> in pag. 16. saith, <hi>I might have written the whole Truth, for that I knew that the House of Lords had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Articles of</hi> Exon. Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> did <hi>then very well know</hi> that the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> for several weeks, if not for some months before, <hi>had approved of the aforesaid Articles,</hi> and <hi>that at that time the Committee wholly consisted of Commoners</hi> (the Lords not then being joyned with us, to my best remembrance.)</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashe</hi> had had so <hi>great a respect</hi> to his <hi>old Master,</hi> as he would have <hi>the world to beleeve,</hi> he might have <hi>proceeded</hi> in Sir <hi>Iohn Stawells Compositions; for the House, whereof he was a Member, could take no exceptions, they having approved of the Articles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> With as much shortness as I conld, I have made a true and faithful Relation and answer to such things as I judge material, for the rest I value not; My Credit not standing upon any mans say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but my own Actions. I rest,</p>

            <p>I Cannot but much admire that Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashe</hi> should be so sensible, and displeased at my <hi>just Certificate</hi> made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir <hi>Iohn Stawel</hi> Knight <hi>of the</hi> Bath, which I did out of my desire to promote that Common Justice which I owe to all men, not aiming at my own particular, nor intending thereby to lay my hand on Mr. <hi>Ashe</hi> his <hi>tender side,</hi> or <hi>to discover any design of his.</hi>
