            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEing called on in <hi>London</hi> to Preach, when I had no time to ſtudy, I was fain to preach ſome Sermons that I had preached in the Country a little before. This was one, which I preached at S. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> in the Church where my Reverend and faithful Brother in Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Richard Vines</hi> is Paſtor: when I came home, I was followed by ſuch importunities by Letters to Print the Sermon, that I have yielded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; though I know not fully the ground of their deſires. Seeing it muſt abroad, will the Lord but bleſs it to the cure of thy contempt of Chriſt and Grace, how comfortable may the occaſion prove to thee and me! It is the ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt and Salvation that undoes the World. Oh happy man, if thou ſcape but this ſin! Thouſands do ſplit their Souls on this Rock which they ſhould build them on! Look into the World, among rich and poor, high and low, young and old, and ſee whether it appear

not by the whole ſcope of their Converſations, that they ſet more by ſomething elſe than Christ? and for all the proclamations of his Grace in the Goſpel, and our common profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to be his Diſciples, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Glorious things that he hath promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in another World, whether it yet appear not by the deceitfulneſs of our ſervice, by our heartleſs endeavours to obtain his Kingdom, and by our buſie and delightful following of the World, that the moſt who are called Chriſtians do yet in their hearts make light of Chriſt? And if ſo, what wonder if they periſh by their contempt? Wilt thou but ſoberly peruſe this ſhort Diſcourſe, and conſider well as thou read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, of its truth and weight, till thy heart be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible what a ſin it is to make light of Chriſt and thy own Salvation, and till the Lord that bought thee be advanced in the eſtimation and affections of thy Soul, thou ſhalt hereby rejoyce, and fulfil the deſires of</p>

            <p>THE bleſſed Son of God, that thought it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to die for the World, but would himſelf alſo be the Preacher of Grace and Salvation, doth comprize in this Parable the ſum of his Goſpel. By the King that is here ſaid to make the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, is meant, God the Father, that ſent his Son into the World to cleanſe them from their ſins, and eſpouſe them to himſelf. By his Son, for whom the Marriage is made, is meant, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, who took to his God-head the nature of Man, that he might be capable of being their Redeemer when they had loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſin. By the Marriage, is meant, The Conjunction of Chriſt to the ſoul of Sinners, when he giveth up himſelf to them to be their Saviour, and they give up themſelves to him as his Redeemed Ones, to be ſaved and ruled by him; The perfection of which Marriage will be at the Day of Judgment, when the Conjunction between the whole Church and Chriſt ſhall be ſolemnized. The word here tranſlated <hi>Marriage,</hi> rather ſignifieth the <hi>Marriage-Feaſt;</hi> and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the World is invited by the Goſpel, to come in and partake of Chriſt and Salvation, which comprehendeth both Pardon, Juſtification, and Right to Salvation, and all other Priviledges of the Members of Chriſt. The <hi>Invitation,</hi> is God's offer of Chriſt and Salvation in the Goſpel; The Servants that invite them, are the Preachers of the Goſpel who are ſent forth by God to that end; The preparation for the feaſt there mentioned, is, The ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, and the enacting of a Law of Grace, and opening a way for revolting Sinners to return to God. There is mention of ſending ſecond Meſſengers, becauſe God uſeth not to take the firſt denyal, but to exerciſe his patience till Sinners are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. The firſt Perſons invited are the <hi>Jews;</hi> upon their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66241:4"/>
obſtinate Refuſal they are ſentenced to puniſhment; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are invited, and not only invited, but by powerful Preaching, and Miracles, and effectual Grace compelled, that is, infallibly prevailed with to come in. The number of them is ſo great, that the houſe is filled with the Gueſts; Many come ſincerely, not only looking at the pleaſure of the Feaſt, that is, at the Pardon of ſin, and Deliverance from the Wrath of God, but alſo at the honour of the Marriage, that is, of the Redeemer, and their profeſſion by giving up themſelves to a holy Converſation; but ſome come in only for the Feaſt, that is, Juſtification by Chriſt, having not the wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſound Reſolution for Obedience in their Life, and looking only at themſelves in Believing, and not to the glory of their Redeemer; and theſe are ſentenced to everlaſting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſpeed as ill as thoſe that came not in at all; ſeeing a Faith that will not work, is but like that of the Devil; and they that look to be pardoned and ſaved by it, are miſtaken, as <hi>James</hi> ſheweth, 2. 24.</p>
            <p>The words of my Text contain a Narration of the ill-entertainment that the Goſpel findeth with many to whom it is ſent, even after a firſt and ſecond invitation. They made light of it, and are taken up with other things. Though it be the <hi>Jews</hi> that were firſt guilty, they have too many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers among us <hi>Gentiles</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>For all the wonderful love and mercy that God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in giving his Son to be the Redeemer of the World, and which the Son hath manifeſted in Redeeming them by his Blood; for all his full preparation by being a ſufficient ſacrifice for the ſins of all; for all his Perſonal Excellencies, and that full and glorious Salvation that he hath procured, and for all his free offers of theſe, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and earneſt Invitations of Sinners; yet many do make light of all this, and prefer their worldly enjoyments before it. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary entertainment of all is by contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that all do ſo, or that all continue to do ſo who were once guilty of it: for God hath his choſen, whom he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to come in. But till the Spirit of Grace over-power the dead and obſtinate hearts of Men, they hear the Goſpel as a common ſtory, and the great matters contained in it go not to the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66241:4"/>
The Method in which I ſhall handle this Doctrin, is this:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. I ſhall ſhew you what it is that Men make light of.</item>
               <item>2. What this ſin of making light of it is.</item>
               <item>3. The cauſe of the ſin.</item>
               <item>4. The uſe of the Doctrin.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The thing that carnal hearers make light of, is, 1. The Doctrin of the Goſpel it ſelf, which they hear regardleſly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The benefits offered them therein: which are, 1. Chriſt himſelf. 2. The benefits which he giveth.</p>
            <p>Concerning Chriſt himſelf, the Goſpel 1. Declareth his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Nature, and the great things that he hath done and ſuffered for Man: his Redeeming him from the wrath of God by his Blood, and procuring a grant of Salvation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Furthermore, The ſame Goſpel maketh an offer of Chriſt to ſinners, that if they will accept him on his eaſie and reaſonable terms, he will be their Saviour, the Phyſitian of their Souls, their Husband and their Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The benefits that he offereth them, are theſe, 1. That with theſe bleſſed Relations to him, himſelf and intereſt in him, they ſhall have the pardon of all their ſins paſt, and be ſaved from God's Wrath, and be ſet in a ſure way of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pardon for all the ſins that they ſhall commit hereafter, ſo they do but obey ſincerely, and turn not again to the Rebellion of their Unregeneracy. 2. They ſhall have his Spirit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Guide and Sanctifier, and to dwell in their Souls, and help them againſt their Enemies, and conform them more and more to his Image, and heal their Diſeaſes, and bring them back to God. 3. They ſhall have right to everlaſting Glory when this Life is ended, and ſhall be raiſed up thereto at the laſt; beſides many excellent priviledges in the way, in Means, Preſervation and Proviſion, and the fore taſt of what they ſhall enjoy hereafter: All theſe benefits the Goſpel offereth to them that will have Chriſt on his reaſonable terms. The ſum of all is in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11, 12. <hi>This is the Record, that God hath given us eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son: He that hath the Son, hath Life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>What this Sin of making light of the Goſpel is?</hi> 1. To make light of the Goſpel, is, to take no great heed to what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66241:5"/>
is ſpoken, as if it were not a certain Truth, or elſe were a matter that little concerned them, or as if God had not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe things for them. 2. When the Goſpel doth not <hi>affect</hi> Men, or go to their <hi>hearts;</hi> but though they ſeem to attend to what is ſaid, yet men are not <hi>awakened</hi> by it from their ſecurity, nor doth it work in any meaſure ſuch holy Paſſion in their Souls, as matters of ſuch everlaſting Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſhould do; this is making light of the Goſpel of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. When we tell men what Chriſt hath done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Souls, and it ſcarce moveth them: We tell them of keen and cutting Truths, but nothing will pierce them: We can make them hear, but we cannot make them feel: Our words take up in the porch of their Ears and Fancies, but will not enter into the inward parts; as if we ſpake to men that had no hearts or feeling; this is a making light of Chriſt and Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 26, 27. hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand, ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive. For the Heart of this People is waxen groſs, and their Ears are dull of hearing, their Eyes are cloſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When Men have no high Eſtimation of Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but whatſoever they may ſay with their tongues, or dreamingly and ſpeculatively believe, yet in their ſerious and practical thoughts, they have a higher eſtimation of the matters of this World, than they have of Chriſt, and the Salvation that he hath purchaſed; this is a making light of him. When Men account the Doctrin of Chriſt to be but a matter of words and names, as <hi>Gallio, Acts</hi> 18. 4. or as <hi>Feſtus, Acts</hi> 25. 19. a ſuperſtitious matter about one Jeſus who was dead, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith is alive. Or ask the Preachers of the Goſpel, as the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Acts 17. 18. <hi>What will this babler ſay?</hi> This is contempt of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When Men are informed of the truths of the Goſpel, and on what Terms Chriſt and his Benefits may be had, and how it is the will of God that they ſhould <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Accept</hi> the offer; and that he <hi>commandeth</hi> them to do it upon pain of damnation; and yet men <hi>will</hi> not conſent, unleſs they could have Chriſt on terms of their own: They will not part with their worldly contents, nor lay down their Pleaſures and Profits, and Honour at his Feet, as being content to take ſo much of them only as he will give them back, and as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66241:5"/>
is conſiſtent with his Will and Intereſt, but think its a hard ſaying, that they muſt forſake all in Reſolution for Chriſt; this is a making light of him and their Salvation. When men might have part in him and all his Benefits, if they <hi>would,</hi> and they <hi>will</hi> not, unleſs they may keep the World too; and are reſolved to pleaſe their fleſh, whatever comes of it; this is a high contempt of Chriſt and everlaſting life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21, 22. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 23. you may find examples of ſuch as I here deſcribe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When men will promiſe fair, and profeſs their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have Chriſt on his terms, and to forſake all for him; but yet <hi>do ſtick</hi> to the World and their ſinful Courſes; and when it comes to <hi>practice,</hi> will not be removed by all that Chriſt hath done and ſaid: this is making light of Chriſt and Salvation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 5. compared with 43. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The cauſes of this ſin are the next thing to be enquired after. It may ſeem a wonder that ever Men that have the uſe of their reaſon, ſhould be ſo ſottiſh as to make light of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch conſequence. But the cauſe is;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some Men underſtand not the very ſenſe of the Words of the Goſpel, when they hear it, and how can they be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with that which they underſtand not? Though we ſpeak to them in plain Engliſh, and ſtudy to ſpeak it as plainly as we can; yet People have ſo eſtranged themſelves from God, and the matters of their own happineſs, that they know not what we ſay, as if we ſpoke in another language, and as if they were under that Judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 11. with ſtammering Lips, and with another Tongue will he ſpeak to his People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some that do underſtand the <hi>Words</hi> that we ſpeak, yet becauſe they are carnal, underſtand not the <hi>matter;</hi> for the natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. They are earthly, and theſe things are heavenly, <hi>John</hi> 3. 12. The things of the Spirit are not well known by bare hear-ſay, but by a ſpiritual taſt, which none have but thoſe that are taught by the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12, that we may know the things that are given us of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66241:6"/>
3. A carnal mind apprehendeth not a <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> in theſe ſpiritual and heavenly things to his mind, and therefore he ſets light by them, and hath no mind of them. When you tell him of everlaſting glory, he heareth you as if you were perſwading him to go play with the Sun: they are matters of another World, and out of his element; and therefore he hath no more delight in them than a Fiſh would have to be in the faireſt Meadow, or than a Swine hath in a Jewel, or a Dog in a piece of Gold: They may be good to others, but he cannot apprehend them as ſuitable to him, becauſe he hath a nature that is otherwiſe inclined: he ſavoureth not the things of the Spirit, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The main cauſe of the ſlighting of Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, a ſecret root of <hi>unbelief</hi> in mens hearts. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may pretend, they do not ſoundly and throughly <hi>believe</hi> the Word of God: They are taught in general to ſay, <hi>The Goſpel is true;</hi> but they never ſaw the <hi>Evidence</hi> of its truth ſo far, as throughly to perſwade them of it; nor have they got their Souls ſetled on the Infallibility of God's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, nor conſidered of the Truth of the particular Doctrins revealed in the Scripture, ſo far as ſoundly to believe them. Oh did you all but <hi>ſoundly believe</hi> the words of this Goſpel, of the evil of ſin, of the need of Chriſt, and what he hath done for you, and what you muſt be and do, if ever you will be ſaved by him; and what will become of you for ever, if you do it not; I dare ſay, it would cure the contempt of Chriſt, and you would not make ſo light of the matters of your Salvation. But men do not <hi>believe,</hi> while they ſay they do, and would face us down that they do, and verily think that they do themſelves. There is a root of bitterneſs, and an evil Heart of unbelief, that makes them depart from the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. and 4. 1, 2, 6. Tell any Man in this Congregation, that he ſhall have a gift of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> if he will but go to <hi>London</hi> for it; if he believe you, he will go; but if he believe not, he will not; and if he will not go, you may be ſure he believeth not, ſuppoſing that he is able. I know a ſlight belief may ſtand with a wicked life. Such as men have of the Truth of a Prognoſtication, <hi>it may be true, and it may be falſe;</hi> but a <hi>true and ſound</hi> belief is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſo great neglect of the things that are believed.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66241:6"/>
5. Chriſt and Salvation are made light of by the World, becauſe of their deſperate hardneſs of Heart. The Heart is hard naturally, and by cuſtom in ſinning made more hard; eſpecially by long abuſe of Mercy, and neglect of the means of Grace, and reſiſting the Spirit of God. Hence it is that men are turned into ſuch Stones: and till God cure them of the ſtone of the Heart, no wonder if they <hi>feel</hi> not what they know, or regard not what we ſay, but make light of all; 'Tis hard preaching a ſtone into tears, or making a rock to tremble. You may ſtand over a dead body long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſay to it, <hi>Oh thou Carcaſe, when thou hast lain rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mouldring to dust, till the Reſurrection, God will then call thee to account for thy ſin, and caſt thee into everlaſting fire,</hi> before you can make it feel what you ſay, or fear the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that is never ſo truly threatned; when Mens Hearts are like the High-way that is trodden to hardneſs by long cuſtom in ſinning, or like the clay that is hardned to a ſtone, by the heat of thoſe Mercies which ſhould have melted them into Repentance; when they have Conſciences ſeared with a hot Iron, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. no wonder then if they be paſt feeling, and working all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with greedineſs, do make light of Chriſt and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Glory. Oh that this were not the caſe of too many of our Hearers! Had we but <hi>living Souls</hi> to ſpeak to, they would hear and feel, and not make light of what we ſay. I know they are naturally alive, but they are ſpiritually dead, as Scripture witneſſeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. Oh if there were but one ſpark of the life of Grace in them, the Doctrin of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt, would appear to them to be the weightieſt buſineſs in the World. Oh how confident ſhould I be, methinks, to prevail with men, and to take them off this World, and bring them to mind the matters of another World, if I ſpake but to Men that had Life, and Senſe, and Reaſon! But when we ſpeak to Blocks and dead Men, how ſhould we be regarded? Oh how ſad a caſe are theſe Souls in, that are fallen under this fearful judgment of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual madneſs and deadneſs! To have a blind Mind, and a hard Heart, to be ſottiſh and ſenſeleſs, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>John</hi> 12. 40. leſt they ſhould be converted, and their ſin ſhould be forgiven them.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66241:7"/>
6. Chriſt and Salvation are made light of by the World, becauſe they are wholly enſlaved to their ſenſe, and taken up with lower things; the matters of another World are out of ſight, and ſo far from their ſenſes, that they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them; but preſent things are nearer them, in their eyes, and in their hands: There muſt be a living faith to prevail over ſenſe, before Men can be ſo taken with things that are not ſeen, though they have the Word of God for their ſecurity, as to neglect and let go things that are ſtill before their eyes. Senſe works with great advantage; and therefore doth much in reſiſting Faith where it is. No wonder then if it carry all before it, where there is no true and lively faith to reſiſt, and to lead the Soul to higher things: this cauſe of making light of Chriſt and Salvation, is expreſſed here in my Text: <hi>One went to his Farm, and another to his Merohandize:</hi> Men have Houſes and Lands to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they have Wife and Children to mind, they have their Body and outward Eſtate to regard, therefore they forget that they have a God, a Redeemer, a Soul to mind; Theſe matters of the World are ſtill with them. They <hi>ſee</hi> theſe, but they <hi>ſee not</hi> God, nor Chriſt, nor their Souls, nor ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Glory. Theſe things are <hi>near</hi> at hand, and therefore work <hi>naturally,</hi> and ſo more forcibly; but the other are thought on as a great way off, and therefore too diſtant to work on their affections, or to be at the preſent ſo much regarded by them. Their Body hath life and ſenſe, and therefore if they want meats, or drink, or cloaths, will feel their want, and tell them of it, and give them no reſt till their wants be ſupplied; and therefore they cannot make light of their bodily neceſſities; but their Souls in ſpiritual reſpects are dead, and therefore feel not their wants, but will let them alone in their greateſt neceſſities; and be as quiet when they are ſtarved and languiſhing to Deſtruction, as if all were well, and nothing ailed them. And hereupon poor people are wholly taken up in providing for the Body, as if they had nothing elſe to mind. They have their Trades and Callings to follow, and ſo much to do from morning to night, that they can find no time for matters of Salvation: Chriſt would teach them, but they have no leiſure to hear him: The Bible is before them, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66241:7"/>
have while to read it: A Miniſter is in the Town with them, but they cannot have while to go to enquire of him what they ſhall do to be ſaved: And when they do hear, their Hearts are ſo full of the World, and carried away with theſe lower matters, that they cannot mind the things which they hear. They are ſo full of the thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and cares of this World, that there is no room to pour into them the water of Life: The cares of the World do choak the Word, and make it become unfruitful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. Men cannot ſerve two Maſters, God and Mammon, but they will lean to the one, and deſpiſe the other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. He that loveth the World, the love of the Father is not in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 15, 16. Men cannot chuſe but ſet light by Chriſt and Salvation, while they ſet ſo much by any thing on Earth; It is that which is highly eſteemed among Men, is abominable in the ſight of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. Oh this is the ruin of many thouſand Souls! It would grieve the Heart of any honeſt Chriſtian, to ſee how eagerly this vain World is followed every where, and how little Men ſet by Chriſt, and the World to come: to compare the care that Men have for the World, with the care of their Souls; and the time that they lay out on the World, with that time they lay out for their Salvation: To ſee how the World fills their Mouths, their Hands, their Houſes, their Hearts; and Chriſt hath little more than a bare Title: To come into their company, and hear no diſcourſe but of the World; to come into their houſes, and hear and ſee nothing but for the World, as if this World would laſt forever, or would purchaſe them another. When I ask ſometime the Miniſters of the Goſpel how their labours ſucceed, they tell me, <hi>People continue ſtill the ſame, and give up themſelves wholly to the World, ſo that they mind not what Ministers ſay to them, nor will give any full entertainment to the Word, and all becauſe of the delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World:</hi> And, oh that too many Miniſters themſelves did not make light of that Chriſt whom they preach, being drawn away with the love of this World! In a word, Men of a worldly Diſpoſition do judge of things according to worldly advantages; therefore Chriſt is ſlighted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. <hi>He is deſpiſed and rejected of men, they hide their faces from him, and eſteem him not, as ſeeing no beauty or comelineſs in him, that they ſhould deſire him.</hi>

            <p n="7">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66241:8"/>
7. Chriſt and Salvation are made light of, becauſe men do not ſoberly <hi>conſider</hi> of the truth and weight of theſe neceſſary things; They ſuffer not their minds ſo long to <hi>dwell</hi> upon them, till they procure a due eſteem, and deeply affect their Heart; did they believe them, and not <hi>conſider</hi> of them, how ſhould they work? Oh when men have reaſon given them to think and conſider of the things that moſt concern them, and yet they will not uſe it, this cauſeth their contempt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Chriſt and Salvation are made light of, becauſe Men were never <hi>ſenſible</hi> of their <hi>ſin and miſery,</hi> and <hi>extream neceſſity</hi> of Chriſt and his Salvation: their eyes were never opened to ſee <hi>themſelves</hi> as they are; nor their Hearts ſoundly humbled in the ſenſe of their condition: If this were done, they would ſoon be brought to value a Saviour: A truly broken Heart can no more make light of Chriſt and Salvation, than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Man of his food, or a ſick man of the means that would give him eaſe: but till then, our Words cannot have acceſs to their Hearts: while ſin and miſery is made light of, Chriſt and Salvation will be made light of; but when theſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an intolerable burden, then nothing will ſerve the turn but Chriſt. Till men be truly humbled, they can ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Chriſt and Salvation for a luſt, for a little worldly gain, even for leſs than nothing; but when God hath illuminated them, and broken their Hearts, then they would give a World for a Chriſt; then they <hi>muſt have Christ, or they die; all things then are loſs and dung to them, in regard of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. When they are once pricked in their hearts for ſin and miſery, then they cry out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Acts 2. 37. When they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by Gods Judgments, as the poor Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29. then they cry out, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> This is the reaſon why God will bring men ſo low by humiliation, before he bring them to ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Men take occaſion to make light of Chriſt, by the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs</hi> of the Goſpel; becauſe they do hear of it every day, the <hi>frequency</hi> is an occaſion to dull their affections; I ſay an occaſion; for it is no juſt cauſe. Were it a <hi>rarity,</hi> it might take more with them; but now, if they hear a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preach nothing but theſe ſaving Truths, they ſay, <hi>We have theſe every day:</hi> They make not light of their bread
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66241:8"/>
or drink, their health or life, becauſe they poſſeſs them <hi>every day;</hi> they make not light of the Sun, becauſe it ſhineth <hi>every day;</hi> at leaſt they ſhould not, for the mercy is the greater; but Chriſt and Salvation are made light of, becauſe they hear of them often; <hi>This is,</hi> ſay they, <hi>a good plain dry Sermon: Pearls</hi> are trod in the dirt where they are <hi>common;</hi> They loath this dry Manna, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 7. The full Soul loaths the hony-comb; but to the hungry every bitter thing is ſweet.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Chriſt and Salvation are made light of becauſe of this disjunctive <hi>Preſumption,</hi> either that he is ſure enough <hi>theirs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</hi> and God that is ſo merciful, and Chriſt that hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much for them, is ſurely reſolved to ſave them, or elſe it may eaſily be obtained at any time, if it be not yet ſo. A conceited <hi>facility</hi> to have a part in Chriſt and Salvation at any time, doth occaſion men to make light of them. It is true, that Grace is free, and the Offer is univerſal, according to the extent of the preaching of the Goſpel; and it is true that men may have Chriſt <hi>when they will;</hi> that is, when they are willing to have him on his terms; but he that hath promiſed thee Chriſt, if thou be willing, hath not promiſed to make thee willing: and if thou art not willing now, how canſt thou think thou ſhalt be willing hereafter? If thou canſt make thine own Heart willing, why is it not done now? Can you do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when ſin hath more hardned it, and God may have given thee over to thy ſelf? Oh ſinners! you might do much, tho' you are not able of your ſelves to come in, if you would now ſubject your ſelves to the working of the Spirit, and ſet in while the gales of grace continue; but did you know what a hard and impoſſible thing it is to be ſo much as willing to have Chriſt and Grace, when the Heart is given over to it ſelf, and the Spirit hath withdrawn its former invitations, you would not be ſo confident of your own ſtrength to believe and repent: nor would you make light of Chriſt upon ſuch fooliſh confidence. If indeed it be ſo eaſie a matter as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine for a ſinner to believe and repent at any time; how comes it to paſs that it is done by ſo few, but moſt of the World do periſh in their impenitency, when they have all the helps and means that we can afford them? It is true, the thing is very reaſonable and eaſie in it ſelf to a pure nature; but while Man is blind and dead, theſe things are in a ſort impoſſible to him, which are never ſo eaſie to others. It is the eaſieſt and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66241:9"/>
life in the World to a gracious ſoul to live in the love of God, and the delightful thoughts of the life to come, where all their hope and happineſs lieth: But to a worldly carnal Heart it is as eaſie to remove a Mountain, as to bring them to this. However, theſe Men are their own condemners; for if they think it ſo eaſie a matter to repent and believe, and ſo have Chriſt and right to Salvation, then have they no excuſe for neglecting this which they thought ſo eaſie. O wretched impenitent Soul! what mean you to ſay, when God ſhall ask you, <hi>Why did you not Repent and Love your Redeemer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the World, when you thought it ſo eaſie that you could do it at any time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. We come now to the Application: and hence you may be informed of the blindneſs and folly of all carnal men: how <hi>contemptible</hi> are their judgements that think Chriſt and Salvation <hi>contemptible?</hi> and how little reaſon there is why any ſhould be moved by them, or diſcouraged by any of their ſcorns or contradictions</p>
            <p>How ſhall we ſooner know a man to be a fool, than if he know no difference between Dung and Gold! Is there ſuch a thing as <hi>madneſs</hi> in the World, if that Man be not mad, that ſets light by Chriſt and his own Salvation, while he daily toyls for the dung of the earth? And yet what pity is it to ſee, that a company of poor ignorant Souls will be aſhamed of godlineſs, if ſuch Men as theſe do but deride them! Or will think hardly of a holy life, if ſuch as theſe do ſpeak againſt it! Hearers, if you ſee any <hi>ſet light</hi> by Chriſt and Salvation, do you ſet <hi>light</hi> by that Man's <hi>Wit,</hi> and by his <hi>Words,</hi> and hear the reproaches of a holy life, as you would hear the words of a mad Man; not with regard, but with a Compaſſion of his miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. What wonder if we and our preaching be deſpiſed, and the beſt Miniſters complain of ill ſucceſs, when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Apoſtles themſelves did ſucceed i no better? What wonder if for all that we can ſay or do, our hearers ſtill ſet light by Chriſt and their own Salvation; when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles hearers did the ſame? They that did ſecond their Doctrin by Miracles: If any Men could have ſhaken and torn in pieces the Hearts of Sinners they could have done it: If any could
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66241:9"/>
have laid them at their feet, and made them all cry out as ſome, <hi>What ſhall we do,</hi> it would have been they. You may ſee then that it is not meerly for want of good Preachers that men make light of Chriſt and Salvation: the firſt News of ſuch a thing as the Pardon of Sin, and the Hopes of Glory, and the Danger of everlaſting Miſery, would turn the hearts of men within them, if they were as tractable in ſpiritual matters as in temporal: But alas, it is far otherwiſe. It muſt not ſeem any ſtrange thing, nor muſt it too much diſcourage the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, if when they have ſaid all that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to ſay to win the hearts of men to Chriſt, the moſt do ſtill ſlight him, and while they bow the Knee to him, and honour him with their Lips, do yet ſet ſo light by him in their hearts, as to prefer every fleſhly pleaſure or commodity before him. It will be thus with many: let us be glad that it is not thus with All.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. But for cloſer application. Seeing this is the great condemning Sin, before we enquire after it into the hearts of our hearers, it beſeems us to begin at home, and ſee that we who are Preachers of the Goſpel, be not guilty of it our ſelves. The Lord forbid that they that have undertaken the ſacred Office of revealing the Excellencies of Chriſt to the World, ſhould make light of him themſelves, and ſlight that Salvation which they do daily preach. The Lord knows we are all of us ſo low in our Eſtimation of Chriſt, and do this great Work ſo negligently, that we have cauſe to be aſhamed of our beſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; but ſhould this Sin prevail in us, we were the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable of all men. Brethren, I love not cenſoriouſneſs; yet dare not befriend ſo vile a Sin in my ſelf or others under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of avoiding it; eſpecially when there is ſo great neceſſity that it ſhould be healed firſt in them that make it their work to heal it in others. O that there were no cauſe to complain that Chriſt and Salvation are made light of by the Preachers of it. But, 1. Do not the negligent ſtudies of ſome ſpeak it out? 2. Doth not their dead and drouſie Preaching declare it? do not they make light of the Doctrin they preach, that do it as if they were half aſleep, and feel not what they ſpeak themſelves?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doth not the careleſneſs of ſome mens private endeavours diſcover it? what do they for Souls? how ſlightly do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Sin? how little do they when they are out of the Pulpit for the ſaving of mens Souls?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:66241:10"/>
4. Doth not the continued neglect of thoſe things wherein the Intereſt of Chriſt conſiſteth, diſcover it? 1. The Churches Purity and Reformation. 2. Its Unity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Doth not the covetous and worldly lives of too many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, loſing advantages for mens ſouls, for a little gain to themſelves? And moſt of this is becauſe men are Preachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are Chriſtians, and tell men of that which they never felt themſelves. Of all men on earth, there are few that are in ſo bad a condition as ſuch Miniſters: and if indeed they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Scripture which they preach, methinks it ſhould be terrible to them in their ſtudying and preaching it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Beloved hearers; the Office that God hath called us to, is, by declaring the glory of his grace, to help under Chriſt, to the ſaving of mens Souls. I hope you think not that I come hither to day on any other errand. The Lord knows I had not ſet a foot out of doors but in hope to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this Work for your Souls. I have conſidered and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conſidered, what is the mater that ſo many Thouſands ſhould periſh when God hath done ſo much for their Salvation; and I find this that is mentioned in my Text is the cauſe. It is one of the wonders of the World, that when God hath ſo loved the World as to ſend his Son, and Chriſt hath made a ſatisfaction by his death ſufficient for them all, and offereth the benefits of it ſo freely to them, even without mony or price, that yet the moſt of the World ſhould periſh; yea the moſt of thoſe that are thus called by his Word! Why here is the reaſon, when Chriſt hath done all this, men make light of it. God hath ſhewed that <hi>he</hi> is not unwilling; and Chriſt hath ſhewed that <hi>he</hi> is not unwilling that men ſhould be reſtored to God's favour and be ſaved; but men are actually unwilling <hi>themſelves.</hi> God takes not <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the death of ſinners, but rather that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. But men take ſuch <hi>pleaſure</hi> in ſin, that they will dye before they will return. The Lord Jeſus was content to be their Phyſitian, and hath provided them a ſufficient plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his own blood: but if men make light of it, and will not apply it, what wonder if they periſh after all? This Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giveth us the reaſon of their perdition. This ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells us the moſt of the World is guilty of. It is a moſt lamentable thing to ſee how moſt men do ſpend their care, their time, their pains for known vanities; while God and Glory are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66241:10"/>
caſt aſide: That he who is <hi>all</hi> ſhould ſeem to them as <hi>nothing;</hi> and that which is <hi>nothing</hi> ſhould ſeem to them as good as <hi>all;</hi> that God ſhould ſet mankind in ſuch a race where heaven or hell is their certain end, and that they ſhould ſet down, and loyter, or run after the childiſh Toyes of the World, and ſo much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Prize that they ſhould run for. Were it but poſſible for one of us to ſee the <hi>whole</hi> of this buſineſs, as the all ſeeing God doth; to ſee at one view both heaven and hell which men are ſo near, and ſee what moſt men in the World are minding, and what they are doing every day, it would be the ſaddeſt ſight that could be imagined. Oh how ſhould we marvail at their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and lament their ſelf-deluſion! Oh poor diſtracted World! what is it that you run after? and what is it that you neglect? If God had never told them what they were ſent into the World to do, or whether they were going, or what was before them in another World, then they had been excuſable; but he hath told them over and over, till they were weary of it. Had he left it doubtful, there had been ſome excuſe; but it is his ſealed word, and they profeſs to believe it, and would take it ill of us if we ſhould queſtion whether they do believe it or not.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I come not to accuſe any of you particularly of this crime: but ſeeing it is the commoneſt cauſe of mens Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſuppoſe you will judge it the fitteſt matter for our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and deſerving our greateſt care for the cure. To which end I ſhall 1. Endeavour the <hi>Conviction</hi> of the guilty. 2. Shall give them ſuch conſiderations as may tend to humble and reform them. 3. I ſhall conclude with ſuch direction as may help them that are willing to eſcape the deſtroying Power of Sin. And for the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the caſe of moſt ſinners to think themſelves freeſt from thoſe ſins that they are moſt enſlaved to; and one reaſon why we cannot reform them, is, becauſe we cannot convince them of their guilt. It is the nature of ſin ſo far to blind and befool the ſinner, that he knoweth not what he doth, but thinketh he is free from it when it reigneth in him, on when he is committing it: It bringeth men to be ſo much unacquainted with themſelves, that they know not what they think, or what they mean and intend, nor what they love or hate, much leſs what they are habituated and diſpoſed to. They are alive to ſin, and dead to all the Reaſon, Conſideration and Reſolution that ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, as if it were only by their ſinning that we muſt know
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66241:11"/>
they are alive. May I hope that you that hear me to day, are but willing to know the Truth of your caſe, and then I ſhall be encouraged to proceed to an enquiry. God will judge imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; why ſhould not we do ſo? Let me therefore by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Queſtions try whether none of you are ſlighters of Chriſt and your own Salvation. And follow me, I beſeech you, by putting them cloſe to your own hearts, and faithfully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Things that men highly value will be <hi>remembred,</hi> they will be matter of their freeſt and ſweeteſt thoughts: this is a known caſe.</p>
            <p>Do not thoſe then make light of Chriſt and Salvation, that think of them ſo ſeldom and coldly in compariſon of other things? Follow thy own heart man, and obſerve what it daily runneth out after; and then judge whether it make not light of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We cannot perſwade men to one hours ſober conſideration what they ſhould do for an intereſt in Chriſt, or in thankfulneſs for his love, and yet they will not believe that they make light of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Things that we highly value will be matter of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: The judgment and heart will command the tongue. Freely and delightfully will our ſpeech run after them. This alſo is a known caſe.</p>
            <p>Do not thoſe then make light of Chriſt and Salvation, that ſhun the mention of his name, unleſs it be in a vain or ſinful uſe? Thoſe that love not the company where Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much talked of; but think it troubleſome preciſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: That had rather hear ſome merry Jeſts, or idle Tales, or talk of their Riches or Buſineſs in the World. When you may follow them from morning to night, and ſcarce have a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory word of Chriſt; but perhaps ſome ſlight and weary men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him ſometimes; judge whether theſe make not light of Chriſt and Salvation. How ſeriouſly do they talk of the World? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 8, 11. and ſpeak vanity! but how heartleſly do they make mention of Chriſt and Salvation!</p>
            <p n="3">3. The things that we highly value, we would ſecure the poſſeſſion of, and therefore would take any convenient Courſe to have all doubts and fears about them well reſolved. Do not thoſe men then make light of Chriſt and Salvation, that have lived twenty or thirty Years in uncertainty whether they have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66241:11"/>
any part in theſe or not, and yet never ſeek out for the right reſolution of their doubts? Are all that hear me this day certain they ſhall be ſaved? Oh that they were! Oh had you not made light of Salvation, you could not ſo eaſily bear ſuch doubtings of it; you could not reſt till you had made it ſure, or done your beſt to make it ſure. Have you no body to enquire of that might help you in ſuch a Work? Why you have Miniſters that are purpoſely appointed to that Office. Have you gone to them and told them the doubtfulneſs of your caſe, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their help in the judging of your condition? Alas Miniſters may ſit in their Studies from one year to another, before ten Perſons among one Thouſand, will come to them on ſuch an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand! Do not theſe make light of Chriſt and Salvation? when the Goſpel pierceth the heart indeed, they cry out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved! Acts</hi> 16. 30. and 9. 6. trembling and aſtoniſhed, <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And ſo did the convinced Jews to <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2. 37. But when hear we ſuch Queſtions?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The things that we value do <hi>deeply affect</hi> us, and ſome motions will be in the heart according to our Eſtimation of them. Oh Sirs, If men made not light of theſe things, what <hi>workings</hi> would there be in the hearts of all our hearers? What ſtrange affections would it raiſe in them to hear of the matters of the World to come! How would their hearts melt before the Power of the Goſpel? what ſorrow would be wrought in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their ſin? what aſtoniſhment at the conſideration of their miſery? what unſpeakable Joy at the glad Tidings of Salvation by the Blood of Chriſt? what reſolution would be raiſed in them upon the diſcovery of their duty? Oh what hearers ſhould we have if it were not for this ſin! whereas now, we are like to weary them, or preach them aſleep with matters of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able moment. We talk to them of Chriſt and Salvation till we make their heads ake; Little would one think by their careleſs carriage, that they heard and regarded what we ſaid, or thought we ſpoke at all to them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our eſtimation of things will be ſeen in the diligence of our endeavours. That which we highlieſt value, we ſhall think no pains too great to obtain. Do not thoſe men then make light of Chriſt and Salvation, that think all too much that they do for them, that murmur at his Service, and think it too grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for them to endure? that ask of his Service as <hi>Judas</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66241:12"/>
the Oyntment; <hi>What need this waſt? cannot men be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much ado? this is more ado than needs.</hi> For the World they will labour all the day, and all their lives; but for Chriſt and Salvation they are afraid of doing too much. Let us preach to them as long as we will, we cannot bring them to reliſh or reſolve upon a life of holineſs. Follow them to their houſes, and you ſhall not hear them read a Chapter, nor call upon God with their Families once a day; Nor will they allow him that one day in ſeven which he hath ſeparated to his ſervice. But pleaſure, or worldly buſineſs, or idleneſs muſt have a part. And many of them are ſo far hardened, as to reproach them that will not be as mad as themſelves. And is not Chriſt worth the ſeeking? Is not everlaſting Salvation worth more than all this? Doth not that Soul make light of all theſe, that thinks his eaſe more worth than they? Let but common ſenſe judge.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That which we moſt highly value, we think we cannot <hi>buy too dear:</hi> Chriſt and Salvation are freely given, and yet the moſt of men go without them, becauſe they cannot enjoy the world and them together. They are called but to part with that which would hinder them from Chriſt, and they will not do it. They are called but to give God his own, and to reſign all to his Will, and let go the Profits and Pleaſures of this World, when they muſt let go either Chriſt or them, and they will not. They think this too dear a bargain, and ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpare theſe things: They muſt hold their credit with men; they muſt look to their Eſtates: how ſhall they live elſe? They muſt have their pleaſure, whatſoever becomes of Chriſt and Salvation: As if they could live without Chriſt better than without theſe? as if they were afraid of being loſers by Chriſt, or could make a ſaving match by loſing their Souls to gain the World. Chriſt hath told us over and over, that if we will not forſake all for him, we cannot be his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Far are theſe men from for ſaking all, and yet will needs think that they are his Diſciples indeed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That which men highly eſteem, they would <hi>help their friends to</hi> as well as themſelves. Do not thoſe men make light of Chriſt and Salvation, that can take ſo much care to leave their Children Portions in the World, and do ſo little to help them to Heaven? That provide outward neceſſaries ſo carefully for their Families, but do ſo little to the ſaving of their Souls? Their neglected Children and Friends will witneſs, that either
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66241:12"/>
Chriſt or their Childrens Souls, or both, were made light of.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That which men highly eſteem, they will ſo diligently ſeek after, that you may ſee it in the <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> if it be a matter within their reach. You may ſee how many make light of Chriſt, by the little knowledge they have of him, and the little commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, and communication from him; and the little, yea, none of his ſpecial graces in them. Alas! how many Miniſters can ſpeak it to the ſorrow of their Hearts, that many of their People know almoſt nothing of Chriſt, though they hear of him dayly! nor know they what they muſt do to be ſaved; if we ask them an account of theſe things, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as if they underſtood not what we ſay to them, and tell us they are no Scholars, and therefore think they are excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their ignorance. Oh if theſe men had not made light of Chriſt and their Salvation, but had beſtowed but half ſo much pains to know and enjoy him, as they have done to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the matters of their Trades and Callings in the World, they would not have been ſo ignorant as they are: They make light of theſe things, and therefore will not be at the pains to ſtudy or learn them. When Men that can learn the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Trade in a few years, have not learned a Catechiſm, nor how to underſtand their Creed, under twenty or thirty years preaching, nor cannot abide to be queſtioned about ſuch things; doth not this ſhew that they have ſlighted them in their Hearts? How will theſe deſpiſers of Chriſt and Salvation be able one day to look him in the face, and to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe neglects?</p>
            <p>Thus much I have ſpoken in order to your Conviction. Do not ſome of your conſciences by this time ſmite you, and ſay, <hi>I am the Man that have made light of my Salvation?</hi> If they do not, it is becauſe you make light of it ſtill, for all that is ſaid to you. But becauſe, if it be the will of the Lord, I would fain have this damning Diſtemper cured, and am loth to leave you in ſuch a deſperate condition, if I knew how to remedy it; I will give you ſome Conſiderations, which may move you, if you be men of reaſon and underſtanding, to look better about you; and I beſeech you weigh them, and make uſe of them as ye go, and lay open your Hearts to the work of Grace, and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bethink you what a caſe you are in, if you prove ſuch as make light of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>

Conſider, 1. Thou makeſt light of him that made not light of thee who didſt deſerve it. Thou waſt worthy of nothing but contempt. As a Man, what art thou but a worm to God? As a Sinner, thou art far viler than a Toad: yet Chriſt was ſo far from making light of thee and thy happineſs, that he came down into the fleſh, and lived a life of ſuffering, and offered himſelf a ſacrifice to the Juſtice which thou hadſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, that thy miſerable Soul might have a remedy. It is no leſs than Miracles of love and mercy that he hath ſhewed to us; and yet ſhall we ſlight them after all?</p>
            <p>Angels admire them, whom they leſs concern, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. and ſhall redeemed Sinners make light of them? What barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yea deviliſh, yea worſe then deviliſh Ingratitude is this? the Devils never had a Saviour offered them, but thou haſt, and doſt thou yet make light of him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the work of Man's Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, is the Maſter-piece of all the works of God, wherein he would have his love and mercy to be magnified. As the Creation declareth his Goodneſs and Power, ſo doth Redemption his Goodneſs and Mercy; he hath contrived the very frame of his Worſhip ſo, that it ſhall much conſiſt in the magnifying of this work; and after all this, will you make light of it? His Name is wonderful, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. He did the work that none could do, <hi>John</hi> 15. 24. Greater love could none ſhew than his, <hi>John</hi> 15. 13. How great was the evil and miſery that he delivered us from? the good procured for us? all are wonders, from his Birth to his Aſcenſion; from our new Birth to our Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all are wonders of matchleſs Mercy. And yet do you make light of them!</p>
            <p n="3">3. You make light of matters of <hi>greateſt excellency and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World:</hi> you know not what it is that you ſlight; had you well known, you could not have done it. As Chriſt ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4. 10. hadſt thou known who it is that ſpeaketh to thee, thou wouldſt have asked of him the waters of Life. Had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. So, had you known what Chriſt is, you would not have made light of him; had you been one day in Heaven, and but ſeen what they poſſeſs, and ſeen alſo what miſerable Souls muſt endure that are ſhut out, you would never ſure have made ſo light of Chriſt again.</p>

Oh Sirs, it is no trifle, or jeſting matter that the Goſpel ſpeaks of. I muſt needs profeſs to you, that when I have the moſt ſerious thoughts of theſe things my ſelf, I am ready to marvel that ſuch amazing matters do not overwhelm the ſouls of Men; that the greatneſs of the Subject doth not ſo overmatch our underſtandings and affections, as even to drive men beſides themſelves, but that God hath always ſomewhat allayed it by the diſtance; much more that Men ſhould be ſo blockiſh as to make light of them. Oh Lord, that Men did but know what everlaſting Glory, and everlaſting Torments are. Would they then hear us as they do? Would they read and think of theſe things as they do? I profeſs I have been ready to wonder, when I have heard ſuch weighty things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, how People can forbear crying out in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; much more, how they can reſt till they have gone to their Miniſters, and learned what they ſhould do to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this great buſineſs might be put out of doubt. Oh that Heaven and Hell ſhould work no more upon Men! Oh that Everlaſtingneſs ſhould work no more! Oh how can you forbear when you are alone, to think with your ſelves what it is to be everlaſtingly in Joy or in Torment! I wonder that ſuch thoughts do not break your ſleep; and that they come not in your mind when you are about your labour! I wonder how you can almoſt do any thing elſe: how you can have any quietneſs in your minds: how you can eat, or drink, or reſt, till you have got ſome ground of everlaſting Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! Is that a <hi>Man</hi> or a <hi>Corps</hi> that is not affected with matters of this moment? That can be readier to ſleep than to tremble, when he heareth how he muſt ſtand at the Bar of God? Is that a <hi>Man,</hi> or a <hi>Clod of Clay,</hi> that can riſe and lie down without being deeply affected with his everlaſting Eſtate? that can follow his worldly Buſineſs, and make nothing of the great buſineſs of Salvation or Damnation; and that when they know it is hard at hand? Truly Sirs, when I think of the weight of the matter, I wonder at the very beſt of God's Saints upon Earth, that they are no better, and do no more in ſo weighty a caſe. I wonder at thoſe whom the World accounteth more holy than needs, and ſcorns for making too much ado; that they can put off Chriſt and their Souls with ſo little: that they pour not out their Souls in every Supplication;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66241:14"/>
that they are not more taken up with God; that their thoughts be not more ſerious in preparation for their account. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they be not an hundred times more ſtrict in their lives; and more laborious and unwearied in ſtriving for the Crown, than they are. And for my ſelf, as I am aſhamed of my dull and careleſs Heart, and of my ſlow and unprofitable courſe of Life; ſo, the Lord knows, I am aſhamed of every Sermon that I preach, when I think what I have been ſpeaking of, and who ſent me; and that Men's Salvation or Damnation is ſo much concerned in it. I am ready to tremble, leſt God ſhould judge me, as a ſlighter of his Truth, and the ſouls of Men, and leſt in the beſt Sermon I ſhould be guilty of their blood. Me-thinks we ſhould not ſpeak a word to men in matters of ſuch Conſequence, without Tears, or the greateſt earneſtneſs that poſſibly we can; were not we too much guilty of the ſin which we reprove, it would be ſo. Whether, we are alone, or in company, me-thinks our end, and ſuch an end, ſhould ſtill be in our mind, and as before our eyes; and we ſhould ſooner forget any thing, and ſet light by any thing, or by all things, than by this.</p>
            <p>Conſider 4. Who is it that ſends this weighty Meſſage to you? Is it not God himſelf? Shall the God of Heaven ſpeak, and Men make light of it? You would not ſlight the Voice of an Angel or a Prince.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Whoſe</hi> Salvation is it that you make light of? Is it not your own? Are you no more near or dear to your ſelves, than to make light of your own happineſs or miſery? Why Sirs, do you not care whether you be ſaved or damned? Is Self-love loſt? Are you turned your own Enemies? As he that ſlighteth his Meat, doth ſlight his life; ſo if you ſlight Chriſt, whatſoever you may think, you will find it was your own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that you ſlighted. Hear what he ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 36. <hi>All they that hate me, love Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Your ſin is greater, in that you profeſs to believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which you make ſo light of. For a profeſſed Infidel to do it, that believes not that ever Chriſt died, or roſe again; or doth not believe that there is a Heaven or Hell, this were no ſuch marvel; but for you that make it your Creed, and your very Religion, and call your ſelves Chriſtians, and have been baptized into this Faith, and ſeemed to ſtand to it: this is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66241:14"/>
the wonder, and hath no excuſe. What! believe that you ſhall live in endleſs Joy or Torment, and yet make no more of it, to eſcape Torment, and obtain that Joy. What! believe that God will ſhortly judge you, and yet make no more preparation for it? Either ſay plainly, <hi>I am no Chriſtian, I do not believe theſe wonderful things! I will believe nothing but what I ſee;</hi> or elſe, let your hearts be affected with your Belief, and live as you ſay you do believe. What do you think when you repeat the Creed, and mention Chriſt's Judgment and everlaſting Life?</p>
            <p n="7">7. What are theſe things you ſet ſo much by, as to prefer them before Chriſt and the ſaving of your Souls? Have you found a better friend, a greater and ſurer happineſs than this? Good Lord! What dung is it that men make ſo much of, while they ſet ſo light by everlaſting Glory! What Toyes are they that they are daily taken up with, while matters of life and death are neglected! Why Sirs, If you had every one a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in your hopes, what were it in compariſon of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom? I cannot but look upon all the Glory and Dignity of this World, Lands and Lordſhips, Crowns and Kingdoms, even as on ſome brainſick beggarly Fellow, that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth fine Cloaths, and plays the part of a King or a Lord, for an hour on a ſtage, and then comes down, and the ſport is ended, and they are beggers again. Were it not for God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Authority of Magiſtrates, or for the ſervice they might do him, I ſhould judge no better of them. For as to their own Glory, it is but a ſmoak: what matter is it whether you live poor or rich, unleſs it were a greater matter to <hi>dye</hi> rich than it is? You know well enough that Death levels all: What matter is it at Judgment, whether you be to anſwer for the life of a rich man, or a poor man? Is <hi>Dives</hi> then any better than <hi>Lazarus?</hi> Oh that men knew what a poor deceiving ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow they graſp at, while they let go the everlaſting Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance! The ſtrongeſt and richeſt, and moſt voluptuous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, do but lay in fuel for their ſorrows, while they think they are gathering together a treaſure. Alas! they are aſleep, and dream that they are happy; but when they awake, what a change will they find? Their Crown is made of Thorns! their pleaſure hath ſuch a ſting as will ſtick in the heart through all Eternity, except unfeigned Repentance do prevent it. Oh how ſadly will theſe wretches be convinced ere long, what a fooliſh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66241:15"/>
bargain they made in ſelling Chriſt and their Salvation for theſe Trifles! Let your Farms and Merchandize then ſave you if they can; and do that for you that Chriſt would have done. Cry then to thy <hi>Baal</hi> to ſave thee! Oh what thoughts have Drunkards and Adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Chriſt, that will not part with the baſeſt luſt for him! For a piece of bread, ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> ſuch men do tranſgreſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 21.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To ſet ſo light by Chriſt and Salvation is a certain mark that thou haſt no part in them, and if thou ſo continue, that Chriſt will ſet <hi>as light</hi> by thee: Thoſe that honour him he will honour, and thoſe that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. Thou wilt feel one day that thou canſt not live without him. Thou wilt confeſs then thy need of him; and then thou mayſt go look for a Saviour where thou wilt; for he will be no Saviour for thee hereafter, that wouldſt not value him, and ſubmit to him here: Then who will prove the loſer by thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? Oh what a thing will it be for a poor miſerable Soul to cry to Chriſt for help in the day of extremity, and to hear ſo ſad an Anſwer as this! Thou didſt ſet light by me and my Law in the day of thy Proſperity, and I will now ſet as light by thee in thy Adverſity. Read <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. to the end. Thou that as <hi>Eſau</hi> didſt ſell thy Birth-right for a Meſs of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſhalt then find no place for repentance, though thou ſeek it with tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. Do you think that Chriſt ſhed his blood to ſave them that continue to make light of it? and to ſave them that value a Cup of Drink or a Luſt before his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? I tell you Sirs, though <hi>you</hi> ſet light by Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>God</hi> doth not ſo: He will not give them on ſuch Terms as theſe: He valueth the Blood of his Son, and the everlaſting Glory; and he will make <hi>you</hi> value them, if ever you have them. Nay, this will be thy condemnation, and leaveth no remedy. All the World cannot ſave him that ſets light by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 14 24. None of them ſhall taſte of his Supper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. Nor can you blame him to deny you what you made light of your ſelves. Can you find fault if you miſs of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which you ſlighted?</p>
            <p n="9">9, The time is near when Chriſt and Salvation will not be made light of as now they are. When God hath ſhaken thoſe careleſs Souls out of their Bodies, and you muſt anſwer for all your ſins in your own Name; O then, what what would you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66241:15"/>
give for a Saviour? when a thouſand Bills ſhall be brought in againſt you, and none to relieve you, then you will conſider, <hi>Oh, Chriſt would now have ſtood between me and the wrath of God: had I not deſpiſed him, he would have anſwered all.</hi> When you ſee the World hath left you, and your companions in ſin have deceived themſelves and you, and all your merry days are gone; then what would you give for that Chriſt and Salvation, that now you account not worth your labour? Do you think when you ſee the Judgment ſet, and you are doomed to everlaſting Perdition for your Wickedneſs, that you ſhould then make as light of Chriſt as now? Why will you not judge now, as you know you ſhall judge then? Will he then be worth ten thouſand Worlds, and is he not now worth your higheſt Eſtimation, and deareſt Affection?</p>
            <p n="10">10. God will not only deny thee that Salvation thou madeſt light of, but he will take from thee all that which thou didſt value before it: He that moſt highly eſteems Chriſt, ſhall have him and the creatures ſo far as they are good here, and him without the Creature hereafter, becauſe the Creature is not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and he that ſets more by the Creature than by Chriſt, ſhall have ſome of the Creature without Chriſt here, and neither Chriſt nor it hereafter.</p>
            <p>So much of theſe conſiderations, which may ſhew the true face of this hainous ſin.</p>
            <p>What think you now friends of this buſineſs? Do you not ſee by this time what a caſe that Soul is in that maketh light of Chriſt and Salvation? What need then is there that you ſhould take heed leſt this ſhould prove your own caſe: The Lord knows it is too common a caſe. Whoever is found guilty at the laſt of this ſin, it were better for that man he had never been born. It were better for him he had been a Turk or Indian, that never had heard the Name of a Saviour, and that never had Salvation offered to him: For ſuch men have no Cloak for their ſin, <hi>John</hi> 15. 22. Beſides all the reſt of their ſins, they have this killing ſin to anſwer for, which will undo them. And this will aggravate their miſery: <hi>That</hi> Chriſt whom they ſet light by, muſt be their Judge, and for <hi>this</hi> ſin will he judge them. Oh that ſuch would now conſider how they will anſwer that Queſtion that Chriſt puts to their Predeceſſors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 33. <hi>How will ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> or

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Can you eſcape without a Chriſt? or will a deſpiſed Chriſt ſave you then? If he be accurſed that ſet light by Father or Mother, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 16. What then is he that ſets light by Chriſt? It was the hainous ſin of the Jews, that among them were found ſuch as ſet light by Father and Mother, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 7. But among us men ſlight the Father of Spirits. In the Name of God Brethren, I beſeech you to conſider how you will then bear his Anger which you now make light of? You that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make light of a little ſickneſs or want, or of natural Death, no not of a Tooth-ach, but groan as if you were undone, how will you then make light of the Fury of the Lord, which will burn againſt the Contemners of his Grace? Doth it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove you beforehand to think of theſe things?</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have been convincing you of the evil of the ſin, and the danger that followeth: I come now to know your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for the time to come. What ſay you? Do you mean to ſet as light by Chriſt and Salvation as hitherto you have done? and to be the ſame men after all this? I hope not. Oh let not your Miniſters that would fain ſave you, be brought in as Witneſſes againſt you, to condemn you. At leaſt, I beſeech you put not this upon me. Why Sirs. If the Lord ſhall ſay to us at Judgment, Did you never tell theſe men what Chriſt did for their Souls, and what need they had of him, and how nearly it did concern them to look to their Salvation, that they made light of it? we muſt needs ſay the Truth: Yea Lord, we told them of it as plainly as we could; we would have gone on our knees to them, if we had thought it would have prevailed; we did intreat them as earneſtly as we could, to conſider theſe things: They heard of theſe things every day; but alaſs, we could never got them to their hearts; they gave us the hearing, but they made light of all that we could ſay to them. Oh ſad will it prove on your ſide, if you ſorce us to ſuch an Anſwer as this.</p>
            <p>But if the Lord do move the hearts of any of you, and you reſolve to make light of Chriſt no more: Or if any of you ſay, we do not make light of him; let me tell you here in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion what you muſt do, or elſe you ſhall be judged as ſlighters of Chriſt and Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66241:16"/>
And firſt I will tell you what will not ſerve the turn.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You may have a notional knowledge of Chriſt and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his blood, and of the excellency of Salvation, and yet periſh as neglecters of him. This is too common among profeſt Chriſtians. You may ſay all that other men do of him; What Goſpel paſſages had <hi>Balaam?</hi> Jeſus I know, and <hi>Paul</hi> I know, the very Devils could ſay, who believe and tremble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You may weep at the Hiſtory of his Paſſion, when you read how he was uſed by the Jews; and yet make light of him, and periſh for ſo doing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You may come deſirouſly to his word and ordinances. <hi>Herod</hi> heard gladly; ſo do many that yet muſt periſh as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecters of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You may in a ſit of fear have ſtrong deſires after a Chriſt, to eaſe you, and to ſave you from God's wrath: as <hi>Saul</hi> had of <hi>David</hi> to play before him; and yet you may periſh for making light of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You may obey him in many things, ſo far as will not ruine you in the World: and eſcape much of the Pollutions of the World by his knowledge, and yet neglect him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You may ſuffer and loſe much for him, ſo far as leaveth you an earthly Felicity; as <hi>Ananias;</hi> the young man. Some parcels of their pleaſures and proſits many will part with in hope of Salvation, that ſhall periſh everlaſtingly, for valuing it no more.</p>
            <p n="7">7. You may be eſteemed by others a man zealous for Chriſt, and loved and admired upon that account, and yet be one that ſhall periſh for making light of him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. You may verily think your ſelves, that you ſet more by Chriſt and Salvation than any thing, and yet be miſtaken, and be judged as Contemners of him: Chriſt juſtiſieth not all that juſtiſie themſelves.</p>
            <p n="9">9. You may be zealous Preachers of Chriſt and Salvation, and reprove others for this neglect, and lament the ſin of the World in like expreſſions as I have done this day; and yet if you or I have no better evidence to prove our hearty eſteem of Chriſt and Salvation, we are undone for all this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66241:17"/>
You hear Brethren what will <hi>not</hi> ſerve the turn; Will you now hear what perſons you <hi>muſt</hi> be if you would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ſlighters of Chriſt? O ſearch whether it be thus with your Souls, or no.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your eſteem of Chriſt and Salvation, muſt be greater than your eſteem of all the Honors, Profits, or Pleaſures of this World, or elſe you ſlight him: <hi>No leſs</hi> will be accounted ſincere, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to your Salvation: Think not this hard, when there is no compariſon in the matters eſteemed. To eſteem the greateſt Glory on Earth before Chriſt and Everlaſting Glory, is a greater Folly, and Wrong to Chriſt, than to eſteem a Dog before your Prince, would be folly in you, and a wrong to him. Scripture is plain in this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother, Wife, Children, Houſe, Land, or his own Life more than me, is not worthy of me, and cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You muſt manifeſt this eſteem of Chriſt and Salvation in your daily endeavours and ſeeking after him, and in parting with any thing that he ſhall require of you. God is a Spirit, and will not take an hypocritical Profeſſion inſtead of the heart and ſpiritual Service which he commandeth. He will have the heart or nothing; and the chief room in the heart too. Theſe muſt be had.</p>
            <p>If you ſay that you do not make light of Chriſt, or will not hereafter; let me try you in theſe few particulars, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you mean as you ſay, and do not diſſemble.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Will you for the time to come make Chriſt and Salvation the chiefeſt matter of your care and ſtudy? Thruſt them not out of your thoughts, as a needleſs and unprofitable Subject; nor allow it only ſome running ſlight thoughts, which will not affect you. But will you make it your buſineſs once a day to bethink you ſoberly when you are alone, What Chriſt hath done for you; and what he will do if you do not make light of it: and what it is to be everlaſtingly happy or miſerable? and what all things in this World are in compariſon of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and how they will ſhortly leave you? and what mind you will be then of; and how you will eſteem them? will you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me now and then to make it your buſineſs to withdraw your ſelves from the World, and ſet your ſelves to ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as theſe? If you will not, are not you ſlighters of Chriſt, and Salvation, that will not be perſwaded ſoberly to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66241:17"/>
think on them? This is my firſt Queſtion to put you to the Trial, whether you will value Chriſt or not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Will you for the time to come, ſet more by the Word of God, which contains the diſcovery of theſe excellent things, and is your charter for Salvation, and your guide thereunto? You cannot ſet by Chriſt, but you muſt ſet by his Word; Therefore the Deſpiſers of it are threatned with Deſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 13. Will you therefore attend to the publick preaching of this Word? will you read it daily? will you reſolve to obey it whatever it may coſt you? If you will not do this, but make light of the Word of God, you ſhall be judged as ſuch as make light of Chriſt and Salvation, whatever you may ſondly promiſe to your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Will you for the time to come eſteem more of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Chriſt, whom he he hath purpoſely appointed to guide you to Salvation? and will you make uſe of them for that end? Alas, it is not to give the Miniſter a good word, and ſpeak well of him, and pay him his Tythes duly, that will ſerve the turn: Is it for the neceſſity of your Souls that God hath ſet them in his Church; that they may be as Phyſitians under Chriſt, or his Apothecaries to apply his Remedies to your ſpiritual Diſeaſes, not only in publick, but alſo in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: That you may have ſome to go to for the reſolving of your doubts, and for your inſtruction where you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and for the help of their Exhortations and Prayers. Will you uſe hereafter to go to your Miniſters privately, and ſollicite them for advice? and if you have not ſuch of your own as are fit, get advice from others; and ask them, <hi>What you ſhall do to be ſaved, how to prepare for Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> and will you obey the Word of God in their Mouths? If you will not do this much, nor ſo much as enquire of thoſe that ſhould teach you, nor uſe the means which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Church for your help, your own Conſciences ſhall one day witneſs, that you were ſuch as made light of Chriſt and Salvation. If any of you doubt whether it be your duty thus to ask counſel of your Teachers, as ſick men do of their Phyſitians, let your own neceſſities reſolve you; let God's expreſs word reſolve you; ſee what is ſaid of the Prieſts of the Lord, even before Chriſt's coming, when much of their work did lie in Ceremonials! <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 5, 6. <hi>My Covenant was with him of life and peace: and I gave them to him</hi> (to <hi>Levi)</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:66241:18"/>
               <hi>for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. The Law of Truth was in his mouth, and Iniquity was not found in his lips; he walked with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from Iniquity. For the Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth: For he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, you muſt not only enquire, and ſubmit to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but alſo to their juſt reprehenſions, and Church cenſures: And without proud repining, ſubmit to the Diſcipline of Chriſt in their Hands, if it ſhall be uſed in the Congregations whereof you are Members.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Will you for the time to come, make Conſcience of daily and earneſt Prayer to God, that you may have a part in Chriſt and Salvation? do not go out of doors till you have breathed out theſe deſires to God; do not lie down to reſt till you have breathed out theſe deſires; ſay not, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my neceſſity without ſo often praying; for though he do, yet he will have you to know them, and feel them, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your deſires, and all the graces of his Spirit in theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: It is he that hath commanded to pray continually, tho' he know your needs without, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17. Chriſt himſelf ſpent whole nights in prayer, and encourageth us to this courſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. If you will not be perſwaded to this much, how can you ſay that you make not light of Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Will you for the time to come, reſolvedly caſt away your known ſins at the command of Chriſt? If you have been proud or contentious, or malicious and revengeful, be ſo no more. If you have been Adulterers, or Swearers, or Curſers, be ſo no more. You cannot hold theſe, and yet ſet by Chriſt and Salvation.</p>
            <p>What ſay you? Are you reſolved to let them go? If not, when you know 'tis the will of Chriſt, and he hath told you, ſuch ſhall not enter into his Kingdom, do not you make light of him?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Will you for the time to come, ſerve God in the <hi>deareſt</hi> as well as in the <hi>cheapeſt</hi> part of his ſervice; not only with your tongues, but with your purſes and your deeds? ſhall the poor find that you ſet more by Chriſt than this World? ſhall it appear in any good uſes that God calls you to be liberal in, according to your Abilities? Pure Religion and undefiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66241:18"/>
God is this; <hi>To viſit the Fatherleſs and the Widows in their afflictions,</hi> Jam. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Will you reſolve to ſtick to Chriſt, and make ſure this work of Salvation, tho' it coſt you all that you have in the World? If you think theſe terms too dear, you make light of Chriſt, and will be judged accordingly.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Will you for the time to come make much of all things that tend to your Salvation; and take every help that God offereth you, and gladly make uſe of all his Ordinances? At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon his ſtrengthening Sacraments, ſpend the Lord's own day in theſe holy Employments. Inſtruct your Children and Servants in theſe things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7. get into good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that ſet their faces Heaven ward, and will teach you the way, and help you thither: and take heed of the wicked Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, or fooliſh, voluptuous, fleſhly men, or any that would hinder you in this work. Will you do theſe things? Or will you ſhew that you are ſlighters of Chriſt by neglecting them?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Will you do all this with delight, not as your toyl, but as your pleaſure? and take it for your higheſt Honour that you may be Chriſt's Diſciples, and may be <hi>admitted</hi> to ſerve and worſhip him; and rejoyce with holy Confidence in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of that Sacrifice by which you may have pardon of all your failings, and right to the Inheritance of the Saints in light? If you will do theſe things ſincerely, you will ſhew that you ſet by Chriſt and Salvation; elſe not.</p>
            <p>Dearly Beloved in the Lord, I have now done that work which I came upon; what effects it hath, or will have upon your Hearts, I know not, nor is it any further in my power, to accompliſh that which my ſoul deſireth for you. Were it the Lord's will that I might have my wiſh herein, the words that you have this day heard, ſhould ſo ſtick by you, that the ſecure ſhould be awakended by them, and none of you ſhould periſh by the ſlighting of your Salvation. I cannot now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to your ſeveral Habitations, to apply this Word to your particular neceſſities: but oh that I could make every Man's <hi>Conſcience</hi> a Preacher to himſelf, that <hi>it</hi> might do it, which is ever with you: that the next time you go Prayerleſs to Bed, or about your buſineſs, Conſcience might cry out, <hi>Dost thou ſet no more by Chriſt and thy Salvation?</hi> that the next time you are tempted to think hardly of a holy and diligent life, (I will not ſay to deride it as <hi>more ado than needs)</hi> Conſcience might cry out, <hi>Doſt thou ſet ſo light by Christ and thy Salvation?</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:66241:19"/>
that the next time you are ready to ruſh upon known ſin, and to pleaſe your fleſhly deſires againſt the command of God, Conſcience might cry out, <hi>Is Christ and Salvation no more worth, than to caſt them away, or venter them for thy Luſts?</hi> that when you are following the World with your moſt eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, forgetting the World to come, and the change that is a little before you, Conſcience might cry out to you, <hi>Is Christ and Salvation no more worth than ſo?</hi> That when you are next ſpending the Lord's day in idleneſs or vain ſports, Conſcience might tell you what you are doing. In a word, that in all your neglects of duty, your ſticking at the ſuppoſed labour or coſt of a godly Life; yea, in all your cold and lazy Prayers and Performances, Conſcience might tell you, how unſuitable ſuch endeavours are to the Reward; and that Chriſt and Salvation ſhould not be ſo ſlighted. I will ſay no more but this at this time: It is a thouſand pities, that when God hath provided a Saviour for the World, and when Chriſt hath ſuffered ſo much for their ſins, and made a full ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſo glorious a Kingdom for his Saints, and all this is offered ſo freely to Sinners, to loſt unworthy Sinners, even for nothing, that yet ſo many millions ſhould everlaſtingly periſh, becauſe they <hi>made light of their Saviour and Salvation, and prefer the vain World and their Luſts before them.</hi> I have delivered my Meſſage, the Lord open your Hearts to receive it, I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded you with the <hi>Word</hi> of truth and ſoberneſs; the Lord perſwade you more effectually, or elſe all this is loſt.</p>
