            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>2. Thess. chap. 2.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the Table of the primitiue Church, hath beene (gentle Reader) set foorth and exhibited before thine eyes, the grievous aflictions and sorrowfull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which through GODS secreet sufferance, fell vpon the true Saincts and members of CHRISTS Church in that time, especially vpon the good Bishops, Ministers, and teachers of the flocke: of whom, some were scourged, some beheaded, some crucified, some burnt, some had their eyes put out, some one way, and some another, miserably consumed: which dayes of woefull calamitie continued neare the space of three hundreth yeares. During which time, the deare spouse and Elect Church of GOD, being sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assaulted on everie side, had small rest, no joy, nor outward safety in this present world, but in much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of heart, continuall teares and mourning vnder the crosse, passed over their dayes beeing spoyled, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, contemned, revyled, famished, tormented, and martyrde everie where, who neither durst well tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

at home for feare and dread, &amp; much lesse durst come abroade for the enemies, but onely by night, when they assembled as they might, sometimes to sing Psalmes and hymnes together. In all which their dreadfull dangers, and sorrowfull afflictions, notwithstanding the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the LORD left them not desolate: but the more their outward tribulations did increase, the more their inward consolations did abound: and the further off they seemed from the joyes of this life, the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was the LORD with them with grace and fortitude, to confirme and rejoyce their soules: and though their possessions and riches in this world were lost and spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet were they inriched with Heavenly gifts and treasures from aboue an hundreth fold, then was true Religion truely felt in heart. Then was Christianitie not in outward appearance shewed, but in inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection receaved, and the true image of the Church not in outward show presented, but in her perfect state effectuall. Then was the name and feare of GOD true in heart, not in lippes alone dwelling: faith then was fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, zeale ardent, prayer not swimming in the lips, but groaned out to GOD from the bottome of the spirit: Then was no pryde in the Church, nor lasoure to seeke riches, nor time to keepe them. Contentions for triffiles was not then so farre from Christians, that well were they when they could meete to pray together against the Devill, author of all dissention. Briefly the wholeChurch of CHRIST IESUS, with all the members thereof, the further it was from the type and shape of this world, the nearer it was to the blessed respect of GODS favour and supportation.</p>

            <head>The first rysing of the Bishops of Rome.</head>
            <p>AFter this long tyme of trouble, it pleased the LORD at length mercifully to looke vpon the Saincts and servants of his Sonne, to release their captivity, to release their miserie, and to binde vp the old dragon the Devill, which so long vexed them, whereby the Church began to aspyre to some more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: And the Bishops which before were as abjects, vtterly contemned of Emperors, through the providence of GOD, (which disposeth all things in his time after his owne will) beganne now of Emperours to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed and had in pryce: Furthermore, as Emperours grew more in devotion, so the Bishops more and more were exalted, not onely in favour, but also preferred vnto honour, in so much that in short space they became not quarter masters, but rather halfe Emperours with Emperours.</p>
            <p>After this in processe of time, as riches and worldly wealth crept into the Clergie, and that the Devill had poured his venome into the Church, (as the voyce was heard the same time over <hi>Constantinople</hi>) so true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie began to decay, and pryde to set in his foote, till at last they plaide as the Ivy with the Oake tree, which first beginning with a goodly greene show imbraceth him so long, till at the length it overgroweth him, and so sucketh all his moysture from him, setting his roote fast in his barke, till at last it both stiffleth the stocke, and killeth the branches, and so commeth to bee a nest of Owles, and all vncleane birds. Not vntruely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5396:4"/>
it was said of <hi>Augustine. Religio peperit divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias, &amp; filia, devoravit matrem: religion begateriches, and the daughter hath devored the mother:</hi> The verity whereof notoriously may appeare aboue all other in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Bishops of the same, for after that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> through favour of Emperours, was indued with lands, donations, possessions, and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, so that the Bishops thereof feeling the smacke of wealth, ease, and prosperitie, beganne to swell in pompe and pryde: the more they floorished in this world, the more GODS holy spirit forsooke them, till at last the said Bishops who at the first were poore, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low vpon the ground, and were persecuted long time, everie man treading vpon them in this world: now of persecuted people, began to be persecuters of others, and to tread vpon the neckes even of Emperours, and to bring the heads of Kings and Princes vnder their girdle. And not that onely that, but furthermore through pryde and riches, they were so farre gone from all religion, that in the verie end they became the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie of God (whom wee call Antichrist) prophecied of so long before by the Spirit of GOD to come, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Temple of GOD. &amp;c. Of whom we reade thus in the Epistle of <hi>Paul. 2. Thess.</hi> 2. where he saith, <hi>Wee beseech you brethren, by the comming of our LORD IESVS CHRIST, and by our fellowship together in him That yee bee not suddenly mooued in your minde, nor troubled, neither by spirite, nor by word, nor by letter, as it were from vs, as though the day of CHRIST were at hand. Let no man in any wayes deceiue you, for that day shall not come, except there come a departing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5396:4"/>
first, and that that man of sinne bee revealed, even the sonne of perdition, that adversarie which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himselfe aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that hee shall sit in the Temple of GOD, as God, and set foorth himselfe as hee were GOD,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY which words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> wee haue diverse things to vnderstand: First that the day of the LORDS com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was not then neare at hand. Secondly, The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle giving vs a token before, to know when that day shall approach, biddeth vs looke for an adversarie first to bee revealed. Thirdly to show what adversarie this shall bee, hee expresseth him not to bee as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon adversarie, such as were then in his time. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Herod, Annas,</hi> and <hi>Cajaphas,</hi> the hie Priests, and Pharisies, <hi>Tertullus, Alexander</hi> the Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith, <hi>Elymas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, were great adversaries, yet heere hee meaneth another besides these, greater then all the rest, not such a one as should bee like to Priest, King, or Emperour, but such as farre exceeding the estate of all Kings; Priests, and Emperours, should be the Prince of Priests, and should make Kings to stoup, and should tread vpon the necke of Emperours, and make them to kisse his feete. Moreover, where the Apostle sayeth, that hee shall sit in the Temple of GOD, thereby is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not the personall sitting of the Pope, in the Citie only of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the authoritie and iurisdiction of his Sea exalted in the whole vniversall Church equall with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5396:5"/>
GOD himselfe. For let men giue to the Pope, that which hee in his lawes, decrees, and in his pontificall requyreth, and what difference is there betwixt GOD and the Pope? If GOD set lawes and ordinances, so doth hee: If GOD hath his creatures, so hath hee: If GOD require obedience so doth hee: If the breach of GODS commandements bee punished, much more bee his. GOD hath his religion, the Pope also hath his: Yea for GODS one Religion, he hath an hundreth: GOD hath set vp one Advocate, hee hath an hundreth: GOD hath instituted but a few holy dayes: for GODS one, hee hath instituted fourtie: And if the holie day that GOD hath appoynted, bee <hi>Simplex:</hi> The feast that the Pope appoynteth is <hi>duplex &amp; triplex.</hi> CHRIST is the head of the Church, so is the Pope: CHRIST giveth influence to his bodie, so doth the Pope: CHRIST for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth sinne, the Pope doth no lesse: CHRIST expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth evill spirits by hispower; so pretendeth the Pope by his holy water: Furthermore, where CHRIST went barefooted vpon the bare ground, hee with his golden shooes is caried vpon mens shoulders. And where CHRIST was called, <hi>Sanctus Sanctorum:</hi> Heeis called <hi>Sanctorum Sanctissimus:</hi> CHRIST never practised but onely the spirituall sword, hee claimeth both spirituall and temporall: CHRIST bought the Church: Hee both buyeth and selleth the Church. And if it bee necessarie to beleeue CHRIST to bee the Saviour of the world: so is it necessarie to beleeuethe Pope to bee the head of the Church: CHRIST payed tribute vnto <hi>Caesar:</hi> hee maketh <hi>Caesar</hi> pay tribute vnto him; Finallie, the Crowne of CHRIST was of sharpe thornes: The Pope hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5396:5"/>
three crownes of gold vpon his head, so farre exceeding CHRIST the Sonne of GOD in glorie of this world, as CHRIST exceedeth him in the Glorie of HEAVEN. The image and paterne of whose intolerable pryde and exaltation, according as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> doeth descryue him in his Epistle foresaid, wee haue heere set foorth, not only in these tables to bee seene, and by his owne facts to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but also by his owne words &amp; Registers; Clementines, Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagants and Pontificals, expressed as in order (the LORD wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) shall follow.</p>

            <p>FIrst, after that <hi>Italy</hi> and the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> were overrunne by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> so that the seate of the Empyre was remooved to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> then beganne <hi>Ioannes</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> to put foorth himselfe, and would needs bee called vniversall Bishop of the world: but the Bishop of Rome in no case would suffer that, and stopped it. After this came the Emperours deputy, and Exarch of <hi>Ravenna</hi> to rule <hi>Italy:</hi> but the Bishop of Rome, through ayde of the King of <hi>Lombards</hi> sone quailed him. Not long after about the yeare of the LORD fyue hundreth, came <hi>Phocas</hi> the murthrer, who slew the Emperour of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>

his master <hi>Maureits</hi> and his children. By which <hi>Phocas,</hi> the Bishops of old Rome aspyred first to their preheminence, to bee counted the head Bishops over the whole Church, and so together with the <hi>Lombardes</hi> beganne to rule the Citie of Rome: Afterwards when the <hi>Lombardes</hi> would not yeeld to him, in accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ambitious desire, but would needs requyre of the Bishop the said Citie of Rome: hee stirred vp <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus,</hi> but first deposed <hi>Childericus</hi> the King of France, and so thrusting him into an Abbey, set vp in his place <hi>Pipinus</hi> and his sonne <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> to put downe the said King of <hi>Lombardes</hi> called <hi>Aistulphus:</hi> and so translated the Empyre from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> divyding the spoyle betweene him and them: so that the Kings of France, had all the possessions and lands which before belonged to the Empyre, and hee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of them the quyet possession of the citie of Rome, with such donations and Lordships, which now they challenge vnto them, vnder the name of S. <hi>Peters</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, which they falsely ascrybe to that donation of <hi>Constantinus</hi> the great.</p>
            <p>It followed then in processe of time, after the dayes of <hi>Pipinus, Carolus,</hi> and <hi>Lodovicus,</hi> (who had indued these Bishops of Rome, called now Popes, with large possessions) when the King of France were not apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their becke, to ayde and maintaine them against the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who began then to push the saides Bishops for their wrongfull vsurped goods, they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the Germans, to redact the Empyre to <hi>Otho,</hi> first of that name Duke of Spaine, referring the election thereof to seven Princes electors of Germany, which

            <p>At length when some of these Germane Emperours also, after <hi>Otho</hi> beganne a little to spurne against the said Bishops and Popes of Rome, some of them they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, some they subdued and brought to the kissing of their feete, some they deposed, and placed others in their possessions.</p>
            <p>So was <hi>Henricus</hi> 4. by these Bishops accursed, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himselfe forced with his wife and chyld, to waite attendance vpon the Popes pleasure three dayes and three nights in Winter at the gates of <hi>Canossus.</hi> Besids all this the said Pope raised vp <hi>Rodolpus</hi> to bee Emperour against him: who being slaine in warre, then the said Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. not resisting this, stirred vp his owne sonne <hi>Henricus</hi> 5. to fight against his owne naturall father, to depose him, which <hi>Henricus</hi> 5. was also himselfe accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed afterward, and excommunicated, and the <hi>Saxons</hi> at last set vp by the Bishops to fight against him.</p>
            <p>After this the Emperours began to bee somewhat calmed, and more quyet, suffering the Bishops to reigne as they listed, till <hi>Fredericke</hi> the first called <hi>Barbarossa</hi> came, and beganne to stirre coales against them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they hampered both him and his sonne <hi>Henry</hi> in such sort, that they brought first the necke of <hi>Frederick</hi> in the Church of <hi>Venice,</hi> vnder their feete to tread v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: and after that the said Bishops crowning <hi>Henricus</hi> his sonne in the Church of S. Peter, set his crowne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his head with their feete, &amp; with their feete spurned
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5396:7"/>
it off againe, to make him know that the Popes of Rome had power both to crowne Emperours, and depose them againe.</p>
            <p>Then followed <hi>Philippus</hi> brother to <hi>Henry</hi> aforesaid, whom also the Popes accursed, about the yeare of our LORD 1198. and set vp <hi>Otho</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxon.</hi> But when the said <hi>Otho</hi> began to bee so saucie to dispossesse the Bishops of their cities and lands, which they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crotched into their bands, they could not beare that, but incontinent they put him besides the cusheon. The like also fell vpon <hi>Otho</hi> the 4. that followed after <hi>Philip,</hi> who was suffered no longer then foure yeares to reigne, about the yeare of the LORD 1209.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Fredericus</hi> 2. the sonne of <hi>Fredericus Barbarossa,</hi> was but young, whom the Bishops of Rome supposing to finde more mortified and tamed to their hand, advanced to bee Emperour after his father: But that fell out much contrarie to their expectation: for hee perceiving the immoderate pompe and pryde of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bishops, which hee could in no case abyde, so netled them, and cut their combs, and waxed so stout against them, intending to extirpe their tyranie and to reduce their pompous riches to the state and condition of the primitiue Church againe, putting some of them to flight, and prisoning some of their Cardinals, that of three Popes, one after another hee was accursed, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented by tieason, at last deposed, and after that poysoned, and last forsaken and died.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Frederick</hi> followed his sonne <hi>Conradus,</hi> whom the foresaid Bishops for his disobedience soone dispatched, exciting against him in mortall warre the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5396:7"/>
Lantgraue of <hi>Thuring,</hi> whereby at length hee was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into his Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and there deceast.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Conradus</hi> had a sonne called <hi>Conradinus,</hi> Duke and Prince of <hi>Swevill,</hi> where this <hi>Conradinus</hi> after the decease of his father, came to enjoy the Kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Bishops stirred vp against him, <hi>Charles</hi> the French Kings brother in such sort, that through craftie conveyance, both <hi>Conradinus</hi> which descended of the blood of so many Emperours, and also <hi>Frederik</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> were both taken, and after much wretched handling in their miserable indurance vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their state, at length were both brought vnder the axe, by the Popes procurement, and so both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed: and thus ended the imperiall stocke of <hi>Frederik</hi> the first surnamed <hi>Barbarossa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like also happened to <hi>Frederik</hi> the Emperour, had almost fallen vpon <hi>Philip</hi> the French King, by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. who because hee could not haue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and revenewes out of France after his will, sent out his bils and letters patents to displace King <hi>Philip</hi> aforesaid, and to possesse <hi>Albertus</hi> King of Romans in his rowme.</p>
            <p>And this hitherto of forraine stories: Now touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our countrie Princes heere in England, so speake somewhat likewayes of them: did not Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the third presumptuously taking vpon him where hee had nothing to doe to intermeddle with the Kings subjects.</p>
            <p>For the death of <hi>Becket</hi> the rebell, albeit the King fusficiently cleared himselfe thereof, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did he not wrongfully bring the said King <hi>Henry</hi> 2.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5396:8"/>
to such pennance as it pleased him to enjoyne, and also violently constrained him to sweare obedience to the Sea of Rome. The like also was shewed before in this storie to happen to King <hi>Iohn</hi> his sonne, for when the said King like a valiant Prince, had held out the tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranie of those Bishops eleven yeares together, was not all the Churches of England barred vp, and his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with all his dominions given away by Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the 3. to <hi>Lodovicus</hi> the French King, and he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward compelled to submit both himselfe, and to make his whole Realme fedetary to the Bishops of Rome, and moreover, the King himselfe driven also to surrander his Crowne to <hi>Pandulphus</hi> the Popes Legate: and so continued a privat person, 5 dayes standing at the Popes courtesie whether to receive it againe or not? And when the Nobles of the Realme rose afterward against the King for the same, was not hee then glad to seeke and sue to the foresaid Pope for succour, as by his owne letter, taken out of the publicke rolles may appeare.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5396:9"/>
in style as followeth. 2. First my institution began in the old Testament, and was consummate and finished in the New, in that my Preift-hood was prefigurated by <hi>Aaron:</hi> and other Bishops vnder me were prefigured by the sonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that were vnder him. 3. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to bee thought that my Church of Rome hath beene preferred by any generall Councill, but obtained the Primacy onely by the voyce of the Ghospell, and the mouth of the Saviour. 4. And hath in it neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such like thing. 5. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as other seats bee all inferiour to mee, and as they cannot absolue me: so haue they no power to bind mee or to stand against me, no more then the axe hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to stand or presume aboue him that heweth with it, or the Saw to presume aboue him that ruleth it. 6. This is the holy and Apostolick mother Church of all other Churches of CHRIST. 7. From whose rules it is not meete that any person or persons should declyne, but lyke as the Sonne of GOD, came to doe the will of his Father, so much yee doe the will of your mother the Church, the head whereof is the Church of Rome. 8. And if any other person or persons shall erre from the said Church, either let them be admonished, or els their names taken, to bee knowne who they bee that swerue from the customes of Rome. 9. Thus then for as much as the holy Church of Rome, whereof I am governour, is set vp to the whole world for a glasse or example, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would what thing soever the said Church determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, or ordaineth, that to bee receaved of all men for a generall and a perpetuall rule for ever. 10. Wherevpon we see it now verified in this Church, that was forepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5396:10"/>
by <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Saying: <hi>Behold I haue set thee vpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nations and kingdomes, to plucke vp and to breake downe, to build and to plant.</hi> 11. Who so vnderstandeth not the prerogatiue of this my Preist-hood, let him looke vp to the firmament, where he may see two great lights, the Sunne and Moone: one ruling over the day, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over the night: So in the firmament of the vniversall Church. 12. GOD hath set two great dignities, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Pope and the Emperour: Of the which two, this our dignitie is so much weightier, as wee haue the greater charge to giue accoumpt to GOD for Kings of the earth, and the lawes of men. 13. Wherefore bee it knowne to you Emperours, which know it also right well, that yee depend vnto the judgement of vs, we must not bee brought and reduced to your will. 14. For as I said, looke what difference there is betwixt the Sunne and the Moone, so great is the power of the Pope ruling over the day, that is, over the spirituality, aboue Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings, ruling over the the night: that is, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Laytie. 15. Now seing the earth is seven times bigger then the Moone, and the Sunne eight times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the earth, it followeth that the Popes dignitie 56 tymes doeth surmount the estate of the Emperours. 16. Vpon consideration whereof, I say therefore and pronunce that <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour did naught in setting the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> at his feete on his left hand. 17. And although the said Emperour, wrote to mee, alledging the words of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> commanding vs to submit our selves to everie humane creature, as to Kings, Dukes, and other for the cause of GOD. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Yet in answering againe in my decretall, I exponed the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5396:10"/>
minds and words of S. <hi>Pet.</hi> to pertaine to his subjects, and not his successors, willing the said Emperor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the person of the speaker, and to whom it is spoken, for, if the minde of Peter had beene there to debase the order of Priest-hood, and to make vs vnderlings to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie humane creature, then everie <hi>lack</hi> might haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over Prelats: which maketh against the example of CHRIST, setting vp the order of Priesthood to beare domination over Kings: According to the saying of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie: Behold I haue set thee vp over Kings and Nations:</hi> 18. And as I feared not then to wryte this boldly vnto <hi>Constantine,</hi> so now I say vnto all other Emperours, that they receaving of mee their approbation, vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, consecration, and Crowne Imperiall, must not disdaine to submitte their heads vnder mee, and sweare vnto mee their alleadgeance: 19. For so you reade in the decree of Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> how that Princes heeretofore have beene wont to bowe and submit their heads vnto Bishops, and not to proceede in judgment against the heads of Bishops. 20. If this reverence and submission was wont to be given to Bishops, how much more ought they to submit their heads to me, being superior, not only to Kings, but Emperours, and that for two causes: first, for my title of succession, that I Pope of Rome haue to the Empyre, the rowme standing vacant. Also for the fullnesse of power that CHRIST King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords, hath given to mee tho vnworthie in the person of <hi>Peter.</hi> 21. By reason whereof, seeing my power is not of man but of GOD, who by his celestiall providence hath set mee over his vniversall Church; maister and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, it belongeth therefore to my office to looke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5396:11"/>
everie mortall sinne of everie Christian man. 22. Whereby all criminall offences als well of Kings as all other bee subject to my censure. 23. In such sort that in all manner of pleading, if any manner of person at any time either before the sentence given or after shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to mce, it shall bee lawfull for him so to doe. 24. Neither must Kings and Princes thinke it much to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues to my judgement, for so did <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> the worthie Emperour: so did <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and also <hi>Carolus.</hi> 25. Thus yee see must bee all judged by mee, and I of no man, yea, although I Pope of Rome, by my negligence or evill demanure bee found vnprofitable, or hurtfull, either to my selfe or others: Yea if I should draw with mee innumerable soules by heaps to hell, yet no mortall man be so hardie, so bold, so presumptuous to reproue mee. 26. Or to say to mee, <hi>Domine cur it a facis?</hi> Sir why doe yee so? 27. For although yee read that <hi>Balaam</hi> was rebuked of his Asse, by the which Afse our subjects, by <hi>Balaam</hi> wee Prelats are signified: Yet that ought to bee no example to our subjects to rebuke vs. 28 And though wee read in the Scripture, that <hi>Peter,</hi> who receaved power of the Kingdome, and being cheife of the Apostles, might by vertue of his office, controle all others, was content to come and giue answere before his inferiors, objecting to him his going to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet other inferiors must not learne by this example to bee check-meat with their Prelats, because <hi>Peter</hi> so tooke it at their hands, shewing thereby rather a dispensation of humilitie, then the power of his office: by the which power hee might haue said to them againe, It becometh not sheepe, nor belongeth to their osfice to accuse their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5396:11"/>
sheepheard. 29. For els why was <hi>Dioscorus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> condemned and excommunicated at <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> not for any cause of his faith, but onely that hee durst stand against the Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and durst excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Bishope of Rome, for who is hee that hath authoritie to accuse the seat of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> 30. Albeit I am not ignorant what S. <hi>Ierome</hi> wryteth, that Paul would not haue reprehended Peter, vnlesse he had thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe equall vnto him. 31. Yet <hi>Ieremy</hi> must thus be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by my interpretation, that this equalitie betwixt Peter and Paul, consisteth not in like osfice of dignitie, but in purenes of conversation. 32. For who gaue Paul li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to preach, but Peter, &amp; that by authoritie of GOD, saying, <hi>Separato mihi Paulum &amp; Barnabam:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be it knowne to al men, that my Church of Rome, is prince and head ofall Nations. 33. The mother of the faith. 34. The foundation cardinall, wherevpon all Churches doe depend, as the doore doth depend vpon the hinges. 35. The first of all other seats without all spot or blemish. 36. Lady mistris and instructor of all Churches. 37. A glasse and spectacle vnto all men to be followed in all whatsoever shee observeth. 38. Which was never found yet to slyde, or declyne from the path of Apostolicke tradition, or to bee intangled with any newnesse of heresies. 39. Against which Church of Rome, whosoever speaketh any evill, is foorthwith an hereticke. 40. Yea a verie Pagan, a witch, and an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later or Infidell. 41. Having fulnesse of power onely in her owne hand in ruling. 42. Decyding, absolving, condemning, casting out or receaving in. 43. Albeit I deny not but other Churches bee partakers with her in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5396:12"/>
labouring and carying. 44. To the which Church of Rome it is lawfull to appeale for remedie from the Churches, although it was otherwise concluded in the generall councill of <hi>Millevit an:</hi> that no man fhould appeale over the Sea vnder the paine of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet my Glose commeth in heere with an exception: <hi>Nisi forte Romanam sedem appellauerint. Id est:</hi> Except the appeale bee to the Sea of Rome. 45. By the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of which Church of Rome, all Synodes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes of councils stand confirmed. 46. And hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes full authoritie in his hands to make new lawes &amp; decreements, and to alter statutes, priviledges, rights or documents of Churches, to separat things joyned, and to joyne things separated, vpon right consideration, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole or in part, either personally or generally. 47. Of the which Church of Rome I am head, as a King is over his judges. 48. The vicar of S. Peter. 49. Yea not the vicar of S. Peter properly, but the vicar of CHRIST properly, and successour of Peter. 50. Vicar of IE sus CHRIST. 51. Rector of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church, director of the LORDS vniversall flocke. 52. Chiefe magistrat of the whole world. 53. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> i. caput, the head and chiefe of the Apostolick Church. 54. Vniversall Pope, and Diocesan in all places exempt, aswell as everie Bishop is in places not exempt. 55. Most mightie Priest. 56. <hi>Lex animata in terris.</hi> i. 57. A living Lawe in the earth judged to have all Lawes in the chest of my breast. 58. Bearing the rowm of no poore man. 59. Being neither God nor man, but the admiration of the world, and a middle thing betwixt both. 60. Having both swords in my power, both of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5396:12"/>
the spirituall and temporall jurisdiction. 61. So farre surmounting the authoritie of the Emperour, that I of my owne power alone without a Councill, have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to depose him, or to trans-ferre his kingdome, and to giue a new election, as I did to <hi>Frederick,</hi> and diverse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 62. What power then or Protestat in all the world is comparable to me: who haue authoritie to bind and louse both in Heaven and earth. 63. That is, who haue power both of heavenly things, and also of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things. 64. To whom Emperours, and Kings are more inferiour, than Lead is inferiour to Gold. 65. For doe you not see the neckes of great Kings, and Princes bend vnder our knees, yea, and think themselves happy and well defenced, if they maye kisse our hands. 66. Wherefore the sawcinesse of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperour is to bee reprehended, and his constitution abolished, who with his laytie would take vpon him to intermeddle, not only with the temporall order, but also with matters ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, and election of the Pope. 67. But heere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance some will object the examples and wordes of Christ, saying, that his Kingdome is not of this world, and where he being required to divide betwixt two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren their heritage, did refuse it; but that ought not to bee no prejudice to my power. 68. For if <hi>Peter,</hi> and I in <hi>Peter,</hi> if wee say, haue power to bind and louse in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, how much more then is it to bee thought, that wee have power in earth to louse and to take away Empyres, Kingdomes, Dukedomes, and what els so ever mortall men may have, and to give them where wee will? 69. And if wee haue authoritie over Angels, which bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours over Princes, what then maye wee doe vpon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5396:13"/>
their inferiours and servants? 70. And for that you shall not marvell that I say; Angels bee subject vnto vs, you shall heare what my blessed Clerk <hi>Antonius</hi> writeth of the matter, saying, that our power, of <hi>Peter</hi> and mee, is greater than the Angels in foure things. 1. In jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. In administration of Sacraments. 3. In know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 4. and reward. 71. And again <hi>in bulla Clemen tis,</hi> doe I not their command in my Bull, the Angels of Paradise to absolve the soule of man out of Purgatorie, and to bring it into the glorie of Paradise. 72. And now besides my heavenly power, to speak of my earthly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, who did first translate the Empyre from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>Almanes,</hi> but I? 73. And not onely in the Empyre am I Emperour, the place being emptie, but in all ecclesiasticall benefices have full right and power to translate, and to depose after my arbitriment. 74. Did not I <hi>Zacharias</hi> put downe <hi>Childerick</hi> the old King of <hi>France,</hi> and set vp <hi>Pipinus?</hi> 75. Did not I <hi>Gregorius</hi> the seventh set vp <hi>Robert Wisard,</hi> and made him King of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cappa</hi> &amp;c. 76. Did not I the same <hi>Gregorius</hi> also set vp <hi>Rodulphus</hi> against <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4 Em perour? 77. And though that this <hi>Henricus</hi> was an Em perour of most stout courage, who stood 62 times in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen field against his enemies. 78. Yet did not I <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, coram nobis,</hi> and made him stand at my gate, three dayes and three nights bare-footed, and bare-legged, with his wife and chyld, in the deepe of winter, both in frost and snow, intreating for his absolution, and after excommunicated him againe, so that hee was twise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated in my dayes? 79. And did not I <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalis</hi> after <hi>Gregorie</hi> set vp the son of the said <hi>Henricus</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:5396:13"/>
against his father, in warre to possesse the Empyre, and to put downe his father, and so hee did. 80. Item, did not I Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> bring vnto <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, King of <hi>England,</hi> for the death of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> and to cause him goe bare-foooted to his tombe at <hi>Cantur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrie</hi> with bleeding feet? 81. Did not I <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, cause King <hi>Iohn</hi> to kneele downe at the feete of <hi>Pandulphus</hi> my Legate, and offer vp his Crowne to his hands: also to kisse the feete of <hi>Steven Langtoun,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Canturberrie,</hi> and besides that merced him a thousand merks by yeare. 82. Did not I <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the second, put downe <hi>Hugo</hi> Erle in <hi>Italie,</hi> discharging his subjects from their oath and obedience to him? 83. Did not I <hi>Pascha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> excommunicate also his son <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and gotte out of his hands all his right, and title of elections, and donations of spirituall promotions? 84. Did not I <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius</hi> the second bring the Captaine <hi>Cnitius</hi> vnder, vnto the kissing of my feete, and after <hi>Gelasius?</hi> 85. Did not I <hi>Calixtus,</hi> quaile the foresaid Emperour <hi>Henricus,</hi> and also bring in subjection <hi>Gregorie,</hi> whom the said Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had set vp against mee to be Pope, bringing him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rome</hi> vpon a Camell, his face to the horse taile, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to hold the horse taile in his hand in stead of a brydle? 86. Further, did not I <hi>Innocentius</hi> the second set vp and make <hi>Lotharius</hi> to bee Emperour, for driving out Pope <hi>Anacletus</hi> out of Rome? 87. Did not I the said <hi>Innocentius</hi> take the Dukedome of <hi>Sicilie</hi> from the Empyre, and made <hi>Roger</hi> to bee King thereof, whereby afterward the Kingdome became the patrimonie of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> 88. Did not I <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, suspend all the Realme and Churches of England for the Kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5396:14"/>
1159? 88. But what doe I speake of Kings? did not I the saide <hi>Alexander</hi> bring the valiant Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the first to <hi>Venice,</hi> by reason of his son <hi>Otho,</hi> their taken prisoner, and there in S. <hi>Marks</hi> Church made him fall downe flat vpon the ground, while I did set my feete vpon his necke, saying the verse of the <hi>TSALME, Super aspidem &amp; basiliscum ambulabis:</hi> 89. Did not I <hi>Adrianus</hi> Pope, an English man borne, excommunicate <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Cicile</hi> and refuse his peace, which hee offered, and had he not overcome me in plaine field, I would haue shaken him out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Cicile,</hi> and Dukedome of <hi>Apulia.</hi> 90. Also did not I the said <hi>Adrianus,</hi> controll and correct the foresaid <hi>Fredericus</hi> Emperour, for holding the left stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruppe of my horse, when hee should haue holden the right. 91. And afterward did not I excommunicate &amp; curse him, for that he was so sawsie to set his owne name in wrytting mine. 92. And although a poore flie after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward overcame and strangled me, yet I made Kings and Emperours to stoup. 93. Did not I <hi>Innocentius</hi> 3. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Philippus,</hi> brother to <hi>Fredericus</hi> from the imperiall Crowne, being elected without my leaue, and after set him vp againe, and also set vp <hi>Otho</hi> of <hi>Brounswick,</hi> and after did excommunicate and also depose the same foure yeares, setting vp the French King to warre against him. 94. Then was <hi>Fredericus</hi> 2. by mee set vp and reigned thirtie seven yeares, and yet fyue yeares before, he died. 95. Did not I <hi>Honorius</hi> interdict him, for not restoring certaine to their possessions at my request. 96. Whom also <hi>Gregorius</hi> 9. did excommunicate twyse together, &amp; and raised vp the <hi>Venetians</hi> against him. 97. And at
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5396:14"/>
length <hi>Innocentius</hi> spoyled him of his Empyre, after that hee caused him to bee poysoned, at length to bee strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by one <hi>Manfredus,</hi> and did excommunicate his sonne <hi>Conradus</hi> after him, not onely depryving him of his right inheritance, but also caused him with <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> to be beheaded. 98. Thus then did not I excommunicate and depose all these Emperours in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? <hi>Henricus</hi> 4. <hi>Henricus</hi> 5. <hi>Fredericus</hi> I. <hi>Philippus, Otho, Fredericus</hi> 2. and <hi>Conradus</hi> his sonne. 99. Did not I interdict King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight. 100. And all his kingdome of England. 101. And had not his prudence and power prevented my practise, I had displaced him from his kingdome, also briefly who is able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the greatnesse of my power, and of my seate. 102. For by mee only generall Councills take their force and confirmation. 103. And the interpretation of the saids councils, and of all other causes hard and doubtfull ought to bee referred and stand to my interpretation. 104. By me the workes of all wrytters, whatsoever they bee, either bee reprooved or allowed. 105. Then how much more ought my wryttings and decrees to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other? 106. In so much that my letters and epistles decretall bee equivalent, with the generall councils. 107. And where GOD hath ordained al causes of men, to bee judged by men, hee hath onely reserved mee, That is, The Pope of Rome, without all question of men, vnto his owne judgement. 108. And therefore where all other creatures bee vnder their judge, onely I who in earth am the judge of all, can bee judged of none, neither Emperour nor the whole Clergie, nor Kings, nor of the people. 109. For who hath power to judge v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5396:15"/>
his judge? 110. This judge am I, and that alone, without any other assistance of any counsell joyned to mee, for I haue power vpon counsels, counsels haue no power over mee. But if the counsell determine amisse, it is my aurhoritie alone to infring it, or to condemne who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I list without any counsell. 111. And all for the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minene of my predecessor blessed S. Peter, which by the voyce of the LORD, hee receaved, and ever shall retaine. 112. Furthermore, and whereas all other sentences and judgements, both of counsels, person or persons, may and ought to bee examined. 113. For that they may be corrupted foure wayes: <hi>by feare, by gifts, by hatred, by favour:</hi> onely my sentence and judgement must stand. 114. As given out of Heaven by the mouth of Peter him selfe, which no man must 115. Breake nor retract. 116. No man must dispute or doubt of. 117. Yea if my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, statute, or yoke, seeme scarcelie tolerable, yet for remembrance of S. Peter it must bee humblie obeyed. 118. Yea and moreover, obedience is to bee given not onely to such decrees set foorth by mee in time of my Popedome, but also to such as I doe foresee and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to wrytting before I bee Pope. 119. And although it bee thought by some wrytters to bee given to all men to erre, and deccaved. 120. Yet, neither am I a poore man. 121. And againe the sentence of my Apostolick seat is alwayes conceaved with such moderation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct and digested, with such patience and rypnesse, and delivered out with such gravitie of delebiration, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is thought in it necessary to be altered or detracted 122. Wherefore it is manifest, and testified by the voice of holie Bishops, that the dignitie of this my seat is to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5396:15"/>
reverenced through the whole world, in that all the faith full submit themselues to it as to the head of the whole bodie. 123. Whereof it is spoken to mee by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, speaking of the Arke, if this bee humbled whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall yee runne for succour, and where shall your glory become? seing then this is so, that so holie Bishops and Scriptures doe witnesse with mee, what shall we say then to such as will take vpon them to judge of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to reprehend my proceedings, or to require hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and tribute of mee, to whom all other are subject. 124. Against the first sort the Scripture speaketh. <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternomie: Thou oughtest not to put thy syth in another mans Corne.</hi> Which thing to attempt against mee, what is it but plaine sacriledge? 125. According to my Canonists, which thus defyne sacriledge to consist in three things: either when a man judgeth of his Princes judgement: or when the holie day is prophained: or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reverence is not given to Lawes and Canons. 126. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the second sort maketh the place of the booke of Kings, where wee reade the Arke of GOD was brought from Gaba to Ierusalem, and in the way the Arke inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by reason of the vnruely oxen. <hi>Ozias</hi> the Levit put to his hand to helpe, and therefore was stricken of the LORD: By this Arke is signified the Prelats, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination thereof, the fall of Prelats. 127. Which also bee signified by the Angels, that <hi>Iacob</hi> did see going vp and downe the ladder. 128. Also by the Prophet, where hee sayeth, hee bowed downe the Heavens and came downe: By <hi>Ozias</hi> and the vnruelie oxen are meaned our subjects. 129. Then like as <hi>Ozias</hi> was striken for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand to the Arke inclyning, no more must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:5396:16"/>
rebuke their Prelats going away. 130. Albeit heere may be answered againe, that all bee not Prelats, which bee so called, for it is not the name that maketh a Bishop, but the life. 131. Against the third sort of such as would bring vs vnder the tribute and exactions of secular men, making the New Testament, where Peter was bid to giue the groate in the fishes mouth, but not the head nor bodie of the fish: No more is the head or bodie of the Church subdued to Kings, but onely that which is in the mouth, that is, the extern things of the Church, and yet not they neither. 132. For so wee read in the booke of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the time, of derth, subdued all the land of the Egyptians, but yet hee ministred to the Preists, so that hee neither tooke their possessions from them, nor their libertie: If then the Prelats of the Church must bee neither judged, nor reprehended, nor exacted, how much more ought I to bee free from the same? 133 Which am the Bishop of Bishops, and head of Prelats. 134. For it is not to bee thought that the case betwixt mee and other Prelats: betwixt my Sea and other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bee like. 135. Although the whole Catholick &amp; Apostolicke Church make a brydechamber of Christ, yet the Catholick and Apostolick Church of Rome, had the preheminence given over all other by the mouth of the LORD himselfe, saying to Peter. <hi>Thou art Peter.</hi> 136. Thus a discretion and difference must bee had in the Church, as it was betwixt <hi>Aaron</hi> and his children: 137. Betwixt the threescore and twelue Disciples, and the twelue Apostles, betwixt the other Apostles and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 138. Wherefore it is to bee concluded, an order &amp; difference of degrees in the Church, betwixt powers,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:5396:16"/>
rior and inferior, without which order the vniversitie of the whole cannot consist. 139. For as amongst the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall creatures aboue in Heaven, there is set a difference and inequalities of powers and orders, some to bee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, some Archangels, some Cherubins, some Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, 140. So in the Ecclesiasticall hierarchie of the Church militant heere on earth, Priests must not bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with Bishops, Bishops must not bee like in order with Arch-Bishops, with Patriarchs, or Primats, 141. Who containe vnder them three Arch-Bishops, as a King containeth three Dukes vnder him, in the which number of Patriarchs, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in the stare also of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fourty two Cardinals or principals, fo called, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the doore turneth by his hinges, so the vniversall Church ought to be ruled by them. 142. The next &amp; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est order aboue these, is mine, who am Pope, differing in power &amp; majoritie, and honour reverentiall, from these &amp; all other decrees of men. 144. For the better declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on whereof, my Canonists make three kynds of power in the earth: <hi>Immediato,</hi> which is mine immediatly from GOD: <hi>Derivato,</hi> which belongeth to other inferior Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats from me. 145. <hi>Ministralis</hi> belonging to Emperors and Princes to minister for mee, for the which cause the anoynting of Princes and my consecration doth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, for they are anoynted onely in the armes or shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and I in the head, to signifie, the difference of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er betwixt Princes and mee. 146. This order therefore of Priests, Bishops and Arch-Bishops, Patriarchs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as a thing most convenient: my Church of Rome hath set and instituted through all Churches following therein; not onely the example of the angelicall armie in Heaven, but also the Apostles. 147. For amongst them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:5396:17"/>
also there was not an vniforme equalitie or institution of a degree. 148. But a diversitie or distinction of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power, albeit they were all Apostles together, yet it was granted notwithstanding to Peter themselues also agreeing to the same that he should beare dominion and superioritie over all other Apostles. 149. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had his name given him, <hi>Cephas,</hi> that is, head or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Apostlehood. 150. Wherevpon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Priesthood first in the New Testament began in Peter, to whom it was said: <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon thee will I build my Church:</hi> 151. And I will give thee the keyes of Heaven: and thou being converted confirme thy brethren. 152. I haue prayed for thee that thy faith shall not faile, wherefore seeing such power is given to Peter. 153. And to mee in Peter, beeing his successor. 154. Who is hee then in all the world, that ought not to bee subject to my decrees, which hath such power, in Heaven, in Hell, in Earth, with the quicke and also the dead: 155. Commanding and granting in my Bull sent to <hi>Vienna,</hi> vnto all such as dyed in their peregrination to Rome, that the paine of Hell shuld not touch them. And also that all such as tooke the holie crosse vpon them, should everie one at his request not onely bee delivered himselfe, but also deliver three or foure soules, whomso ever hee would haue out of Purgatorie. 156. Againe having such promises and assurance, that my faith shall not faile, who then will not beleeue in my doctrine: for did not CHRIST himselfe first pray for Peter, that his faith should not faile. 157. Also haue I not a sure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Pauls owne mouth, wrytting to my Church in these words: <hi>God is my witnesse whom I serue in my spirit,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5396:17"/>
in the Ghospell of his Sonne, that without ceasing I make mention of you alwayes in my prayers: Rom.</hi> I. 158. Where fore I condemne all such worthilie, which will not obey my decrees, to be despossessed of all their honours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restitution. 159. So all they that beleeue not my doctrine, or stand against the priviledge of the Church, especially of the Church of Rome, I pronounce them Heretiques. 160. And as the other before is called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, so this man is to bee called an heretique. 161. For why he goeth against the faith, which goeth against her who is the mother of faith. 162. But heere may ryse perchance a doubt or seruple, that if my faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge stand so sure by the promise of CHRIST, and by the continuall prayer of S. Paul? whither is it true, or is it to bee granted that any other should excell men in knowledge or interpretation of holie Scripture. 163. For looke whose knowledge is grounded vpon most reason his words should seeme to bee of more authoritie. 164. Wherevnto I answere, and grant, that many there bee &amp; hath beene more abundantly indued with fuller grace of the holie Ghost, and greater excellencie of knowledge, &amp; therefore that the tractations of <hi>Augustine, Hierom,</hi> and others thought to bee preferred before the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of dyvers Popes: yet I say in determination of cause, because they haue not the vertue and hight of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, which is given to mee, therefore in exponing of Scriptures they are to bee preferred, but in decyding of matters they stand inferror to my authoritie: by vertue of which authoritie, 165. Both they themselues be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for doctors: &amp; their works approved, and also al other matters bee ruled, through the power of the keyes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5396:18"/>
which is given to me immediatly of CHRIST: although I deny not, but the same keyes bee also committed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelats, as they were to other Apostles besids Peter. 166. Yet it is a thing to haue the keyes, another thing to haue the vse of the keyes. 167. Wherefore heere is to bee noted a distinction of keyes, after the minde of my schoole doctors: one key which is called <hi>Clavis ordinis:</hi> Having authoritie to binde and loose, but over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom they binde and loose, and this authoritie they take not immediatly of CHRIST, but immediatly by mee the viccar of CHRIST. The other is called <hi>Clavis Iurisdictionis,</hi> Which I the viccar of CHRIST take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly of him, having notonely authoritie to binde and loose, but also dominion over them on whom this key is exercised, by the jurisdiction of which key, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my power is so great, that whereas all others are subjects. 168. Yea and Emperours themselues ought to subdue their executions to mee, onely I am a subject to no creature. 169. No not to my selfe except I list, <hi>In foro poenitentiae,</hi> to my Ghostly father submitting my selfe as a sinner, but not as Pope: so that my papall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie ever remaineth vnminisched. Superior to all men 170. Whom all persons ought to obey, 171. and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 172. Whom no man must judge nor accuse of cryme, either of murther, adulterie, symony, or such like 173. No man depose but I my selfe. 174. No man can excommunicate mee, yea though I communicat with the excommunicat, for no Canon bindeth me, whom no man must lye to. 175. For hee that lyeth to mee is a Church robber. 176. And who obeyeth not mee is an hereticke, and an excommunicat person. 177. For like
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5396:18"/>
as all the Iewes were commanded to obey the hie Priest, of the Leviticall order, of what state or condition soever they were, so are all Christian men more and lesse bound to obey mee CHRISTS Lievetennant on earth, concerning the obedience or disobedience, of whom yee haue in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 178. Where the common glosse sayeth, that hee who denyeth to the hie Priest <hi>obedientiam,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnder the sentence of condemnation, as much as hee that denyeth to GOD his <hi>omnipotentiam.</hi> Thus then appeareth that the greatnesse of my Priest hood, 179. Begunne in <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> solemnized in <hi>Aaron,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the children of <hi>Aaron,</hi> perfectionated in <hi>Christ</hi> represented in Peter, exalted in the vniversall iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and manifested in Silvester: so that through this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of my Priest-hood, having all things subject to mee. 180. It may seeme well verified in mee that was spoken of CHRIST: <hi>Psal. 8. Omnia subjecisti sub pedibus ejus, oves &amp; boves, &amp; vniversa pecoracampi. Volucres coeli, &amp; pisces maris.</hi> That is to say, Thou hast subdued all things vnder his feete, sheepe and oxen, and all cattell of the field, the birds of Heaven, and fish of the sea. 181. Where it is to bee noted, that by oxen, Iewes and Heretiques, by cattell of the field, Paganes be signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for although as yet they bee out of the vse of my keyes of binding and lowsing, yet they bee not out of jurisdiction of my keyes, but if they returne I may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solucthem. 182. By sheepe and all Cattell are meaned all Christian men both great and lesse, whither they bee Emperours, Princes, Prelats, or other. By birds of the aire, yee may vnderstand the Angels and potestars of Heaven, who bee all subject to mee, in that I am greater
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5396:19"/>
then the Angels, and that in foure things, as is afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and hath power to binde and louse in Heauen. 183. And to giue Heaven to them that fight in warres. 184. Lastly by the fishes of the sea, are signified the soules departed in paine or purgatory, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> by his prayer deliuered the soule of <hi>Traianus</hi> out of Hell, and I haue power to deliver out of Purgatorie whom I please. 185. Lastly, by the fishes of the sea, are signified such as bee in purgatorie: In so much that they stand in need and necessitie of other mens helpe, and yet bee in their journey: <hi>Viatores &amp; de foro Papae:</hi> id est: Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and belonging to the court of the Pope, therefore they may bee relieved out of the store-house of the Church, by the participation of indulgence. And for as much as some do object that my pardons cannot extend to them, that bee departed, for that it was said to Peter, whatsoever thou shall lowse vpon earth, and therefore seeing they are not vpon earth, they cannot bee lowsed by mee: heere I answere againe by my doctors, that this word, <hi>Super terram:</hi> Vpon the earth, may bee referred two manner of wayes, first to him that is the lowser, so that who shall lowse, shall bee vpon the earth, and so I grant, that the Pope being dead can lowse no man. Also it may bee referred to him that is lowsed, so that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is lowsed must be vpon the earth or about the earth: And so the soules of Purgatorie may bee lowsed, which albeit they are not vpon the earth, yet they are about the earth, at least they be not in Heaven: because oft times, a question may arise vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, &amp; the heads of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now a days are curious, a man hearing now, that I can deliver out of Purgatorie, will ask here a question, whether I be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5396:19"/>
so to empty all Purgatorie at once or not, to whom my Canonist. <hi>August. de Ancho.</hi> doth answere by a triple distinction: <hi>Quantum ad absolutam meamjurisdictionem, Quantum ad ordinatam executionem, Quantum addivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam acceptionem.</hi> First, touching my absolute jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee sayeth, I am able to rid out all Purgatorie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for as many as bee vnder my jurisdiction, as all be, except onely infants vnbaptised <hi>in limbo:</hi> and men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted onely <hi>cum Baptismo slaminis,</hi> that is, with the Baptisme of the spirit: and such as haue no friends to doe for them, that therefore pardons bee given these onely excepted: for all other besids, the Pope hee sayeth, hath power to release all Purgatorie at once as touching his absolute jurisdiction. Albeit <hi>Thomas Aquixas</hi> part. 4 denyeth the same, forsomuch as CHRIST himselfe hee sayeth, when hee came downe did not onely vtterly at once release all Purgatorie. As touching my ordinarie execution, they hold, that I may if I will, but I ought not to doe it. Thirdly, as concerning the divyne accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that is, how GOD would accept it, if I did it, that they say is vnknowne to them, &amp; to everie creature, yea and to the Pope himselfe.</p>
            <p>And to the intent I would all men to see and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that I lack not witnesse besids these, if I list to bring them out, you shall heare the whole quyre of my divine Clergie brought out, with a full voyoe testifying in my behalfe, in their bookes, tractations, distinctions, titles, glosses, and summaryes, as by their owne words heere followeth. The Pope say they being the viccar of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST through out the whole world, in the stead of the living GOD, hath that dominion and lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5396:20"/>
which CHRIST heere in earth would not haue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee had it in <hi>habitu,</hi> but gaue it to Peter in <hi>actu:</hi> that is, the vniversall jurisdiction both of spirituall things and also of temporall, which double jurisdiction was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the two swords in the Ghospell. And also by offering of the wise men, who offered not onely incense, but also gold: to signifie, not onely the spirituall domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but also the temporall to belong to CHRIST and to his viccar: For as wee read the earth is the LORDS, and the fulnesse thereof, and as CHRIST sayeth, all power is given to him both in Heaven and earth: So it is to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>inclusive.</hi> That the viccar of CHRIST hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on things, coelestiall, terrestiall, and infernall, which hee tooke immediatly of CHRIST, All other take it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly by Peter and the Pope, wherefore such as say that the Pope hath dominion onely in spirituall things in the world, and not in temporall, may bee likned to the councillers of the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> 2. Reg. 20. Which said that the gods of the mountaines be their gods: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue overcome vs: but let vs fight against them in the low meadows &amp; valleys where they haue no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and so wee shall prevaile over them: so evill counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers now a dayes, through their pestiferous flatterie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave Kings and Princes of the earth, saying, Popes, and Prelats, bee gods of mountaines, that is, of spirituall things onely, but they bee not gods of valleyes, that is, they haue no dominion over temporall things, and there fore let vs fight against them in the valleyes, that is, in the power of the temporall possessions, and so we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vale over them: But what sayeth the sentence of GOD vnto them, let vs heare, because saith hee the <hi>Sirians</hi> say
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5396:20"/>
that the God of mountaines is their god, and no the god of valleyes, therefore I will giue all this multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord, what can bee more effectuall spoken to set foorth the Majestie of my jurisdiction, which I receaved immediatly of the LORD, of the LORD I say, and no man: For whereas <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Emperour gaue to <hi>Silvester,</hi> indowing him with this possession and patrimonie, that is, so to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned and taken not so much for a donation, as to bee counted for a restitution made of that, which tyranous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was taken from him before. And againe, whereas I haue given at sundrie times to <hi>Lodovicus</hi> and other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, of my temporall lands and possessions, yet that was done not so much for recognising of homage to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as for keeping peace with them, for I ow to Emperours no obediene that they can clame, but they ow to mee as their superior: And therefore for a deversitie betwixt their degree and mine, in their consecration they take their vnction in their arme, I on the head, and as I am su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to them, so am I superior to all lawes, and free from all constitutions: Which am able of my selfe, and by my interpretation, to preferre equitie being not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, before the law writen: having all lawes within the chest of my breast, as is aforesaid: and whatsoever this my Sea shall enact, approue, or disproue, all men ought to approue and reproue the same, with out either judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, disputing, doubting, or extracting. Such is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veledge given of CHRIST in the behalfe of Peter to the Church of Rome 186. That what kingdome soever, countrie or province, choosing to themselves bishops &amp; Ministers, although they agree with all other Christs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5396:21"/>
people in the name of IESUS, that is, in faith &amp; charitie, believing in the same GOD, and in CHRIST his true Sonne, and in the holie Ghost, having also the same Creid. The same Evangelists and Scriptures of the Apostles, yet notwithstanding vnlesse that Bishops and Ministers take their origine and ordination from this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall state, they are to bee counted not of the Church: so that succession of faith only is not sufficient to make a Church, exceptt he Ministers take their ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by them which haue their succession from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, so their faith, supremacy, and chayre of Peter, keyes of Heaven, power to binde and lowse, all these bee inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Church of Rome. So that it is to be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that GOD alwayes providing, and S. Peter helping the Bishoprick and dyocy of Rome, shall never fall from the faith, and likewise is to bee presumed and presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that the Bishop of that Church is alwayes good and holy: yea although hee bee not alwayes good, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of his ownemerits, yet the merits of S. Peter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor of that place, bee sufficient for him: who hath bequeathed and left a perpetuall dowrie of merits, with inheritance of innocency to his posteritie. 187. Yea, though hee fall in homicide or adulterie, hee may sinne but yet hee cannot bee accused, but rather excused, by the murtherers of <hi>Samson</hi> the shifts of the Hebrewes, the adulterie of <hi>Iacob.</hi> 188. And likewise if any of his Clergie should bee found imbracing a woman, it must be expounded and presupposed, that he doth it to blesse her: furthermore, the Pope say they hath all the dignities and all powers of Patriarchs. In his primacy hee is <hi>Abel</hi> in governament the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> in Patriarchdome:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5396:21"/>
               <hi>Abraham:</hi> in order <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> in dignitie <hi>Aaron:</hi> in authoritie <hi>Moses:</hi> in seat judiciall; <hi>Samuell:</hi> in zeale <hi>Elias</hi> in meeknesse <hi>David:</hi> in power <hi>Peter:</hi> in vnction <hi>CHRIST:</hi> Nay thou art Anti-Christ, my power they say is greater then all the Sancts: for whom I confirme, no man may infirme, I may favour and spaire whom I please. 189. To take from one and giue to another, and if I beenemy to any man, all men ought to eshew that person foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and not tarrie and looke while I bid them doe so: all the earth is my dyocie, and I the ordinarie of all men having the authoritie of the King of all kings vpon sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, I am all in all and aboue all. 190. So that God himself and I the viccar of God haue both one consist o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. 191. And am able almost to doe that GOD can doe <hi>Claue non errante.</hi> 192. Item it is said of mee, that I haue an heavenly arbitriment, and therefore am able to change the nature of things, <hi>Substantialia vnius appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando alteri:</hi> and of nothing to make things to bee, and of a sentence that is nothing, to makeit stand in effect, in all things that I list, my will to stand for reason, for I am able by the law to dispence aboue the Law, &amp; of wrong to make justice, in correcting lawes and changing them, yee haue hard hitherto susficiently out of my doctors: now yee shall heare greater thinges out of my owne decrees. 193.

Againe, if Prelats of the Church bee called and counted of <hi>Constantinus,</hi> for gods, I then being aboue all Prelats, seeme by this reason to be aboue all Gods: wherefore no marvell, if it bee in my power, to change time and times, to alter and abrogate lawes, to dispense with all things, yea with precepts of CHRIST for where CHRIST biddeth Peter put vp his sword, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his disciples not to vse any outward force in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging themselues. 197. Doe not I Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> wryting to the Bishops of France, exhort them to draw their materiall swords in persewing their enemies, and recovering their possessions, setting against the precept of CHRIST, the prophet saying, Item where CHRIST was present himselfe at the mariage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee.</hi> 198. Doe not I Pope <hi>Martinus</hi> in my distinction, inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the spirituall Clergie to be present at mariage feasts, and also to marie themselues? Item where matrimonie by CHRIST cannot bee lowsed, but onely for whoore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. 199. Doe not I Pope <hi>Gregorius Iunior</hi> wryting <hi>ad Bonifacium:</hi> permit the same to bee broken for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie or infirmitie of bòdies. 200. Item against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse caution of the Ghospell, doeth not <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth, permit <hi>vim vi expellere.</hi> 201. Item against the New Testament in swearing and that in these sixe causes. 202. Likewise against the old Testament I doe dispence in not giving tythes. 203. Wherein two kinds of oaths are to bee noted, whereof some bee <hi>promissiora</hi> some bee <hi>assertoria.</hi> 204. Item in vowes and that <hi>ex to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to voto,</hi> whereas other Prelats cannot dispence <hi>ex toto

Where also note, that in all swearing, alwayes the authoritie of the superior is excepted. 207. Moreover where CHRIST biddeth lend without hope of gaine, doe not I Pope <hi>Martinus</hi> giue dispensation for the same? and notwithstanding the counsell of <hi>Thuring</hi> indicted the contrarie, yet with the bulles I dissanulled that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creement. 208.

Also against the Canon of the Apostles: I can &amp; doe dispence, for where they in their Canon command a Priest for fornication to bee deposed, I through the authoritie of <hi>Silvester</hi> doe alter the rigor of that constitution. 212. Considering the minds and bodies also of men now to be weaker then they were then: 213. Brieflie against the vniversall state of the Church, I haue dispensation, and for mariage in the second degree of consanguinitie and affinitie that is betwixt brethrens children although not, so that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle may not marrie his Neece, vnlesse for vrgent and weightie causes. As for all such contracts betwixt party and partie, were that matrimonie is not yet consumat bv carnall copulation, it is but a small matter for mee to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence withall: In summa if yee list brieflie to heare the whole number of all such causes as properlic doe pper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to my papall dispensation, which commeth to the number of 51. poynts, that no man may meddle withall, but onely I my selfe alone, I will rehearse them in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish as they bee set foorth in my canonicall doctors.</p>
