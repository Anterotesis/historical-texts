         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe dear Salutation of my life salutes you all, in the most pure
and dearest love with which I am beloved of the Father, and
with which also at this present my heart is filled and issueth
forth towards you, and the whole body of elected ones, and the
remembrance of you in the Lord is very precious unto me, as I see and
behold you, and hath fellowship with you in the Immortal life, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52834:2"/>
the Father hath begotten in you and in me, and in which my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is of you, and my unity with you, and therein onely is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of my dearest love unto you, and in which I hope I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
known and remembred of you, even in the spiritual relation and
heirship of Immortality, being fellow Citizens of the heavenly <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and children of her conception and bringing forth.</p>
            <p>Now my dearest friends, seeing you have believed in the light &amp; life
of men, even in him that was, and is, and is to come, and have also
tasted of that all fulness that is in him, you have a witness in your selves,
even of the Spirit of the Father which is greater then all, and you
need no other testimony but that of the Spirit, That the Lord is good
and full of Grace, Truth, Mercy, Peace, and Joy, even the full
Fountain and Treasure of all vertue and blessednesse in this present
time and hereafter; I say, if you have tasted and felt of Immortal
life, and if the fountain hath been opened in you, and you have seen
his glory, and received of his treasure, then the evidence dwells in you
of eternal blessedness, and no man needs to teach you of these things,
nor to say unto you know the Lord, if you dwell in him and go no
more forth, yet bear with me a little, that I may speak and be refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not to deminish from what testimony you have in you, but the
rather to add towards it; for my witnesse is not another, but the same
which ye enjoy, which is faithful and true; And this I say, Oh how
great, how mighty and powerful is the Lord our God everlasting and
infinite; He is that eternal spirit that filleth all, the Creator and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all things that are, the life and virtue in all, and the invisible
substance greater then all, he is in himself the immesurable and infinite
fulnesse, the Fountain of Life, of Mercy, and Righteousnesse and
Peace, and of all virtue, and of every good thing, who can declare
his beginning, or end? he is without time, place or thing, yet gives
being to all, and is present in all, yet not known, saving of himself,
and by his own spirit, yet he effecteth all things, and worketh
whatsoever he will; Who can utter his wonderous Works? Who
can number his Mercies? Who can account his infinitenesse?
Who can behold his Invisibility? Who can reach his endlesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
He filleth Heaven and Earth, and of his fulnesse every
Creature in Heaven and Earth receiveth, and by him doth subsist,
though it is onely given unto mankinde to behold and perceive of him,
it is onely his gift unto his Saints that fear him, to understand of his
ways, and in us he hath opened of his fulnesse and treasure, even in
our hearts, and the divine mistery of this infinite God is revealed and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52834:2"/>
discovered in the hearts of the sons of men whom he hath chosen; and
he hath given us to enjoy and possesse in us a measure of that fulness
that is in himself, even a measure of the same love and life, of the
same mercy and power, and of the same divine nature, and a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the same heavenly quality and property which is in him in all
fulnesse, dwelleth in us his Saints by measure, even in all that are
born of him, in whom the immortal birth is brought forth, which is
of his own nature, and is Immortal, Spiritual, Holy, Meek, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
even as the Father; for the quality of him that hath begotten, is
in us that are begotten of him, we bear his image and are of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
partakers of his substance, Immortal and Infinite, and are one
with him in nature and fellowship, and perfect through him that dwells
in us, and hath changed us into his likenesse; these things ye know if
ye be born from above, and if the immortal birth live in you, and ye
be constant in the faith, then are ye heirs through it, of the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inheritance of eternal life, and already have received the earnest,
and assurance thereof, and all are yours, because you are Christs, and
he is Gods, and you have the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>And this life and immortality is brought forth in us, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it self dwells with us, and eternity possesseth us, and fulnesse it
self is shed abroad in our hearts, and we have the treasure of Life, of
Wisdome, of Knowledge, and of Divine fulnesse in our Tabernacles
of clay, which also are sanctified by his Word and Power to be fit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
for the Eternal God to dwell in; And oh what love is this
with which we are beloved by him! Oh what mercy is this of which we
partake from him! Who are become the Sons of God and Children of
the most high, in whose earthen vessels dwells Immortality and Life,
and infinite Substance, being gathered into his shepheards fold of
defence, where we have immortal food, and are established on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mountain where nothing can destroy, and are at rest and
peace under the shadow of the Rock of Ages, that hell nor death,
nor wrath of man can terrifie; Oh what eye hath seen this, what
ear hath heard it, and what heart hath perceived it, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the loving kindnesse of the Lord? who among you are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of this, that sayes not, great and Infinite is the Lord, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable
in Mercy, and Truth, and Righteousnesse; Oh Friends,
if ye know these things, and if ye receive daily of this fulnesse, and if
the measure of that immortal life be risen in you, and hath raised up
you with its self into its own fulnesse, which once was descended out
of its own fulnesse of Eternal Rest, and strength, and was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52834:3"/>
in its measure, in poverty and weaknesse in your hearts, in the
feeling of afflictions and wrath because of sin, but it descended to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all, and to bear transgression, that you might be raised with it into
its life, and glory, and fulnesse; and if this be finished and effected
in you, Oh then how shall you not live to his glory and praise in your
Generation, and in love, and peace, and unity with himself, and
one with another, and magnifie him in Soul and Spirit that hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you and chosen you, and now works all your works in you and
for you, and you live by him, because he lives in you.</p>
            <p>But though it is thus that some are entred into the rest, and have
received of his fulnesse, and hath the Testimony of Life and assurance
in the Father, and are risen with Christ, yet are you and we and all
the children of the Father, so set and placed in this Creation, as that
there is an enemy to be ruled over, and also a service to be fulfilled by
us for the Lord that hath chosen us; and therefore watchfulnesse and
faithfulnesse is required from us; And unto this I cannot but exhort
you all, even to walk in the fear of the Lord, in watchfulnesse and
faithfulnesse, in humility and meeknesse, in truth and justice, and in
every good thing, and that you fulfil the Will of the Lord in all things
whatsoever the motions of his own life draws you unto, that every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of this infinite Body which is highly exalted at his right hand, may
be preserved in dominion over sin and death, and also may shew forth
the Honour, and Glory, and Praise of him who is the head (even
Christ) whose virtue hath annointed every member, and is shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
through the whole body; I say Friends, of every member is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the duty and service thereunto pertaining, according as it is
placed of him, that the Treasure of Life may shew forth its virtue in
one manner or another through you all in all well doing, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of him who is God above all, and that in the sight of your enemies
(whom you know watches for evil, and would rejoice in any occasion
against you, that they might speak evil of the Lord because of you)
you may walk without offence in the answer of a Good conscience, and
if you walk as such as are the Lords, you will cut off all occasions from
them that seek it, and they will be confounded, and you preserved in
the blessedness and peace everlasting, and you will grow in immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and into the knowledge and fulnesse thereof more and more till
you know the Father, even as you are known of him.</p>
            <p>And be not unmindeful of the word of Lord wch begat you, wch
first entred into your hearts, &amp; wrought mightily in you to the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and destroying of death and emnity, and remember the travel of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52834:3"/>
the dayes past, and the indignation which once you felt because of sin,
through the Word of God, and the Word endures for ever, of which
you are begotten; and if any appearance of iniquity, or motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
arise in you into desire to be fulfilled, the word will quench it,
and give you dominion over sin and death, and save you from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof; for the word changes not, but is the same alwayes, but
if man change and pervert his way into iniquity, it reproves and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects,
and so delivers him, for this word keeps clean the heart, and it
sanctifies, and also keeps in subjection the mortal man with all his
thoughts, desires and actions, and destroys the man of sin, the sinful man
by whom the whole Creation hath been corrupted and perverted into
evil in its practise of degenerate man, and if you forget the word, then
iniquity prevails again and the love of this world and its vanities, and
the riches and pleasures of the mortal man steals away the heart, and
they possesse the habitation of God unrighteously, and all things are
become sinful, and the body of death comes over the pure Life, and
peace with God in the Conscience is lost, and that because the word of
God is forgotten which once begat unto God, and where the unclean
spirit enters again, the latter end of such is worse then the beginning,
more sinful against God, and more hated of him; and therefore let
none follow the way of such, for it leads to death and darknesse, and
misery will be the end of it. But Friends, mind him and feel his
power, who is the preserver of men in Peace and Righteousnesse, and
let not up that part in you into liberty, into which Satan enters and
sowes his Seed of degeneration, but live in the Cross of Christ, and
in the meek and lowly Spirit, that you may not do your own wills,
but the Will of the Father, and may fear him and his goodnesse, and
that subjecteth the ground of temptations that sin cannot prevail;
so shall your peace be everlasting, and your life as a River of pleasure,
and joy and gladnesse shall be your daily portion, and the Lord shall
never forsake you, but be unto you a Tower of strength, and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of peace, and a Crown of victory and Reward in this present time
and for ever.</p>
            <p>And if ye abide in Christ the Vine into which you are planted by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
then will your fruit be of the Vine, and acceptable unto the
Father who is the good Husbandman, and through his vertue you will
grow into perfection as partaining to the conscience, where all guilt
of sin is taken away, and the burden of iniquity and body of death
clean removed away from you; for that is perfection as pertaining to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52834:4"/>
the conscience where sin and transgression is done away, and power
received over it, both in motion and action and the guilt of it, and the
conscience sprinkled with the imortal blood of the Lamb, and no stain
nor guilt remaining, but peace altogether by the holy spirit in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
and this is perfection which was not attained to by outward
things in the first covenant, but is witnessed in the second which the
Lord hath made with us, and confirmed unto us, where sin &amp; iniquity
is blotted out, and innocency &amp; immortality lives and raigns; and such
stands before the throne of God without fault before him, &amp; no guile in
their mouthes, and these sings the song of the Lamb &amp; of the Redeemed
where all sorrow is fled away, if so be that the burden and guilt of all
tansgression be removed, then there is no cause of sorrow; and blessed
are they that dwells here, and that are entred into the everlasting rest,
even into God, for he is the rest of the immotal soul and the life of it;
and if ye know these things, ye have satisfaction and comfort, which
none knows but they that have it, its the portion of the redeemed,
whose Father, Master, Ruler, Judg and King is the Lord God and the
Lamb, and we are sujects of that Kingdom, and free born of that City
the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and we are made free through the price of
immortal blood, and then how can any of you that are such serve this
world and the vanities of it, by any immoderate care or desire or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
in earthly things, for this is the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are free from it, and are not intangled concerning the things of
this world, but they are subjected under, and the inheritance of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
portion is their crown &amp; substance; and <hi>Esaus</hi> portion is the earth, he
that hath no assurance in God; wherefore live above this world in the
seed of God, and be without immoderate care in every thing, as to
earthly matters, not taking thought what shall come, or be to morrow,
neither cumbring your selves about uncertain riches, but leave the issue
of all things to the Lord, in whose hands are blessing and the curse, to
give or take away according to his pleasure; and be not servants unto
but Rulers over all affections in earthly things, for spiritual blessings are
the Crown, and the earth is the footstool of the Lords Redeemed.</p>
            <p>And as for the dayes and seasons in which we now are, let none be
troubled as though it were not wel, or could be better, for all things are
well that are come to pass, because the will of the Lord hath effected
them, either as the cause or as the means, and it is good for us that these
things are so; for the prosperity of our Kingdom is going on through
all, the hammer is beating upon the Rocks that wil beat them to pieces,
and the ax is hewing down the Ceders, &amp; the little stone prevails against
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52834:4"/>
the many headed beast; and the Image of idolatry is weakning and the
holy Seed growes in strength and vertue, and the puropse of the Lord
can none prevent; But the light of the Sun must be as the light of seven
dayes amongst us, and the day spring from on high hath already visited
us, and we have seen of his glory; wherefore let all the upright have
patience and long suffering til the measure of iniquity in our adversaries
be fullfilled, which is hastening to be accomplished, and transgression
growes full, and sinners growes ripe for vengance, and we must pass
over their mountain of darkness, and in the mean time the Lord hides
us under his shadow, even till transgression be finished, and covers us
from the storm, and blinds the enemie, &amp; turns his rage backward, and
we are not destoyed, but our life is renewed, &amp; righteousness, mercy and
love are a defence about us, and how great is the kindness of the Lord
herein mine eye have seen it, and my heart meditateth thereon, the
power and wisdom and love of the Lord herein are very great, and
who can find out the depth thereof, or declare his immeasurable power
and wisdom.</p>
            <p>And thus the salutation of my life unto all the faithful is expressed,
and I am well in him who is my fulness, and desires no more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
you then your faithfulness in the cause of God, for without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
the cause of God is with us, and on our part, and as you are
faithful therein, that is my reward concerning you, and the addition to
my joy; and in the Heavenly spirit of the Lord God Almighty are you
committed unto him who is able to keep you, even to the end and in
the end, to glorifie you in eternal life in rest and peace for ever; and this
is the portion of the faithful, and my desires on your behalfe, and my
salutation of you, hoping that you have not so learned Christ as to deny
his because of the Love or terror of this world, but that over all you will
be preserved in faith and victory.</p>
            <p>I am now according to the will of the Father in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is some weeks
since I arrived at <hi>Cork</hi> City in much peace and safty, with my dear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
it having been long upon my spirit to visit the seed of God in
this Nation, even of love have I felt it in me and not of constraint; but
of a willing mind and free spirit, and not of force; and after the time of
patience and waiting for many days to see my way clear for it, the Lord
hath ordered it and brought it to pass acceptable unto me and many
here; and this is the time in which this visitation must be effected, for till
now my way was not clear; &amp; but that this journey, hath laid upon me,
I should have rejoyced to have been present among you either in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
by suffering or otherwise, but this is the will of God. And it is in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52834:5"/>
my heart to pass through this Nation, and to visit the seed of God by
the love and word of the Father, as he gives of his life and strength and
opens the way before me. I perceive in this Land friends are generally
well and truth grows in victory and dominion, and the Lord is adding
to the numberless number of them that must stand on mount Zion; and
through the rage of men, and above it all, the little flock is preserved
in its beauty, and the seed sown in weakness and afflictions is received
and quickned in much power, which is my joy. About <hi>Bristol</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
about two moneths in much precious service for the Lord, and
truth had good authority over all, and great acceptation in the hearts
of many, and some convinced and others edified and confirmed, as
many can witness in the spirit; and until after the time of the Fair I was
not clear of that City, but imediately after I was free, and my way
made very convenient and clear to this place; and the hand of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ordered all things very well on that behalfe, as I do hope, in the
continuance of the power and presence of the Lord with me through
this work; and in his power I am committed, even to do or suffer all
things for his Name sake, and that by vertue of his own life that dwells
in me; And the Lord preserve all the Brethren like minded that the
work of the Lord may be fulfilled and finished by us. Amen.</p>
