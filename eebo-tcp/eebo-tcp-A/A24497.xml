         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am the Perſon to
whow the following
Letter was writ, and I
am the Publiſher of it; no
man is obliged to give a
reaſon of ſuch actions; I
onely had an inclination to
ſhew thee ſome of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements,
who are not
men of the town: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
thoſe glorious Perſons
<pb facs="tcp:95478:3"/>
have ſufficiently run us
down, by continualy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the World, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of admirable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
whilſt we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly invent a tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mode for our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and grave tempers:
we muſt take our fortune,
till the Round brings ſuch
things again into esteem;
We will not appeal to thy
juſtice for a ſentence to
our advantage, we know
in what nature the addreſs
<pb facs="tcp:95478:3"/>
is made, and we ignore not
their captivating arts;
this is not the firſt Age
will be recorded for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
vertue, though
the extravigancies of ſuch
an humour, are onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
now. We have yet
in our diſgraces this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
left us, (which we
hope our Generous Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
will not deny us)
that when experience, and
time, have diſabuſed the
foppiſh Youth of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
<pb facs="tcp:95478:4"/>
they will more
revere the practice, and
diſcretion of their Fathers;
when their gallantry's will
be as much diſpiſed, as
our vertue now. I will
ſay nothing for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
papers though I have
both a Juſtice, and a
Friendſhip to ſatisfie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account, but a
thouſand Elogies will not
incline a man to approve
that which is againſt his
humour, and one alone is
<pb facs="tcp:95478:4"/>
ſuperfluous, where the
ſubject is agreeable; If
thou dost not like it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help it, thou mayeſt
posſibly ſometimes have
ſpent more time, and mony
for an ill humour. If it is
not ſuitable to thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
reſerve it for thy
Children, who may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prefer it, before the
follies of their Fathers
practices.</p>

you conſider, that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
theſe things from a

of doing right to ſo
grand and ſo important a
Subject; and one beſides,
who can furniſh the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with no experiencies
of his own: but I know
your ingenuity and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
are too great to expect
a ſufficiency from a man he
has not about him; neither
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95478:6"/>
do I believe that you want
any motives to aſſiſt you in

that knows your love, alſo

But ſince you will
be amorous, and ſerious
too, as you have received
the pleaſures of the firſt

you ſhall now receive the
entertainments of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

yet I muſt before hand tell
you, that as in Pictures, ſo
in ſo conſiderable draughts
of humane intereſts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
there muſt needs be
wanting thoſe graces and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95478:7"/>
lovelineſſes, that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
nor account can
reach; and we can only lay
the colours, and a ſimetry
of parts, whilſt the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the charm, are
above the reach of pens. It
will be neceſſary Sir (to
keep your thoughts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
to purſue a method,
and to decline the hunting
mode of writing, now in
uſe, of running remarques
here and there, as the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Author leads him.
Marriage is our Theam, and
the juſtneſs, neceſſity, and
advantages of it, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
to be enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into; and we cannot
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95478:8"/>
raiſe this ſuperſtructure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a better foundation then
the Divine Declaration in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18. where it is ſaid,
<hi>It is not good that the man

appears, that when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

               </gap>ove; Empire and command
were not ſo Noble as the
affairs of a practical virtue:
<hi>Adam</hi> was entertained with
the freſhneſs of a youthful

paid not then the tribute of
his ſweat and labour; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95478:9"/>
only a pleaſant ſpring,
but thoſe delights were not
equal to the ſociety of a
woman.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He was alone
in the poſſeſſion of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;
<hi>Adam</hi> was perfect,
and ſo wanted not to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
but the degrees and
conſummations of it, which
were deſign'd him in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
and intereſts of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Standard of
happineſs by which it was
meaſured, was not then a
life of quiet and repoſe, but
a power and ſufficiency of
communicating virtue and
excellent qualities; and I

<hi>it is not good that

of which particulars, if they

perpetuate Generations, and
the variety of Ages; from

whoſe zeal and holineſs did
ſhine among the dark vices
of the world, where they
now ſparkle in ſpheres of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
light and love: To
this we owe the original
and excellency of Learning,
which has taught wiſdome
and civility to barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
he was once rock'd
in the Cradle, whoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy

Mother on her Lap
firſt bound the tender head
of a famous Conquerour,
that after wore the Laurels
of ſo many Victories. Whilſt
ambition, war, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

Marriage ſupplied it with
other inhabitants. When
by the death of ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

When ſome holy man, who

The Aſſyrian Empire

broke to pieces by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of its Adminiſtrators:

thoſe vain hopes, but
with little ſucceſſe. So has
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95478:13"/>
learning been ſucceſſively
maintained. <hi>Plato</hi> left ſome
excellent knowledge, with
many phantaſtical opinions:
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> endeavoured better
demonſtration, but yet with
that, left ſome Lordly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and barren terms.
Then the followers of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anged themſelves into
ſeveral Sects, troubling the
World with idle quarrels,
and diſputes. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
of <hi>Greece,</hi> was capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and affected, but
when it travelled to <hi>Rome,</hi>
they made it more ſociable,
and of a more pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:
one Age wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and diſputed, another pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95478:13"/>
and convinc'd: From
thoſe times the adventures
of Learning have been vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and not eaſily abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Thus have ſeveral Ages
had ſeveral rencounters, and
variety of action, all of
which have been furniſhed
with Adminiſtrators, from
the Marriage bed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It was good, as
it was a model of the after
Governments of the World:
the dominion of a Parent in
his Family, is a true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of the government
of a Vertuous Prince, who
is the Father of his Country;
men in this mirour might ſee
the agreeableneſs of power,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95478:14"/>
and Empire; and with better
inclinations might become
obedient to an univerſal
Head, whileſt they plainly
could ſee the advantages of
order and ſubjection in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Families, had there
been no diſtinction in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in which, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and obedience paid to
ſome perſons, the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Rule might have been

               </gap>rc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ived and approved,
men would never have been

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to have parted with
the moſt extravagant parts
of their liberty, but all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of Soveraignty had been
oppoſed, as injuſtice and
tyranny, but by Marriage,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95478:14"/>
and the iſſue of the bed, men
had within themſelves a
Lordſhip, and Dominion,
and the quiet and advantages
of that, evidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the intention of ſome
excellent perſon, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to protect Countries,
and Provinces, and be their
univerſal Head, and Parent,
was not received with that
ſcorn and averſion, as they
would have been, had there
not been thoſe advantagious
Preſidents: And I know not
how to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieve, that all the
Dominions of the Earth
were founded in abſolute
Tyranny, and that they had
at firſt no deſign of the good
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95478:15"/>
of Nations, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental,
and found neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for the ſecurity and quiet
of power, ſince it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that any Country can
injoy peace, riches, or profit
without the Superiority of
ſome or other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was good, as
it brought in the grand foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
of Kingdomes; for this
(yet with no injury) fixes a
man to a ſettlement, and a
contented condition of living,
who, if he ſhould obey the
force of no other Arguments,
yet the juſt conſideration of
his Family, and Relations,
would diſpoſe him to peace,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95478:15"/>
and ſubjection, many men
are ſometimes tempted to be
the Inſtruments of fatal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
to a Nation, whileſt
they have nothing to ſuffer,
but themſelves in the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of ill ſucceſs; few are
ſo brutiſh, as to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the welfare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of thoſe they love;
who would by treaſon, cut
from his Children a brave
eſtate, and leave them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and the reproaches of
his crime to inherit: and
though ſome have broke
through all theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and neglected their
deareſt intereſts, yet that
does not diſprove the force
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95478:16"/>
they uſually have upon our
minds: 'tis providing for
thoſe that come after us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
makes us induſtrious, and
ſometimes peaceable, and
vertuous too: What man
would not be ſhook, and
feel ſome remorſe in his
deſignes and projects of
ruine, when he has a loving
Wife leaning on his boſome,
and innocent Children hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about his knees; but he
that lives alone, what deſign
ſoever he drives at, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
none of theſe regrets,
and remorſes; but ſetting all
things in himſelf, cries, <hi>Let
the world ſtand and fall with
me.</hi> And I am of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95478:16"/>
that the unmarried
lives of the Romiſh Prieſts,
has been the cauſe of great
calamities, and diſorders in
Kingdomes; men who have
too much leiſure, and too
little dependence on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
intereſt, will freely
play away their own ſhare
in any Kingdome, by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uin
and deſtruction, whileſt
there are ſo many cloyſters
in other places, to protect
and receive them, their
Guardians and Superiours
throwing about theſe fatal
Firebrands, and In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>endiaries
to inflame and trouble the
World, who, if they had a
Family, and an intereſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95478:17"/>
to mind, would take a
great deal leſs pleaſure in the
diſorders of Chriſtendome.
Marriage makes men look
upon the peace and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the World, with more
concernment and pleaſure
than thoſe, who care only for
themſelves, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was good,
to have the honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of a hopeful iſſue, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was eſteemed of old, a
greater aggrandizement than
many children, the iſſue of
a lawfull bed, the promiſing
youth of a child, returns a
reputation to the Father, and
many men had been forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95478:17"/>
in the Hiſtories of Ages,
had not they not been the
Parents of Children, that
were famous: Every Parent
receives an honour by the
vertues and celebrated quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their Children; 'tis
an honour conſiderable
enough, to have been the
root that bore flowers, whoſe
fairneſs and ſweetneſs were
pleaſant to the whole world:
Nor is the delight any thing
inferiour; if the excellent
endowments of a Stranger
are pleaſing to us (as they
doubtleſs are to every inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
mind.) What muſt
be the accompliſhments of
thoſe, whom we have brought
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95478:18"/>
into the world our ſelves
to be the Parents of thoſe
that may prove ſucceſſeful
inſtruments, for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and reformation of the
Church, for the peace,
and advantages of their
Country, are bleſſings and
contentments not to be
equalled by little things: and
the actions of many men,
that have lived in the World
would have none of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
they have yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
if it had not been for
the conſideration of their
Family; next to the intereſts
of Religion, nothing is ſo
noble, ſo good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
as to proſecute in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95478:18"/>
wayes of juſtice and honour,
the intereſts of their Family;
in the purſuit of which has
moreover been raiſed, all or
moſt of thoſe glorious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of vertue, courage,
and induſtry, that the world
has known; for who, onely
for the flaſhes of a ſhort
Fame, would with the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his own life, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Government of
Kingdomes, have added re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
as well as neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
provinces, to the tribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
of his Throne? who would
have expoſed himſelf to the
various accidents of the
deep, and have ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
treaſures in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95478:19"/>
barbarous, unconquer'd,
and remote, if he had not
hoped to have left them as
the patrimony of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Thus on death beds,
have great as well as ſerious
men, left ſuch excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
to their Children,
of keeping up the honour,
and greatneſs of their names,
as if the intereſt they ſhould
take in it remained beyond
the Grave: <hi>Agripina</hi> doted
ſo much on the imperial dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of her Son <hi>Nero,</hi> as to
cry out, <hi>occidat, modo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi>
Let me die ſo he may
reign.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It was good, to
perpetuate the memory and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95478:19"/>
dignity of vertue, it is true,
it ſometimes happens, that
a Son is not onely unlike his
Father; but ſo different, as
to be a ſhame and reproach to
his memory; but yet uſually
the great qualities of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
lives in the Children,
having the advantages of
their example and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and at leaſt if their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is much weaker and
fainter, yet ſupported by
the Fathers memory, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſtrangely uſeful, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and reſpected in the
world. The children of ſome
men, that have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of great benefits, and
good offices to Countries,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95478:20"/>
and Nations, have ſerved
many great and happy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the world, who yet
have had no great, merit of
their own to boaſt of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nothing
is ſo much idolized nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
by the generality of
people, as a mighty name,
and a vertue poſſibly in it ſelf
much the greater, that is
found in a perſon not famous,
cannot do thoſe things,
which the bare reputations
ef ſome perſons is able to
perform: In the civil wars
of <hi>France,</hi> the Authority of
a Prince of the Blood, would
eaſily huſh thoſe commotions
and produce that obedience
to diſcipline, which all the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95478:20"/>
courage, arts, and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of inferiour Captains
could never do.</p>
            <p>Sixth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, It was good to
inlarge the Sphere and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
occaſions of practical
vertue. He that is married
has more compaſs, and a
larger field of action; he
uſually procures more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to the World, at leaſt
more ſubſtantial and better
grounded. He that is alone
lives to this Age, but he
that is married (by the force
of imbraceing cauſes) lives
to that Age which ſtands
next the worlds laſt calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and burning fit. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
did not onely fight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95478:21"/>
for the liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi>
'till he was it's greateſt, and
mighty Sacrifice, but left
thoſe gallant Sons, who
bravely endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
it, when ſaint and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The practical vertues
that belong to the affairs of
this life, is they are more,
ſo they are more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the married ſtate;
Speculation, however plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to ſome tempers, yet
if it be not altogether divine,
is a thing of little advantage,
eſpecially to the world, and
that is the meaſure of every
excellent quality, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the general World:
Infinite thinking, that deſigns
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95478:21"/>
no other benefit, but the
private ſatisfaction of him
that is buſied in it, is but an
ingenious ſort of idleneſs;
and moreover, the miſchief
the world has received by
thoſe ſtrange opinions inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by men, who injoyed a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs,
remains too great a
reproach of idle ſpeculation:

and extravagancies of a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
love. What diſorders
and diſtractions had there
been in the world, if an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous

had been ſubject to no
conduct; the fancy placing

preſently tranſported the

of it; Cities had been
conſumed to aſhes, houſes
left deſolate, or fill'd with
groans, only for the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a beauteous prey;
the affairs of the State had
been neglected, or readily
wounded, for the acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of an idle love; for
ſuch is the violence of that
paſſion, and ſuch its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
when it is taught
no moderation by Religion
and excellent Laws; the
power of Conqueſt had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95478:27"/>
been a ſufficient title to the
objects we had covered, and
we had no felt no remorſe, to
have taken them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the arms where they
had ſpent many years in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments
of love: no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could have flouriſhed,
nor have been ſucceſsful in
its affairs, if a wanton flame
had thus conſumed the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
temper and vigour of
the youth; or if their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
had not tranſported
them to ſuch violent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet the gentleſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of thoſe flames
had made them uncapable
of ſerving the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,

Humane Society; and what
with running to publick
houſes of luſt, the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

up all that time with which

Generations: Whilſt they
had followed theſe deſigns,
ill humor, reſtleſneſs of the

actions, had been the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
companions to them;
therefore there was great
wiſdom in that Law amongſt
the Jews, that none ſhould

of an idle paſſion poſſeſſed
the hearts and heads of their
Subjects. Marriage more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines

and neceſſary buſineſs, then
the wandring luſts of Stews
and Concubines; and even
in thoſe Countries, where
Polygamy, and many Loves

            <p>Tenthly, It was good to
have the ſociety, of a Sex
that ſhould once be the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the Son of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World; and that
was of a Virgin too,
though not deflowr'd, yet
betroth'd: that man as he
had once reproached that
Sex, as the firſt yeilder to
that temptation, which
ruined mankind, ſo they
might receive a benefit,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95478:29"/>
and an advantage by it,
that might make them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the memory of former
injuries: Did She preſent
us with the fruit, the
eating of which loſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
and an innocence
more ſweet and agreable?
from Her Womb roſe the
morning of eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
ſpreading its
light and bleſſings over the
World: Man has no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to nouriſh antient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments,
that has her
for the companion of his
vertuous Love, whoſe
aboades the vailed Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
did not diſpute.</p>
            <p>I know nothing can be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95478:30"/>
objected to all this, but
that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> he that
lives unmarried does beſt,
to which it is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
that that, as ſome
other things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
were chiefly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for that Age, as a
time of great perſecution,
and calamity to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith; then were the
powers of the World ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
againſt the Doctrine
of Chriſt, and the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of it, were forced
to remove from one City,
and Country to another,
and to live with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and thoſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

and it was more
convenient for them that
were continually in jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
in perils, on the Land
and Sea, to have ſmall

many things may not be ſo
proper for ſome times,
that are both convenient,
and neceſſary for others:
and it was but juſt, that

But this is part of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
Sir, ſince our
diſcourſe ought only to
lead us to examine their
ſentiments of marriage, and
the juſtice of them: which
we ſhall now do. It is
not ſure becauſe they live
chaſtly and ſeverely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a woman? nothing
leſs! their averſion, for the
Pales and fences of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
is becauſe they love
their ranges, and a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
chaſe: they deſpiſe
the ſociety of a vertuous
wife, that they may gad
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95478:35"/>
abroad to ſeek Love, ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their wealth, their
ſtrength, and their time,
in the imbraces of a Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
their heads and their
hearts, are perpetually full
of new deſignes, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching
innocent Virgins,
of diſhonouring the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
bed of their friend,
and of ridding themſelves
of an injoyment of which
they are tired: neither is
it their earneſtneſs of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Country, that
makes them neglect mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
no all their time is
ſpent in their dreſſes, their
Courtſhip, and their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
it can be nothing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95478:35"/>
but their violent inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to vice, which are
aſſiſted from below, that
makes them do this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
to ſacred things:
and it is ſtrange to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that thoſe who have
no better characters ſhould
yet win any thing upon
the tempers of men: they
are thoſe who as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally
ſpend the eſtates of
antient and noble Families,
ſo they will in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
leave the next ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
nothing but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
diſtempers, and
french conſumptions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they content with

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95478:36"/>
and to bring into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
thoſe things that have
ſo long worn the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
but they indeavour
to remove all reverence to

not only owning, but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
in Atheiſm; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in contempt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of thoſe that would
inſtruct them, ſuch a Sect
of Philoſophers the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
world could not
ſhow; and we may think,
that it had not been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with them now, had
they not been the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
either of its diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or ſome Times of dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95478:36"/>
events: the glorious
Creator of the world, when
he permits to be owned, and
practiſed, principles ſo fatal
and pernicious to all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all Lawes, Intereſts,
and ſocieties in the world,
forewarnes us of mighty
revolutions: and I am apt
to believe, that they have
reached the higheſt ſteps,
that the baſeneſs and the
degeneracy of man can go;
it is impoſſible any age
ſhould be more wicked, or
triumph more in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and their crimes.
But there are others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe Dons that do
injuries to marriage, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe.</p>

Firſt who ſpake of it
with little reſpect; thereby
begetting ſtrange fears, and
prejudices in the mindes of
the Youth, if there are
thoſe whoſe inclinations are
for a ſingle life, and they
live in that with chaſtity,
and diſcretion, no one ought
to accuſe them for ſuch a
manner of life, but why
ſhould they mock at all
practices that are contrary
to their own? ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leight
diſcourſes I know will
weigh very little with wiſe
and prudent perſons, but
unexperienced Youth, is
apt to be affected with
things confidently delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95478:37"/>
though there be ſome
times little ſence in them;
if they have a mind to
exerciſe their wit, let
them chuſe a ſubject more
agreeable to the intereſts
and the complexion of
mankind; and let them
think it to be a little rude
to reproach the practice
of their Fathers, and the
greateſt part of the world,
which they do in ſpeaking
againſt marriage. Never
any age had more trifling
gallantries than this has,
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet none was ever
more in love with them;
great capacities were of
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, ſerious, modeſt, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95478:38"/>
unaffected; but now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that
ownes a little wit, makes
ſuch a noiſe with it, as to
diſturb the quiet and the
ſerious affaires of the
world. But there are
thoſe, who have done
greater injuries to marriage
and they are,</p>
            <p>Secondly thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
it by their own
practiſes. If we ſhould
here examine all thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things, that prove a
diſcredit to that condition
we ſhould undertake a task
too long and difficult, ſince
there are ſo many little
affairs, which (like the
ſmall heads of Rivers) by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95478:38"/>
the covered adventures of
a long courſe, open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at laſt in great floods
of diſcontents, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
there are cauſes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
in marriage, that
pretend a priviledge from
diſputes; but this we may
ſay with freedom enough,
that the indiſcretions alone
of many in this condition
have been the cauſes of
conſiderable miſcarriages,
and that not in the firſt
choice, but after manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and as it ſometimes
happens in greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
that an injury done
to an inconſiderable perſon,
(as lately in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95478:39"/>
has, through unknown
wayes, produced effects,
as have ſhook the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
of thoſe Empires
themſelves. So little peices
of imprudence, have been
the firſt cauſes of great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
in marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
we may plainly ſee, that as
in all the concernments of
the whole world, if there
had been, but half that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and prudence in
the management of them,
as there has been of other
pretences, the world had
known much more repoſe,
ſatisfaction, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than it now can ſhew;
ſo if thoſe in the ſtate of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95478:39"/>
marriage, had truſted more
to ſuch ſafe indowments,
than to their little gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and pretended ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies,
we had ſeen few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
inſtances of ill-betrothed
pairs. Many preſume upon
their own good qualities, or
truſt too much to their
being lov'd, even whileſt
they withdraw the cauſes
of that affection. Others
love to railly with imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
injuries, not taking
right meaſures of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
they ſo accoſt. Some
expect, that the comforts
and bleſſings of marriage,
ſhould coſt them no indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95478:40"/>
and prudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Others give cauſes
of real wrongs, by fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly
hunting for imagined:
and much of the ſcandal,
that lies upon that Sex, is
originally owing to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Husbands: without
doubt, the ſmalleſt diſguſts,
and weakneſſes in families
ſhould be concealed from
the whole world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the firſt prudence,
diſtinguiſhed mankind into
particular dwellings, that
none might be witneſſes of
ſuch things, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
encreaſed, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vell'd
into greater quarrels, when
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95478:40"/>
they are known and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
There art others, who
aſſiſt themſelves to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of that vertue, they
ought to maintain; the
mind is not a thing hard
and impenetrable, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the impreſſions of
what ſtands next it; and
many by their own folly,
unperceiveably create thoſe
inclinations, in that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may in time
prove fatal to their repoſe;
and it happens often pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
as in publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes,
where that vertue,
which was ſtrong, &amp; perfect,
in places of ſerious, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95478:41"/>
living, has inſenſibly
declined (and unperceived
by the owner) where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
intrigues, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are publiquely owned;
and that converſation,
which is the <hi>Mode,</hi> thoſe
inclinations do they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
who have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in it. This does not
deny, but that many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of great vertue, may
live amongſt thoſe who are
vitious: but we ſpeak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of what is general. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are too careleſs of
their love affairs; and I
ſcruple not at all to affirm,
that though jealouſie is a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95478:41"/>
very ill thing, yet a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
conduct and care, is
abſolutely neceſſary for the
preſervation of vertue: I
underſtand not thoſe, who
call neglects of this nature,
a good diſpoſition and
much love, ſince thoſe are
much greater, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to remove temptations
from the valued object,
then to expect unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
a victorious vertue in
the middeſt of aſſaults. Sir,
I have pointed at but very
few of thoſe things, that
prove the firſt grounds of
diſcontents in marriage, and
ſo by conſequence of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95478:42"/>
reproaches are flung upon
that condition. There are
beſides a thouſand more;
ſome that might be named,
and others that are better
concealed. But there is one
thing that proves the greateſt
ground of after diſcontents,
and that is imprudent choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
either unſuitable to our
humours, education, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or affairs; this indeed
is a very great prejudice to
marriage, but ought not to
be reckoned, as a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to that condition; ſince,
though our Creator has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us uſeful, happy, and
agreeable inſtitutions, yet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95478:42"/>
our own follies, and want
of braines, is a reproach to
our ſelves alone: if we by
indiſcretion, covetouſneſs,
or other vain inclinations,
will throw our ſelves into
ſtrange unions, we ought
to beare the ſcandal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
fopps; and not
expect that the prudence,
or lovely order of things,
ſhould be broken, to repair
our weakneſſes; marriage
is free from the miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that follow the actions
of theſe men. Beſides the
moſt excellent enjoyments
of humane life, are the moſt
nice, and critical; and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95478:43"/>
where the advantages are
extraordinary, an ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
muſt needs make
the prejudices the ſame:
and the greateſt juſtice
theſe men can do the world,
and the greateſt prudence,
and nobleneſs they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſhewing, is by an
invincible diſcretion, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
to do right to that
condition, their firſt follies
had wronged. We have
now inquired of diſcretion;
next we may celebrate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as a foundation of
vertuous unions. This ſhould
have been the firſt, but the
other has a larger ſway;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95478:43"/>
yet if this had the power
it ought, all would be
happy loves; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
of Man has thruſt
it out of theſe, as wel as
other affairs: yet without
this, it is poſſible, that
Time (if no other accidents
ſhould happen may bring
decayes upon the ſtrongeſt
paſſions; and neglects may

               </gap>ate of Love;
but this adds a perpetual
greeneneſs, and freſhneſs
to Love; this is uſed to
carry thoſe tenderneſſes,
and endearments to fifty,
and threeſcore, that were
knowne at twenty; and it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95478:44"/>
is the greateſt, and moſt ſure
conſervor of Love. There
are Sir, two things, that
may pretend an intereſt in
this diſcourſe. Divorce,
and Poligamy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the firſt,
we may ſay in ſhort, that
it is (one caſe excepted)
forbidden by unanſwerable
Scriptures: and the beſt
prudence of Mankind: for,
it would be the inlet to
the greateſt diſorders, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuities,
and extravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
that the World
could know. And for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy,
tis enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
it, that the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the married life,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95478:44"/>
and that in the poſſeſſion of
all the advantages and
pleaſures, that innnocence,
and Paradice could beſtow,
was but of two; which
proves the divine intention
and the original benefits,
and happineſſes of that
ſtate, to conſiſt in one
Love: beſides the practiſes
of the new Teſtament: and
the inconveniences of the
contrary, in Countries
where it is allowed, where
nothing but an inſatiable,
(not quenched but infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by variety) and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
ſottiſh luſt, reignes
in the generality; and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95478:45"/>
amongſt the wiſe, there
are either the perplexities
of unreconcileable dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique
quarrels; or elſe
that liberty laid down, for
the pleaſures of repoſe,
and contentment. And now
Sir, after we have been ſo
long ſerious, tis agreeable
to our Youth, to divert
our ſelves, with opening
the gay and pleaſant ſcenes
of Love, and deſcribe a
little the felicities of that
paſſion: it would be but
juſt, ſomething to looſen a
minde bound up to grave
and ſerious conſiderations,
by celebrating a love, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95478:45"/>
has ſo large a Dominion
in the Earth; but I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sir, that this is the
province of greater men,
and our Maſters the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
will not allow us
this freedome; as they
alone pretend to make
Love, with glory, and
ſucceſs; ſo they alone will
record their adventures:

the harangue with ends of
French, without which

beautifully; we ſubmit to
them, and as we cannot

the mighty concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thy Youth, but
they muſt borrow dreſſes
from their neighbours, for
their victorious paſſions:
yet the capricio of thy
Fortune is ſomething
ſtrange, whil'ſt it is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to beg an Almes
at a Romans door, (to
whoſe Gallantry thou yet
haſt owed ſo much) but
