            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat oblique Descants will come traverse upon this honest <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi> I already preiudicate. The fate of those who write of <hi>Times</hi> within ken, <hi>Times</hi> better for the <hi>History</hi> then for the <hi>Historian;</hi> for while they render <hi>Truth</hi> more <hi>resplendent,</hi> they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bring the <hi>Relater</hi> under a <hi>cloud.</hi> Whence the bane of all faithfull <hi>Tradition,</hi> that an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian</hi> is rarely <hi>found,</hi> untill the <hi>Truth</hi> be <hi>lost</hi> And what is History without, its <hi>Idiome; Truth,</hi> but a meer <hi>Romance?</hi> And if so, what pen will undertake the History of a King? Kings in their Functions so neer resemble the Divine Nature, as <hi>God</hi> himself hath styled them <hi>Gods.</hi> And as in many respects they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it, so also in that of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> though <note place="margin">Epist.</note> not in his sense, <hi>De Deo etiam periculosum est dicere verum.</hi> Though as <hi>Men</hi> they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the incidence of frailty, (for as that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">Antoninus Pius apud Iul. Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinum.</note> said, <hi>Imperium non tollit affectus. Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty doth not proscribe humane affections)</hi> yet their very failings have been in former times accounted, like their Persons, so sacred
<pb facs="tcp:95383:3"/>
that to touch them, though never so tenderly, hath been esteemed Petty-Treason. But in King <hi>Charles</hi> (the grand concernment of these Annals) the Danger is counter changed, to exhibit in him any thing of merit, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lesse then a <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Domitian,</hi> many will not endure. And these two extremes make my passage through this History like that of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> to the <hi>Philistims, A sharpe rock on the one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 4.</note> 
               <hi>side, and a sharpe rock on the other side.</hi> Which consideration hath moved me to decline ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, otherwayes remarkable, and not commonly known, and to content my self with <hi>saving-truths.</hi> Nor should I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to have interposed a modest vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this <hi>King</hi> in some particulars, not reflecting upon the fatall proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, had not the ingenuity of some eminently dis-affected to him, led me the way.</p>
            <p>But if in relation to these perils, I am studious to bear my self erect, yet in other concernments, some will censure me for too strong a Biass.</p>
            <p>Some will say I seem no friend to the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and left my silence should make this an <hi>Accusation,</hi> which is but a meer <hi>calumny;</hi> I answer, Church men I honour, (no man more) and this I do for their Sacred <hi>Orders</hi> sake. But if their Order be Sacred, it doth
<pb facs="tcp:95383:3"/>
not (I wish it did) make all such who are initiated in that Order; too many of that holy profession are, ever were, and will be <hi>Sacred</hi> in another and worse sense. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctifyed lives of some Officiating at the Sacred <hi>Altar,</hi> have been the complaint of all ages. Read we not to their shame of the <hi>Sons of Ely,</hi> whose impiety made men <hi>abhor</hi>

               <hi>Parent</hi> of <hi>ill-will</hi> is no novelty, no not where no <hi>ill-will</hi> is the Parent of that Truth, as in this work of mine; for of those whom it will have the unhappinesse to displease, not a single unite can challenge me for any personall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against him; or justly say, I have made <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> do the drudgery of mine own despight.</p>
            <p>Nor perhaps will the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> esteem me altogether well-affected to them. A crime the lesse, because almost epidemical and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from their so principally occasioning our late sad distractions, yet have I so much charity for them, as heartily to wish they may read their errour in their punishment. For they who were so instrumental towards the ruine of their <hi>Superiour Order,</hi> have lived to feel the reverberation of divine indignation by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of chastisement upon their owne <hi>Calling.</hi> So even and equall a decorum doth the wisdome of <hi>God</hi> observe in the Oeconomy, and dispensation of his judgment.</p>
            <p>Nor will all objections reflect upon my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, some will also upon my Narrative, and fault its <hi>Orthography,</hi> which consists in the true representation, not of <hi>Words,</hi> but <hi>Things.</hi> I have constantly conversed in the vale of rurall recesse, far from the Court (the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and vantage ground of observation) and upon that very account, this poor infant, even before it can speak, before it comes to the birth
<pb facs="tcp:95383:4"/>
of edition, while it is yet in the womb of the Presse, is already by some <hi>reprobated</hi> for <hi>errors foreseen.</hi> The best is this Objection was not earlier contrived, then my Answer framed. Ocular observation of the Author is not absolutely necessary to the credibility of a story; for that were all at once, not to eclipse, but totally to extingush the light of all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (Sacred only excepted) whatsoever, the greatest part whereof were <hi>Postscript</hi> an age at least to the things recorded: and they who wrote the memorials of their own times, as <hi>Thucydides, Xenophon, Herodian</hi> and others, who are the most accurate Reporters, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confesse, they as well derive some things <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>upon trust from others,</hi> as other things they deliver upon their own credit. To speak therefore <hi>ad idem,</hi> close, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to mine own vindication, to satisfie the impertinent curiosity of these enquirers, I shall descend to these overtures. As to what things are matters of <hi>Record,</hi> I confesse I have not consulted the very originals, but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Copies, but of so neer extraction, as they are but once removed from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it self. In other affaires, my information hath constantly resulted from Persons, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly present, but eminently, and some in <hi>Chief</hi> commanding in the actions, or principal instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Transactions. And as the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:95383:5"/>
part of this information did flow from one single hand, so (for the credit of my labour) may I give this account of him, that he had as certain and as ful intelligence of all emergencies both forain and domestique, as any one in this Nation: and as he was too judicious to receive, so was he too honest to transmit a vain report; whereby, confident I am, I stand secure against any substantial falshoods, and I hope against circumstantial also, especially in point of <hi>I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities,</hi> in assigning all both <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> their proper times, no one of which I will be bold to say is so in these Annals mislaid, as to super-annuate, and not many to vary from the very day of their prime existence. But if I be detected to have mis-reported any thing, light the errour where it will, my solace 'tis, <hi>Nemo Historicus non aliquod mentitus, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biturus</hi>

The gallantry of <hi>Henry</hi>'s heroique spirit ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded somewhat to the disadvantage and extenuation of <hi>Charles</hi> his glory, who arriving at his years, and wanting nothing of his Princely institution, came yet short of him in the acquist of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with the People. <hi>Henry</hi> of a forward, and enterprising; <hi>Charles</hi> of a studious, and retired spirit: whereof the blame may in part be imputed to some organicall impotences in his body. For in his state of increment and growth, he was exceeding fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his lower parts, his legs growing not erect, but repandous and embowed, whereby he was unapt for exercises of activity. Again, he was none of the gracefullest Orators, for his words came difficultly from him, which rendred him indisposed to speak much. But in the flux of time, and when he began to look man in the face, those tender limbs began so to consolidate and knit together, as the most eminently famed for exercises of honour, were forced to yeeld him up the garland. And though his vocall impediment accompanyed him till the fatall stroke, yet was it to wise men an index of his wisdome: therefore <hi>Obloquy</hi> never plaid the fool so much, as in imputing folly to him, since there was never, or very rarely, known a fool that stammered. And for his intellectuals, he gave in the Spanish Court (where was

For the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Spaniard</hi> would not admit the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> into the fabrick of the Capitulation, no not by way of Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, but said it should be as a reserve of gratuity to conferre upon the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> after the Nuptials consummated. And besides, he spun out and protracted the procedure of the affair to a length, tedious to the Prince, and (as it happened) destructive to the whole designe. For the transaction being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted to the very signing of the Articles on both parts, and the obtaining a Dispensation from his Holiness, and all things fit for Contract and Espousals, in the very nick of time (a strange traverse of Providence) dyes Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> whose death put all to a stand; for his Dispensation being now as null as himself, a necessity there was of soliciting Pope <hi>Urban</hi> for another, which negotiated to the best improvement of expedition, could not be obtained on the suddain. And (as if the rescue had been by conspiracie) at that very time Dispatches came from King <hi>Iames,</hi> to summon the Prince speedily home; who, glad of the occasion, communicates to <hi>Philip</hi> his Fathers call, and pressed the necessity of his obedience so close, as his Catholick Majesty could not in civility deny him. Matters being in this wavering posture, the lazy <hi>Spaniard</hi> bestirs him, and importunately moves on the other side; that, since he might not disoblige his Highness from obeying his Fathers order, and that this unhappy <hi>remora</hi> could onely amount to the losse of some few dayes, and seeing there remained still the same inclination of alliance on both parts, according to the tenour of the Articles, he would be pleased to assigne in his absence some Proxy to contract with the <hi>Infanta</hi> after a new Dispensation had from <hi>Rome.</hi> To whom the Prince returned answer: That he would impower the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> to give his Majesty all satisfaction in that particular; which accordingly he did. Nothing was now left to impede his Highness return, but to ceremoniate his dismission agreeable to his reception. And (whatever the linings were) certain it is, there was such a fair outside of love, such a seeming serenity of affairs, such dear
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95383:6"/>
               <hi>accollado's</hi> interchanged between <hi>Philip</hi> and his Highness, at their valediction and parting, as eye scarce ever beheld the like. There goes a report that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had a design to have staid him, but that he outstript the Post; which I leave, as I find it, dubious. But certain it is, the Prince began to nauseate the match, and to meditate all honourable evasions, and no sooner was he aboard the vessell of his reduction, but he disparched a clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Agent to the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> with an expresse order, not to yeeld up his Proxie, till further instructed from <hi>England.</hi> And so he hoisted up sail for his beloved <hi>Ithaca,</hi> and home; upon whose prosperous arrival, being <hi>Octob.</hi> the 5. the Kingdome fell into so generall a conflagration with bone-fires, as if the people had meant to make an holocaust of it, such an universal and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall joy there was, not only that <hi>Charles</hi> was returned safe, but that also without his lading: In truth they were so co-incident, as the loyal hearted <hi>English</hi> could not distinguish between the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> match and <hi>Charles</hi> his ruine. Upon his first accesse to his Fathers Court, after many dear and cordial welcomes, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his Majesty the state of his Negotiation, who perceiving upon the hole sum, that the slie <hi>Spaniard</hi> practised to make an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter game of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and observing a generall disgust in the hole Kingdome, by advice of his Privie Councel, dispatcheth Letters to the Earl of <hi>Bristoll, enjoyning him positively to demand restitution of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>and that till he had absolute satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein, the Proxy should not be delivered, nor any further progresse made in the Treaty.</hi> This unexpected proposall put his Catholique majesty into such a dazling demur, as it was no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to presage a finall rupture would ensue, which (after the Treaty had lain languishing about five moneths) happened by the solicitation of the Parliament, <hi>March,</hi> 24. 1623. The esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation his Highnesse got in this expedition of a solid and serious Prince, was more then could be expected from his puisne years of 23.</p>
            <p>Nor was this the only service that adventure did him, it gave <note place="margin">Overtures of the <hi>French</hi> Alliance.</note> him also a transitory view of that excellent Lady, whom the supreme Moderator of all things had reserved for him. For <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> being obvious to him, and in his way to <hi>Spain,</hi> he delaid there one day, where fortune entertained him with a sight of the Princesse <hi>Henretta Maria</hi> at a Court Masque; this view he stole undiscovered, through the benefit of a false hair: I will not say this casualty was causal to the first design of soliciting that alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; yet possible it is, that first ocular acquaintance with her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, might create something of affection in him beyond neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality; what occasion it was first started that Treaty, I know not, but for certain there never was such an harmony of universal votes in any affair of that quality, between the two Crowns, as in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95383:7"/>
this. For King <hi>Iames</hi> recommending it to the consideration of his Privie Councell, they extol both the relation and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the match, assuring his Majesty the project would take passing well in an Assembly of the three Estates; whose convention his Majesty having before meditated in order to the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he now fals upon resolution, and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth summons for the Parliament to assemble: which being met, and the businesse propounded, it was entertained with an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous consent, and a motion made, that an Ambassador should be sent over to negotiate the Treaty. The King finding the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament so great zelots in this design, he presently issueth out a Commission to the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> to that intent. Who being a most commodious and proper instrument for such an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, speedily imbarques for <hi>France,</hi> where upon the prime over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his message at the French Court, he found so ready and fluent an inclination in King <hi>Lewes,</hi> as he was able to divine the issue before capitulation, whereof he early transmitted advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Master, who upon notice of it (for the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the correspondence, and to expresse the exuberancy of his devotion to the match) superinducted the Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi> as an additionall Ambassador to the Earl of <hi>Holland.</hi> And from <hi>France, Lewes</hi> (who disdained to be wanting in any dues of compli-ment) dispatcheth the Marquesse <hi>D' Effait</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> These noble instruments of State ply'd their instructions with that diligence and fidelity, as the accord was full formed, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> the 10. 1624. and Articles signed on both sides, so as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> seemed now as one Continent, and all of a piece. True it is there wanted a dispensation from the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof his Majesty of <hi>France</hi> was then in pursuit.</p>
            <p>But in the interim of that delay, King <hi>Iames</hi> (as if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of that match had been his <hi>consummatum est)</hi> brake <note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> his Death.</note> up his ruinous house of clay, surrendring up at <hi>Theobalds</hi> his soul to <hi>God,</hi> and his three Kingdomes to his Son, <hi>March</hi> 27. 1625.</p>
            <p>It will not be amisse nor ablude from the usuall ceremony or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the bodies of extinct Princes, if I here represent in brief the pourtraicture of this famous Monarch, which I will do freely, sincerely, and with a spirit which equally disdaines to libel or to flatter him.</p>
            <p>In the stile of the Court he went for <hi>Great Britain's Solomon;</hi> nor is it any excursion beyond the precincts of verity to say, <note place="margin">His Character.</note> that neither <hi>Britain</hi> nor any other Kingdome whatsoever, could ever, since <hi>Solomon</hi>'s daies, glory in a King, (for recondite learning, and abstruse knowledge) so near a match to <hi>Solomon,</hi> as He. And though he was an universall Scholar, yet did he make other sciences (their most proper imployment) but drudges
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95383:7"/>
and serviteurs to Divinity, wherein he became so transcendently eminent, as he notoriously foyl'd the greatest Clerks of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> See. Nor did his Theological abilities more advantage the cause of Religion abroad, then at home, they keeping the now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled-Clergie aloof, and at distance, as not daring to infuse into so solid a judgement their upstart and erroneous fancies, no nor disquiet the Churches peace with heterodox opinions. A stout adversary he was to the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> whom he call'd, as <hi>Prosper</hi> before him, the <hi>enemies of Gods grace.</hi> And as slender a friend to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> of whose tyrannical and Antimonarchical principles he had had from his cradle smart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. He was an excellent speaker, the scheme of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory being more stately, then pedantique, and the expressions argu'd him both a King and Scholar. In his apparell and civill garb he seemed naturally to affect a majestique carelesnesse, which was so hectique, so habitual in him, as even in religious exercises, where the extern demeanour is a grand part of that sacred ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, he was somewhat too incurious and irreverent. He was indulgent a little to his palat, and had a smack of the Epicure. In pecuniary dispensations to his Favourites he was excessive liberal, yea though the exigence of his own wants pleaded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Studious he was of Peace, somewhat overmuch for a King, which many imputed to Pusillanimity; and for certain the thought of war was very terrible to him: whereof there needs no further demonstration then his manage of the cause of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate:</hi> for had he had the least scintillation of animosity, or majestick indignation, would he have so long endured his Son in law exterminated from his Patrimony, while the <hi>Austrian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (to his great dishonour) <hi>cajol'd</hi> and kept him in delusory chat with specious fallacies? Would he in those severall negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Carlile, Bristow, Belfast,</hi> and <hi>Weston,</hi> have trifled away so vast sums, the moity whereof, had they been disposed in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary levies, would have modelled an Army able (when <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delburgh, Manheim,</hi> and <hi>Frankindale</hi> defended themselves) to have totally dissipated all the forces of the usurpers, to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered the imperious Eagle, enforcing her to forgoe her quarry, and re-estated the <hi>Paltzgrave?</hi> Would he so shamefully have courted the alliance of <hi>Spain</hi> to the very great regret of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whom his Predecessor had so often baffled, and whom <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ever found a worse friend, then enemy? What stronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be given in of a wonderfull defect of courage? As this lipothymie, this faint-heartednesse lost him the reputation and respects of his people, so his heavie pressures upon them, and undue levies by Privy-seals and the like, alienated their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, especially considering how those moneys were mis-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, indeed rather thrown away, partly in the two dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95383:8"/>
treaties of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and the consequential enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and partly in largesses upon his Minion <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Between this disaffection and contempt in his people, there was generated a general disposition to turbulent and boystrous darings, and expostulations even against his darling Prerogative; And though those dismall calamities which befel his son, were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ampliated by a superfetation of causes, yet was their first and main existency derivative from those seminalities; Let Court-pens extol the calmnesse of his Halcyonian reign with all artifice of Rhetorique, yet can they never deny but that admired serenity had its set in a cloud, and that he left to his successour both an empty Purse and Crown of thornes.</p>
            <p>The death of this famous Monarch caused no other <hi>Interreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> then of Joy, his Son <hi>Charles</hi> being immediately by Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

These instructions were precisely observed, and on <hi>May</hi> 11. the Espousals solemnized in the Church of <hi>Nostre-Dame</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> the Queen being given by her two Brothers, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur.</hi> The Nuptials past, his Majesty thought long till he was personally, as well as virtually, united to his beloved moiety, and therefore dispatcheth over the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> with other personages of quality, both to accelerate her transfretation, and wait upon her with the greater splendour. <hi>May</hi> the 24. they arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Iune</hi> the 2. the Queen (after the iteration of most affectionate adieus, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and interchanged between the King and her self) set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for <hi>Amiens,</hi> where being attended with a most princely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, she was under the restraint of a magnificent entertainment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95383:8"/>
till the 16. of that moneths; thence she dislodged for <hi>Bulloign,</hi> where she was to imbarque for <hi>England,</hi> (the contagion being then much at <hi>Calais)</hi> there she found ready to receive her, one and twenty tall Ships sent from her Dearest, with a gallant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of the Dutchesse of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and other Ladies of honour and eminence to serve her. <hi>Iune</hi> 22. she set sail for <hi>England,</hi> and landed safe at <hi>Dover</hi> after a turbulent and tempestuous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. His Majesty lay that night at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and next morning with joy incredible greeted his royal Consort, and conducted her to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where the marriage was finally completed; the <hi>Duke of Chevereux,</hi> his Majesties former Representative, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing up his precious charge to the King. From <hi>Canterbury</hi> his now dual Majesty took coach for <hi>White-hall,</hi> where the third day after their arrivall, presenting themselves in their Royal Thrones before the Nobles of the Realm, their Marriage was declared with great exultations and rejoycings: but soon after they were warned to depart; for <hi>London</hi> being then visited and empested with a fierce and furious contagion, it began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large its quarters so far, as at length it seised even <hi>White-hall</hi> it self, which necessitated the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> to remove to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It doth, I know, render King <hi>Charles</hi> obnoxious to untoward and sinister descants, that he commenced his reign with so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auspicious <note place="margin">A Reflex up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</note> an omen, as that prodigious pestilence; yet, setting aside that mortality had now taken forth a larger Commission, what can be imputed more to him, then that he did Patrize? Would the suggestors of that oblique construction search coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, little more then a score of years, they might learn that King <hi>Iames</hi> (who enjoyed the longest term of peace of any <hi>British</hi> King since the Conquest) initiated his government with, and under the same calamity. Nay it is farther remarkable, that these two plagues, that of the Father, this of the Son, were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives both of one Parish <hi>(White Chappel)</hi> yea under the same roof, and issued forth on the same day of the moneth; such correspondence was there in their entrance, who were so diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sify'd in their exits.</p>
            <p>To the former paragraph, and short discourse upon the grand Infection, give me leave to adde another, (and both within Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical <note place="margin">And upon the Alliance.</note> toleration) by way of speculation upon the <hi>French</hi> Alliance. I have heard some great pretenders to <hi>State-aetiology,</hi> and who undertake to mate all events with their proper causes, passionately ascribe <hi>Englands</hi> calamities to those internuptials, and fetch that ireful stroke of divine Justice upon his late Majesty from his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Lady of mis-belief. Grant I do that both <hi>Englands</hi> and his Majesties sufferings may in some sort be reductive to the causality of that match, but that there was any intrinsique noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95383:9"/>
in it, either as <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Popish,</hi> I am not yet convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. As <hi>French,</hi> it could not morally operate any thing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably destructive to us, in regard our correspondence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with that nation was rarely lesse then during that alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Again, certain it is, and I have partly proved it before, that the self same spirit of contest (the main cause of our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) between regall Prerogative and popular Liberty (I had almost said Licentiousnesse) was emergent long before that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Nor dare I affix direct and absolute culpability to it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare account of its being <hi>Popish</hi> meerly, which I can more easily dislike, then justly blame. It is, I know, with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence urged what S. <hi>Paul</hi> interdicted the <hi>Corinthians: Be not unequally yoked.</hi> But that prohibition being determined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly to Infidels, and persons of another Religion, is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly apply'd to Papists, who hold the same fundamentals (the Creed Apostolical) with us, and are in truth of the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Christian, with us; to thousands of whom we dare not think the advenue's of eternal blessednesse precluded; for though there be many errors in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which will not admit of reconciliation; yet are there many thousand mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof whose incuriosity contented with ordinary and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truths, neglect the acquaintance of those noxious myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and are in the safest plight by reason of their plain and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple belief. It cannot be denied, but unity and individuation of <note place="margin">Caeteram tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam credendi simplicitas tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimam facit. <hi>Aug. Ep. Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. cap.</hi> 4.</note> perswasion in all points of sacred truths, were to be wished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween married couples; yet notwithstanding it is not of such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity to Matrimonial bonds, but (where other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations of congruity respond not) we are probably indulged the choice of one of dissenting belief. And this was at this time King <hi>Charles</hi> his case, for such was the paucity of Protestant Princes, as the hole tribe of Reformation was not able to furnish and supply him with one single match of agreeable birth and fortune. But be the sin as great as malice it self can wish it; yet can it not be truly stiled his; who, though he was most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, was least conversant in the transaction of the businesse; For, as I have already manifested, (before his adeption of the crown) the affair had clearly proceeded beyond an honourable retreat, being not only commenced, but fully and finally made up by his Father with the unanim vote of Parliament. So that to the obligation of his filial obedience, there was superinducted a decent complacence with the three Estates; the Principality of the crime (if a crime it must be) being theirs, theirs was also the greater condignity of the Block. But Divine vengeance issuing out no signal attachment against them, convinceth this idle sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of ill contrivance, since nothing is more preposterous then to punish the accessary, and discharge the prime offender.</p>

The same time while his Majesty was thus buryed in his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous negotiation abroad, he ply'd as well his interest at home, and while he wooed his Royal Mistresse there, he made love to his people here by summoning a Parliament: that league being not <note place="margin">A Parliament called.</note> more important to him as Man, then this as King; for as man is without a female consort, so is a King without his supreme Councel, an half-form'd, steril thing; the natural extracts of the one procreated without a wife, are not more spurious then the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique descendants of the other without the coition of a Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. The solemnity of this grand match was commenced at <hi>Westminster, Iune</hi> the 18.

            <p>Though deny'd it could not be, but this Speech was elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of very rational materials, and ponderous arguments, yet did it not cause such a precipitation of resolution, but that the Parliament did descend to consideration of it by degrees. That which retarded the debate was this. They had in store by them two <hi>Petitions,</hi> one for <hi>Religion,</hi> the other against <hi>Grievances;</hi> to which, having been model'd in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, and prefer'd to him at the close of the last Session of the last Parliament, they as yet never received answer. They said it was the ancient, and as they <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Answer.</note> conceived, a most prudentiall practice, to present Petitions at the Commencement of Parliaments, or so long before their dissolution, as the King might have time to return a full and deliberate answer; That the same course they were resolved strictly to pursue, and give priority of dispatch to those Petitions, before any other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whatsoever; which accordingly they did. To the severall heads against grievances his Majesty gave a distinct and satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry answer, and promised largely to the Petition for Religion: and the better to draw on supplies, he did audit to them the severall disbursments, both relating to the Army and Navie, that all jealousies of mis-imployment might be removed; which produced so good effects, as the Laity gave him, freely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coudition, two <hi>Subsidies</hi> from Protestants, and four from Papists, as a mulct of the House upon their Recusancy, and the Clergie three.</p>
            <p>In this Session of Parliament was Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> questioned <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> questioned?</note> for publishing certain Books prejudiciall to the Protestant cause, for which he was ordered to be brought to the bar, to whom the Speaker declared the pleasure of the House, <hi>That they would referre his censure to their next meeting, and in the interim in respect of his notorious contempt, he should stand cnmmitted to the Serjeants Ward, entring Bail for his then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95383:11"/>
But Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> had by the artifice of his Court friends cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly crept into the <hi>Kings</hi> service undiscerned, and the <hi>King</hi> signifyed to the Parliament two days after, <hi>That he thought his servants (whereof</hi> Mountague <hi>was one) might have as much protection as the servant of an ordinary Burgesse.</hi> Neverthelesse his bond of two thousand pound whereupon he was tailed, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uncancelled.</p>
            <p>This Session was also enacted a Law for punishing of divers abuses committed on the <hi>Lords-day</hi> called Sunday.</p>
            <p>A Law enabling the <hi>Kings</hi> Majesty to make Leases of Lands parcel of his Highnesse Dutchy of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> or annexed to the same.</p>
            <p>A Law for the ease in obtaining of <hi>Licences</hi> of <hi>Alienation,</hi> and in the pleading of <hi>Alienations</hi> with <hi>Licence,</hi> or of <hi>Pardon</hi> of <hi>Alienation</hi> without <hi>Licence,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> or elsewhere.</p>
            <p>A Law for the further restraint of tipling in Innes, Alehouses and other Victualling houses.</p>
            <p>An Act that this Session of Parliament shall not determine by his Majesties royall assent to these Acts.</p>
            <p>There passed also in the House of Commons a Bill of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> but because it was limited to a year, whereas former grants to his Majesties predecessors were for term of life, it was foundred in the Lords House, and went no further; the cause of this restraint was,</p>
            <p>In the Parliament 18. of King <hi>Iames,</hi> the Kings Councell culled out of that Act reasons for pretermitted Customes, and other impositions, which were then charged upon, and grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Subject. Again, there had been lately set an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate rate upon those <hi>Customes,</hi> and therefore they had in designe to reduce them to the rate setled in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, but they had not time enough at present to make the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> the first the Parliament met again at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Divinity Schoole was appointed for the House of Commons, <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assembled at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </note> and the Galleries above for the House of Lords. The fourth of the same month both Houses were called together to <hi>Christ-Church-hall</hi> by the King, where he laid open to them his wants for setting forth the Fleet. But the Parliament before they would return his Majesty any answer, presented him with a Petition against Recusants to this effect.</p>

            <p>To all these severall branches the <hi>King</hi> return'd <hi>August</hi> 7. an <note place="margin">The Kings Answer.</note> answer so plausible and satisfactory, as nothing could be desired more.</p>
            <p>One good turn requires another, and as the King had given the Parliament ample content by this answer: so he hoped they would be as cheerfull in supplying him with moneys, for which he earnestly importuned them, and especially for his great Naval preparation. Whereupon ensued a great debate in the House, some were very prompt to give, some would give, but in convenient time, not then: Some would give, but they complained that the design was managed by <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Single Councell,</hi> that Sir <hi>Robert Mansel</hi> a man of judgement and experience, had declared against the Plot, and had tendred the Councell of War a project of greater advantage and lesse expence, which was approved by the Lord of <hi>Chichester;</hi> To which the <hi>Solicitor</hi> replyed in the <hi>Dukes</hi> behalf, that the Councel of War, for the generality, much disliked the project of Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and concluded upon what was then intended. But the greater part agreed not to give, and to make an humble <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> declaring the causes and reasons of their not giving. Most of the voters of this Remonstrance, flew high and impetuously prest in upon the <hi>Duke,</hi> some would devest him of his offices, the Admiralty especially; others of his Revenue, by resuming what he possest of the Crown demeanes, others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an account of what publick monies he had been entrusted with. This being signify'd to the King, he soon prognosticated of what quality the Remonstrance would prove, therefore in distast he determined to dissolve the Parliament. The House of Commons were resolved into a Grand Committee, when the Usher came from the Lords house with that message, and before they would permit the Solicitor, then in the chair, to leave his seat, they agreed upon a Protestation, which Mr. <hi>Glanvile</hi> stood up and declared to this effect:</p>
            <p>First, To give his Majesty thanks for his gratious answer to our Petition for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95383:13"/>
Next, For his Care of our healths, in giving us leave to depart this dangerous time.</p>
            <p>Lastly, A dutifull declaration of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and loyalty, and purpose to supply his Majesty in a Parliamentary way, in a fitting and convenient time.</p>
            <p>This being done the Speaker took the Chair, and admitting the <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dissolved.</note> Usher he delivered his message from the Lords concerning the dissolution of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The dissolution of the Parliament gave the King an <hi>otium</hi> for his Summers pastime, and, that his own progresse might not impede That of his affairs, his Councel were his Synodites, and went along with him; by whose generall advice two things were most considerably resolved upon: <hi>First, that the Fleet should</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Treaty with the united Provinces.</note> 
               <hi>speedily put out to sea. Secondly, that a more straight amity should be entred into with with the States of the united Provinces:</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting to the King in <hi>September</hi> by their Ambassadors, prayed his conjunction with them in a league <hi>Offensive</hi> and <hi>Defensive</hi> against their common enemies, the <hi>Emperor</hi> and King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and not only so, but that he would also assist them in soliciting other Princes to associate with them in a confederation of equall latitude. To which our King freely condescended (upon agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the <hi>States</hi> should bear a fourth part of the charge of the Fleet) and in pursuance thereof sent in <hi>October</hi> next the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> over to the <hi>Hague,</hi> both to confer with the Ambassadors of other Princes about it, and to put his disconsolate sister in some hopes of her restitution to the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> But these two being arrived in <hi>Holland,</hi> found the Agents of <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Denmark</hi> not impowered to so large a concession, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their Masters condition was indisposed to so ample a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; whereupon for the better satisfaction of, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to all parties, the League was concluded in these words, <hi>For the restoring the Liberties of Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This negotiation having taken up somewhat more then a month, home returns the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Earl,</hi> where they abode not long, before <note place="margin">The ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of <hi>Gades</hi> Voyage.</note> they were saluted with the current newes of the mis-fortune of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Wimbletons</hi> Fleet at <hi>Gades.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> the eight the Admiral put forth to Sea, and on the twelfth was encountred with so furious a storm, that in conflict and skirmish with it, all his long-boats and the <hi>Long-Robert</hi> of <hi>Ipswich,</hi> a Ship
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95383:13"/>
wherein were a hundred seventy five persons perished, and the rest were so dissipated and scattered, that for seven daies, fifty of the <hi>English</hi> Navy, being in all but eighty, were missing. Again, when they met together in the height of the Southern <hi>Cape,</hi> and had a desire to make some local onset, a Councell of war being cal'd to resolve where the accompt should be first made (their Commission leaving them at that liberty) the debate was so long, as in the interim their discovery alarum'd the next coast to a posture of defence. At length the Councell determined an assault upon the Ships in the Bay of <hi>Gades,</hi> a design much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> Vice-Admiral, who eagerly desired there to play over his game of honour again, double or quit with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But that Fleet lay in a harbour inaccessible, unlesse the Fort belonging to <hi>Puntal Castle</hi> could be cleared; therefore order was given, <hi>That twenty</hi> English <hi>and five</hi> Dutch <hi>Ships should advance for that service.</hi> But the slender reputation the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had amongst the Mariners (as one ignorant in Sea affairs, and a deep disgust they took that he should be obtruded and thrust upon them in stead of Sir <hi>Robert Mansel,</hi> a gentleman peculiarly qualifyed for and long traded in Sea exploits, and who had an unquestionable right to the chief conduct of this enterprise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Dukes</hi> default) so lessen'd the influence of the authority, that the five <hi>Dutch</hi> only attended their duty, not a man of the other twenty stirring: which caused the Admiral from ship to ship personally to re-inforce his command, untill with much adoe he obtained their advance and engagement against the Castle; which, contrary to expectation, entertained the shock with so sturdy a defiance, as neer two thousand great shot put it not to the detriment of one stone. Whereupon the Admiral conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it that way impregnable, decreed to try it by a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force; to which end Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs</hi> (a Gentleman of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent gallantry in Martiall feats) was sent with a Regiment of Foot to manage that design; He going upon the service, met with some Horse and Foot of the enemies intending to impede his march, but he welcomed them with such a storm of courage, that the Captain Governour of the Castle viewing the tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and flight of his party, began to dislike the situation of his strength, and hang out a white flag, whereupon a parly ensued, and a <hi>resignation</hi> upon that <hi>Parly.</hi> The Fort with fifteen barrels of Powder, and eight pieces of Ordinance being now ours, the ships were consequently in the generall expectation adjudged us: therefore instructions were issued out for the firing of them, and Sir <hi>Samuel Argall</hi> was appointed to be the incendiary. And in the interim the Field-men were directed to land for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, to take in fresh-water, to forrage the Country, and to keep the stronger guard: but no sooner were they on shore,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95383:14"/>
then they discovered the cellars plentifully stock't with wine, whereof they caroused so liberally (every one being his own Vintner) in despite of more sober commands to the contrary, as put them upon the hazard of a dismall reckoning; for had the <hi>Spaniard</hi> known his advantage, he might have made a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table butchery amongst them, being worse fitted for flight then resistance, and the more disabled from running who were not able to stand. The Admirall finding the souldiers thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferably disordered, and perceiving that to stay longer were bootlesse, resolved to put to Sea again, and the rather by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the <hi>Plate-Fleet</hi> from the <hi>West-Indies</hi> was now expected every day. But first he sent to Sir <hi>Samuel Argal</hi> to know what exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution he had done, who returned answer, that their purpose was defeated by the enemies drawing up their best ships to <hi>Por<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Royal,</hi> and sinking others in the Channel, thereby to obstruct the adve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. Matters succeeding thus ill, the Admirall re-imbarques all and hoysing up sayl plies for the <hi>Southward Cape,</hi> there inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to wait twenty dayes for the <hi>Plate-Fleet,</hi> hoping to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve something against it, which might be adaequate to, and make even with the generall expectation at home: but he was in no capacity to performe any thing considerable against an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, unlesse by communication of his own calamity, for the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion so reigned in his Navie, that there were not hail men enow to handle the sails; and to make the affliction more sociable, there being a hundred and fifty sick in the S. <hi>George,</hi> the Councel orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (an odde method of cure) that every ship should take to nurse a couple of the sick, and subsortitiously, by lot, to supply their places with as many sound. This course so propagated the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it soon swept thousands over-board. This calamity took away the Admirals stomach to the Plate-fleet (which passed by within four dayes after) and enforced him to ply home with all the speed he could; but his motion was so retarded, that the newe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of his miscarriage much outwent him, and while every man stood gaping after the issue of the expedition, fame flew into his mouth and fill'd it with the report of what a bad market of reputation the <hi>English</hi> came to.</p>
            <p>Severall were the Descants of such as pretended to judicious <note place="margin">Descants upon it.</note> censure, as fancy or affection swayed the ballance; some blamed the Parliament for not supplying the <hi>Kings</hi> necessities, whereby the Fleet put forth too late, <hi>October</hi> being alwayes accounted with us a month formidable to Navigation, in regard of the usuall tempestuousnesse of the season, known under the notion of <hi>Micha elmas flaw.</hi> Some reflected sinisterly upon the <hi>Duke,</hi> saying, <hi>It never either was, or will be well with</hi> England, <hi>while the Sea is under the command of an Admirall so young, and withall so inexperienced.</hi> Others also made deductions from this miscarriage in reference to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95383:14"/>
the King, that because commencements do often forspeak the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of future contingencies in the series and row of succeeding affairs, they much feared this was but the earnest of some inauspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clousnesse which would attend the residue of his reign. Nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest was Captain <hi>Brets</hi> conjecture vain, who-told the Duke, <hi>That the Fleet was never like to speed better, wherein there went along, Bag without money, Cook without meat, and Love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charity;</hi> so were the three Captains named; and a great default there was, doubtlesse, of sufficient pay, of holesome meat, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>

               </note> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ordered a Commission to be sent out under the Great Seal, for putting in execution Lawes enacted against <hi>Recusants.</hi> This Commission was read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in all the Courts of Judicature at <hi>Redding,</hi> and withall a Letter was directed to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> enjoyning him to take special care within his Province for the discovery of <hi>Iesuites, Seminary Priests</hi> and other <hi>Recusants,</hi> offenders against the <hi>Lawes.</hi> It was in truth high time for severe proceedings against them, they having contracted so much inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, presuming protection by reason of the late match, that at <note place="margin">The Papists insolent.</note> 
               <hi>Winchester,</hi> and many other places, they frequently passed through the <hi>Churches</hi> in time of Divine Service, houting and ho-lo-ing, not only to the disturbance of that duty, but scorn of our <hi>Religion;</hi> yea and one <hi>Popish</hi> Lord when the <hi>King</hi> was at <hi>Chappell,</hi> was heard to prate on purpose lowder in a Gallery adjoyning, then the <hi>Chaplain</hi> prayed, whereat the King was so moved, that he sent this message to him, <hi>Either let him come and doe as we doe, or else I will make him prate fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of the next year mighty preparation was made both here and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the re-inforcing of Navall strength. Nor was the <hi>Land-Militia</hi> left unregarded, but because the Country <hi>Captains</hi> of the Train-bands were (for the generality) very unskilfull and rude in the use of their Armes, an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95383:15"/>
hundred and fifty <hi>Veteran</hi> Souldiers were sent for out of the Low-countries to drill and discipline them.</p>
            <p>The malignancy of the air, having lain under the correction of a ripping and frosty winter, began to contract a more salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious temper, whereby the plague decreasing, the King secure of safety, began to meditate magnificence, and matters of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick concernment. And the first thing resolved upon was, his solemn initiation into Regality, and setting the Crown upon his head: a thing practised by the wisest Monarchs, as wherein they cannot be idle to better purpose. For though it conferreth no one dram of solid and reall grandure to the throne; yet ceremoniated, as it is, with such formalities, it representeth it self a serious vanity. For as the King enters recognizance and stipulateth with the people to govern according to Law, so they unanimously acclaim him their King, all sutable to the ancient mode of conveying Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</p>
            <p>The day appointed for this ceremony was <hi>Feb.</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> The King, whether more provident for his person (which so great a <note place="margin">The King Crowned.</note> concourse might endanger) or purse, uncertain, rode not to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> through the City after the ancient fashion, but went private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by water: this design was a frugall one, and saved him sixty thousand pound which should otherwise have been disbursed in Scarlet for his train; and little was the day lesse glorious for the <hi>No-rubrique</hi> of solemnity, considering it wanted it not in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar.</hi> Two things were of singular remarque in the order of this celebrity. First, that whereas it did peculiarly belong, <hi>ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> to the Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> to powre the sacred oyle upon the Kings head, Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> that Dean, and Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> was put by, and Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> ordered to officiate in his stead. Secondly, That some words in a Prayer, which had been omitted ever since <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. his time, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed and used to this effect; <hi>Let him obtain favour for this people like</hi> Aaron <hi>in the Tabernacle,</hi> Elisha <hi>in the waters,</hi> Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias <note place="margin">Obtineat grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am huic Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo sicut Aaron in Tabernaculo, Elizeus in flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio, Zacharias in Templo. Sit Petrus in clave, Paulus in dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</note> 
               <hi>in the Temple, give him</hi> Peters <hi>key of Discipline,</hi> Pauls <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> Other variation then this, there was none; nor was this variation the solitary act of <hi>Laud</hi> alone, but of a Committee: this I positively assert, as minding the reformation of a vulgar error thrown abroad in loose pamphlets, that Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> altered the Coronation Oath; whereas the Oath itself was precisely the same with former precedents.</p>
            <p>The Coronation being past, the <hi>King</hi> prepareth for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now approaching. The last was somewhat (he thought) <note place="margin">A Parliament called.</note> uncivil towards the Duke, and the (so thought) Delinquents must be made examples; upon this account the Lord Keeper <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Williams</hi> L. Keeper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed.</note> fell, and his place was disposed of to Sir <hi>Thomas Coventry:</hi> his mischief was not great, his cancellier, his fall being only from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95383:15"/>
The first lost; for though he parted from the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> he kept the Lawn Sleeves; and though he left the <hi>Purse</hi> behinde him, he went away with the <hi>Money:</hi> having feathered his nest pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well, and apprehending his condition to be some what tottering, he made all the means he could to re-ingratiate himself with the Duke, but nothing could prevail, nor would the Duke be exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, no not by the intercession of the <hi>Countesse</hi> his Mother, who loved the Bishop (if same belies her not) better then was fit; but it was not enough to pluck his feathers, unlesse his nailes were pared also. For being a Bishop, and consequently a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the House of Peers, he was still able to appear an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent opposer of the Dukes, and to do him some considerable mischief, therefore the best expedient for the Dukes security, was to interdict him with the <hi>Earls of Somerset, Middlesex, Bristow,</hi> (all of an inclination, though not all of a plume) the Parliament House.</p>
            <p>On the 6 of this <hi>February</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> met, the <hi>Commons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meet.</note> their work where they last broke off at <hi>Oxford,</hi> making Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion their first, which was their superlative care, and recollecting what a full and satisfactory answer the <hi>King</hi> gave to their <hi>Petition</hi> against <hi>Recusants,</hi> and his Commission issued out in pursuance of that answer, appointed a Committee for Religion, impow'ring them strictly to examine what abuses of his Majesties Grace had occurr'd since that time, who were the authors and abetters of those abuses.</p>
            <p>Mean while the Lords had formed an addresse to the King concerning a grievance to their own Order, represented <note place="margin">A Petition from the Lords.</note> thus:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.</head>
                  <opener>In all humility,</opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SHeweth unto your most</hi> Excellent Majesty <hi>your ever loyall subjects the</hi> Lords Spiritual <hi>and</hi> Temporal <hi>now in Parliament assembled;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That, whereas the</hi> Peers <hi>and</hi> Nobility <hi>of this your Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>have heretofore in civility yeelded, as to strangers, precedency according to their several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees unto such Nobles of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>as being in titles above them, have resorted hither.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now divers of the naturall-born subjects of this Kingdome, resident here with their Families, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95383:16"/>
their chief Estates among us; do by reason of some late created dignities, in those Kingdomes of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>claim precedency of the Peers of this Realm, which tends both to the dis-service of your</hi> Majesty <hi>and these Realms, and to the great dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the</hi> English Nobility, <hi>as by these reasons may appear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a novelty without precedent, that men should inherit honours where they possesse nothing else.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is injurious to those Countries from whence their Titles are derived, that any should have Vote in</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>where they have not a foot of land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a grievance to the Country where they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, that men possessing very large fortunes and Estates, should by reason of forain titles, be exempted from those services of trust and charge, which through their default, become greater pressures upon others who bear the burthen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>It is a shame to</hi> Nobility, <hi>that persons dignified with the Titles of</hi> Barons, Vicounts, &amp;c. <hi>should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious and exposed to arrest, they being in the view of the Law no more then meer</hi> Plebeians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We therefore humbly beseech your Majesty, that you will be pleased, according to the example of the best Princes, and Times, upon consideration of these inconveniences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to your</hi> Majesty <hi>by the nearest body of Honour to your</hi> Majesty, <hi>that some course may be taken, and an Order timely setled therein by your Princely wisdome, so as the inconvenience to your</hi> Majesty <hi>may be prevented, and the prejudice and disparagement of the</hi> Peers <hi>and</hi> Nobility <hi>of this Kingdome may be redressed.</hi>
                  </p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Soon after the presenting of this Petition (to which the King reply'd, <hi>He would take order therein)</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> to the Tower. The cause was a marriage consummate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his son the Lord <hi>Maltravers,</hi> and the eldest daughter of the late Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> whom the King (being Guardian to them both) had so far designed to, as he had concluded the match
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95383:16"/>
with the Earl of <hi>Argiles</hi> Heir, the Lord of <hi>Lorn,</hi> (who was brought up in <hi>England</hi> in the Protestant Religion) meditating thereby a reconciliation of those two families, who had for many years been at deadly feud. The Earl asked his <hi>Majesties</hi> pardon, protesting himself no way privie to the plot, and that it was acted between the Dutchesse of <hi>Lenox</hi> and his own <hi>Countesse</hi> in a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine way.</p>
            <p>But this commitment of the Earl presently moved the house of Peers to exhibit another Petition, representing therein to the King that it is their undoubted right [That no Peer, sitting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to be imprisoned without order from the House of Peers, unlesse it be for <hi>Treason, Felony,</hi> or <hi>refusing</hi> to give security for the Peace.] They had the more reason to urge their priviledge at this time, because the Earl had deputed to him six Proxies, which would be of no validity during his restraint. Upon this Petition a great debate arose between the King and Lords about the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their House, which lasted from <hi>March</hi> 14. untill <hi>Iune</hi> the 8.</p>
            <p>During these things the House of <hi>Commons</hi> acted little, being in expectation of some discovery from their <hi>Committee,</hi> from whom Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> at length made a report of a letter written to the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> for reprieving some <hi>Iesuites, Priests,</hi> and other <hi>Recusants.</hi> This Letter being under the <hi>Signet,</hi> a Sub-Committee was ordered to search the <hi>Signet Office,</hi> and compare it with the Originall.</p>
            <p>These proceedings inwardly much displeased the <hi>King,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands supply.</note> yet he smothered the indignity for a time, though he after inventory'd it to them amongst his other regrets. And plying his more important affairs with a most stedy temper, he sent a message to them by Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That his Fleet is returned, and their victuals spent, the men must of necessity be discharged and their wages paid them, or else mutiny will follow, which may be of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous consequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he hath in readinesse about forty ships to be set forth upon a second service, which want a present supply of moneys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Armies quartered on the coasts, want victuals and cloathes, and they will disband if not furnished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Companies of</hi> Ireland <hi>lately sent, must spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95383:17"/>
be provided for, else they may be subject to rebell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, the season for providing healthfull victuall will be past, if this moneth of</hi> March <hi>be suffered negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to elapse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore he desired to know, without more adoe, what present supply he must depend upon from them, that accordingly he might shape his course.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In stead of a supply to his message Mr. <hi>Clement Coke</hi> (son to <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> and Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> their bold Speech.</note> Sir <hi>Edward Coke)</hi> a Member of the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> let fly this reply. <hi>It is better to dye by a forein enemie, then to be destroyed at home.</hi> And as if the Prerogative had not been sufficiently alarum'd by that expression, one <hi>Turner</hi> a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> reassaults it in these six Queries.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Whether the King hath not lost the Regality of the narrow Seas, since the Duke became Admiral?</item>
               <item>2. Whether his not going as Admiral in this last Fleet, was not the cause of the ill successe?</item>
               <item>3. Whether the Kings revenue hath not been impaired through his immense liberality?</item>
               <item>4. Whether he hath not ingrossed all Offices, and preferred his kindred to unfit places?</item>
               <item>5. Whether he hath not made sale of places of Iudicature?</item>
               <item>6. Whether Recusants have not dependence upon his Mother and Father-in-law?</item>
            </list>
            <p>This was uncouth language to a Princes ears, but who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that in so vast a body, and masse of men, all parcels should <note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</note> take salt alike, and that no part should have rancidity in it? And perhaps this clamor and noise might be the rudenesse of some few new admitted into that great School of wisdome, the greater part continuing (it's possible) sincere, and loyal; therefore the King sends Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> to them requiring satisfaction. But the House was slower in the work, then was agreeable to his <hi>Majesties</hi> minde, so intent upon some severe proceedings against them: upon this he called the Lords and them together, and by the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> his proper Speaker, thus conveyes his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to them. <note place="margin">By the Lord Keeper.</note>

               <p>My <hi>Lords</hi> and you the <hi>Knights, Citizens</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> His <hi>Majesties</hi>

signifying his will to you. His will was that both <note place="margin">Ann. Christi 1626.</note> Houses should be called together; you, my <hi>Lords,</hi> as witnesses of the justice of his resolutions, and of this addresse to the House of <hi>Commons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Majesty</hi> would have you know, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was <hi>King</hi> who better loved his people, or was more sincerely affected towards the right use of Parliaments, or more ready to redresse what shall be represented unto him in the quality of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, provided it be in a regular and decent way, then Himself: but he would also have you know, that, as he loves his <hi>People,</hi> so he regards his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> and if he be sensible of his Subjects grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of his own he is much more, especially when they flow from offences of such a nature, as not only blast his reputation, but impede the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of his weighty affairs. To come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Majesty</hi> saith, that, whereas Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> spake very seditious words in your house, he was so far from being questioned or censured for them by you, as Doctor <hi>Turner</hi> (animated with the same spirit) made them his introduction to certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of inquiry of as unsavoury a condition, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against the <hi>Duke,</hi> but in truth libelling his <hi>Majesties</hi> Government. And though his <hi>Majesty</hi> did not only by Sir <hi>Richard Weston,</hi> but in his own person declare his just displeasure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded justice against those exorbitants, yet have you not only halted in your obedience to him, but have followed the very steps of Doctor <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and upon false-bottom'd suggestions ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to distain his Own and Fathers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>He also complaineth that you have taken upon you to search his Signet Office, and to examine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95383:18"/>
the Letters of his Secretary of State, leaving him nothing free from their discovery: a thing not formerly practised.</p>
               <p>As concerning the <hi>Duke,</hi> whom you seem to persecute with such asperity of disgust, I am also commanded to tell you, that his Majesty knowes (none better) he acted nothing of publique im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, without his speciall Warrant; that he hath discharged his trust with abundant both care and fidelity; that he merited that trust both from his now Majesty and his late Father, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal hazard both at home and abroad; And that since his return from <hi>Spain,</hi> he hath been sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in promoving the service and contentment of your <hi>House.</hi> It is therefore his expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that you absolutely desist from such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary disquisitions, and resign the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what is amisse to his <hi>Majesties</hi> care, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and justice.</p>
               <p>I am also to speak about the businesse of <hi>supply;</hi> you have been made acquainted with the posture of his <hi>Majesties</hi> affairs both forain and domestique, and with his necessitous condition; the charge of all martial preparations, both by sea and land, hath been calculated to you, and you promised a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply both speedy and sutable to his occasions; but his <hi>Majesty</hi> complaineth, that as yet, you have performed neither, failing both in the measure and in the manner. In the measure, by granting only three subsidies, and three fifteens, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion vastly short of what is requisite. In the manner, being both dilatory and dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the King, as arguing a distrust of him; for you have ordered the Bill not to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the House untill your grievances be both heard and answered: which is such a tacite
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95383:18"/>
condition, as his <hi>Majesty</hi> will not admit of.</p>
               <p>Therefore his <hi>Majesty</hi> commands you to take it into your speedy consideration, and to return your final answer by <hi>Saturday</hi> next, what further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you will make; and if your supplies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate and equal the demands of the cause, he promiseth to continue this <hi>Session</hi> to your just content, else he must and will entertain thoughts of your dismission.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I am commanded to tell you, that his <hi>Majesty</hi> doth not charge these distempers upon the hole body, and assembly of the <hi>House;</hi> but as he is confident the greater number are persons of a more quiet dispose, so he hopeth their influence, and this his <hi>Majesties</hi> admonition will prevent the like for the time to come.</p>

            <p>The Lord Keeper having ended, the King said,</p>

               <hi>times past; you may remember my Father mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by your counsel, and won by your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions brake the Treaties; in these perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I was your instrument towards him, and I was glad to be instrumental in any thing which might please the whole body of the Realm: nor was there any then in greater favour with you then this man, whom you now so traduce.

               <hi>That concerning Mr.</hi> Coke, <hi>true it is, he let fall some few words which might admit an ill constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the</hi> House <hi>was displeased therewith, as they declared by a general check; and though Mr.</hi> Coke'<hi>s explanation of his minde more clearly, did somewhat abate the offence of the House, yet were they resolved to take it into further consideration, and so have done, the effect whereof had appeared ere this, had they not been interrupted by this his</hi> Majesties: <hi>message and the like interruption befel them also in the businesse of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> Turner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As concerning the examination of the Letters of his Secretary of State, as also of his</hi> Majesty'<hi>s own, and searching the Signet Office and other Records; they had done nothing therein, not warranted by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of former Parliaments upon the like occasions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That concerning the</hi> Duke, <hi>they did humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech his</hi> Majesty <hi>to be informed, that it hath been the constant and undoubted usage of</hi> Parliaments, <hi>to question and complain of any person of what degree soever; and what they should do in relation to him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95383:19"/>
they little doubted but it should redound to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the</hi> Crown, <hi>and safety of the</hi> Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, As to the matter of</hi> supply; <hi>That if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may be made of other things importing his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then in consultation amongst them, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved so to supply him, as might evidence the truth of their intentions, might make him safe at home, and formidable abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Remonstrance the King answered briefly, <hi>That he would have them in the first place consult about matters of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test importance, and that they should have time enough for other things afterwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Parliament accounted nothing of so great importance as a legall proceeding against the <hi>Duke:</hi> in order to which all incouragement is given by both <hi>Houses,</hi> to any who would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form against him. Upon this the Earl of <hi>Bristow,</hi> being seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Kings command from the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> petitioned that <hi>House,</hi> that he might be admitted to prefer an accusation against the Duke. This request, as most equitable, the Lords readily granted, and <hi>Bristowes</hi> design coming to the Dukes ear, he plots amain (and high time) to encounter him. Many good men were passing jocund at the contest; between men at odds there never seemed an evener match; <hi>Bristow</hi> had, it's true, the better head, (yet some thought it was ill set on) but the <hi>Duke</hi> the better back; nor seemed the question in the sense of many, which was the Traitor, but which the most. And first the <hi>Duke</hi> (with a boldnesse becoming the clearest innocence) begins the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, by whose perswasion the King commands the <hi>Atturny</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to summon the <hi>Earl</hi> to the Lords Bar as a Delinquent, <hi>May</hi> the 1. <hi>Bristow</hi> appearing, the Atturney told the Peers, that he came thither to accuse the <hi>Earl</hi> of High Treason: with that the Earl, <hi>My Lords I am a Freeman and a Peer of the Realm unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, I have somewhat to say of high consequence for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties service, I beseech your Lordships give me leave to speak.</hi> The Lords bidding him go on, then said he, <hi>I accuse that man, the Duke of Buckingham, of High Treason,</hi> and will prove it. The <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Bristow</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the D.</note> Articles of his charge were as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Duke</hi> did secretly conspire with the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Gondamar</hi> Ambassador of <hi>Spain</hi> before the said Ambassadors last return into <hi>Spain,</hi> 1622. to carry his <hi>Majesty</hi> then <hi>Prince</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95383:20"/>
end he might be enforced, and instanced in the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> and thereby have perverted the <hi>Prince,</hi> and subverted the true <hi>Religion</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was made acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> and such message fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at his return as might serve for a ground to set on foot the conspiracy: which was donw ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and thereby both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> highly abused.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Duke</hi> at his arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers not only in the belief of his own being Popishly given, by absenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from all exercises of our <hi>Religion</hi> (then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly used in the Earl of <hi>Bristow</hi>'s house) and conforming himself to please the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by kneeling to, and adoring their Sacraments, but gave them hope also of the <hi>Princes</hi> conversion; which caused them to propound worse conditions for Religion, then had been formerly setled and signed by the Earl of <hi>Bristow</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Aston.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Duke</hi> did many times in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Earl of <hi>Bristow,</hi> move his <hi>Majesty</hi> at the instance of the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Gondamar,</hi> to write a Letter to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which the <hi>Earl</hi> utterly disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that although during the <hi>Earls</hi> abode in <hi>England</hi> he hindred the writing any such letter, yet the <hi>Duke</hi> after the <hi>Earls</hi> return procured it wrot.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Pope</hi> being informed of the <hi>Dukes</hi> inclination in point of Religion, sent him a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Bull</hi> in Parchment, therein perswading him to pervert his <hi>Majesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Duke</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> did abuse the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Ministers so, as they would not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95383:20"/>
admit of a Reconciliation with him; whereupon seeing the match would be to his disadvantage, he endevoured to break it, not for any service to this Kingdome, nor dislike of it in it self, nor for that he found, (as since he hath pretended) that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did not really intend it, but out of his particular end and indignation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That he intending to crosse the match, made use of Letters of his <hi>Majesty</hi> then private to his own ends, and not to what they were intended, as also concealed many things of great importance from his late <hi>Majesty,</hi> thereby overthrowing his <hi>Majesties</hi> purposes, and advancing his own ends.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That, for the foresaid ends, he hath abused both Houses of Parliament by a sinister relation of the carriage of affairs, as shall be made appear in every particular of that <hi>relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. That he imployed his power with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> for the procurement of favours and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he bestowed upon unworthy persons, for the recompence and hire of his lust: which is a great infamy and dishonour to our Nation; that a <hi>Duke,</hi> a privie Counsellor and Ambassador, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in his <hi>Majesties</hi> favour, and solely intrusted with the person of the Prince, should leave behind him in a forein Court, so much scandall by his ill behaviour.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That he hath been a great part the cause of the ruin of the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> and his estate; in so much as those affairs concern this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That he hath in his relation to both <hi>Houses</hi> of Parliament, wronged the Earl of <hi>Bristow</hi> in his honour, by many sinister aspersions.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Lastly, that the Earl of <hi>Bristow</hi> did reveal to his late <hi>Majesty,</hi> both by word and letter, in what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95383:21"/>
sort the Duke had mis-demeaned himself, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his trust: and the King by severall waies sent him word he should rest assured <hi>that he would hear the said Earl in due time;</hi> and that four daies before his sicknesse, he signified to the Earl, that <hi>he would hear him against the Duke as well as he had heard the Duke against him.</hi> And not long after the King died, having been much vexed and pressed with the said <hi>Duke.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>When the Earl had ended his Charge, up starts no upstart <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Spencer.</hi>
               </note> Lord, (the more the pity) and unbeseeming his noble extraction, and ancient fame, <hi>Is this all</hi> (said he) <hi>you have to say against the Duke?</hi> The Earl replyed, <hi>Yes my Lord, and I am sorry it is so much. Then,</hi> quoth the Lord <hi>Spencer, if this be all, Ridiculus Mus!</hi> and so sate down again. Upon this a crotchet took the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> in the crown, and out he goes to Mr. <hi>Richard Spencer</hi> a younger son of the Lord, and a great zelot in the lower House against the Duke: <hi>Dick,</hi> said he, <hi>what is done in your House to day against the Duke? My Lord</hi> (said he) <hi>he is charged with no lesse then High Treason. Tush Dick,</hi> quoth the Lord, <hi>High Treason! if this be all, Ridiculus Mus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after, the <hi>Commons</hi> having digested their Impeachment <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment against the Duke.</note> against this great man into thirteen heads, on the eighth of the same moneth presented it to the Lords.

            <p>Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs</hi> his Prologue, for the extraordinary elegancy of the frame, and concinnesse of his metaphors, I shall crave leave to insert, as it was delivered to the Lords, before the Gentlemen of the house of Commons did present the thirteen grievances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly this.</p>

                        <p>There are so many things of great importance to be said in very little time this day, that I conceive it will not be unacceptable to your <hi>Lordships,</hi> if (setting by all Rhetoricall affectations) I only in plain countrey language, humbly pray your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> favour to include many excuses, necessary to

my manifold infirmities, in this one word, I am <hi>COMMANDED</hi> by the <hi>Knights, Citizens</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> House, to present unto your <hi>Lordships</hi> their most affectionate thanks for your ready condescending to this <hi>conference,</hi> which out of confidence in your great wisdomes, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Justice for the service of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the welfare of this Realm they desired upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                        <p>The House of <hi>Commons,</hi> by a fatall and universal concurrence of complaints from all the sea-borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts of this Kingdome, did finde a great and grievous interruption and stop of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.</hi> The base Pirats of <hi>Sally</hi> ignominiously infesting our coasts, taking our ships and goods, and leading away the subjects of this Kingdome into barbarous captivity; while, to our shame, and hinderance of commerce, our enemies did (as it were) besiege our Ports, and block up our best Rivers mouthes; our <hi>Friends</hi> on slight pretences made embargoes of our Merchants goods, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nation upon the least occasion was ready to contemn and slight us: So great was the apparent diminution of the ancient honour of this Crown, and once strong reputation of our Nation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Commons</hi> were more troubled, calling to remembrance how, formerly in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and every where by sea and land, the valours of this Kingdome had been better valued, and even in later times within remembrance, when we had no alliance with <hi>France,</hi> none in <hi>Denmark,</hi> none in <hi>Germany:</hi> no Friend in <hi>Italy; Scotland,</hi> to say no more, ununited; <hi>Ireland</hi> not setled in peace, and much lesse security at home; when <hi>Spain</hi> as was ambitious at it is now, under a King <hi>(Philip</hi> the second) they call'd their wisest, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95383:22"/>
house of <hi>Austria</hi> as great and potent, and both strengthened with a malicious league in <hi>France,</hi> of persons ill-affected, when the Low-countreys had no being; yet by constant counsels and old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> waies, even then that <hi>Spanish</hi> pride was cool'd, that greatnesse of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> so formidable to us now, was well resisted, and to the united <hi>Provinces</hi> of the Low-countreys, such a beginning, growth, and strength was given, as gave us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour over all the Christian world. The Commons therefore wondring at the evils which they suffered, debating of the causes of them, found they were many, drawn like one Line to one Circumference of decay of <hi>Trade,</hi> and strength of Honour, and of Reputation in this Kingdome; which, as in one centre, met in one great man, the cause of all, whom I am here to name, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>

All which encompasse round with cherishing comfort this Body of the Commons, who truly labour for them all, and though they be the footstool and the lowest, yet may well be said to be the setled centre of the State.</p>
                              <p>Now (my good <hi>Lords)</hi> if that glorious <hi>Sun</hi> by his powerfull beams of grace and favour shall draw from the bowels of this Earth, an <hi>Exhalation</hi> that shall take fire, and burn and shine out like a <hi>Star,</hi> it needs not be marvelled at, if the poor <hi>Commons</hi> gaze and wonder at the <hi>Comet,</hi> and when they feel the effects, impute all to the corruptible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it. But if such an imperfect mixture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, like that in the last age, in the Chair of <hi>Cassiopea</hi> among the fixed Starres themselves, where <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the old Philosophers conceived there was no place for such corruption; then, as the learned <hi>Mathematicians</hi> were troubled to observe the irregular motions, the prodigious <hi>magnitude,</hi> and the ominous Prognosticks of that Meteor: so the Commons when they see such a <hi>Blazing-star</hi> in course so exorbitant, in the affairs of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, cannot but look up upon it, and for want of Perspectives commend the nearer exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to your <hi>Lordships,</hi> who may behold it at a better distance. Such a prodigious <hi>Comet</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> take this <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to be, against whom and his irregular waies there are by learned Gentlemen; legall <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Charge</hi> to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to your <hi>Lordships,</hi> which I am generally first commanded to lay open.</p>
                              <p>

First, the <hi>Offices</hi> of this Kingdome, that are the eyes, the eares, and the hands of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, these have been engrossed, bought and sold, and <hi>many</hi> of the greatest of them, holden even in this <hi>Dukes</hi> own hands, which <hi>severally</hi> gave in former ages sufficient content to greatest <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> and were work enough for the wisest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors: by means whereof, what strange abuses, what infinite neglects have followed? The <hi>Seas</hi> have been <hi>unguarded, Trade</hi> disturbed, <hi>Merchants</hi> oppressed, their Ships, and even one of the Royal-Navie, by cunning practise delivered over into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain hands, and contrary to our good <hi>Kings</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imployed to the prejudice (almost to the ruine) of friends of our own <hi>Religion.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Next, <hi>Honors</hi> (those most precious jewels of the <hi>Crown)</hi> a treasure inestimable, wherewith your noble Ancestors (my <hi>Lords)</hi> were well rewarded for eminent and publique service in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth at home, for brave exploits abroad; when covered all with dust and bloud, they sweat in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the honour of this Crown. What Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, what By-waies have been by this <hi>Duke</hi> found out, is too well known to your <hi>Lordships;</hi> whereas anciently it was the honour of <hi>England,</hi> (as among the <hi>Romans)</hi> the way to the Temple of <hi>Honor</hi> was through the Temple of <hi>Virtue.</hi> But I am comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to presse this no further then to let your <hi>Lordships</hi> know, one instance may perhaps be given of some one <hi>Lord</hi> compelled to purchase Honor.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, as divers of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s poor kindred have been raised to great <hi>Honors,</hi> which have been and are likely to be more chargeable and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the <hi>Crown;</hi> so the Lands and Revenues, and the Treasuries of his <hi>Majesty</hi> have been intercepted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95383:23"/>
and exhausted by this <hi>Duke</hi> and his friends, and strangely mis-imployed with strange confusion of the Accompts, and overthrow of the well esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished ancient orders of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
                              <p>The last of the <hi>Charges</hi> which are prepared, will be an injury offered to the person of the late <hi>King</hi> of blessed memory, who is with God; of which (as your <hi>Lordships</hi> may have heard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) you shal anon have farther information. Now upon this occasion, I am commanded by the <hi>Commons</hi> to take care of the <hi>Honor</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> our Soveraign that lives, (long may he live to our comfort, and the good of the Christian world) and also of his blessed Father, who is dead; on whom to the grief of the <hi>Commons,</hi> and their great distast, the Lord <hi>Duke</hi> did, they conceive, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily cast some ill ordure of his own foul waies. Whereas <hi>servants</hi> vvere anciently wont to bear (as in truth they ought) their <hi>Masters</hi> faults, and not cast their own on <hi>them</hi> undeservedly. It is well known the <hi>King,</hi> who is with God, had the same power, and the same wisdome before he knew this <hi>Duke,</hi> yea and the same affections too, through which (as a good and gracious <hi>Master)</hi> he advanced and raised some stars of your <hi>Lordships Firmament,</hi> in whose hands this exorbitancy of will, this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendency of power, such placing and displacing of Officers, such irregular running into all by-courses of the Planets, such sole and single managing of the great affairs of State, was never heard of. And therefore only to the Lord <hi>Duke</hi> and his procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by mis-informations these faults complained of by the <hi>Commons</hi> are to be imputed. And for our most gracious <hi>Soveraign</hi> that lives, whose name hath been used, and may perhaps now be, for the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95383:24"/>
                                 <hi>Dukes</hi> justification. The <hi>Commons</hi> know well, that among his <hi>Majesties</hi> most royall vertues, his piety unto his <hi>Father</hi> hath made him a pious nourisher of his affections ever to this Lord <hi>Duke,</hi> on whom, out of that consideration, his <hi>Majesty</hi> hath wrought a kinde of wonder, making <hi>Favour</hi> hereditary. But the abuse thereof must be the Lord <hi>Dukes</hi> own. And if there have been any Commands, such as were or may be pretended, his mis-informations have procured them; vvhereas the Lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> teach us, that <hi>Kings</hi> cannot command ill or unlawful things when ever they speak, though by their <hi>Letters Patents</hi> or their <hi>Seals;</hi> if the thing be evill, these <hi>Letters Patents</hi> are void, and whatsoever ill event succeeds, the executioners of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands must ever answer for them.</p>
                              <p>Thus my <hi>Lords,</hi> in performance of my duty, my weaknesse hath been troublesome unto your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</hi> It is novv high time humbly to intreat your pardon, and give vvay to a learned <hi>Gentleman</hi> to begin a more particular Charge.</p>

                        <p>First, That he the said <hi>Duke,</hi> being young and <note place="margin">
                              <hi>The Articles.</hi> 1. His engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing great Offices.</note> unexperienced, hath of late years with exorbitant ambition, and for his own advantage procured and engrossed into his own hands, several great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both to the danger of the State, and prejudice of that service which would have been performed in them, and to the discouragement of others, who are thereby precluded from such hopes as their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95383:25"/>
virtues, abilities, and publique imployments might otherwise have obtained.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That in the sixteenth year of the reign of the late <hi>King,</hi> he did give and pay to the then <note place="margin">By buying the place of Admiralty.</note> 
                           <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> for the Office of Great Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Wales,</hi> and General Governor of the Seas, and Ships of the said Kingdomes, and for the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendor of the said Offices, to the intent the said <hi>Duke</hi> might obtain them to his own use, the sum of three thousand pounds, and did also procure for the said surrendor from the late <hi>King,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of One thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> payable to the said Earl, for which considerations the said <hi>Earl</hi> surrendred the said Office with his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, unto the late <hi>King,</hi> who granted them to the said <hi>Duke</hi> for his life: which is an Offence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lawes and statutes of this Realm, those Offices so highly concerning the administration and execution of Justice.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That he the said <hi>Duke,</hi> in the 22. year of the <note place="margin">And Lord Warden of the <hi>Cinque Ports:</hi>
                           </note> late <hi>King,</hi> did give and pay unto <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> for the Offices of Lord Warden of the <hi>Cinque Ports</hi> and of Constable of <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, the sum of One thousand pounds, and granted also an annuity of five hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> during his life, and that for the consideration aforesaid, the said Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> did surrender his Offices and Letters Patents, to the late <hi>King,</hi> who granted them to the said <hi>Duke</hi> for his life: which Offices (so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the administration of Justice) the <hi>Duke</hi> hath ever since held against the Lawes of the land.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That he hath neglected the just execution of <note place="margin">Not guarding the Seas.</note> those his Offices, and violated the trust reposed in, and committed to him by them; in so much, as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95383:25"/>
through his neglect the trade of this Kingdome hath been of late much decayed, and the seas ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiously infested with Pirats and enemies, to the great losse of both Ships and goods, and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger of this Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>That, whereas about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last, a Ship called <note place="margin">Stay of the S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>New-Haven.</hi>
                           </note> the St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>New Haven,</hi> laden with divers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, Jewels, and commodities to the value of Forty thousand pounds, or thereabout, for the properaccount of <hi>Monsieur de Villowes</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>New-haven,</hi> was taken by the Ships of his <hi>Majesties</hi> late Fleet, and brought into the Port of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> as a prize, upon probability that the said Ship or Goods belonged to the subjects of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> whereupon there was an arrest of two <hi>English</hi> Ships at <hi>New-haven</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>France:</hi> after which, intimation was given to the Advocate in the chief Court of Admiralty from his <hi>Majesty</hi> by secretary <hi>Coke,</hi> for the freeing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the said ship, and goods, and thereupon by Commission under seal the said ship and goods were released. The said <hi>Duke</hi> notwithstanding any such Order, and Decree, detained still to his own use, the Gold, Silver, Pearl, Jewels, and other commodities so taken out of the said ship, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly caused the said ship to be arrested again, in contempt of the lawes of this land, and to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Trade.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That the <hi>East-India</hi> Merchants in the 21 of <note place="margin">And of the <hi>East-India</hi> Fleet.</note> the late <hi>Kings</hi> reign, preparing to set forth Four great ships richly laden in their usuall course of Trade, the <hi>Duke</hi> moved the <hi>Lords</hi> then assembled in Parliament to know whether he should make stay of those ships for the service of the State: which motion being approved by the <hi>Lords,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> accordingly did stay those ships; and after
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95383:26"/>
procured a joynt Action to be entred in the Court of Admiralty in the name of the late <hi>King,</hi> and himself, as Lord Admirall, against Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds pretended to be Piratically taken by some Captains of the said Merchants ships, and in the hands of the said Captains: and accordingly, an Attachment was served upon the said Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Whereupon the said Merchants being urged to bring in the Fifteen thousand pounds, or to go to prison, made now suit to the <hi>Duke</hi> for the release of their ships; who pretending that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be moved therein, the Merchants much perplexed, and considering that they should lose much by unlading their ships, and the losse of their voyage; resolved to tender to the <hi>Duke</hi> Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds for his unjust demand, who by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his office extorted and exacted from them the said Ten thousand pounds; and upon receipt thereof, and not before, released the said ships.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That the <hi>Duke,</hi> being Great Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lending of the <hi>Vant-guard</hi> to the <hi>French:</hi>
                           </note> did by colour of the said Office procure one of the principal ships of the Navie-Royal, called the <hi>Vant-guard,</hi> and six other Merchants ships of great burthen, to be conveyed over with all their Ordnance, Ammunition, and Apparel, into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France;</hi> and did compell the said Masters and Owners of the said ships, to deliver the said ships into the possession and command of the <hi>French King,</hi> and his Ministers, without either sufficient security for their re-delivery, or necessary caution in that behalf, contrary to the duty of his Office, and to the apparent weakning of the Naval strength of this Kingdome.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That the <hi>Duke,</hi> knowing the said ships were intended to be imployed against the <hi>Rochellers</hi> and <note place="margin">To be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</hi>
                           </note> the <hi>Protestants</hi> elsewhere, did compel them as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95383:26"/>
to be delivered unto the said <hi>French King</hi> and his Ministers, to the end that they might be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against those of the reformed Religion, as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they were; to the prejudice of the said Religion, contrary to the intention of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord the <hi>King,</hi> and to his former promise at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and to the great scandal of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. That he hath enforced some who were rich <note place="margin">Selling of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours:</note> (though unwilling) to purchase honours: as the Lord <hi>Roberts, Baron</hi> of <hi>Truro,</hi> who was by menaces wrought to pay the sum of Ten thousand pounds to the said <hi>Duke,</hi> and to his use for his said <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. That in the 18 year of the late <hi>King,</hi> he <note place="margin">And Offices.</note> did procure of the late <hi>King</hi> the Office of High Treasurer of <hi>England</hi> to the Vicount <hi>Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> now <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Manchester,</hi> for which Office he received of the said Vicount, to his own use, the sum of Twenty thousand pounds of money, and also did procure in the 20 year of the late <hi>King,</hi> the Office of Master of the Wards and Liveries for Sir <hi>Lionel Cranfeild,</hi> afterward <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and as a reward for the said procurement, he had to his own use, of the said Sir <hi>Lionel Cranfeild,</hi> the sum of Six thousand pounds, contrary to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his late Majesty.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. That he hath procured divers honors for <note place="margin">Procuring Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours for his Kindred.</note> his Kindred and allies, to the prejudice of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nobility, and disabling the Crown from rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding extraordinary virtues in future times.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. That he procured and obtained of the late <note place="margin">Diminishing the Revenues of the Crown.</note> 
                           <hi>King</hi> divers Manors, parcels of the Revenues of the Crown, to an exceeding great value, and hath received, and to his own use disbursed great sums of money, that did properly belong unto the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95383:27"/>
late <hi>King:</hi> and the better to colour his doings, hath obtained severall privie Seals from his late <hi>Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Majesty</hi> that now is, warranting the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great sums of money by him, as if such sums were directed for secret service of the State, when as they were disposed of to his own use; and hath gotten into his hands, great sums which were intended by the late <hi>King</hi> for the furnishing and victualling of the Navie-Royall, to the exceeding diminution of the Revenues of the Crown, to the deceiving and abusing of his late and now <hi>Majesty,</hi> and detriment of the hole Kingdome.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Lastly, that he being a sworn servant of the <note place="margin">His applying Physick to King <hi>Iames.</hi>
                           </note> late <hi>King,</hi> did cause and provide certain plaisters and potions for his late <hi>Majesty</hi> in his last sicknesse, without the privity of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Physicians; and that although those plaisters and potions former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed produced such ill effects, as many of his sworn Physitians did disallow as prejudiciall to his <hi>Majesties</hi> health, yet neverthelesse did the <hi>Duke</hi> apply them again to his <hi>Majesty;</hi> whereupon great distempers and dangerous symptomes appeared in him, which the Physitians imputed to those admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations of the <hi>Duke,</hi> whereof his late <hi>Majesty</hi> also complained: which was an offence and misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor of so high a nature, as may be called an act of transcendent presumption. And the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by protestation, saving to themselves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of exhibiting hereafter any other accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or impeachment against the <hi>Duke,</hi> and also of replying unto what the <hi>Duke</hi> shall answer unto the said Article, Do pray that the said <hi>Duke</hi> may be put to answer all and every the premises, and that such proceedings, examinations, tryals, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be upon every of them had, as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to law and justice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95383:27"/>
The <hi>Commons</hi> having presented this Accusation, presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sent a message to the <hi>Lords,</hi> desiring that the <hi>Duke</hi> might be committed, declaring that it did mis-beseem their House to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a man so deeply impeacht to sit in Councell with them: And <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                           </note> at that very time, Sir <hi>Dudly Diggs</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot</hi> were sent for out of the <hi>House,</hi> by two messengers of the Chamber, who upon their coming forth, shew'd them warrants for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment to the <hi>Tower;</hi> but it was resolved by the Judges, that by their restraint, (no reason being given to the House for it) the hole house was arrested, and Remonstrance was made to the <hi>King</hi> of their priviledge, whereupon they were released.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Commons</hi> having sped so well, the <hi>House</hi> of Peers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of his imprisonment.</note> to claim their immunity, making an order that nothing should be transacted in their House, untill the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arundel</hi> were restored: upon which instantly ensued the Earls postlimination and readmittance.</p>
                        <p>Popular disgust began now to break in upon the <hi>Duke</hi> with such a running and sweeping tide, as drew along with it by way of concomitancy the Peerage; nor could his new dependents and Allies keep the Ballance horizontal and even, much lesse sway it; and because his fate must result from them, and not by weight, but tale, the old trick of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was thought upon, and a new summons of persons, firm confidents of the <hi>Duke</hi> (as the Lords <hi>Mandevil, Grandison,</hi> and <hi>Carlton)</hi> into the row of Nobles. But this project would not take, for the House of <hi>Lords</hi> found an ancient Order, That no Lords created <hi>sedente Parliamento,</hi> shall have voices during that Session, but only shall have priviledge of sitting among the rest: upon which their suffrage was excluded. This gave the <hi>Duke</hi> a taste (a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one) of their inclinations, so that finding small favour to trust to, he magnanimously, some thought impudently, stood upon his Justification. And as the ill opinion of his Peers deprest him, so their affection to the Earl of <hi>Bristow</hi> elevated him: who received the Atturneys charge with such an undaunted spirit, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so home an answer, as the <hi>House</hi> was amply satisfied with it. On the other side, the <hi>Duke</hi> was as intent upon his Defence, and having moulded it to his contentment, upon the 8. of <hi>Iune</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it to the Lords, who upon receit thereof, sequestred him <note place="margin">The <hi>Duke</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred from the House of Lords.</note> from sitting any more as a Peer of the <hi>House,</hi> untill his cause was determined; upon which he went away much dejected. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his answer was as followeth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To the charge concerning his plurality of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, he answereth, That his late <hi>Majesty</hi> did of his <note place="margin">The <hi>Duke</hi>'s Answer.</note> own Royal motion bestow them upon him, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95383:28"/>
he hopeth and conceiveth he may without blame receive, what his bountifull Master conferred upon him, if the Common-wealth doth not suffer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Nor is it without precedents, that men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the esteem of their Soveraign, have held as great and many offices as himself. But if it shall be proved that he falsly, or corruptly hath executed those Offices, he is, and will be ready to resign them with his life and fortunes to his <hi>Majesties</hi> dispose.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To the second, he answereth, That the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Nottingham</hi> then Lord Admiral, being grown much in years, and finding himself not so fit nor able to perform what appertained to his place, as formerly; became an earnest sutor to his late <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> to permit him to surrender up his Office, who at length being overcome by the <hi>Earls</hi> many soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations condescended thereunto; and his late <hi>Majesty</hi> at the entreaty of others, without the <hi>Dukes</hi> privity, was also perswaded to confer it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Duke,</hi> much against his will, he being no way experienced in those affairs: so that the <hi>Earl</hi> did freely surrender, and the <hi>Duke</hi> accept the grant of the said Office, without any the least contract or proviso. But true it is, that his late <hi>Majesty</hi> out of his Royal bounty did grant to the said <hi>Earl</hi> a Pension of One thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> as a recompence for his former service to the Crown; and also the <hi>Duke</hi> himself did freely and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily with his late <hi>Majesties</hi> approbation, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his honourable respects to so Noble a Predecessor, send the <hi>Earl</hi> Three thousand pounds, which he hopeth is not blame-worthy in him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To the third, he answereth, That the Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> being grown in years, and unfit to manage the Office of the Warden of the <hi>Cinque-Ports</hi> and Constable of <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, which are indeed both
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95383:28"/>
but one, discovered a willingnesse to surrender it, and made severall offers thereof to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who at last contracted with the said Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> for his surrender, for the consideration of One thousand pound in money, and Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> and the said <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> being prevented by death, his late <hi>Majesty</hi> directed the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to go through with the Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> for it, upon the same termes; which he was the willinger to do, by reason he had found by experience, that the <hi>King</hi>'s service suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much through the emulation, disaffection, and contention arising between those two Officers; and he hopeth this act of his in acquiring this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, accompanied with such circumstances, the <hi>King</hi> also being both privie and directing it, will receive a favourable construction, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he was altogether unacquainted with any law to the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. To the fourth, he answereth, That the losse happening to the <hi>Kings</hi> subjects by Pirats and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hath not proceeded through the <hi>Dukes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, as is suggested, but because those Pirats ships are built of a mould as fit for flight as fight; being far too nimble for the <hi>Kings</hi> Ships. To prevent which inconvenience, for the time to come, there is present order taken for the building of Ships of the same shape with those of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and for the Pirats of <hi>Sally;</hi> that provision is taken either to restrain by treaty, or to represse them by force, as will give good satisfaction; and this will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon proof.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. To the fifth, he answereth, That complaint being made on the behalf of some <hi>French</hi> men at the Councel Table concerning the St. <hi>Peter</hi> and some other Ships; His <hi>Majesty</hi> then present did

order that she and all other should be released as were found to belong to any Prince or State in ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with him; provided they were not fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coloured. And accordingly this Ship was by sentence in the Admiralty discharged. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few daies after new information came to the Lord Admiral, that this Ship was laden by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>Amiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesio</hi> wafted her beyond the North <hi>Cape,</hi> and that witnesses were ready to attest as much: upon which the <hi>Duke</hi> acquainted his <hi>Majesty</hi> therewith, and by his command made stay of this Ship, as he was assured (by the opinion of the <hi>King</hi> and five other advocates) he might do, and command was given to the <hi>Kings</hi> Advocate to hasten the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of witnesses, in pursuance of the new infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But the <hi>French</hi> Merchants impatient of delaies which the producing many witnesses would occasion, complained again to the Councel-board, and obtained an order from thence for the delivery of the said Ship and goods, upon security; which security was once offered, but after retracted; yet upon consideration of the testimonies produced the <hi>Kings</hi> Advocate informing the <hi>Duke</hi> that the proof came short for that Ship, the <hi>Duke</hi> did instantly give order for her finall discharge, and that all her goods should be re-imbarqued to the Owners; which was done accordingly.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. To the sixth, he answereth, That the motion in <hi>Parliament</hi> about the stay of the <hi>East-India</hi> Ships was only upon apprehension that they might be serviceable for the defence of the Realm. That the action entred in the Court of Admiralty against the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, was not after, (as is sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested) but divers moneths before that motion in <hi>Parliament,</hi> yea, before the Parliament began. That
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95383:29"/>
the composition (mentioned in this <hi>Article)</hi> was not moved by the <hi>Duke,</hi> but made by the late <hi>King,</hi> and that the Company without any menaces or compulsion agreed to the composition, as willing to give so much, rather then to abide the hazard of the suit. That of the said sum, all but Two hundred pounds, was imployed by his late <hi>Majesties</hi> officers for the benefit of the Navie; and lastly, that those Ships were not discharged upon payment of the said sum of Ten thousand pounds, but upon an accommodation allowed that they should prepare other ships for his <hi>Majesties</hi> service, whilest they went on their voyage; which accordingly they did.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. To the seventh, he answereth, That those Ships were lent to the <hi>French King</hi> without his privity; that when he knew thereof, he did what appertained to his office. That he did not by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, or any undue practise by himself, or any other, deliver those Ships into the hands of the <hi>French:</hi> that what error hath since happened, was not in the intention any way injurious to the State, nor prejudicial to the interest of any private man.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. To the eighth, he answereth, That under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a discovery that those Ships should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed against <hi>Rochel,</hi> he endevoured to divert the course of such imployment: and whereas it is alledged that he promised at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that those Ships should not be so imployed, he under favour saith, he was misunderstood, for he only said, that the event would shew it, being confident in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the <hi>French King,</hi> and that he would have really performed what was agreed upon.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. To the ninth, he answereth, denying any such compulsion of the <hi>Lord Roberts</hi> to buy his honor, and that he can prove, that as the said Lord did
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95383:30"/>
then obtain it by the solicitation of others, so was he willing formerly to have given a great sum for it.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. To the tenth, he answereth, That he had not, nor did receive any penny of the said sums to his own use, that the Lord <hi>Mandevil</hi> was made Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> by his late <hi>Majesty</hi> without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract for it, and though his <hi>Majesty</hi> did after bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the said Lord Twenty thousand pounds, yet was it upon proviso of repayment, for which the <hi>Duke</hi> at first past his word, and after entred him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity by land, which stood engaged untill his late <hi>Majesty</hi> during the <hi>Dukes</hi> being in <hi>Spain,</hi> gave the Lord satisfaction by land in Fee-farm of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable value, whereupon the <hi>Dukes</hi> security was returned back. And that the Six thousand pounds disbursed by the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> was bestowed upon Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi> by his late <hi>Majesty</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Dukes</hi> privity) who had and enjoyed it all entire.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. To the eleventh, he answereth, That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth he were rather worthily to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the opinion of all generous mindes, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such favour with his <hi>Majesty,</hi> he had minded only his own advancement, and had neglected those whom the law of nature had obliged him to hold most dear.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. To the twelfth, he answereth, That he doth humbly, and with all thankfulnesse, acknowledge his late <hi>Majesties</hi> bountiful hand to him, and shall be ready to render back into the hands of his now <hi>Majesty</hi> whatsoever he hath received, together with his life, to do him service: But for the value sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested in the charge, he saith there is a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the calculation, as he shall make evident in a Schedule annexed, to which he referreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95383:30"/>
Nor did he obtain the same by any undue soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation or practise, nor yet a release for any sums so received. But having several times, and upon several occasions disposed divers sums of his late and now <hi>Majesty,</hi> by their private directions, he hath releases thereof for his discharge, which was honorable in them to grant, and not unfit for him to desire and accept for his future indemnity.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. To the last he answereth, That his late <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> being sick of an Ague, a disease out of which the <hi>Duke</hi> recovered not long before, asked the <hi>Duke</hi> what he found most advantageous to his health; the <hi>Duke</hi> reply'd a <hi>Plaister</hi> and Posset-drink admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to him by the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Warwick'</hi>s Physician; whereupon the <hi>King</hi> much desired the Plaister and Posset-drink to be sent for. And the <hi>Duke</hi> delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he commanded a servant of the <hi>Dukes</hi> to go for it against the <hi>Dukes</hi> earnest request, he humbly craving his <hi>Majesty</hi> not to make use of it without the advice of his own Physicians, and experiment upon others; which the <hi>King</hi> said he would do, and in confidence thereof, the <hi>Duke</hi> left him, and went to <hi>London.</hi> And in the mean time, he being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the said <hi>Plaister</hi> and <hi>Posset-drink</hi> were brought, and at the <hi>Dukes</hi> return, his <hi>Majesty</hi> commanded the <hi>Duke</hi> to give him the Posset-drink; which he did, the Physicians then present not seeming to mislike it. Afterward the <hi>Kings</hi> health declining, and the <hi>Duke</hi> hearing a rumour as if his Physick had done his <hi>Majesty</hi> hurt, and that he had admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred physick without advice, the <hi>Duke</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>King</hi> therewith, who in much discontent replyed, <hi>They are worse then Devils that say so.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>This being the plain, clear, and evident truth of all those things which are contained in that Charge, He humbly referreth it to the judgements of your
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95383:31"/>
               <hi>Lordships,</hi> how full of danger and prejudice it is, to give too ready an ear, and too easie a belief unto a Report or Testimony without <hi>Oath,</hi> which are not of weight enough to condemne any.</p>
            <p>Also he humbly acknowledgeth, how easie it was for him in his young years and unexperienced, to fall into thousands of errors in those ten years, wherein he had the honour to serve so great and so open an hearted a Soveraign Master.</p>
            <p>But the fear of Almighty <hi>God,</hi> his sincerity in the true Religion established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (though accompany'd with many weaknesses and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, which he is not ashamed humbly and heartily to confesse) his awfulnesse not willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend so good and gracious a Master, and his love and duty to his Countrey, have restrained and preserved him (he hopeth) from running into any heinous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours and crimes.</p>
            <p>But whatsoever upon examination and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, they shall appear to be, least in any thing unwittingly, within the compasse of so many years, he shall have offended;</p>
            <p>He humbly prayeth your <hi>Lordships,</hi> not only in those, but to all the said misdemeanours, misprisions, offences and crimes wherewith he standeth charged before your <hi>Lordships,</hi> to allow unto him the benefit of the free and general Pardon granted by his late <hi>Majesty</hi> in Parliament in the one and twentieth year of his Reign, out of which he is not excepted. And also of the gratious Pardon of his now <hi>Majesty</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the said <hi>Duke,</hi> and vouchsafed in like manner to all his Subjects at the time of his most happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration and Coronation; which said Pardon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and granted to the said <hi>Duke,</hi> beareth date the tenth day of <hi>February</hi> now last past, and so here shewed forth unto
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95383:31"/>
your <hi>Lordships</hi> on which he doth humbly relie.</p>
            <p>And yet he hopeth, that your <hi>Lordships</hi> in your Justice and Honour (upon which confidence he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himself) will acquit him of, and from those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, offences, misprisions and crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath been charged.</p>
            <p>And he hopeth, and will daily pray that for the future, he shall by Gods grace so watch all his actions, both publick and private, that he shall not give any just offence to any.</p>
            <p>This answer of the <hi>Duke</hi> to his impeachment, was a kind of new grievance to his Adversaries; for it being contrived, and so inlay'd with modesty and humility, it was like to have a powerfull influence towards the conversion of many who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a defence of another and more disdainfull spirit. Again it seemed to state him in impunity, and the Commons having charged him, as they thought, through and through, loath they were to fall short of victory; and having pursued him with such vehemency, thought themselves worsted, should he now at last make a saving game of it, therefore resolved they were to ply him with a speedy reply: but while they were hammering of it, the <hi>King</hi> sent them a Letter, demanding without further delay the speedy producing their Bill of Subsidy to be passed; to which, to prevent their dissolution, they conformed. But first they had drawn up a <hi>Declaration,</hi> of the same make and mind with their former impeachment, of the miserable state of this Kingdome, and not without some high contest, it was allowed by the House before the Bill of Subsidy. Whereupon his Majesty was so exceedingly <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dissolved.</note> incensed, as on the very next day being <hi>Iune</hi> the fifteenth he dissolved the Assembly, though the <hi>Lords</hi> sent four of their House unto him, beseeching him earnestly he would permit them to sit but two dayes longer, but he answered, <hi>Not a minute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same afternoon the Earl of <hi>Bristow,</hi> the <hi>Dukes</hi> grand <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Bristow</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> persecutor, was committed to the Tower, and the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> confined to his own house. There came also forth from his Majesty a Proclamation for burning of all Copies of the Commons Declaration made before the Parliaments disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>This Rupture of the Parliament being supposed to issue <note place="margin">The King charged with imprudence.</note> from the Kings great affection to the Duke, I finde him charged with <hi>Deep imprudence and high over-sight to hazard
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95383:32"/>
the love of millions for him onely.</hi> Loth I am to leave him as I finde him, and hope this suggested imprudence will either totally disappear, or seem much lesse, if we well weigh those high obligations all Princes have, and what <note place="margin">The Charge Answered.</note> he had more then many others, to uphold their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. It is, and ever was the perpetuall lot of those who are of choisest admission into Princes favours, to feel as strong reverberations of envie and ill will from beneath, as they do irradiations of grace and favour from above; whereby they suffer a kind of persecution, it being the main businesse of those who maligne them, to be narrow inquisitors into all their actions, ready to aggravate the worst, and to traduce the best; nor scape they so, but over and besides their proper failings, they usually bear the blame and odium of their Masters faults; upon which Consideration Princes are in some sort tyed in equity to support them, thereby to compensate and make them some amends for what despight they endure upon the skore of their affection to them. Again, should a <hi>King</hi> desert and abandon a servant of such choice esteem upon every slight suggestion, what can he expect but a generall tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, a backsliding of affection and fidelity from him, and an utter declining of his service ever after? These are motives of generall concernment, over and besides which King <hi>Charles</hi> had others of more peculiar relation. He did not discern any thing in the accriminations of so horrid import as might blemish his owning him. His accumulated Offices and Honours, he reputed so far from an offence, as he could scarce think them an errour, and he believed hardly one of a million would have declined, or resisted the temptation of those Royal tenders, had they been in the Dukes case. And for his study to advance his near relations, he might most worthily have been counted a Monster, and an extravagancy in Nature, had he cast off all regard of those to whom he was by consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity so near annexed. Lastly, his Majesty took notice, that in all those thirteen Articles of Impeachment, there was not any thing of value, but what was acted and happened in the Reign of his late Father, and consequently not legally cogniscible in his time; nor did he think it sorted with his honour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an accusation against a person so dear both to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of blessed memory, and him self, after so many years e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed, especially considering that since the time of his pretended delinquency, he was honoured by many of his now accusers with the acclamation of the <hi>Preserver of his Countrey,</hi> and that in open Parliament; so odd a turn of passion is there in the minds of men. These were the inducements which fixt the King so much in the Dukes protection, which are here delivered
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95383:32"/>
out of a desire to expunge that blemish of <hi>imprudence</hi> thrown upon his <hi>Majesty,</hi> not as a concession of his dissolving the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament upon the account of that <hi>Protection</hi> only; for the <hi>King</hi> had other provocations which stimulated him also to it. Those <hi>Queries</hi> of Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> and that expression of Mr. <hi>Coke,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> resented as insolent, and so represented them to the Parliament; very hot they were of the spice, and had more peper then salt in them. In subconsulary <hi>Rome, Athens</hi> or <hi>Sparta</hi> they might have been tolerated, but in a state founded upon the administration of Monarchy, those small strictures and sparks of animosity, had fire enough in them to kindle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the anger of a mild Prince: for nothing irritateth and causeth the wrath of Kings more then dis-respect, as nothing gives them splendor and brightnesse but Authority, whereof if Soveraignty be once dismantled, once stript, she is soon trampled upon, scorned and contemned: And though those speeches did not take their aime directly at his Majesty, yet did they by glance and obliquely deeply wound him. They that make Princes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions the But or mark of their accusations, had need have a very steady hand, for it is very difficult to asperse persons so near the Throne, but some drops will sprinkle upon Majesty it self. Nor had those disordered heats power enough of themselves to operate so sad an effect, had they not been seconded by a Declaration of the hole House of the same meal and leaven'd with language of equal disgust to the King.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Monday</hi> before this dolefull dysaster, there happened a <note place="margin">A strange spectacle upon the Thames.</note> terrible and prodigious spectacle upon the <hi>Thames.</hi> The water near <hi>Lambeth-Marsh</hi> began about three of the clock in the afternoon to be very turbulent, and after a while rising like a mist it appeared in a circular form of about ten yards diameter, and about ten foot elevated from the River. This Catarract or spout of waters was carried impetuously crosse the River, and made a very furious assault upon the Garden wales of <hi>York-</hi>house (where the <hi>Duke</hi> was then building his new water stairs) at length, after a fierce attempt, it brake asunder, sending up a fuliginous and dusky smoak, like that issuing out of a Brewers chimny, which ascended as high, as was well discernible, and so vanisht. And at that very instant there was in the City of <hi>London,</hi> so dreadfull a storm of rain and hail, with thunder and lightening, as a great part of the Churchyard wals of St. <hi>Andrewes</hi> Church in <hi>Holborne,</hi> fell down, and divers graves being thereby discovered many coffins tumbled into the middle of the channel.</p>
            <p>It will not be amisse now to crosse the seas, and to take a <note place="margin">Difference between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95383:33"/>
between himself and his chief confederate and Brother <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whereby the former amity notwithstanding many Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives apply'd was enforced at length to yeeld to direct hostility. In the provocation, <hi>Lewis</hi> was the first, <hi>Charles</hi> in the quarrel. The leading occasion, this.</p>
            <p>During the late Treaty of marriage between <hi>England</hi> and <note place="margin">Seven <hi>English</hi> ships lent to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>France, Lewes</hi> pretending a martiall design against <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> entreated and obtained of King <hi>Iames</hi> the loan of the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> a parcel of the Navie-Royal, and (with the owners consent) of six Merchants ships more. But it being rumour'd that <hi>Lewes</hi> intended these ships against <hi>Rochel,</hi> then revolted from him, King <hi>Iames</hi> (who resolved to preserve himself neuter in that businesse, liking the <hi>Rochellers</hi> Religion too well to offend them, and their cause too ill to protect them) put in expresse cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that those ships should not be imployed against the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi> But before their ships put forth to sea (soon after King <hi>Iames</hi> died) <hi>Lewes</hi> and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> (at the instance of King <hi>Charles</hi> by his two Ambassadors, the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> and Sir <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Carlton)</hi> came to an accord. This pacification gave <hi>Lewes</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of enterprising upon the <hi>Valtoline</hi> with greater, both power and expedition, and invited <hi>Charles</hi> to dispatch the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> ships for <hi>France:</hi> but no sooner arrived they at their Port, then that nest of wasps at <hi>Rochel</hi> began to infest King <hi>Lewes</hi> again, for <hi>Subize</hi> following his old trade, took the opportunity of the advance of the <hi>French</hi> Army for <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>a l'improviste,</hi> before they were aware, surprised the Isle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> then incuriously guarded (so in-secure did overmuch security make them) seised many ships in the harbour, and bad fair for the taking of <hi>Fort-Lewes,</hi> had not the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Vendosme</hi> posted thither with relief. <hi>Lewes</hi> finding them of the <hi>Revolt,</hi> lapsed into their wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency, began to rouse amain, put to sea all the ships he could procure, sends to the <hi>Dutch</hi> for Naval aide, and demanded of Captain <hi>Pennington</hi> the delivery of the <hi>English</hi> ships agreeable to his Masters promise: The Captain reply'd, he took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any such promise, nor of any other agreement with the <hi>King</hi> his Master, <hi>then of taking in a chief Commander, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Souldiers, not superiour to the</hi> English, <hi>and to go upon such imployment as his Christian Majesty should direct,</hi> which, he said, he was ready to do: but to deliver up the ships without expresse order from his <hi>Master,</hi> were a presumptuous, yea, a treasonable act in him. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Frence</hi> perceiving the Captain so incompliant, courted and tempted him with ample promises of advancement, and the proffer of large sums of ready money; and finding him still intractable, he proceeded to protest against him as a Traitor to his <hi>King;</hi> which protest so irritated and urged the <hi>English</hi> Sea-men, then under his command, as they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95383:33"/>
stantly in a fury weighed anchor, and set sail for the <hi>Downs:</hi> from whence the Captain sending to our <hi>King</hi> for a further signification of his pleasure, <hi>his Majesty</hi> rather willing to submit to the hazard of <hi>Lewes</hi> his breach of Faith, then to the blame of receding his own from pollicitation, returned answer, that <hi>His wil was that he should</hi>

To the breach of Promise the <hi>French King</hi> returned answer that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had first temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and slighted their Faith with him, and that necessity inforced him to use all means to impede the progresse of so great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty, which he could not well doe without the aid of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ships, his own Fleet being upon other service: As to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Ships, he replyed, <hi>That his Subjects, by whom they were mann'd, held them contrary to his minde,</hi> and therefore wisht his Brother would come by them as he could. King <hi>Charles</hi> would have none of this answer, and while he pressed for a better, he occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it, by the seisure of the <hi>New-haven-ship;</hi> which <hi>Lewes</hi> took for sufficient ground not only to keep his hold of those seven ships, but also to arrest our Merchants goods in <hi>France</hi> to the value of three hundred thousand pounds; yet at length, either upon our Kings re-imbarquing to the <hi>French</hi> owners their goods, or reason of State (new commotions then arising in <hi>France)</hi> so perswading, <hi>Lewes</hi> in the begining of <hi>May,</hi> 1626. released all our both ships and goods. Upon this all was calm as could be between them again; But this lucid interval lasted not long, there being a fresh eruption of discontent upon an unhappy dysaster, which befel in our <hi>Queens</hi> Court, and it was as followeth.</p>

            <p>This accusation, though not determined to any particulars, yet while the blame hovered over all, every single was concern'd to keep it aloof; so that one by one, they began profession of their several innocencies. The <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Mende</hi> answered, Sir, <hi>If this accrimination be levelled at me, let me, I beseech you, know my fault, while I am here to make defence.</hi> And Madam S. <hi>George</hi> seconding him; Sir, <hi>I make no question but the Queen will give of me a fair testimonial to your</hi> Majesty. But the King departed with this <hi>Reparti,</hi> this short reply only, <hi>I name none.</hi> The <hi>Queen,</hi> whose tenerity of years, and frailty of sex had not yet annealed and fixt her for such an encounter, upon the first knowledge of it overwhelmed with the billows of passion, grew exceeding impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous against his <hi>Majesty,</hi> imputing it to him as the outside and extremity of unkindenesse, that having so slender a set and sute of her Native friends and servants to attend her, they must now be in an instant all casheir'd, in whose lieu she must now expect not a train of Honor, but a guard of disaffected strangers, not to wait so much upon her commands, as to watch her actions, and to be treated liker a <hi>Prisoner</hi> then a <hi>Princesse.</hi> That it was an high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to the daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that she could not retain a menial servant without a <hi>Conge d'eslier,</hi> and precarious addresse. His <hi>Majesty</hi> observing her thus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, laboured by all gentle perswasions to pacifie her; but finding the torrent too ferocient and furious for reason to deal with, resolved he was (hoping that her choler would at length quench it self with its own ebullitions and over-seethings) to ride out the storm, and persisted inflexible from his former purpose. Whereupon in the beginning of the next month they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained <note place="margin">They are warned out of the Realm.</note> to quit the Realm. A very sad doom it was certainly to the <hi>French,</hi> if we look upon the punishment abstracted and singled from the fault; for many of them had made sale of all was theirs in <hi>France</hi> for the purchase of those places of attendance, to whom proscription and banishment was equivalent to utter ruine. But as the animadversion was extreme severe; so their offences <note place="margin">Their several offences.</note> were adequately and in like degree hainous: and suffer they might an uniform chastisement, for misdemeanours of several makes. The <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> stood charged for putting intolerable scorn upon, and making Religion it self doe <hi>Penance</hi> by enjoyning
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95383:34"/>
her <hi>Majesty</hi> under the notion of <hi>Penance,</hi> to goe barefoot, to spin, to wait upon her Family servants at their ordinary repasts, to trash on foot in the mire on a rainy morning from <hi>Somerset</hi> house to Saint <hi>Iameses,</hi> her Confessor mean while like <hi>Lucifer</hi> him self riding by her in his Coach; but, which is worst of all, to make a Progresse to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> there to present, her devotions. A most impious piaculary, whereof the <hi>King</hi> said acutely, that, <hi>The Action can have no greater invective then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> Again the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Mende</hi> was blamed for contesting over eagerly with the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> about the <hi>Stewardship</hi> of those Mannors, which were setled upon the <hi>Queen</hi> for her Dower, that Office being confer'd on the <hi>Earl</hi> by the <hi>King,</hi> and the Bishop claiming a grant from her <hi>Majesty.</hi> The other sex were accused of crimes of another nature, whereof <hi>Madam S. George</hi> was, as in dignity of Office, so in guilt, the principal; culpable she was in many particulars, but her most notorious and impardonable fault was, her being an accursed instrument of some unkindenesse between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> through a causelesse taking <hi>distaste</hi> at his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> for a repulse from riding in the Coach with both their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties,</hi> Ladies of greater eminency worthily claiming preferment. This seeming disrespect she resented with so deep disgust, as she ever after meditated all possible means not only to create an odium and disdain in the <hi>Queen</hi> against the <hi>English</hi> Ladies, but also to procure a disaffection to the <hi>King</hi> himself. And in tract of time her insinuations into the <hi>Queens</hi> credulity were so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that what <hi>Madam S. George</hi> suggested, was more credential with her, then what her husband could alleadge in contradiction. So that the <hi>King</hi> perceiving Majesty thus trampled under foot, and the sacred tyes of Wedlock, making such approaches to a kinde of nullity, through the instigation of hers and such mischievous spirits, the result of his reason could be rationally supposed no other, then to evacuate and discharge the Kingdome of them. And the event did highly commend the counsel, for these incendiaries once casheired, the <hi>Queen</hi> who formerly shewed so much waspish protervity and way wardnesse, soon fell into such a mode of loving complacence and compliance, as evidently verified, her former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was rather the product of malicious spirits, then the effects of any crosse-grained inclination of nature; nor did the world ever afford a couple more mutually endeared each to other, then that Pare-Royal became after that. But though this <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> of her Majesties servants imported domestique peace, yet was it attended with an ill aspect from <hi>France,</hi> though our King (stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to preserve fair correspondence with his Brother) sent over the Lord <hi>Carleton</hi> with instructions to represent a true account of the action, with all the motives to it, but his reception was very course, being never admitted to audience. For <hi>Lewes</hi> his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95383:35"/>
cars were so wide open to the complaints of the proscribed <hi>French,</hi> as in the crowd of many truths, malice had power to convey in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous lyes, one whereof is especially filed upon the Record of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> by some <hi>French</hi> Narrators, <hi>viz. That they were casheir'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

               <hi>their wages and appointment;</hi> whereas they had not only their full Debentures paid them, but (as in draught) large rewards over and besides, the total amounting to twenty two thousand seven hundred thirty two pound, the several parcels whereof I am able to ascertain, and for the verity of this I appeal to Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> then Cofferer to the King. But <hi>Lewes</hi> dispatcht <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Marshall de Bassompierre</hi> as extraordinary Ambassadour to our <hi>King,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the restitution and postlimineation of the <hi>Queens</hi> Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiques; who labouring some months in vain for their re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was compelled at length to return home a mal-content. Nor was it very difficult to presage what the issue of his Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation would prove in <hi>England,</hi> considering how the Lord <hi>Carleton</hi> was slighted in <hi>France,</hi> and how that disrespect was seconded by an affront of a worse quality upon our Ships at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> at <note place="margin">An Embargo of our ships at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </note> that very instant of <hi>Bassompiers</hi> imployment here. For our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants laden with Wine at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in their return home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take in their Ordinance at <hi>Blay</hi> a Castle upon the <hi>Gironde,</hi> where (according to an ancient custome of diffidence in the <hi>French</hi> towards us <hi>English</hi> they were unladen) they were all arrested in the beginning of <hi>November</hi> by order from the Parliament of <hi>Roüen,</hi> upon pretence of some injurious depredation by the <hi>English.</hi> This indignity King <hi>Charles</hi> stomacht with such vehemency of spirit, as he resolved upon hostility with <hi>France,</hi> as shall appear in the Narrative of the ensuing year.</p>
            <p>Before I remove from hence, let me here offer at an <hi>Aphorism</hi> and State-syllogism, that is, from those premised and fore-recited differences to infer, that <hi>Confederations</hi> and alliances between Princes are rarely long-lived; the reason (I conceive) is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not souldered by any magnetique of <hi>Love,</hi> but by occult interest of State, and therefore pendulous upon the variety and mutation of affaires. And for the most part they are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by a <hi>Fear,</hi> either mutual of each others, or in conjunction of a third power, (so that such <hi>Leagues</hi> may more properly be called <hi>Leagues</hi> of meticulosity and <hi>fear,</hi> then of <hi>amity)</hi> whereby it comes to passe, that if the ballance of power be not equilibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, very evenly poysed, that Prince who hath the oddes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination either in reality or supposition, will soon finde and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitate for his own advantage matter of pretext to retire from his Faith, and to temerate the Laws of Alliance; nor can any verbal formality in the frame of the Treaties secure, nor the Oaths (the strongest ligaments of humane society) by which they are ratified, be defensatives sufficient against any, who hath a genius
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95383:35"/>
and minde to violate his fidelity, especially when the difference is like to receive no other decision then what the sword yeelds. And if such Alliances have the hap to be entertained with a serious and cordial disposition on both parts, yet many traverses and untoward accidents fortuitously and by chance occur, which either not managed to the best behoof of correspondence, or seconded by counsels of an ill temper, carry along with them fatal consequences, and generate a Rupture. So it fell out in this quarrel between us and <hi>France,</hi> wherein whether either merited the total of the blame generally imputed to them, may occasion further disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>That the imbarque and stay of our ships at <hi>Blay</hi> by <hi>Lewes</hi> his command was an infringement of the League, it is conceded, no evasion can be devised for it. But that he brake his Faith (as is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally suggested and urged against him) in using the seven ships against <hi>Rochel,</hi> changing thereby the property of their prime destination, I under favour supersede my assent. My reason is;</p>
            <p>All promises whatsoever, carry always about them, tacite <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's</hi> and savings of general and imply'd conditions; whereof one is, <hi>That affairs keep their station, and vary not from what they were at the moment of pollicitation:</hi> for words cannot oblige be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the minde, and it would be destructive to humane society, should a man be bound up by the strictnesse of his parole, to the performance of what (upon rational principles) neither himself would have granted, nor another have required of him at the first instant of the contract. And this was <hi>Lewes</hi> his case: for when he first past that promise, he had at home a considerable Armado, the greatest part whereof he might, and would have reserved to engage against <hi>Rochel,</hi> and consequently have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the <hi>English</hi> ships agreeable to his first purpose. But that Navy being now abroad, and too remote to bring timely aid, not to use all imaginable means in order to his own safety for <note place="margin">

            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> is taxed for violating the Matrimonial Pact by the Renvoy and discarding of the <hi>Queens</hi> Domestiques. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95383:36"/>
which if it hath somewhat of truth, it hath I am sure more of partiality; for why should he be singled out in the accri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, who was not single in the crime? not only other Princes, but <hi>Lewes</hi> himself having been guilty of a similary practice upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> retinue of his own <hi>Queen.</hi> But Precedents are no Standards, nor can they legitimate illegal actions; this therefore no just vindication of our <hi>King,</hi> whose honour will (if I mistake not) finde better relief from the Agreement it self, then from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>The Article urged against him is the fourteenth, by which it was contracted, <hi>That all the Domestique servants which the Queen should bring over into</hi> England, <hi>should be natural</hi> French <hi>and Catholiques, chosen by the most Christian King.</hi> And in case of death, she to chuse others Catholiques of <hi>France,</hi> provided the <hi>King</hi> of Great <hi>Britain</hi> should assent. Hereby it appeareth that her first set was to be of her Brothers Election, and so they were. But how long they should continue their attendance, and that ejectment (in case of misdemeanour) might not create a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy as well as death, nothing is expressely limited to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and indeed it cannot in reason be conceived, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles should give them a longer tearm, then during an obedience sutable to their Offices, or state them in such an indefeisable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, as might tempt them to all kinde of insolence against their Superiours. So then their condition being pendulous upon their good behaviour, which no doubt, (as is evident by their Oath clientelary, and of Fidelity formed in the fifteenth Article) was equally relative to either <hi>Majesty,</hi> I cannot but totally acquit King <hi>Charles</hi> of blame in proscribing such as refractarily offended. To proceed.</p>
            <p>Whilest these two Kings were thus picking quarrels one with the other, very sad news came hither from <hi>Germany,</hi> That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> notwithstanding the late aid sent from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of six thousand men under the conduct of Sir <hi>Charles Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> had on the 17. of <hi>August</hi> received a total overthrow by <hi>Tilly,</hi> and was reduced to such distresse, that if present succour came not he was ruined fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Though these storms appeared as Land-skaps and aloof, yet the <hi>King</hi> foresaw that as the winde lay, their impression was like soon to visit him at home, and at home he was in no good plight to bear up against them, matters going there with him corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondently ill.</p>

and <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> an hideous storm so ruffled them, as they had much ado to gain safe harbour; and well they escaped so, for they were of so slight and insufficient a structure, as had they been but an hundred leagues farther off, very few, if any, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered land.</p>
            <p>But it is an ill wind blows none to good, and this boystrons gust was a friendly contrivance of providence for the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Denbighs</hi> advantage, there falling out an unhappy accident in his absence, which called and speedily too, for all was man in him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marquesse Hamilton</hi> had been long, and earnestly solicited <note place="margin">Marquesse <hi>Hamilton</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</note> by the <hi>Duke</hi> to marry his Neece, this <hi>Earles</hi> daughter. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse</hi> had a minde as high as (some thought above) his extraction, and did account that Earls daughter, who was (though well deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) but yesterday Sir <hi>William Fielding, impar congressus,</hi> and no fit match: at length the <hi>King</hi> interposeth his desire, and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are equiparate to commands; so in the end the <hi>Marquesse</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and weds her, but with a serious resolution never to bed her: all fair and gentle means were used both by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> to perswade him to become her bed-fellow, and that failing they steer'd a course quite contrary, and divested him of his place in the <hi>Spicery,</hi> worth two thousand five hundred pound <hi>per annum.</hi> Upon this the <hi>Marquesse</hi> mal-content, a week before the <hi>Earls</hi> return, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts for <hi>Scotland,</hi> bidding the Court (as it was supposed) an eternal valediction. The <hi>Earl</hi> no sooner landed, then he was saluted with the news of his son in laws departure; whereupon he takes post a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after him, and after many denyals, at last with earnest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity reduced him to the Court; yet all the art and Royal power could not induce him to bed her, untill two years after, and not then without some seeming reluctation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being thus on every side on the losing hand, he was <note place="margin">The King in want.</note> much distressed in minde what course to take to discharge himself of those impendent calamities; should he call a Parliament, the time (whose every moment was precious to him) would not permit to stay for their convention; and when met, should they prove (as it was odds they would) as dilatory and disgustful as the former, he were in a worse condition then before. In this perplexed difficulty, at length his Councel agreed to set that great engine his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on work, many projects were hammered on that Forge, but they came all to small effect. First they moved for a contribution by way of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> but this was soon dasht; then a resolution was taken to enhance the value of Coyn two shillings in the pound, but this also was soon argued down by Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> but that <note place="margin">Raiseth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by Loan.</note> which the Councel stuck closest to, was the issuing of a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, dated the 13. of <hi>October,</hi> for raysing of almost two hundred thousand pounds by way of <hi>Loan;</hi> and the more to expedite and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate this levy, the Commissioners were instructed to represent

to the subject the deplorable estate of <hi>Rochel,</hi> then closely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager'd by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guise,</hi> and if not speedily relieved, would fall irrecoverably into the hands of the enemies of the Protestant Religion.</p>
            <p>These were plausible insinuations. For <hi>Rochel</hi> though situated in another Countrey, yet was looked upon as in the same parallel of belief with us. And what will not men suffer for others of the same perswasion; especially when fame reports them sufferers, because of the same perswasion?</p>
            <p>But all would not smooth the asperity of this illegal Tax; <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> and all other forain considerations must stand by, when home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred liberty is disputed; so thought the almost mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Upon this account of refusal, <note place="margin">Many refuse.</note> prisoners, some of the Nobility, and most of the prime Gentry were daily brought in by scores, I might almost say by Counties, so that the Councel Table had almost as much work to provide Prisons as to supply the <hi>Kings</hi> necessities.</p>
            <p>This year learning lost two luminaries of the greatest magnitude that ever this Nation enjoy'd.</p>
            <p>First, that stupendiously profound Prelate Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> Bishop <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> B. of <hi>Winchester</hi> dieth.</note> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> an excellent disputant, in the orientall tongues sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing knowing, so studiously devoted to the Doctrine of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers as his extant works breath nothing but their faith, nor can we now read the Fathers in his writings more then we could have done in his very aspect, gesture and actions, so venerable in his presence, so grave in his motions, so pious in his conversation, so primitive in all. Briefly, in him was, what was desirable in a Bishop, and that to admiration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the then, and last Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> Vicount St. <hi>Albans,</hi> for humane learning his ages miracle, but <note place="margin">And the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans.</hi>

            <p>He lyeth interred in the Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> at St. <hi>Albans</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> and hath there a fair statuary monument erected for him of white Marble at the cost of Sir <hi>Thomas Meautis,</hi> his ancient servant, who was not neerer to him living then dead: for this Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ending his life about a score of years after, it was his lot to be inhumed so nigh his <hi>Lords</hi> Sepulchre, that in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his grave, part of the <hi>Vicounts</hi> body was exposed to view; which being spyed by a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> he demanded the head to be given him, and did most shamefully disport himself with

that shell which was some-while the continent of so vast treasures of <note place="margin">Ann. Christi 1627.</note> knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Commission of Loan not answering in its product his Majesties expectation, the Papists began now to plot their own advantage from the Kings wants, and under pretence of Loyalty, they of <hi>Ireland</hi> propounded to him that upon consideration of a Toleration of their Religion, they would at their own charge fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with a constant Army of five thousand foot and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horse. But this project to their great regret proved dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baked, the Protestants countermining them, for in the next Spring Doctor <hi>Downham</hi> Bishop of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> preaching before the Lord Deputy and the whole State, <hi>Aprill</hi> the 22. taking for his text <hi>Luke 1. 74.

What part the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> have always taken in the affaires of the reformed Churches of this Kingdome, and with what care and zeal they have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for the good of them, is manifest to all, and the examples of it are also as ordinary as the occasions have been. The now <hi>King</hi> my most honoured Lord and Master, comes nothing short of his Predecessors therein, if his good and laudable designs for their good had not been perverted to their ruine, by those who had the most interest for their accomplishment. What advantages hath he refused? what parties hath he not sought unto? that by his alliance with <hi>France</hi> he might work more profitably and powerfully the restitution of those Churches into their ancient liberty and splendor. And what could be best hoped by so strict an alliance, and from so many reiterated promises, by the mouth of a great Prince, but effects truly Roial and sorting with his Geatnesse? But so far fails it therein, that his Majesty in so many promises and so strait obligation of friendship, hath found means to obtain liberty and surety for the Churches, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store peace to <hi>France</hi> by the reconciliation of those whose breath utters nothing else but all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obedience to their King under the liberty of the edicts; that contrariwise they have prevailed by the interest which he had in those of the Religion to deceive them, and by this means not only to untie him from them, but also to make him (if not odious unto them) at the least suspected, in perverting the meanes which he had ordained for good, to a quite contrary end. Witnesse the <hi>English</hi> ships not desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the extirpation of these of the Religion (but, to the contrary, expresse promise was made, that they should not be used against them) which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding were brought before <hi>Rochel</hi> and were imployed against them in the last Sea-fight; what then may be expected from so puissant a King, as the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95383:38"/>
King my Master so openly eluded, but a through feeling equal and proportioned to the injuries recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? but his patience hath gone beyond patience, and as long as he had hope that he could benefit the Churches by any other means, he had no recourse by way of armes; so far, that having been made an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and worker of the late Peace, upon conditions disadvantagious enough, and which would never have been accepted without his Majesties intervention, who interposed his credit and interest to the Churches to receive them (even with threatnings) to the end to shelter the honor of the most Christian King, under assurance of his part, not only for the accomplishment, but also for the bettering of the said conditions, for which he sends caution to the Churches.</p>
            <p>But what hath been the issue of all this, but only an abuse of his goodnesse? and that which his Majesty thought a soveraign remedy for all their sores, hath it not brought almost the last blow to the ruine of the Churches? It wanted but little by continuing the Fort before <hi>Rochel,</hi> (the demolishing whereof was promised) by the violence of the Souldiers, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons of the said Fort and Isles, as well upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the said Town, as strangers; in lieu whereas they should wholly have retired, have daily been augmented, and other Forts built, and by the stay of Commissioners in the said Town beyond the term a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, to the end to make broiles, and by the means of the division which they made to open the gates to the neighbouring Troops, and by other withstandings and infractions of Peace, little, I say, fail'd it that the said Town, and in it all the Churches had not drawn their last breath. And in the mean while his Majesty hath yet continued, and not opposed so many inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so many faith-breakings, but by plaints and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, untill he had received certain advice (confirmed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95383:39"/>
by intercepted Letters) of the great preparation that the most Christian King made to showre upon <hi>Rochel.</hi> And then what could his Majesty do lesse but to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his honor by a quick arming against those who had made him a party in their deceit, and to give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his integrity and zeal, which he hath alwayes had for the re-establishing of the <hi>Churches,</hi> which shall be dear and precious to him above any other thing?</p>
            <p>The first design of this <hi>Fleet</hi> was intended against <hi>Fort-Lewes,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the continent neer <hi>Rochel.</hi> But we were diverted by a stratagem of the Duke <hi>d' Angoulesm,</hi> who (coming with three thousand Foot, and two hundred Horse, for the security of the Fort, and annoyance of <hi>Rochel)</hi> ordered his Quarter-masters to take up as much accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in the Villages for quarters, as would suffice for fifteen thousand men; and they of the <hi>Religion</hi> supposing the power to be agreeable to this area or content of ground possessed by them, sent speedy advice thereof to the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Subize,</hi> who instantly directed their course toward the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Rhe.</hi>

               <hi>Iuly</hi> the 30. the <hi>English</hi> early in the morning shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the <hi>Islands</hi> of <hi>Oleron</hi> to the number of about twenty fail: upon their first discovery from land they were supposed to be <hi>Dunkerks</hi> waiting the motion of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> then in the road, but when it was perceived that they made nearer approches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the shore of the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Rhe,</hi> and withall grew more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> taking no alarm, they were then sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be <hi>English.</hi> The next day they sent in twelve ships to guard the entry of <hi>Port-Breten,</hi> falling down with the rest to a Fort of the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Rhe,</hi> called <hi>de la Pree,</hi> against which they played with their Canon, untill they made their approaches within Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket shot of the shore, which made <hi>Sieur de Toiras</hi> Governour of the Citadel of St. <hi>Martin</hi> think they had intentions of landing there; to impede which he made out all the strength he could, but we kept the <hi>French</hi> at that distance with our Ordinance, as gave us liberty to land about twelve hundred men. The enemy being about one thousand Horse and Foot besides Voluntiers, made a very gallant impression upon us, but coming counter and travers of our Canon, they received the greater losse; the total of those who fell on both sides was estimated at about nine hundred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the enemy bare the greater share. Men of note slain of our party were Sir <hi>William Heyden,</hi> and <hi>Sieur de Blancard,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, Agent from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rhoan,</hi> and the Protestants. Of the <hi>French</hi> the Governours brother, the Baron of <hi>Chuntal,</hi> and about half a score more.</p>

In this skirmish it was hard to distinguish which side won the field, seeing neither kept it, both retreating to their holds, we to our ships, they to their Garrison, where for three dayes all was so hust, so calm on both sides, as if they had sworn a Truce, or had spent their hole stock of valour. At length the <hi>Duke</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>French</hi> had as little stomach as himself, went on shore again, intrenching himself, untill he had debarqued all his Horse: then he dispatcht <hi>Subize,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Beecher</hi> to <hi>Rochel</hi> for a recruite; who returning with five hundred Foot, they forthwith marched directly towards St. <hi>Martins Fort,</hi> (disdaining to attempt <hi>La Pre,</hi> which a slender assault would have subdued, and might have proved an handsome and safe place of retreat in their future neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.) The Islanders upon his approach to their town fled into the Castle, and left the Town to his dispose, who thought it was an earnest of the Citadel it self, though the sense of their Councel of War, especially of Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs,</hi> was clearly otherwise; and that a strength so mann'd and fortify'd, and in an Enemies Countrey, was almost inexpugnable. But notwithstanding all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of his Councel, the <hi>Duke</hi> fals to circumvallation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, rearing many batteries, from whence he pelted the Fort for the space of two months together, though to little purpose; all the prejudice the enemy that way received, being not equivalent to ours in the losse of that gallant Gentleman Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> slain.</note> who was slain with a Musket shot from the Citadel, while he was viewing the <hi>English</hi> Works, and after nobly and honorably interred at <hi>Westminster.</hi> It is said, that during this siege, there was taken by the <hi>English perdu,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man with a ponyard of an odde fashion, wherewith (as he confessed) he was sent by <hi>Toyras</hi> to have stabb'd the <hi>Duke,</hi> which moved the <hi>Duke</hi> to poyson their fresh Springs; whereby, and for want of other supplyes they were at once reduced almost to the point of yeelding; when in the very joynt and nick of necessity, <hi>Mounsieur Balin</hi> at an high flood, in the dead of night conveyed in twelve Pinnaces laden with such provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as bare up their drooping spirits untill fresh relief arrived, which came successively in smaller parcels, until the Marshall of <hi>Schomberg, October</hi> 29. about three of the clock in the morning, the <hi>English</hi> taking no Alarm, under the favour of the <hi>Fort de la Pree</hi> landed four thousand foot and two hundred horse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with about day-break he marched up to the view of the Fort and of the <hi>English.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> much startled at this so strange apparition, and finding it a formidable power, being loth to endure an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement front and rear, resolved to rise and be gone; to which end he sent three hundred to guard the Bridge over which his Army was to passe unto the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Loose;</hi> but before he could be ready to march away, the enemy were drawing out of the little Fort, whereupon command was given to hasten away with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95383:40"/>
But before the <hi>English</hi> were out of the Town, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my followed their Rear with their swords drawn, hollowing to us in a <hi>bravado,</hi> whereupon being got Musquet shot from the Town, we were all drawn into battalia, thinking the Enemy would charge, but they would advance no neerer: then we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Military order again, and coming through a Village, we placed our Musqueteers behind the wals in Ambuscado, which giving fire upon their Enemies Horse as they were coming that way, enforced them to retreat. Having marched about three miles further we came to many little hils, which we ascended, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath set our men again in Battalia, staying there almost an hour before we marched away. In the interim the enemy, which were before a mile and half distant from us, came almost up to us, and facing us from the tops of the hils, observed in what posture we marched. Then were drawn forth some Musqueteers of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn, to shoot at those upon the hils, and to play upon their Horses. But as we marched away they still approched neerer to us, untill we came to a passage which was so narrow, having salt-pits on either side, as we could only march six a breast. The <hi>French</hi> now spying his opportunity, powred forth a great volee <note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> routed.</note> of shot against us, then we began to march as fast as possible. But as our Rear began to march, their Horse presently charged the Lord <hi>Montjoyes</hi> Troops, who turning tail rode in amongst our ranks, and routed us, (which Sir <hi>Charles Rich</hi> perceiving, cry'd, as it is reported, Kill him, kill him, though he be my brother) so that the greatest part began to shift for themselves, and confusedly ran away, many casting away their arms, others leaping into the water were cut off. The other divisions of the Horse fell upon Sir <hi>William Coninghams</hi> Troops; but they most bravely fought it out unto the last man; had the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> done the like, there had not a quarter so many perished. In this time we could not charge the Enemy because our Horse interposed betwixt us and them, and we could not annoy the Enemy, but we must more endanger our own fellowes. By this means all those Regiments in the Rear were cut off, and some of those in the Battail; the Enemy charging us even to the Bridge, where some of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders made a stand to receive them, and being not seconded by the souldiers who leapt into the water, were most of them slain; and had not Sir <hi>Edward Conways</hi> who led the Van marched back to the Bridge, and gallantly repelled the Enemy, who were newly passed over the Bridge, we had been all slain. Now the enemy being driven on the other side, we left a select company of Musqueteers to guard that Passe untill night, when we burnt the Bridge, lodged that night in the Loose, and the next day went on board. The black Bill of this days mortality was about fifty Officers, of common souldiers few lesse then two thousand, Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <note place="margin">The sum of their losse.</note>

No my Lord, it's said the King replyed, your redemption shall be only two couple of Hounds from <hi>England.</hi> Some interpreted this a slender value of that Lord to be exchanged for a couple of Dogs, but it was only in the King a modest estimate of his curtesie.</p>
            <p>Thus were we I know not whether more, or chaced out or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in this fatall Isle, an Isle so inconsiderable as had we lost there neither bloud nor honour, and gained it in to the bargain, it would have ill rewarded our preparation and charge of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
            <p>Great enterprises are fit entertainments for heroique spirits, and the ambition of them is noble. But as the achievement of them is glorious, so the failing shamefull, and the both glory and discredit commensurate with the interest of the Agent, and consequently Adventurers in chief have the greatest shew both in the honour and disgrace; so it fared with the <hi>Duke,</hi> whom this misfortune made principally obnoxious to the lash of wanton tongues, for upon his first weighing anchor and setting sail home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the <hi>French</hi> said in a jeer, Though the Duke could not take the Cittadel of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> yet it was odds but he would take the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> Nor did his own Countrey spare him at home, for immediately upon his return Doctor <hi>Moore</hi> a Prebend of <hi>Winchester,</hi> a man of an acute but aculeated wit, took occasion to cite in his Sermon that of <hi>Augustus</hi> in <hi>Tacitus, Quintili Vare redde Legiones,</hi> which saith the Historian perished <hi>propter inscitian &amp; temeritatem Ducis,</hi> giving him a quaint wipe with the amphibology the double-mindednesse of the word <hi>Dux:</hi> In this he was exceeding that in the face of Majesty he found all serene, only the King told him what Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> had written to him of a far greater losse then he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
            <p>During this expedition, <hi>George Abbot</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was compelled to a re-cesse not inglorious to his fame, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite contentment to his mind, which secluded from the drudgery of temporall cares might holely intend those which concern'd eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Being sequestred from his function, and a Commission da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>October</hi> 9. granted by the King to five Bishops, Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> being of the Quorum to execute Episcopall jurisdiction within his Province.

And although no arguments were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted which the wit of potent malignity could device or suggest against him, yet was he by the hole court (acquiescing in the opinion of those two learned men, Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> who both strenuously vindicated him) pronounced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</p>
            <p>Next <hi>Michaelmas Tearm</hi> there was an high debate concerning the <hi>Loan Recusants,</hi> they Petitioning the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> for an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the <hi>Attorney</hi> General alledging they were not bailable, and their Councel affirming they were, by reason the cause of their Commitment was not declared in the Warrant; but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Councel pleaded with great applause, yet were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to bide by it.</p>

            <p>Penance and restraint were indeed somewhat unseasonable at a time of such Jovial festivity and indulged freedome.

            <p>That <hi>Christmas</hi> the Temple Sparks had enstalled a <hi>Lieutenant,</hi>

The Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> being thus master of the field, took the <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> and haled, rather then led him to the <hi>Counter,</hi> and with indignation thrust him in at the prison gate, where he lay till the <hi>Atturney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> mediated for his enlargement, which the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> granted upon condition he should submit and acknowledge his fault.

            <p>On the other side the <hi>King</hi> was infinitely perplext, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted with restlesse thoughts, these discontents of the Subject were not still-born, but cryed so lowd as reached to his sacred ears; he studyed all means to disabuse them and remove their jealousies, declaring he disdained to harbour any such unkingly thoughts, and that he had a greater love for them then so, and <hi>desired he might at least ease their mindes, seeing he could not (as matters stood with him at present) their purses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in truth his exigents were passing great, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> being reduced almost to a despondence, and quitting of his Kingdome, our Garrison governed by <hi>Colonel Morgan</hi> exceedingly straightned, and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> crying amain for help.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Duke</hi> being returned from the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Rhe,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> resolved upon a serious and formidable siege against <hi>Rochel,</hi>

His last borrowing Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was a course so displeasing to the subject, as would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of re-petition, and it would prove an odde payment of that <hi>Loans</hi> arrears to demand another. But the <hi>King</hi> was now the <hi>Subject</hi> of a greater <hi>Potentate</hi> then himself, <hi>Necessity;</hi> and this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity put him upon several projects. First he borroweth of the Common Councel of <hi>London</hi> one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, for which and other debts he assures unto them twenty one thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> of his own lands, and of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company thirty thousand pounds, and yet he wants: Next <hi>privy Seals</hi> are sent out by hundreds, and a new way of <hi>Levy</hi> by <hi>Excise,</hi> resolved upon to be executed by Commission, dated the 3. of <hi>February,</hi> and yet he wants. But the best and most ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king project of all, was a <hi>Parliament;</hi> whereby he hoped not only to supply his necessities, but also to give some better repose to his troubled spirit; for he felt no inward contentment, whilest he the Head, and his Subjects the Body, were at distance, or like intersects and flies, tack't together by a mathematical line &amp; imaginary thread; therefore he seriously resolved for his part to frame and dispose himself to such obliging complacence and compliance, as might re-consolidate them by continuity of affection: This <hi>Parliament</hi> was summoned to meet upon the 17. of <hi>March,</hi> and the writs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">A Parliament called.</note>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:95383:42"/>
issued our, the <hi>Loan-Recusants</hi> appeared the only men in the peoples affections; none thought worthy of a Patriots title, but they who were under restraint upon that account; so that the far greater number of the Parliament was formed of them, and as their sufferings had made them of eminent remark for noble courage, so did they for external respects appear the gallantest assembly that ever those wals immured, they having estates, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly estimated, able to buy the House of <hi>Peers,</hi> (the <hi>King</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) though one hundred and eighteen, thrice over. Thus were all things strangely turned in a trice topside t' other way, they who lately were confined as prisoners, are now not only free, but petty Lords and Masters, yea and petty Kings.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes before the <hi>Session,</hi> a notable discovery was <note place="margin">A notable nest of Jesuites dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> made of a Colledge of <hi>Iesuites</hi> at <hi>Clerkenwell.</hi> The first infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was given by one <hi>Crosse,</hi> a messenger to Secretary <hi>Coke,</hi> who sent a Warrant to Justice <hi>Long</hi> dwelling neer, enjoyning him to take some Constables and other ayd with him; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to beset the house and apprehend the <hi>Iesuites:</hi> Entring the first door, they found at a stairs foot, a man and woman standing, who told them, <hi>My Masters, take heed you goe not up the stairs, for there are above many resolute and valiant men, who are well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with swords and pistols, and will lose their lives rather then yeeld, therefore if you love your lives be gone.</hi> The Constables took their counsel, and like cowardly Buzzards went their way, and told Secretary <hi>Coke</hi> the danger: whereupon the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi> sent the <hi>Sheriff</hi> to attach them, who coming with a formidable power found all the holy Foxes retired, and sneakt away; but after long search their place of security was found out, it being a lobby behinde a new brick wall wainscotted over, which being demolisht, they were presently unkennell'd to the number of ten. They found also divers letters from the <hi>Pope</hi> to them, empowering them to erect this Colledge under the name of <hi>Domus Probationis</hi> (but it proved <hi>Reprobationis) Sancti Ignatii;</hi> and their books of accounts, whereby it appeared they had five hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> contribution from their Benefactors, and had purchased four hundred and fifty pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> they had a <hi>Chappel, Library,</hi> and other roomes of necessary accommodation with houshold utensils and implements marked with <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> 
               <hi>S.</hi> What became of those Jesuites will fall in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and what would have become of the <hi>Secretary</hi> for his double diligence in their prosecution, you should have heard, had not the Duke been cut off, by an end untimely to himself, timely to the popular gust.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> being met, the <hi>King</hi> began thus to them;</p>

The stream of affairs running thus smoothly without the least wrinkle of discontent on either side, the House of <hi>Commons</hi> first <note place="margin">Ann.

It seemeth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable thing, to send a prisoner, and not withal to signifie the crimes laid against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This businesse stuck very much in the <hi>Lords</hi> House, who were <note place="margin">The Lords nice in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.</note> willing that the nails should be pared, not the hands tyed of the <hi>Prerogative;</hi> severall and great debates there were about it, the Atturney pleading eagerly, though impertinently for the <hi>King;</hi> and the ancient Records were so direct for the people, and so strongly enforced, as the Atturney had no more to say, but, <hi>I refer my self to the judgement of the Lords.</hi> And when these <hi>Lords</hi> were to give judgement concerning it, the <hi>Ducal</hi> or Royal party (for they were both one) were so prevalent, as they who leaned the other way, durst not abide the tryal by vote, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> down, moulded the House into a <hi>Committee,</hi> untill the Lord <hi>Say</hi> made a motion, <hi>That they who stood for the Liberties,</hi> (being <hi>effective</hi> about fifty) <hi>might make their protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that to be upon record, and that the other opposite party should also, with subscription of their names, enter their reasons to remain upon Record, that posterity might not be to seek, who they were, who so ignobly betrayed the freedome of our nation, and that this done, they should proceed to vote.</hi> At which the Court-party were so daunted, as they durst not mutter a syllable against it.</p>
            <p>Personal <hi>liberty</hi> being thus setled, next they fall upon the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of goods, the <hi>unbilleting</hi> of <hi>Souldiers</hi> and nulling of <hi>Martiall Law</hi> in times of peace, and finding <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and six other Statutes explanatory of it, to be expresly on their side, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the <hi>King</hi> to graut them the benefit of them; whereupon he declared himself by the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> to them, That he did hold the statutes of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the six other insisted upon for the subjects liberty to be all in force, and assured them that he would maintain all his subjects in the just freedome of their persons, and safety of estates. And that he would govern accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes and Statutes of the Realm; and that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should finde as much security in his royall word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as in any lawes they could made. So that hereafter they should have no cause to complain, and therefore he desired no doubt nor distrust might possesse any man, but that they would proceed speedily and unanimously on with their businesse.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Message</hi> begat a new question, <hi>Whether, or no, his Majesty
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95383:44"/>
should be trusted upon his word.</hi> Some thought it needlesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his <hi>Oath</hi> at the <hi>Coronation</hi> binding him to maintain the Lawes of the Land, that <hi>Oath</hi> was as strong as any royall word could be; Others were of opinion, that should it be put to vote, and carryed in the negative, it would be infinitely dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him in forein parts, who would be ready to say, The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> would not trust the <hi>King.</hi> At length in the height of this dispute stands up Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> and thus infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the House, <hi>We sit now in Parliament, and therefore must take his Majesties word no otherwise then in a Parliamentary way, that is, the King sitting on his Throne in his Robes, his Crown on his Head, his Scepter in his hand, in full Parliament, that is, both Houses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present; all these circumstances observed, and his assert being entred upon record, make his royall word the word of a King in Parliament, and not a word delivered in a chamber, or at second hand by the mouth of a Secretary, or Lord Keeper.</hi> Therefore his motion was, That the House should <hi>(more Majorum)</hi> according to the custome of their Predecessors, draw a <hi>Petition (de Droict)</hi> of Right to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> which being confirmed by both Houses and assented to by the <hi>King,</hi> would be as firm an <hi>Act</hi> as any.</p>
            <p>This judgement of so great a Father in the Law, at this time <note place="margin">The Petition of Right.</note> ruled all the House, and accordingly a Petition was framed, and at a conference presented to the Lords, the substance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of after the recitall of severall Statutes relating to the privilege of the subject, was reduced to these four Heads:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They do pray your most excellent Majesty, that no man hereafter be compelled to make or yeeld any Gift,</hi> Loan, Benevolence, <hi>Tax or such like charge, without common consent by</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Parliament; <hi>and that none be called to make answer, or to take such oath, or to give attendance, or be confin'd, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise molested, or disquieted concerning the same, or for refusall thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>And that no freeman be taken, and imprisoned, or be disseised of his free-hold or liberty, or his free customes, or be out-lawed or exiled, but by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgement of his Peers, or by the law of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And that your Majesty would be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Souldiers and Mariners now Billetted in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95383:45"/>
divers Counties, and that your people may not be so bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened in time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the late Commissions for proceeding by</hi> Marshal-law <hi>may be revoked and annulled, and that hereafter no Commission of like nature may issue forth to any person or persons whatsoever to be executed, test by colour of them any of your Majesties subjects be destroyed, and put to death contrary to law and the franchises of the land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which they most humbly pray of your most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majesty, as their rights and liberties accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes and Statutes of this Realm, And that your Majesty would also vouchsafe to declare, that all awards, doings, or proceedings to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of your People, shall not be drawn hereafter into consequence and example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The passe of this <hi>Petition</hi> was a great while disputed earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> had a more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning interest in the Prerogative, as that which gave them their first existence, and present subsistence; and this <hi>Petition</hi> they thought would detrunck too much, and some thought strike at the very root of that <hi>Prerogative,</hi> so that they suspended their assent; yet because they would seem not altogether to abandon the Publique, they model'd an <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>Saving</hi> (as they called it) and desired the Commons it might be adnexed to the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the addition was, <hi>We present this our humble Petition to your Majesty, not only with care to preserve our own liberties, but with regard to leave intire that Soveraign Power, wherewith your Majesty is trusted for the protection, safety, and happinesse of your people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>addition</hi> would not down with the <hi>Commons,</hi> who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it would make the Petition so much Royalist, as it would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, as to the subjects benefit, and would prove <hi>felo de se,</hi> self-destructive. A conference was had with the <hi>Lords,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> sent to signifie the reasons and resolutions of the lower House, but the <hi>Peers</hi> received little satisfaction; thereupon a second was desired, and being managed by Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Glanvile;</hi> at length the Lords were perswaded to comply: then it was presented to the <hi>King</hi> without any such saving label. His Majesty desired time to consider of it, yet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95383:45"/>
did not long delay them; for as his own gracious inclination disposed him to give much, so he thought it expedient in that conjunction of time, to give more for expedition in reference to his necessary supplies, and within five daies after gave them this ensuing answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King willeth that right be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes and Customes of the Realm,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Kings first Answer.</note> 
               <hi>and that the Statutes be put in due execution, that his Subjects may have no cause to complain of any wrong or oppressions contrary to their just Right and Liberties, to the preservation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he holds himself in conscience as well obliged as of his Prerogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> was confident this <hi>Answer</hi> would have pleased to purpose, for as he was far from any mental reservation or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, so was he studious it should be worded adequate to their desires, and was astonisht to hear it was not satisfactory; but it seems it was too elaborate, and that the <hi>King</hi> had put too much cost into it; for the sense was not, it seems, the essence; and though the matter was <hi>sans exception,</hi> yet because not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the usuall mode, disliked, for formality was the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall part of it; therefore the Parliament agreed to petition for a new Answer of the old model, but before that Petition was framed, his <hi>Majesty</hi> unexpectedly surprised them with this Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Answer I have already given you was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">His second Answer.</note> 
               <hi>made with so good deliberation, and approved by the judgement of so many wise men, that I could not have imagined but that it should have given you full satisfaction; but to avoid all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous interpretations, and to shew you there is no doublenesse in my meaning, I am willing to please you in words as well as in substance. Read your</hi> Petition, <hi>and you shall have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95383:46"/>
an Answer that I am sure will please you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Petition</hi> being read, his <hi>Majesty</hi> answered,</p>
            <p>Le droict soit faict comme il est desire. <hi>This I am sure is full, yet no more then I gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you in my first answer; you see now, how ready I have shewed my self to satisfie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, so that I have done my part, wherefore if this Parliament hath not an happy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the sin is yours, I am free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> having ended, the <hi>Houses</hi> testified their joy with a mighty shout, and presently the Bels rung and Bone-fires were kindled all the city over; nor was the true cause so distinctly known; for many apprehended at first, that the <hi>King</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the <hi>Duke</hi> up to them to be sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon which misprision some said the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-hill</hi> was instantly pulled down, the people saying, <hi>His Grace should have a new one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was also said, that the House of <hi>Lords</hi> made suite to the <hi>King</hi> upon this happy accord, that he would be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into Grace those Lords who were in former disfavour, which he readily yeelded to, and admitted the Lord <hi>Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Essex, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln, Warwick, Bristow,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Say</hi> to kisse his hand.</p>
            <p>The Petition thus granted, the Commissions of <hi>Loan</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> were instantly out-lawed, and at the entreaty of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers</hi> cancelled in the <hi>Kings</hi> presence. Having thus secured the <hi>Faults,</hi> they removed to the <hi>Faulty;</hi> and resolved upon a large <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> ripping up both the grievances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the authors of them. This <hi>Remonstrance</hi> consisted of six branches, in sum these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The danger of</hi> Innovation <hi>and alteration in</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance.</note> 
               <hi>This occasioned by, 1. The great esteem and favours many professors of the</hi> Romish Religion <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at Court. 2. Their publique resort to</hi> Masse <hi>at</hi> Denmark <hi>House, contrary to his</hi> Majesties <hi>answer to the</hi> Parliaments Petition <hi>at</hi> Oxford. 3. <hi>The Letters
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95383:46"/>
for stay of proceedings against them. Lastly, the daily growth of the</hi> Arminian <hi>faction favoured and protected by</hi> Nele Bishop <hi>of</hi> Winchester, <hi>and</hi> Laud Bishop <hi>of</hi> Bathe <hi>and</hi> Wels, <hi>whilest the Orthodox party are silenced or discountenanced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The danger of</hi> Innovation, <hi>and alteration in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment occasioned by the</hi> Billeting <hi>of Souldiers, by the Commission for procuring one thousand</hi> German Horse <hi>and Riders, as for the defence of the Kingdome, by a standing Commission granted to the</hi> Duke <hi>to be General at land in times of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Dysasters of our Designes, as the expedition to the</hi> Isle <hi>of</hi> Rhe, <hi>and that lately to</hi> Rochel, <hi>wherein the</hi> English <hi>have purchased their dishonor with the waste of a million of treasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The want of Ammunition occasioned by the late selling away of thirty six Last of Powder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The decay of Trade by the losse of three hundred ships taken by the</hi> Dunkyrkers <hi>and</hi> Pirates <hi>within these three last years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The not guarding the narrow Seas, whereby his</hi> Majesty <hi>hath almost lost the Regality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of all which evils and dangers the principal cause is the</hi> Duke of Buckingham <hi>his excessive</hi> power, <hi>and abuse of that power. And therefore they humbly submit it to his</hi> Majesties <hi>wisdome, whether it can be safe for himself, or his Kingdome, that so great power both by Sea and Land as rests in him, should be trusted in the hands of any one Subject whatsoever.</hi>

            <p>This <hi>Remonstrance</hi> being finished on <hi>Tuesday, Iune</hi> 17. they presented it, as an appendix, with the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Subsidies</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> in the Banqueting house, who having heard it out, told them he little expected such a <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> after he had so graciously passed the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right;</hi> as for their grievances he would consider of them as they should deserve. Some say that at his passage out, the <hi>King</hi> gave the <hi>Duke</hi> his hand to kisse, which others only suppose was no more then the <hi>Dukes</hi> low congie to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties hand.</p>

It is also reported, that the <hi>King</hi> being informed that Mr. <hi>Denzil Hollis</hi> had an hand in this Remonstrance, he replyed in the words of <hi>Iulius Caesar, Et tu Brute!</hi> I wonder at it, <hi>for we two were fellow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers in a Masque together.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>IT may seem strange that I come so suddainly to end this Session, therefore before I give my assent to the Bils, I will tell you the cause, though I must avow I ow an account of my actions to none but God alone. It is known to every one that a while agoe the House of Commons gave me a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, how acceptable every man may judge, and for the merit of it I will not call that in question, for I am sure no wise man can justifie it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now since I am certainly informed that a second Remonstrance is preparing for me, to take away my profit of Tonnage and Poundage (one of the chief maintenances of the Crown) by alledging that I have given away my right thereof, by my Answer to your Petition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This is so prejudicial to me, as I am forced to end this Session some few hours before I meant it, being willing not to receive any more Remonstrances, to which I must give an harsh Answer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And since I see that even the House of Commons begins already to make false constructions of what I granted in your Petition, lest it be worse inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in the Country, I will now make a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning the true intent thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Profession of both Houses, in the time of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95383:48"/>
hammering this Petition, was no wayes to trench upon my Prerogative, saying,</hi> They had neither intention, <hi>nor power to hurt it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore it must needs be conceived that I have granted no new, but only confirmed the ancient Liberties of my Subjects. Yet to shew the clearnesse of my intentions, that I neither repent nor mean to re-cede from any thing I have promised you, I do here declare, That those things which have been done, whereby men had cause to suspect the Liberty of the Subject to be trencht upon (which indeed was the true and first ground of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) shall not hereafter be drawn into example for your prejudice; And in time to come (in the word of a King) you shall not have the like cause to complain.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But as for</hi> Tonnage <hi>and</hi> Poundage, <hi>it is a thing I cannot want, and was never intended by you to aske, never meant (I am sure) by me to grant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To conclude, I command you all that are here, to take notice of what I have spoken at this time, to be the true intent and meaning of what I granted you in your Petition; But especially you my Lords the Iudges, for to you only under me belongs the interpretation of the Laws, for none of the Houses of Parliament joynt, or separate (what new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine soever may be raised) have any power, either to make, or declare a Law without my consent.</hi>

The <hi>Parliament</hi> being thus prorogued, the <hi>Commons</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly male-content, for they desired only a Recesse, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, whereby all matters then depending, might be found in the same station and condition at their next meeting, wherein they at that present left them.</p>
            <p>This Session were enacted these Lawes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For further reformation of divers abuses committed on the Lords-day, commonly called Sunday.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="7">7. <hi>For the grant of five entire Subsidies, granted by the Temporality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all famous to all posterity is this Session, for his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> gracious answer to that gallant Standard of common Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>the Petition of Right.</hi> Never did Arbitrary power since Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy first founded, so <hi>submittere fasces,</hi> so vail its Scepter; never did the Prerogative descend so much from perch to popular lure, as by that concession, a Concession able to give satisfaction, even to supererogation, for what was amisse in all the Kings by-past Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>During this Session many things occurred worthy to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which because forein to the <hi>Parliament</hi> affairs I reserved as a <hi>Postscript:</hi> being loth to make a simultaneous meddly of various actions, shuffled together without dependence upon either antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or subsequent narrations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 8. the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Denbigh</hi> as Admiral set sail from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The relief of <hi>Rochel</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but in vain.</note> with about fifty sail of tall ships, for the relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and being scanted in Mariners he was enforced to take in two thousand two hundred land men, who should be amphibious, serving partly for sea-men, and partly for land-souldiers: with this power he made an attempt toward the relief of the Town, but was repelled much to our losse, but more to our dishonour; so as he presently betook himself to a speedy return, arriving at <hi>Plymouth</hi> the 26. of the same month. The supposed author of this dysaster was one <hi>Clark</hi> a Bedchamber man, and a chief Commissioner in all our former improsperous expeditions: who, because a supposed Papist, was conceived to have industriously betrayed us to this and former miscarriages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:95383:49"/>
The same month, but with greater honour was <hi>Stoadt</hi> our <hi>English</hi> Garrison, some twenty miles from <hi>Hamborough</hi> on the other side of the <hi>Elbe,</hi> given up to the Imperialists, Sir <hi>Charles Morgan</hi> having bravely and stoutly defended it: the conditions were, that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Stoadt</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered.</note> souldiers should never bear arms against the <hi>Emperour,</hi> but at the command of their own <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iune</hi> the 13. Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> suffered for the testimony of a lewd <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Lamb</hi> his exemplary death.</note> conversation. Having been at a Play-house, at his return some boyes began to affront him, and call him the <hi>Dukes Devil,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he hired some to guard him home, and taking in at a Cooks shop where he supt, the people watcht his coming out, but he was so strongly guarded as they durst not venture on him; then he went to the wind-mill Tavern in <hi>Lothbury,</hi> and at length coming forth, the tumult being much encreased, gave the onset, and assaulted him, so as he was forced to take refuge in the next house, but the enraged multitude threatned to pull down the house unlesse <hi>Lamb</hi> were speedily delivered to them. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the house was a Lawyer, and fearing some sad comsequence of this uproar, discreetly sends for four Constables to guard him out. But the furious multitude flew at him, in the midst of his auxiliaries, struck him down, and malled him with a vengeance, so as they beat out one of his eyes, and left him half dead upon the place. In this plight he was carryed into the Counter in the <hi>Poultery,</hi> no other house being willing to receive him, where the next morning he changed this life either for a better or for a worse.</p>
            <p>A most infamous and gracelesse wretch he was, twice had he been arraigned, once for a witch, and practising his hellish art upon the Lord <hi>Windsor,</hi> another time for a rape at the Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench-barre at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where to the astonishment of all then present, he proceeded to such prodigious insolence as to say in the audience of the hole Court, <hi>I wonder any should think I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such an act upon so despicable a creature as this</hi> (meaning his accuser) <hi>when had I been so disposed, I could have had my choise of the handsomest Ladies in the Court.</hi> Some considerable circumstances must not be forgot, by reason of their synapsis, their coherence with this relation.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that not full a year before, he foretold, that he should perish in the streets by the fury of the people. Some say, that when the multitude were belabouring him with stones, and cudgels, they said, <hi>that were his master the Duke there, they would give him as much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some things also were of ominous observation in reference to the <hi>Duke;</hi> for on the same day that <hi>Lamb</hi> was slain, the <hi>Dukes</hi> picture fell down in the high Commission Chamber at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> But that which was most notable, was, that when
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95383:49"/>
these and the like accidents were spoke of as foreboding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of present fatality to the <hi>Duke</hi> in the Lady <hi>Davis</hi> her hearing; she, for certain, reply'd, <hi>No, his time is not come till Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi> This added to her former prediction concerning this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and both verifi'd in the event, rear'd the Lady up the fame of a great Prophetesse: and yet this could be in the very Devill himself, but a nude conjecture; for though he had found the mindes of men very susceptible of, and disposed to receive a temptation to such a fact, which he was resolved to suggest at that time; yet that the act itself should be executed precisely then, guesse he might, prognosticate he could not; for in things determined in their naturall causalities to certain and definite effects, not only Devils but wise men, where miracle interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not, may infallibly divine the products: but in things contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent upon free and voluntary agents, all the Devils in hell can but blunder.</p>
            <p>On the Munday after the Lord Maior and Aldermen of the City were sent for to appear at the Councell Table, and to give an account of the uproar about <hi>Lamb,</hi> and were threatned, that unlesse they discovered and rendred up the Malefactors, they should sorfeit their Charter, and in the upshot were fined, as was reported, Six thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>This Session ended, the <hi>King</hi> finding as he thought so male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent a glosse started from his late Act of Grace, conceived it stood him in hand to stand upon his guard, and to make the best improvement of the small remnant of Prerogative which he had left; to which purpose instruments of working and active brains were sought out, and finding the Earl of <hi>Marlborough</hi> the <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> then <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> too dull and phlegmatick for his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he removed him and lifted up the late Lorded Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Weston</hi> into his place, a man of most accomplisht quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Richard Weston</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> for his design, and about the same time dignified Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> of <hi>York-shire</hi> with a Barony, though one of the late Committee in forming the unpleasing Remonstrance, and a stickler against the Prerogative, but this beam of Majesty as it did heat, so did it soften the temper of the man, so as he became thence forward most flexible to his service.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>August</hi> came forth a Proclamation against Papists, but especially against Jesuits and Priests, a sort of men in the state of <hi>England,</hi> like the Mathematicians, and Astrologers under <note place="margin">Genus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num quod in ci vitate nostra &amp; vetabitur sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; retinebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Taeit.

            </p>
            <p>But the great businesse of this vacation was the setting forth a third Fleet for <hi>Rochel,</hi> then which there never appeared a more galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Armado</hi> formed by our Nation, and because so noble a preparation must be sutably commanded, the <hi>Duke</hi> resolved to give the venture once more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95383:50"/>
But whilest he was in pursuit of this enterprise, he was rapp'd and hurried into another world by an abrupt and untimely death.</p>
            <p>For on the Vigil, the Eve of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> the 23 of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> being at breakfast at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> with <hi>Soubize,</hi> and others <note place="margin">The Duke murdered.</note> of principall quality, one <hi>Iohn Felton</hi> (sometimes a Lieutenant to a Foot Company in the Regiment of Sir <hi>Iohn Ramsey)</hi> who had but about a week before meditated the act, but had not yet contrived the means, sneaks into the chamber, vigilant to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve every opportunity serviceable for his purpose, and finding the <hi>Duke</hi> ready to rise from the table, he withdrawes into an entry, through which the <hi>Duke</hi> was to passe, who coming by with Sir <hi>Thomas Frier</hi> (to whom he declined his ear in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of attention) in the very instant of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his retiring from the <hi>Duke, Felton,</hi> with a back-blow, stabb'd him on the left side into the very heart, leaving the knife, a ten penny coutel, in his body. The Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi> and some others who were in the hearing of the thump, reported, that the most religious murderer, in the very act of striking, said, <hi>Lord have mercy on thy Soul;</hi> a speech, which the <hi>Duke</hi> had scarce ability to say for himself, for pulling the knife out, presently, the orifice being wide, there streamed such an effusion of bloud, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such an emission of spirits, as he only was heard to say (some report with an oath) <hi>The villain hath killed me,</hi> and then expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. All this while the assasinate pass'd undiscovered (a faire advantage had he been studious of escape) and the general voice passing currant up and down, that he was a <hi>French-man, Felton</hi> like an ingenuous villain, with an undaunted courage, avowed himself the author of it. Many are said to be his instigations to this execrable act. He had long and in vain attended for his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears of pay due for former service. Again, he was twice repulsed upon his Petition for a Captains place, and others super-inducted over his head. It was thought these extimulated and whetted him on to rancour, and it is like he had prejudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some such construction would be made of it, and conceiving the supposition of private revenge would infame and blemish the glory of the exploit, presuming he should encounter inevitable destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he stitched a paper to the lining of his hat, wherein he declared, his only motive to the fact was, the late Remonstrance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons against the <hi>Duke,</hi> and that he could not sacrifice his life in a nobler cause, then by delivering his Countrey from so great an enemy.</p>
            <p>Two things, as especially, and almost singularly observable after his fall may not be omitted.</p>
            <p>First, no sooner had he expired his last, and his body shifted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Things me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fall.</note> another room, but the Corps was totally abandoned, not a living
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95383:50"/>
soul was to be seen a great while in either chamber, that where he dyed, or that whereinto he was removed; either bycause they durst not trust fancy with a spectacle so horrid, or bycause they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some further assasination. The like fate, if <hi>History</hi> be truly informed, attended the Body of our first <hi>Norman King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that the first news thereof finding his <hi>Majesty</hi> (then about four miles distant) at his publique devotions, he received it without the least emotion of spirit or discomposure of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: which equanimity some imputed to his steady intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon that sacred duty: others thought that though he disliked the mode and way of his dispatch, yet with the thing he was well enough pleased, as if providence had thereby rid him of the Subject of his so great perplexity, whom he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve with <hi>safety,</hi> nor desert with <hi>honour.</hi> But these were soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their errour, when they observed his <hi>Majesty</hi> treat his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations with so intense respect.</p>
            <p>But whatsoever satisfaction the King received thereby, certain <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons rejoyce.</note> it is, it pleased the <hi>Common</hi> man too well; for though Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity and the Law found the act murther, yet in vulgar sense it rather past for an execution of a Malefactor, and an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of that justice dispensed from heaven, which they thought was denied on earth. And bycause all those stormes at publique miscarriages generated in the lower Region of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> had of late been terminated in him, as their grand efficient, every man would now be wise and fore-speak fair weather, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between the <hi>King</hi> and Subject, how truly a few moneths will discover.</p>
            <p>His leaving a <hi>Will</hi> behind him, imports he did somewhat <note place="margin">His Will.</note> premeditate death. Therein he bequeathed to his <hi>Duchesse</hi> the fourth part of his Lands for her Joynture. His debts amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sixty one thousand pounds, his Jewels (most belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the late <hi>Queen)</hi> were prized at three hundred thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>His Funerall was nothing solemn, his body being interred <note place="margin">His Funerall.</note> clandestinely the 25 of <hi>September,</hi> attended with about an hundred mourners. The Heralds were indeed sent for by the Lord <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer</hi> a week before to project a sumptuous funerall for him, and according to order they brought in large proportions, it was thought exceeding those in the Obsequies of King <hi>Iames.</hi> But at length, upon second thoughts, the <hi>Treasurer</hi> told the <hi>King, Such pompe would prove but an houres shew, and that it were more for his glory to erect him a stately Monument which he might do for half the cost.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> liked the motion well, and after the <hi>Dukes</hi> Buriall, put the <hi>Treasurer</hi> in minde of what he had contrived, wishing him to see it done; then the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95383:51"/>
Treasurer reply'd, <hi>Sir, I would be loath to tell your Majesty, what the World would say both here, and abroad, if you should raise a Monument for the Duke, before you erect one for your Father.</hi> Whether this clearly and cunning diversion flowed from the Treasurer his no singular good will to the <hi>Duke,</hi> or from a provident regard to his Masters purse, let others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>Thus fell this miracle of grandure in the 36 year of his age, <note place="margin">His Character.</note> a race he might, in the ordinary rode of nature, have doubled. A Gentleman he was of that choice and curious make for exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour shape, as if Nature had not in his hole frame drawn one line amisse; nor was his fabrique raised by soft and limber stud, but sturdy and virile. His intellectuals gained him rather the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a wise man, then of a wit. His skill in letters very mean, for finding nature more indulgent to him in the ornaments of the body, then of the minde, the tendency of his youthfull genius, was rather to improve these excellencies, wherein his choice felicity consisted, then to addict himself to morose and sullen bookishnesse, therefore his chief exercises were, Dancing, Fencing, Vaulting, and the like, as indications of strenuous agility: yet could he have foreseen where all the climacteries and motions of his advance should have terminated, that from no more then a meer Gentleman, it should be his luck to vault into the Dignity of a <hi>Duke,</hi> and trust of a privie <hi>Counsellor,</hi> we may presume his early studies would not have cast so much neglect upon a thing so important to him as a Statesman, though not very fashiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a Courtier. The temperature of his mind was, as to morall habits, rather disposed to good then bad; his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was most affable and debonair, a rare example in one raised so high, and so speedily: to his relations liberall, firme to his friend, formidable to his enemy. From venereal excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions I cannot totally acquit him, He was a Courtier and young man, a Profession and Age, prone to such desires, as when they tend to the shedding of no mans bloud, to the ruine of no Family, humanity sometimes connives at though she never approves. Of his Religion, they who write most in favour of him speak little, whereof if he was too incuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, His condition the more deplorable, when surprised by so suddain a death as afforded him not the respiration of auricular contrition. But seeing God is accostable by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organicall and inaudible ejaculations, and no time is too short to exclude such an infinite mercy, charity wils we hope the best.</p>
            <p>This Tragique accident of the Dukes did so little impede the <note place="margin">The last at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt toward <hi>Rochels</hi> relief.</note> motion of the Fleet, as it is a question whether or no it did at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard it: for the <hi>King</hi> did with such personal assiduity, such dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

hasten the furnishing of it with all necessaries both of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and munition, as he dispatcht more of concernment to it in ten or twelve dayes then the <hi>Duke</hi> did in so many moneths before, so that on the eighth of <hi>September</hi> following departed from <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> (a Gentleman full of gallantry and courage) commanding in chief: but before his coming the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had fiaisht his prodigious Boorn and Barricado, through which it was impossible to break.

            <p>During this last expedition news came to our <hi>King</hi> of some damage we had sustained, and as bad news could not be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him, so was he loth to hear it from his Parliament, and from them he questioned not but to hear what ever untowardly befell, should they sit according to their first intention; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hoping the event would render them more pleasing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he adjourned the meeting till <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 20. In the interim there were severall emergences and occurrences which would give them their hands full. For the generality of the Merchants both of the <hi>Turkey</hi> and the <hi>East-India Company</hi> refused to pay a penny, under the notion of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> which caused a mighty contest betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and them, he urging the practise of his Predecessors in taking, they the validity of the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> in denying, so that divers of their goods were seised.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> was now approaching, and something must be done to please them, and what could better please them then the gracing of their great confident the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury?</hi> therefore he was sent for to the Court about <hi>Christmas,</hi> and from out of his barge received by the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dorset,</hi> by them accompanyed to the <hi>King,</hi> who giving him his hand to kisse enjoyned him not to fail the <hi>Councell Table</hi> twice a week.

            <p>There was then also published another Proclamation for the <note place="margin">A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Papists.</note> apprehending of <hi>Richard Smith</hi> the titular <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> This Proclamation, saith Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> was procured at the earnest so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of the Regular Priests in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently opposed Dr. <hi>Smiths</hi> Episcopal Jurisdiction; but Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> was much mistaken, for that prosecution was not till the year 1630. as shall be evidenced hereafter. And the impulsive to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding against him, was his endevour to have perverted some poor silly people in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> where the holy man appeared in his <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> (as horned <hi>Mitre</hi> and <hi>Crosier)</hi> amongst a company of Geese.</p>

               <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 16. the Lord <hi>Doncaster</hi> son to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Carlile,</hi> brought very sad news to Court from the <hi>Hague,</hi> which put the <hi>King</hi> and all his train into mourning, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Frederique Henry,</hi> eldest son to the <hi>Palzgrave,</hi> was unfortunately drowned in <note place="margin">

The Prince clasped his armes about the mast, cryed out for help, and boats were sent out to relieve him, but the night was dark and the weather so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous as they could not finde him until morning, when they discovered him clinging about the mast, but stark dead; the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> his mother was newly brought to bed, when this doleful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent befel her, the news whereof drave her into a most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment passion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 20. the <hi>Parliament</hi> sate, who soon found they were <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meet.</note> like to have work enough: for complaints came thronging in, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against the Customers for taking and distraining Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods for <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of called them to the Banqueting house, and told them;</p>
            <p>The occasion of that meeting was a complaint made in the lower <hi>House</hi> for staying of some mens goods, for denying <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> which difference might be soon decided, were his words and actions rightly understood. For if he did not take those duties as appendixes of his Hereditary Prerogative, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he challenged them not of right, and only desired to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them by the gift of his people, why did they not passe the <hi>Bill,</hi> as they promised to him to clear his by-past actions and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proceedings, especially in this his time of so great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity?</p>
            <p>Therefore he did now expect they should make good what they promised, and put an end to all questions emergent from their delay.</p>
            <p>The House of <hi>Commons</hi> said, that Religion is above policy, <hi>God</hi> above the <hi>King;</hi> and that they intended to reform Religion before they ingage in any other consideration; nor was it agreeable to the liberty of consultation to have their transactions prescribed, so that they would for the present lay aside the Bill of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> till they thought convenient. And they were as good as their words, for the first thing resolved upon was the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Committees,</hi> (which the <hi>Courtiers</hi> called an Inquisition) <note place="margin">Committees appointed.</note>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95383:53"/>
One for Religion, another for Civil affairs, and these to represent the abuses in both.</p>
            <p>The Committee for Religion declared, that upon due inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they found it in a very tottering and declining condition. The dangers which most threatned it were <hi>Arminianism</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Religion in danger.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Arminianism,</hi> informations were very pregnant, That, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the resolution of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> &amp; other reverend Bishops and Divines assembled at <hi>Lambeth, Anno</hi> 1595. on purpose to deliver &amp; declare their opinions concerning the sense of the 39. Articles in those particulars, unto which resolution the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and all his Province did then conform in their belief. That notwithstanding those Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> were so well approved of by King <hi>Iames,</hi> as he first sent them over to the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> as the Doctrine of our Church, where they were asserted by the suffrage of our <hi>British</hi> Divines, and after that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the <hi>Convocation</hi> held in <hi>Ireland</hi> to be inserted amongst the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> established <hi>An.</hi> 1615. and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they were.</p>
            <p>That notwithstanding formerly many several Recantations enjoyned and Censures inflicted upon the spreaders of those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, those very men so censured in open Parliament, as <hi>Mountague, Cozens, Manwaring,</hi> and <hi>Sibthorpe,</hi> had by the procurement and solicitation of <hi>Nele Bishop</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dorset</hi> obtained their pardons under the great Seal, and were not only sheltered under the Lee of Royal favour, but through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> advanced to great preferment, whilest the Orthodox party were depressed, and under inglorious disdain, and the truth they served, was scarce able to protect them to impunity.</p>
            <p>The hazard conceived from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the fear lest <hi>Tibur</hi> should drown the <hi>Thames,</hi> floweth from partly the uncontrolled preaching of several points tending and warping that way, by <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague, Goodman, Cozens</hi> and others; and from the audacious obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of divers superstitious ceremonies by the Prelates, as erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fixed <hi>Altars,</hi> the dopping and cringing towards them, standing up at <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi> But these were but part-boyled Popery, but Popery oblique, the greatest danger was from Popery direct.</p>
            <p>And from this the danger appeared very great; informations came daily in of the mighty progresse and increase of it within these few years, the contest whereof was proved by these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: That (for <hi>Ireland)</hi> in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> there were lately erected thirteen houses for <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> to officiate in, more in number then the Pariochial Churches for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. For <hi>Scotland</hi> that the Papists have been of late very inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and turbulent there. For <hi>England,</hi> that in some Counties
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95383:53"/>
they are multiplyed to the product of some thousands of families, more then there were in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> her time; That of those ten who were apprehended at <hi>Clarkenwell</hi> at the Sessions 3. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> last, three of Treason, and the rest of Premunire, and direct Treason proved against three of them at the Session, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then present and testifying as much, yet by the artifice of the two chief Lord Justices, <hi>Hide,</hi> and <hi>Richardson,</hi> in suppressing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Longs</hi> evidence, nothing was done against them, save that one was condemned, and the day before Execution was reprieved, by warrant from the Chief Justice, who pretended he did it by the Kings command. Lastly, the excessive resort of <hi>Romish</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to Masse at <hi>Somerset house,</hi> being so frequent, yet so connived at, and the penalty of Statutes through his Majesties overmuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence so dispensed with, little differing from a Toleration.</p>
            <p>The Committee appointed for inspection into Civil affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, That upon search they finde the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> printed <note place="margin">Abuses in the Civil State.</note> with the <hi>Kings</hi> first Answer, which gave the Parliament no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, for which the printer being questioned he confessed upon examination, that during the first Session of this Parliament one thousand five hundred copies were printed authentique, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that <hi>addition,</hi> and that since that Session he had order from the <hi>Atturney</hi> General to reprint it with that addition. That many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have had their goods seised, and informations preferr'd against them in the Starchamber, for refusing to pay the customes of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage;</hi> Impositions against the tenor of the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and against the priviledge of Parliament, one of these Merchants, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rolles</hi> being a Member of the House of Commons: for which misdemeanours Sir <hi>Iohn Worsham,</hi> the Patentee of the Customes, Mr. <hi>Dawes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with him, were called to account. The King finding these men under the lash, steps in to bear off or to bear the blows; tels the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that what they did was but as men addicted to his command, nor did he Commission them to take it as of right <note place="margin">A great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the King and Parliament.</note> belonging to him, but out of a firm presumption that the House of Commons, sutable to their large professions, would grant i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him by Bill; which he now exceedingly desired they would dispatch, and so put an end to this dispute.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Parliament</hi> replyed, that the Customers had no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from his Majesty for all they did, as he did mis-understand, for they have diligently read his Majesties Warrant to the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and it only impowereth them to levy and collect the monies, but not to seise the Merchants goods, and are censurable for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagants from their Commission. And as to the passing the Bill, they craved his <hi>Majesties</hi> pardon for a while, both because they were at present intent upon matters of Religion, and they hoped he would not be offended if they served <hi>God</hi> in the first place, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95383:54"/>
also because at present, his <hi>Majesty</hi> had put them out of capacity to doe it; for in his Warrant, formerly mentioned, <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> are declared to be <hi>a Principal revenue of his Crown;</hi> if so, he had no cause to demand, nor they to grant what was his own already; therefore unlesse that expression may be rectified, or cancell'd the Record, and his <hi>Majesty</hi> will be content that the Bill may expressely and positively set forth his no right to it, but by the gift of his subject, they cannot rational grant it. The <hi>King</hi> perceiving their intention still was to sever the Customers act from his command, thereby to make them the more exposed to censure for Delinquency, and judging it highly concerned his honour to indemnifie them, iterated his desires again to them in a message sent by Secretary <hi>Coke,</hi> that they would desist from further mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting these men, intimating withall that what they did was by his especial direction; the House in much distaste at this message in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly cry'd <hi>Adjourn, Adjourn,</hi> and so they did, until the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> following, on which day the <hi>King</hi> also by the advice of his Privy Councel <hi>Adjourned</hi> them until the 2. of <hi>March:</hi> hoping thereby that giving them the more time to cool of themselves, it would soften their temper. But having certain intelligence from his correspondents in the lower <hi>House,</hi> that the heat did rather intend then relax, he resolved to <hi>Adjourn</hi> again untill the 10. of <hi>March.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And again.</note> But the House being met on the 2. of <hi>March,</hi> up riseth Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot</hi> in the morning, and makes a tart and stinging speech against the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> fixing all the ills both of Church and State upon him, and in particular charging him with a design of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the <hi>English</hi> trade to Forianers. What he then delivered was in part prognosticated by the <hi>King,</hi> who knew it even an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, and in the first conception; for it rarely happens, that what many know, none will discover, be it a secret of never so great importance, especially where men are, as these were, of a free and open spirit. Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> invective being ended, the Speaker decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a message from the King commanding an <hi>Adjournment</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the 10. of that instant, wherewith the House being discontented told him, it was not within the verge of his Office to deliver such a Message, that <hi>Adjournment</hi> properly belonged to themselves, and that in time convenient they would satisfie the <hi>Kings</hi> pleasure: then again upriseth Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> with a <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which he presented to the reading, but both the Speaker and Clerk refused it, and being restored to him he read it himself, the substance being to this effect.</p>
            <p>That they had taken into consideration the forming of a Bill for <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> but were so overlaid with the pressures of other businesse, and found that affair it self a matter so perplext with several difficulties, which would require much leisure to discharge, that at that time accomplish it they could not, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

Session moving (as they conjectured) apace to determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And lest his <hi>Majesty</hi> should hereafter (as formerly he did) incline to the advice of servile spirits, or be abused into a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that he might legally and justly receive those subsidies of <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> they humbly declare to him, that the laying any such Imposition upon the Subject is contrary to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental law of the Kingdome, and to his Majesties late Answer to the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi> And therefore they lowly crave his Majesty would for the future forbear such taxes, and not to take ill the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of his people, to what is demanded by Arbitrary and unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table power.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Remonstrance</hi> being read, the Speaker was moved to put it to the vote, whether it should be presented to the <hi>King,</hi> yea, or nay. But he craved pardon, alleadging that the <hi>King</hi> expresly ordered him to leave the House, and attempting to rise from his chair, he was by force and strong hand stayed, (Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (so my information hath it) a deep Oath, that he should sit still as long as they pleased; and when neither threats nor reproaches could prevail, Sir <hi>Peter Hayman</hi> moved Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> to read these ensuing Articles as the Protestation of the House.</p>

            <p>These distempers continued so long, and with so quick and high a pulse, as the King had early notice of them, who forthwith sent for the Serjant of the Mace, but the House would not permit him to depart, but taking the Key of the door from him, gave it to Sir <hi>Miles Hobart</hi> a Member of the House to keep.

            <p>He answered,</p>

               <hi>That he had some other times as well as then, seated himself in that place.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> reply'd, <hi>I say of his Majesties power my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot</hi> next call'd in, was questioned for words he spake in the Lower-house of Parliament, and for producing the last Remonstrance.</p>
            <p>To this he answered,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That whatsoever was said or done by him in that place, and at that time, was performed by him as a publick man, and a member of that House, and that he was, and ever will be ready to give an account of his sayings and doings in that place whensoever he should be called unto it by that House, where (as he taketh it) he is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95383:56"/>
only to be questioned, and in the mean time being now but a private man he would not now trouble himself to remember what he said or did in that place as a publick man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Miles Hobart</hi> was also questioned for locking the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment House door, and putting the key in his pocket: to which he pleaded the command of the House.</p>
            <p>The other Gentlemen were questioned for reproving the Speaker, and not permitting him to do what the <hi>King</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, who all alledged in their defence the <hi>Privilege of the House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this they were committed, some to the <hi>Tower,</hi> some to the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> and some to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and <hi>May</hi> the 1. the <hi>Atturney</hi> sent a processe out against them to appear in the <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,</hi> and to answer an information to be entred there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: but they refused; as denying the Jurisdiction of that Court over offences done in <hi>Parliament:</hi> which created the greatest and longest controversie in Law that had been started of many years.</p>
            <p>About the later end of <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Marquesse Huntly</hi> (with <note place="margin">Stirs in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about the Marquesse <hi>Huntly.</hi>

            <p>The Marquesse was hereditary Sheriff of a great part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where his Lands lay. At <hi>Aberden,</hi> the Papists posted up a treacherous libel: not long after which, the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuites</hi> said Masse openly. This coming to the Councels hearing, they wrote to the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> as high Sheriffe, to cause with all speed those <hi>Priests</hi> and their abertors to be apprehended, and safely sent to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> yet not prescribing any certain day. The <hi>Marquesse</hi> took the Letters, neglected the service, and gave no account to the Councel: whereupon they wrote a second letter, commanding him that the service be done by a precise day, and that himself appear also before them to answer the contempt. Notwithstanding all this, the <hi>Marquesse</hi> still neglected, and in stead of apprehending them, gave them notice to escape; but sent in the interim to the Councel, craving a longer day. The Councel would not grant it, but instantly caused the <hi>Herald</hi> in his coat of <hi>Armes</hi> to wind the <hi>Horn</hi> thrice, and at every time to summon the <hi>Marquesse</hi> and the <hi>Earls.</hi> None of which appearing, the <hi>Herald</hi> proclaimed them Rebels to the King and Kingdome. And while the Councel was plotting to apprehend them, they took their flight for <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>The next moneth returned Sir <hi>Henry Fane</hi> from the <hi>Hague,</hi> his errand thither was to make a tender to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from

And ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I would suffer my childe to be bred in Idolatry, I would cut his throat with mine own hand.</hi> So erect a minde had she in her lowest state.</p>
            <p>This Spring the <hi>Queen</hi> (some say frighted with some boysteroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a mastiff towards her little dogs in the Presence chamber) not compleating her proper time of gestation:, aborted of a son; yet having life in him, her Priests were wondrous earnest to baptize him, but the King stepping in prevented them, and charged Dr. <hi>Web</hi> to officiate, and name him <hi>Charles,</hi> he lived about an hour, and then expired.</p>
            <p>About the same time also, the <hi>Seigniory</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> by her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours <note place="margin">Peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. That considering it is very difficult to make restitution of what hath been taken as prize, as well on one side as the other, during the late wars; it is agreed between the two Crowns, that for what is past no satisfaction shall be demanded on either side.</p>

6. The promises being established on both sides, Persons of eminency shall be reciprocally dispatcht as <hi>Ambassadours</hi> on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part for ratification of the accord, and for nomination of Agents ordinarily resident at either Court, for the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving this union.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And because many ships are now at Sea, with letters of Marque, who cannot suddenly take cognizance of this Peace, it is agreed that what shall occur in the nature of hostility for the space of two months on either side, shall not prejudice nor dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from this agreement. Provided notwithstanding, that what shall be made prize of within that space of two months after signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shall be restored on either side.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Lastly, the two <hi>Kings</hi> shall respectively sign the present <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> the 14 of this present month of <hi>April,</hi> and at the same time they shall be consigned into the hands of the Lords <hi>Ambassadours</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> to deliver reciprocally to the two <hi>Kings</hi> at a day prefixt. And from the day of signing all acts of hostility shall cease, to which end Proclamation shall be issued out in both Kingdomes the 20. day of <hi>May.</hi>

            <p>Nothing was wanting now to the perfecting of this League, but the ultime and compleating act, the solemn confirmation by <hi>Oath.</hi> To which intent Ambassadours were sent on both sides the <hi>September</hi> following.

            <p>The King had all the reason in the world to bid peace welcome, for Martial affaires be they conducted by never so mature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or carryed on with never so gallant resolution, have yet a great dependence upon the arbitrament of Fortune; and Fortune the King had sadly felt, in the dispensation of victory ever lookt another way. Again he was sinew-shrunk, and wanted money the sinews of war, his Exchequer being profoundly dry, and one of the noblest and beneficial springs not obstructed but cut off. This his condition was observed abroad as well as at home; and by his enemies as well as friends, and his felicity it was that those enemies which observed it were in no capacity to make any other advantage of it then overtures of peace. And this was now <note place="margin">Overtures of a Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> the grand ambition of that ambitious <hi>Monarch,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was by many late considerable misfortunes brought ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously (I had almost said pitifully) low.

Pasquin</hi> demands the reason; Because, said <hi>Marforius, he had lately taken three vows upon him, One of Poverty, ever since the</hi> Hollanders <hi>took the</hi> West-India <hi>Fleet. The other of Obedience, since the</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To solicite this Peace, <hi>Peter Reuben</hi> the famous rich Painter of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> Secretary and Gentleman of the Chamber to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duchesse, <note place="margin">Peter Reuhen <hi>the</hi> Spanish <hi>Agent.</hi>

               <hi>Bishops gate,</hi> very jocund he was at supper, especially rejoycing that the day before, being his Birth day, he had attained the age of fifty years, hoping now he should reach his Fathers account, who lived till sixty four, and to see many happy days. After supper he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Baynards</hi> Castle his house, where he sate up till midnight, and was very well: but after he had been a while in bed (his <hi>Lady</hi> by him) he fetcht a most profound groan, whereat she not being able to wake him, shrieked out for Company, who coming in, found him speechlesse, in which condition he remained till 8. next morning, and then dyed. It was said that Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> a Mathematician at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> had calculated his Nativity many years before, and could not give any hopes of his life beyond his 50. year. He dyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate, and left of debts to pay eighty thousand pounds. He was scarce cold before the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arundel</hi> begg'd the custody of his <hi>Countesse,</hi> upon pretence that she was not <hi>mentis compos,</hi> and crackt in her brain; and because his son the Lord <hi>Maltravers</hi> was her next heir in right of his mother, sister and coheir with her and the <hi>Countesse</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> all three being the inheretrices of the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>'s Estate. But her affection stood more enclined to her Brother the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> and therefore the King granted him the disposition of her.</p>
            <p>He was the very picture and vive effigies of Nobility; His <note place="margin">His Character.</note> person rather Majestique, then elegant; his presence whether quiet, or in motion, full of stately gravity; his minde generous and purely heroique, often stout, but never disloyal; so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an opponent of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as when that <hi>Match</hi> fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confideration, he would sometimes rouze to the trepidation of King <hi>Iames,</hi> yet kept in favour still; for that <hi>King</hi> knew plain dealing as a jewel in all men, so was in a Privy Counseller an Ornamental duty; and the same true heartednesse commended him to King <hi>Charles,</hi> with whom he kept a most admirable correspondence, and yet stood the firm Confident of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, and not by a sneaking cunning, but by an erect and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous prudence, such as rendred him unsuspected of ambition on the one side, as of faction on the other. This universality of affection made his losse most deplorable. But men are lost when all turns to forgotten dust. That affection would not that he should be non-plust so, but kept his Noble fame emergent and aloft: and if this History shall help to bear it up, I shall think it not more his felicity then mine own.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That nothing did affect his Master the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> Great Britain <hi>more, then the consideration of the daily calamities undergone by his Brother the Prince</hi> Elector, <hi>his Wife and Children; that he deemed no place more expedient where to treat of their reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and re-establishment then in this</hi> Diet; <hi>therefore he made it his most ardent request to his</hi> Imperial Majesty, <hi>that having regard to the many intercessions of his late Father, and other Kings and Princes, he would remit the displeasure conceived against his</hi> Brother, <hi>and recal the proscription issued out against him. True it is, his</hi> Brother <hi>had offended, and was inexcusably guilty, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the rashnesse and precipitation of youth may somewhat plead for him): but others had been as culpable as he, whom yet his</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majesty <hi>received into grace and favour, and would he be pleased to extend to him the same clemency, it would oblige his Master to dimonstrations of deepest gratitude, and raise a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous emulation in others to imitate so Majestique a pattern. That the</hi> Paltzgrave <hi>would eutertain this favour with an heart so firmly devoted to his service, as all the intention of his Spirit should be disposed to compensation and reparation of his by-past miscarriages: That his</hi> Master <hi>held nothing so dear, as the affection of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majesty, and establishment of a durable peace between them. And as upon all occasions he hath been forward to represent himself solicitous of it, so at this time he is ready to give more ample Testimony, if his</hi> Imperial Majesty <hi>be pleased to incline to a Treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Estates</hi> gave Sir <hi>Robert</hi> fair respect, but as to his message returned answer, that the present affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> which called them thither, were of that important concernment, as they would not admit of any forain debate; but when leisure served, the <hi>King</hi> his Master should have such satisfaction as would be agreeable to their honour, and they hoped to his content.

But it was a Peace, and though not in all points fully adequate to the Kings content, yet readily embraced because he was not then in state to better it.

            <p>On <hi>Sunday, November</hi> the 27. it was by the hole Colledge of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds</hi> mounted on horseback, in their rich Surcoats, proclaimed both at <hi>White-hall</hi> Gate, and in <hi>Pauls</hi> Churchyard, and at <hi>Cheapside</hi> Crosse, the Lord <hi>Maior</hi> with his confraternity of <hi>Aldermen</hi> also mounted, and in their Scarlets.

After this they all went up to the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting house, where a most princely and sumptuous dinner was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them.</p>
            <p>But the Subject paid the reckning. For his Majesty being stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with want and disgusting Parliaments was enforced to call in the aid of his Prerogative.</p>
            <p>There was, it seems, an old skulking statute long since out of <note place="margin">The Tax of Knighthood.</note> use, though not out of force, which enjoyned all subjects, who had not some special priviledge, to appear at the Coronation of every <hi>King, ad arma gerenda, to bear armes</hi> (not to be made

Knights, as was vulgarly supposed) that is, to present themselves before the <hi>Lord High Chamberlain,</hi> who (if the Kings service so required) was to deliver to every man a <hi>Belt</hi> and <hi>Sur-coat</hi> out of the <hi>Kings</hi> Wardrobe; and if, upon four daies attendance, they were not imployed, they might depart to their severall homes. But they who were guilty of default and made no appearance, were to submit to fine.

            <p>This peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> begat a war in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> I mean between the <note place="margin">The Jesuites and secular Priests at odds.</note>

            <p>The Papacy having in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> her emissaries for the planting of a Gospel which <hi>Christ</hi> nor his <hi>Apostles</hi> never dreamt of, expedient it was thought both for the ordaining of Priests, and confirmation of persons baptized, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> should be sent amongst them; to which purpose Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15 delegated one <hi>William Bishop,</hi> entituled the Bishop of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon. Anno 1624 Bishop</hi> died, after him succeeded by mission from <hi>Urban</hi> the 8, <hi>anno 1625, Richard Smith</hi> with the same title; <hi>Smith</hi> was a busie fellow, and took upon him more then <hi>Bishop,</hi> for he arrogated to himself the approbation of such regular <hi>Priests</hi> as were to be standing <hi>Confessors;</hi> which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> thought an usurpation upon their Jurisdiction, whereupon a conspiracy is entred to dispatch him hence, a Declaration is contrived under the name of the most <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>eminent Catholiques</hi> against his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded authority, withall asserting all sufficient power in the <hi>Regulars</hi> to all those intents, and the no necessity of having any Bishop at all. This Declaration in the nick of his departure hence, for <hi>Spain,</hi> to prevent more satisfactory informations, was offered to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Ambassador <hi>Don Carlos de Coloma.</hi> And the Bishop so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> as finding himself in no capacity of standing an open contest by reason of his skulking condition, caused through the <hi>Kings</hi> Proclamation against him, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to seek his safety abroad, and escaped into <hi>France.

            <p>Nor was this bickering the only product of our peace, but the Romish Catholiques began to rant it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their fancies called Religion so publiquely, as if they had gained a Toleration. For whilest the <hi>Lords Iustices</hi> were at Church in <hi>Dublin,</hi> they were celebrating Masse, which the <hi>Lords Iustices</hi> taking notice of, they sent the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the <hi>Maior, Sheriffes,</hi> and <hi>Recorder</hi> of the town to apprehend them; which they did, taking away the Crucifixes, Chalices, and Paraments of the <hi>Altar,</hi> the Souldiers hewing down the Image of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> The <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> were delivered into the hands of the Pursevants, at whom the people threw stones and rescued them.

The first encounter was sharp, and cost the <hi>King</hi> above a thousand men; whereat the <hi>King</hi> fired with gallant courage, came undauntedly up to the Count, and gave him so terrible a shock, as made his Vantguard to brandle, disordered both Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail and Rere, routed all the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, slew Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand on the place, took Sixteen Pieces of Ordinance, Thirty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, Thirty two Cornets of Horse; and immediately stormed the Town and carryed it.</p>
            <p>For the incouragement of the Marquesse in this expedition, the <hi>King</hi> gave him the impost upon the Wines in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which would amount to Twenty thousand pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> and as a great part of their maintenance was to be derived from <hi>Scotland,</hi> so were the Auxiliaries themselves to consist for the most part of that Nation.

These two <hi>Captains</hi> having notice which way the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> were to passe, way-laid them in a wood with a Troop of Horse, and having met them, bad them <hi>stand;</hi> that done, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to prepare for death, for dye they must: the <hi>Hollanders</hi> replyed, <hi>they hoped not so, for all their money was at their dispose.</hi> We seek not your money, said the two <hi>Captains,</hi> but your lives, and will now be revenged for those barbarous torments three of this your company put our Countrey-men and allies to at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boina;</hi> and had we leisure, we would serve you so too. First, they hung up <hi>Iohnson</hi> the chief of the <hi>Amboinists,</hi> and made the other seventeen cast the dice which of them should escape to carry intelligence into <hi>Holland.</hi> The fifteen guiltlesse persons thought this hard measure, and hoped they would not punish them for others faults: but the Gentlemen pleaded, <hi>legem talionis,</hi> and that they might as well hang them, as their Countreymen were but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chered at <hi>Amboyna</hi> without cause. So without further endictment they hang'd up sixteen, and sent the odde man home.

            <p>About 18. years since the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> was separated (by a most just sentence of <hi>Nullity</hi> executed by Commission under the great Seal of <hi>England)</hi> from the Lady <hi>Frances Howard.</hi> True it is, that <hi>Countesse</hi> was of a very lewd report, and full of fire, as the Earl of ice, nor will I undertake to vindicate from indirect and unjustifiable practises, the scrutiny of her Virginity. But judgement must proceed according to the tenor of allegations and proofs, and as the Jurv of Midwifes declared her to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched Virgin, so did the <hi>Earl</hi> himself confesse that (though he had often attempted it) <hi>he never could,</hi> and <hi>beleeved never should carnally know her.</hi> Whereupon the Commissioners pronounced a Divorce between them. Upon this definitive sentence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, a late compiler of <hi>Great Britains</hi> History, abetting popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar error, hath cast some odious glances, not knowing that <hi>Geneva</hi> her self had done the like before in the case of the <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> and others.

            <p>I am now entred upon the year 1631. remarkable for the trial <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Audley</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned.</note> of <hi>Mervin</hi> Lord <hi>Audley, Earl</hi> of <hi>Castle-haven,</hi> which I could for the honor of Christianity, for the honor of Nobility, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of our Nation, yea for the honor of our Nature, even man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood it self, that the story of so much filth might be swept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the channel of Oblivion. But offences so prodigiously high, as his, we may not so stride over; contract they doe a penality too vital for one <hi>Scaffold</hi> to determine, <hi>History</hi> must erect another for him, wherein he may ever suffer in what is extant of him, his posthume Fame, the souls most considerable relict on earth, in whose Proxy she is happy or miserable to all posterity.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Earl</hi> marryed to his second wife, the daughter of the old Countesse of <hi>Derby,</hi> and widow of the Lord <hi>Shandos,</hi> by whom she had a daughter marryed to the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> the <hi>Earls</hi> son. He was committed in <hi>December</hi> last, upon an accusation of such a racemation and cluster of abominations, as were never heard of before. First, for causing one <hi>Skipwith</hi> his <hi>Ganymede,</hi> (son to a maker of Usque bath in <hi>Ireland)</hi> and advanced by the <hi>Earls</hi> villany, (for it were a shame to call it bounty) to an estate of near a thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> to ravish the <hi>Countesse,</hi> himself as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting: next, for procuring the same <hi>Skipwith</hi> and others to cuckold his son, by lying with his Lady in the presence of the <hi>Earl.</hi> Lastly, for acting <hi>Sodomy</hi> both upon <hi>Skipwith</hi> and others. After all these hellish deeds, some Lords expostulating with him in prison his motives to them, with an impudence sutable to his lewdnesse, he told them: <hi>As others had their several delights, some in one thing, some in another, so his hole delight was in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning souls, by enticing men to such acts as might surely effect it:</hi> For these offences he was endited at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and there found guilty by the Grand Enquest, whereupon he was transmitted to the <hi>Kings-bench-Bar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Arraignment</hi> there was <hi>April</hi> the 25. of this present year. <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> (being for that day constituted <hi>Lord High Steward of England)</hi> brought the Commission into the Court, where after an <hi>O yes</hi> made by the Serjant at Arms, he gave it to Sir <hi>Thomas Fanshaw</hi> Clerk of the <hi>Crown</hi> to read, who read it, and then the huisher of the <hi>Black rod</hi> kneeling down to the Lord <hi>High Steward,</hi> presented him with a white rod, the staffe of his Office. His seat was a chair of State, and underneath him sate the Peers, in number twenty six, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> the Lord <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Arundel, Pembroke, Kent, Worcester, Bedford, Essex, Dorset, Salisbury, Leicester, Warwick, Carlile, Holland,

Barkshire, Denbigh;</hi> the <hi>Vicounts, Wimbleton, Conway, Dorchester, Wentworth;</hi> the <hi>Barons, Percy, Strange, Clifford, Peters, North, Goring.</hi> And beneath the Nobility sate the <hi>Iudges</hi> assistants. The Commission read, and Oyes made, the Lord <hi>High Steward</hi> gave leave to the Peers to be covered, and then they were called over by their names, to which every one gave a particular answer. Then the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the Tower brought the Prisoner forth to the Bar, to whom the Lord <hi>High Steward</hi> declared the cause of his being brought thither. His endictment was read by Sir <hi>Thomas Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw,</hi> who asked him whether he were guilty, or not guilty. The Lord <hi>Audley</hi> replyed, <hi>Not guilty.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> then demanded, <hi>How wilt thou be try'd?</hi> the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> reply'd, <hi>By God and my Peers.</hi> Then the Lord <hi>High Steward,</hi> addressing himself to the Peers, said;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prisoner is endicted of Rape and Sodomy, to which he hath pleaded not guilty; My duty it is to charge you with the Tryal of him, yours to judge. The cause may move in some pity, in others detestation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which ought to be put in the scale, for a grain on either side may sway the Ballance. But Reason must rule your affections, and your heads, your hearts. You are to give attentive heed, and weigh equally, that the scale may incline the right way. The Iudges will assist you in points of Law, whereof if doubts arise, you are to propound them to me, and I to them: Thus your Lordships are to proceed without Corporal Oath, for the Law supposeth you of such integrity, as you will doe that for Iustice, that others are compelled to by their Oathes. And so God direct you in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Lord <hi>High Steward</hi> had ended, the Atturney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral spake vehemently in aggravation of the crimes whereof the Prisoner was impeacht; then the witnesses were produced, and the Evidence upon Examination was found summarily this;</p>
            <p>That the first or second night after marriage, the Lord and Lady being in bed together, he told her, <hi>That her body now was his, and that if she lay with any by his consent,</hi> the fault would be his, not hers. That <hi>Broadway</hi> by his command forcibly lay with her, whilest the <hi>Lord</hi> assisted him in holding her. This was proved by the testimony of the Lady her self the Defendant, and <hi>Broadway</hi> the assailant. The <hi>Sodomy</hi> was proved by <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> and <hi>Fits Patrick</hi> on whom it was acted. These were the main and capital offences; of lesse hainous nature in the eye of the Law,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95383:63"/>
was his oft perswading <hi>Shipnith</hi> to act villany with the young <hi>Lady,</hi> whom he kept so short of maintenance, as she had no means but what <hi>Shipnith</hi> gave her, and that during <hi>Shipniths</hi> lewdnesse with her, he called up divers servants to behold them, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self much delighting therein. This was proved by the testimony of the young <hi>Lady</hi> herself, <hi>Shipnith,</hi> and four or five more.</p>
            <p>To these the <hi>Earl</hi> pleaded, that his wife had been bad before, and so no competent witnesse against him. Then the Lord <hi>High Steward</hi> asked the Judges whether one may ravish a woman of ill fame? Who reply'd, An Whore may be ravisht, and it is fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony to doe it.</p>
            <p>Then the Lords withdrew to consider of the evidence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Found guilty,</note> returned, the Lord <hi>High Steward</hi> demanded their several suffrages, who all, one by one pronounced him guilty of the <hi>Rape,</hi> and fifteen of <hi>Sodomy:</hi> which verdict being brought in, the Lord <hi>High Steward</hi> delivered sentence of death against him in these words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as much as thou</hi> Mervin <hi>Lord</hi> Audley; <hi>hast</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 
               <hi>been endicted of divers felonious crimes, for which thou didst desire to be try'd by God and thy Peers, which Tryal thou hast had, and they have found the guilty of them: Thy sentence is therefore, that thou return from hence to the place from whence thou camest, and from thence to the place of Execution, and there to hang by the neck till thou be dead. And the Lord have mercy on thy soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This doom being past upon him, the Court arose, and the <note place="margin">His execution.</note> 
               <hi>Lord</hi> was remanded to the Tower, where he continued close prisoner till <hi>May</hi> 14. being the day of his Execution, when being brought to <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> he ascended the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> (waited on by his two Chaplains, Dr. <hi>Winiff</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wickham)</hi> and made a short Cenfession, declaring himself many ways wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, but solemnly protesting his innocency in those two faults whereof he stood condemned. His confession ended, he resorted to his prayers, after which bidding farewell to all the Spectators, and forgiving the Executioner, he yeilded his head to decussation, to the striking off, which was performed dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously, and at one blow.</p>
            <p>One thing I offer as observable, and from mine autopsie, my self beholding, that having preserved his countenance all the while before in one constant tenor, he no sooner did addresse himself for the stroke of death, but his hands and face were in a moment overshadowed with such a swarthy metamorphosis,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95383:64"/>
as neer resembled smoke-dryed Bacon. The like befell (as I was credibly informed) to one of noble eminency, whom Justice pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued to the like end, for a different offence, during these civil wars, as shall (God willing) take place in the sequel of this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Thus dyed this titular piece of Nobility, like a bad Actor hist off the stage, of few lamented, for of few beloved.</p>
            <p>Now we have done with the Malefactor, we will next arraign <note place="margin">A remarque upon his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> the Fact it self, I mean that transcendent one the <hi>Rape;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so horrid and hideous a quality. For, whereas all other sins are the dictates of sensual pleasure or profit, and have their seminalities within the bed of natural corruption, this was a sin which even depraved nature would not own, as having no incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to it, a sin whereunto the Devill himself seemed not acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, a sin without temptation, a <hi>Rape</hi> without concupiscence, an abomination whose every grison and step should we climbe, we shall not be able in the hole Repertory of Fame to finde its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. Some have made rude sallies upon female chastity, but it hath been to sate and allay the boiling extimulations of their own, rarely of others lusts. Possibly some, with whom to serve hath been to subsist, have been adjutants to their Masters in actions of like detestation, but who ever heard the practise counterchanged, or a Master voluntarily to officiate to his servant in a deed so execrable? Had it been acted upon a stranger it had been bad sufficiently, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an acquaintance much worse, upon an ally worse still, (as super-inducting <hi>Incest</hi> with <hi>Rape)</hi> but to perpetrate it upon her, whom the sacred ties of Wedlock had consigned up to him in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est notion of dearnesse, for a man to commit a <hi>Rape</hi> upon himself, (for so she was in truth) certainly there never was a sin of so odde and impartial a genius. Nor did the person on whom it was acted render the impiety more odious, then the mode and way of doing it: for whereas nature it self, in acts of such uncleannesse, (even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween married couples, who have the highest dispensations) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth insolation and open view, this villany was acted as upon a common Theater, as if all the delight had been in the Spectacle, and all the pleasure in the Ostentation. So that in short (all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances spell'd together) I may safely say it was a sin without Precedent of former ages, and which I hope posterity will never co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py out.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:95383:64"/>
               <hi>Fitz Patrick</hi> in his last speech at the Gallowes reflected inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively upon the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> as the beguiler of him into his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; because, upon his examination before the Lords, the Earl promised in the name of the whole board, that whatsoever he gave in evidence against his <hi>Lord,</hi> should no waies prejudice himself, which moved him to declare his <hi>Lord</hi> guilty of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and that the testimony he then gave against his <hi>Lord,</hi> was now the main cause of his own condemnation. As to the matter of fact for which the Lord suffered, he much lamented his <hi>Lord</hi> should dye in protestation of his innocence, for he professed the <hi>Lord</hi> was guilty of both those crimes for which he dyed. Much time he spent in addresses to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the Saints, and ended his life in the <hi>Romish</hi> perswasion.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Broadwaies</hi> confession was very ingenuous, Christian, and sincere; much blame he laid upon the <hi>Countesse</hi> as a woman of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous conversation, and much upon himself for his dissolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for which in the most significant gestures of contrition he craved pardon from God, and dyed in much assurance of it.</p>
            <p>In the same moneth of <hi>May</hi> wherein this Monster-Lord was <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Giles Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</note> sentenced, Sir <hi>Giles Allington</hi> fell also under censure for a sin of grand, though under-graduate abomination. This Knight (in other things a Gentleman of much honour) had against the advice of the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> and other venerable Divines, marryed his own Neece, the daughter of Mr. <hi>Dalton,</hi> for which incestuous match he was questioned in the <hi>High Commission,</hi> with whom he tugg'd hard, and being a man of great estate, resolved he was to spare no cost which might be serviceable to quit him. First, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates pleaded it was not within the Levitical interdict, where the marriage of the Nephew with the Aunt is forbidden, but not of the Unkle with the Neece; and when the same parity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was urged, <hi>Bellarmines No</hi> was produced, because, saith he, <hi>The first everteth the natural subjection due from a Nephew to his Aunt, who must be his underling by the duty of a wife; whereas if a Neece doth marry her Uncle the natural subjection is rather doubled, then destroyed.</hi> But these arguments were rather dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pastimes, then just evasions. Sir <hi>Giles</hi> his best refuge was to the Common Pleas, from whence he obtained two Rules; one, requiring the <hi>High Commissioners</hi> to shew cause why a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition should not be granted. The other intimating, that if in the interim they proceed further, a Prohibition should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which so incensed the <hi>High Commissioners,</hi> as they sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to acquaint the <hi>King</hi> therewith, who gave present order to the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> to let the Judges know he did much distast such proceedings, whereupon the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> desisted from further interruption; and it was well they did, for the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> grew so high in passion, as he said <hi>he would move the Lord of</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:95383:65"/>
Canterbury <hi>to excommunicate all the Iudges within his Province who should dare to act in such a Prohibition, and in case the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop would not, he was resolved to do it in his Diocese, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it himself in St.</hi> Pauls <hi>and other Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Giles</hi> thus stript of all Common Law protection, became the full But to receive the keen arrowes of a provoked Court, eight <hi>Bishops,</hi> and four other Commissioners were his Judges, and his sentence; <hi>Fine to the King Twelve thousand pounds to stand obliged in the penalty of Twenty thousand pounds never to co-habit or to come into private company with his Neece any more: to be committed to prison, or put in sufficient bail till both he and his Neece or Lady shall have done penance at</hi> Pauls <hi>Crosse, and at Great St.</hi> Maries <hi>in</hi> Cambridge <hi>at a day enjoyned by the Court.</hi> Never was Delinquent censured there by a more solemn and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Consistory.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> thoughts were most abroad; and imployment those thoughts could not want, whilest his brother the <hi>Palizgrave</hi> wanted his patrimony; and though he was almost at the point of desperation, as to prevailing with the <hi>Emperour</hi> by precarious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, yet did he resolve once more to re-enforce his former instances: to which effect he dispatht Sir <hi>Robert Anstruther</hi> again as Ambassador to him. But the <hi>Emperour</hi> being not high enough to deny, nor low enough to grant, kept his old posture of procrastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereof our King having advice from his Ambassador, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding patiently to wait untill new emergences should occasion new counsels, gave him order still to attend and pursue his former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, untill he should receive others.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Gustavus King</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the way of whose conquest nothing could stand, with a victorious sword made a furious inrode into <hi>Germany;</hi> the restauration of whose li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties he made the design of that hostile incursion.

Christi 1632.</note> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> (whether because he had prospered to an autocracy a self-subsistence, and so needed no participants either in the hazard, or glory of the archievement; or upon what other account, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) neither entertained, nor imployed the <hi>Scots</hi> with that respect as was expected, most of them never encountring any enemy but those two fierce ones, <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Famine.</hi> Again, he set at first so high a rate upon what was sued for, as rendred it not worth accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon such harsh tearms: For he demanded from the Prince,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That he should enter Recognizance, of holding his Countrey</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>as a Donative of that</hi> King, <hi>and consequently should repute himself as his Beneficiary and Vassal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That he should make no Martial Levies without his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>liking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That he should, during those Wars, furnish him with so many thousands upon his own pay; more indeed then his desolate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>could maintain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That two of his Head Towns should be left to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4.</note> 
               <hi>King as Cautionaries for performing of Covenants, which should be made presidiary and Garisons to be maintained by the contribution of the Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>That he should make no League nor Article with any other Prince, his consent not first had.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>These proposals were lookt upon by the Prince, rather as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions tendred by a Conqueror to a vanquisht Foe, then acts of Grace to a distressed friend, nor did they answer that ambitious title of the <hi>LIBERATOR</hi> and <hi>DELIVERER</hi> of <hi>GER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANY,</hi> to which that <hi>King</hi> pretended, with so intense a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palizgrave</hi> therefore loth to change his Lord only, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his old servitude, rejected these tearms as dishonorable, which being also resented as such by the Agents of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces,</hi> and so represented to the <hi>King,</hi> he condescended to others of a more lenitive temper. But Heaven was no party <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> slain at <hi>Luizen.</hi>
               </note> to those transactions, for when all things were even upon the point of signing, the supreme Disposer of all things signed a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal countermand, giving a sudden stop to that brave <hi>Heroe</hi> in the full carreer of all his triumphs, by a death, natural to him as a Souldier, though violent as a Man: This dysaster happened at that memorable battel at <hi>Lutzen, Novemb.</hi> 6. where the <hi>King</hi> being too adventurously engaged in the thickest of his Troops, was slain by an hand, yea by a party, (whether his own or the enemies) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. But that blow was not more fatal to himself, then to his adversaries, for no sooner did the noyse of the fall overspread his Army, but they redoubled their Martial fury, and consequently their blows, hewing down their stiffe opponents with so gallant
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95383:66"/>
courage, as they went off Victors with a vengeance, leaving dead on the place six thousand men.</p>
            <p>This was the end of that renowned <hi>King,</hi> for sprightly metal the <hi>Caesar,</hi> for successe the <hi>Alexander</hi> of this Age, to whom we may apply what the Historian said of that <hi>Macedonian</hi> Prince. <note place="margin">Eo clarior quod adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scens in incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento rerum nondum alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam expertus decessit. <hi>Liv. 8. c 77.

               <hi>He was the more famous, because he was cut off in his youth, and in the growth of his prosperity, before fortune had ever forsaken him, or shewed him her averse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gustavus</hi> being thus taken away, the Prince <hi>Elector</hi> his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipant in his best Fortune would needs also be concomitant in his worst, and was at the same time I may say (not improperly) slain, he receiving his deaths wound thence, though not there. He had some few days before taken the infection at <hi>Mentz,</hi> being newly returned from visiting his Ally the Duke of <hi>Deux-Ponts;</hi> and was in an hopeful way of recovery, when news was brought him of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Swedens</hi> death, which he re-sented with so intense a passion, as he dyed the 29. of the same moneth. Nor could the restitution of <hi>Franckendal</hi> (the fairest flower of his Garland) bear up his Spirit from desponding and overwhelming with grief. For that Town having been so long, and so cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (aiming to convert that necessity into a favour, and to pick a thank from <hi>England,</hi> whose Ambassadors still ply'd his instances at the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it up into the hands of the <hi>English</hi> Officers the 21. of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, being eight days before the <hi>Prince</hi> expired, so that he lived to know himself in part restored, though sorrow had so imbittered all relish of earthly joy, as his spirit was not susceptible of any other then doleful impressions.</p>
            <p>The same year our <hi>King</hi> also dispatcht the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> to <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour into <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </note> the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> his <hi>Vncle;</hi> the most considerable design of his Embassie was to condole the late decease of his Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lady <hi>Sophia</hi> Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the dividend of a sixt part of what she left as due to him, and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in right of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> their Mother; for by the Fundamental Law of that Kingdome all children, of whatsoever sex, inherit equal shares, allotting only to the eldest a double portion. The part due to our King and his Sister amounted to an hundred and fifty thousand pounds, which that King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to satisfie assoon as monies came in, but withall intimated that he desired to re-minde his Nephew of <hi>England</hi> of what he was in arrear of the thirty thousand pounds <hi>per mensem,</hi> which was due to him from the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> upon the contract made 1625. towards the support of his Army, so that the <hi>Earl</hi> finding the intrado of his Negotiation like to come to nothing, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled, that is, after the <hi>Danish</hi> mode, made merry with that King, returned home.</p>

This year the Protestants and <hi>English</hi> Plantators in <hi>Ireland,</hi> began to grow into some discontent: The <hi>Papists,</hi> especially the <hi>Romish Clergie,</hi> encreased excessively, to neer double the number of Reformed Beleevers, and became so insolent as openly to erect <note place="margin">Discontents in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> an University in <hi>Dublin,</hi> in emulation, or rather in defiance of the Kings <hi>College</hi> there: so that they had reason to fear sad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their potency. Again, the <hi>King</hi> finding the <hi>Romish</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques in that Kingdome so numerous, so ignorant, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all so poor, he thought fit for a while to dispense with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the statute of twelve pence <hi>per</hi> Sunday for absence from the Church, especially being somewhat irritated by what was suggested to him (though untruly) that writs were issued out for levying those sines, before the quarterly contribution of five thousand pounds granted by the Countrey for maintenance of the <hi>Army</hi> was expired, which (had it been so) might have proved of dangerous consequence. This act of Grace as it elevated the pride of the Recusants, so it found amongst the Protestants a most unpleasing resentment: which was not a little ampliated by their great oppression, by an odious Papist Under-sheriff his unequal levying the last Contribution. These distempers made for, and in a manner made the Lord Vicount <hi>Wentworth;</hi> for whereas the Politique administration of that Kingdome was then entrusted to many, under the notion of Lords Justices with their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, the King was perswaded that those humors would better settle and repose under a single Governour; and if so, no man more proper, none of more dexterous prudence, none of more assured fidelity then that Lord: of whom his <hi>Majesty</hi> had full experience in his <hi>Presidence</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> which he discharged with so great wisdome, such fair integrity, as argued him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the highest promotion: so that the <hi>King</hi> agreeable to the value he had for him, not more favouring, then righting him, invested him with the sole power of that Kingdome (in subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to himself alone) under the title of Lord <hi>Deputy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> the 2. the <hi>King</hi> fell sick of the <hi>Small-Pocks,</hi> but the malignity was very remisse, and gentle, so as, by Gods blessing, he soon recovered.</p>
            <p>The same month also he sent the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arundel</hi> to the <hi>Hague</hi> to his <hi>Sister,</hi> both to comfort her, and solicite her and her childrens journey into <hi>England:</hi> but she returned answer, that she craved her Brothers excuse for that time, having no disposition to so long a journey.</p>
            <p>The same year St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church prayed reparation for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age <note place="margin">A contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Saint <hi>Pauls.</hi>

spirits) kept him short. But the good word of a great Man is worth gold, and though he was unfurnished himself, yet he commended her condition to such as were able; issuing forth a Commission to divers Lords and Gentlemen of note, willing them to exhort their adjacent neighbours to a large contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby though the summe raised by that Benevolence lookt bigge in grosse, yet did it much fail the expectation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and for his sake (it was supposed) suffered no small dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution; for many had no fancy to the work, meerly because he was the promoter of it, (so ill are even the best actions relisht of men lapsed into common disdain) nor did some forbear to cry, What needs this waste to decore a superstitious relique? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse the work went on, and her excoriated carkasse began to skin again, but with so slow a motion, as at length the distempers of the State marr'd the temper of the mortar, and made the Artists knock off abruptly, leaving that famous structure half ruin'd, half polite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the 11. there happened a terrible fire upon <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> which consumed very many houses, whereof the still extant gap and chasment is a visible demonstration.</p>
            <p>Sorely vext was Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> to see his <hi>Cathedral</hi> so tedious in trimming, especially at such a time, as he did behold under his nose, so vigorous a construction of a little City, not super-edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon an old bottom, but upstart and new-emergent from the ground.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>King</hi> having granted leave to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Bedford</hi> to edifie at pleasure upon the <hi>Convent Garden,</hi> it being of a very ample and spacious Area and Content; the <hi>Earl</hi> ply'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign with such celerity and quick dispatch, as he soon rear'd such numerous rows of stately and ambitious buildings, as made old <hi>London</hi> envy the magnificence of her Sub-urbicary sister.</p>
            <p>But some thought this gallant structure of greater state, then safety, and that this <hi>Kings</hi> Father, upon better reason of state, restrained such erections. For Cities are the great rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of People, and where there is the greatest confluence of men, there will be the greatest <hi>power.</hi> And as all power is a kinde of grievance to them who obey, so no <hi>Power</hi> is more Tyrannical then that of a <hi>City,</hi> witnesse <hi>Athens, Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> And if the excessive Grandure of <hi>Cities</hi> be intolerable in a Popular State, it is much more under a single Soveraignty. For there is nothing more adverse and opposite to Regality then a <hi>Re-publique,</hi> and as all Incorporations are in their Politique constitution ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented according to a popular Scheme, so are their Members usually principled agreeable to such intents, and onely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend untill an opinion of their formidable numbers, or some other serviceable emergency shall invite them to daring against Regal

power. A truth which may be exemplify'd in the late deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Ann. Christi 1633.</note> of this <hi>Metropolis,</hi> whose Inhabitants this <hi>King</hi> sadly found the considerable Artificers of his ruine. A caveat to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, (whether, or not, to <hi>His,</hi> I leave to him <hi>whose wayes are past finding out)</hi> not to permit them to grow to a luxuriancy disproportionable from the interest of subjection.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> you have heard before was in the 1. year of his Reign <note place="margin">The Kings progresse into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> inaugurated <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> of <hi>England</hi> I say, not of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> wherein as <hi>Scotland</hi> challenged one moity, so had she a <hi>Crown</hi> to confer as well as <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>Crown</hi> that <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thought was worth the fetching, and so did the <hi>King</hi> also, at least seemingly, having it in such an anniversary consideration as every year (since his first) the time was prefixt, and his foot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the stirrup for a <hi>Progresse</hi> thither. But some thing or other came ever travers and thwart in the very nick of time, and put him by, so that his often preparations for <hi>Scotland</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled those of <hi>Tiberius</hi> for visiting Provinces remote, (which <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> gave him the by-name of <hi>Callipedes) who was ever going, yet never went.</hi> And the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves, none of the most candid interpreters of this <hi>Kings</hi> actions, lookt upon it no otherwayes, then as a meer mockery. The truth is, the <hi>King</hi> had no great stomach to the journey. For as the place had nothing of amenity or delight, so the <hi>Nation</hi> and race of men were not fashioned to the mode of <hi>Englands</hi> civilities, but under the scheme of an honest animosity and specious plain-dealing, most perfidious. But things safe preponderate and outweigh the pleasing, and it grew high time now not to delay and super-annuate longer this expectation. He had lately requested a great Person of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to whom the custody of the <hi>Crown</hi> was entrusted, to bring it into <hi>England,</hi> that he might be crowned here, and save a tedious Journey: whereto that Lord reply'd, <hi>He durst not be so false to his trust, but if his Majesty would be pleased to accept thereof in</hi> Scotland, <hi>he should finde those his People ready to yeeld him the highest honor, but should he long defer that duty, they might perhaps be inclin'd to make choyce of another King.</hi> And a while after the Marquesse <hi>Huntly,</hi> having obtained a <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the exercise of the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That <hi>Councel</hi> stoutly told him, <hi>When his Majesty shall be pleased to come and be crowned amongst us, He will, we doubt not, be sworn to our Laws, mean while seeing he hath entrusted us with them, we will look they shall be observed:</hi> These speeches the King took as bold hints of his necessitated Progresse, so that finding that in reason of State, goe he must, resolved he was to appear there like himself, in a most Princely equipage. The suite and train of <hi>English</hi> Nobility he took along were the Earls of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Arundel, Pembroke, Southampton, Salisbury, Carlile,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95383:68"/>
Holland, Monmouth</hi> and <hi>New-castle;</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London, Lora Treasurer,</hi> Secretary <hi>Coke, Vice-chamberlain,</hi> with many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 13. thus attended he set forward from <hi>London.</hi> His gests and motions were much fore-slowed by his making so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny halts to receive the Noble treatments provided for him, by persons of <hi>Honor</hi> all along the rode; every hours repast being no lesse then a sumptuous feast. But the entertainment most of all august and Royal was that of the Earl of <hi>New-Castle</hi> at <hi>Welbeck,</hi> which was estimated to stand the <hi>Earl</hi> in at least six thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iune</hi> the 10. he came to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the 18. was designed for <note place="margin">His Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the day of his <hi>Inauguration. Great Britain</hi> never saw any thing more solemn, never a more refulgent <hi>parade,</hi> and shew of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very then that celebrity: nor doth she afford a <hi>City</hi> more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably disposed by Nature to represent such a triumph to the best advantage of beholders, then that of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> For it being but one entire street, very spacious, seated on the prone and descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of an hill, pro-tended in a right line from the Castle to <hi>Holy-rood</hi>-house (the Kings <hi>Palace)</hi> at least a mile in length, and the <hi>King</hi> setting forth from the Castle with his suit of Nobles, rode in a most refulgent state through the City to the Palace, (where he was to be crowned) so as the Spectators eyes had a ful pursuit of all that glorious pomp, from the first to the last.</p>
            <p>Thus was King <hi>Charles</hi> inaugurated King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though <note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to him.</note> not King of <hi>Scots;</hi> not all his most gracious and debonair mine towards them, could vest him in that Nations affection. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation (though most legal and innocent) of such things as had been depredated and scrambled away from the <hi>Crown</hi> in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers minority, with a Commission of <hi>Surrenders</hi> of <hi>Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and Tithes, by which the Ministers and Land-owners were bought out and redeemed from the <hi>Clientele</hi> and Vassallage of the Nobility and Laique Patrons, they could not concoct: these were the real causes of their disaffection to him; and because that disaffection durst not look abroad under such an odious extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore they were sedulous to faign another of better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. Soon after the <hi>Coronation</hi> followed an <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> therein an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Ratification</hi> of all Acts formerly made, and then in force, rather for matter of form and course, then for necessity, was propounded: yet did it finde such obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as with much difficulty it passed: for those irritated spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whom nothing could content, but what afforded matter of discontent, would not assent; suggesting though in a clandestine way, that the design of this <hi>Act</hi> was, but to maintain <hi>Episcopacy</hi> (which they thought but a great chip of the old block <hi>Popery)</hi> and what hopes of <hi>Reformation,</hi> what of planting the Gospel,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95383:68"/>
what of erecting the Discipline of Jesus Christ so long as Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy is established? But notwithstanding all these clancular, these close insinuations by these turbulent malevolents, the Act passed, and the King had so considerable and so many friends in that Kingdome, as they durst not then attempt any thing which might discompose the publique quiet.</p>
            <p>Having thus dispatcht the serious part of his errand into <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Majesty gave himself the satisfaction of visiting <hi>Falkland, Sterling,</hi> and some other the most eminent places of pleasure, but in his return and passage from <hi>Brunt Iland</hi> over the <hi>Forth</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he escaped a great danger, the winde being boisterous, and the channel insecure. This done he hasted home, that is, unto the embraces of his dear Consort, where he ended his progresse <hi>Iuly</hi> the 20.</p>
            <p>Not long after his return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> aged and self sear <hi>George Abbot</hi> the Titular Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> went to his everlasting home, <hi>August</hi> the 4. A very learned man he was, his Erudition all of the old stamp, stifly principled in the Doctrine of St. <hi>Augustine;</hi> which they who understand it not, call <hi>Calvinisme,</hi> therefore dis-relisht by them who incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the <hi>Massilian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets. Pious, grave, and exemplary in his conversation. But some think a better <hi>Man</hi> then Archbishop, and that he was better qualified with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for the Dignity, then with a spirit answering the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the exercise whereof he was conceived too facile and yeelding; his extraordinary remisnesse in not exacting strict conformity to the prescribed Orders of the Church in point of ceremony, seemed to resolve those legall determinations to their first principle of indifferency, and led in such an habit of inconformity, as the future reduction of those tender conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men to long dis-continued obedience was interpreted an Innovation. This was the height of what I dare report his failings reacht to: That he was a Ring-leader of that Sect which lately appeared desperate proselytes, loth I am with a late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to affirm, warrant I have none to leave so ill a savour upon his same, nor can it be infallibly inferred from these men their being then in favour with him. Their principles perhaps were entertained since his death, or if before, not then declared, and untill such secrets be discovered, men may be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in those they favour, the greatest sufferer of these times was so.</p>
            <p>Next this Archbishop succeeded <hi>William Land</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and was translated <hi>September</hi> the 19. Higher he could not be advanced in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> he might, and <hi>Rome</hi> was so studious to adopt him hers as supposing his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was not terminated so, before he was translated, she seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95383:69"/>
made him a ridiculous tender of a Cardinals Cap to which he returned answer negative <hi>until</hi> Rome <hi>were other then it is.</hi> Implying that the Church had errors to which he could no waies conform, and had she been as Orthodox as ever, he who was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate here thought it not sorted with his honour to be second to any elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The King having observed at his last being in <hi>Scotland</hi> that God Almighty was very negligently and as he thought unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently worshipt there, took the Reformation of Sacred wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship into his Princely care; and because innovations must be (though never so necessary) led in by degrees, he first began with his own Chappel at <hi>Holy-Rood</hi> House, and this <hi>October</hi> issued forth several Articles or Orders to be there observed by the Dean of his Chappel.</p>
            <p>First, That prayers be said twice a day according to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish form.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That a Communion be held every moneth, and all Communicants to receive the blessed Eucharist on their knees.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That on Sundaies and Holi-daies he who officiates should constantly perform his duty in his Whites or Surplice. But these Directions, though backt with a Letter requiring exact obedience, and though only relating to the Kings private Chappel, yet were very slowly observed, the Bishop of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blane</hi> then Dean of his Majesties Chappel, pleading now one thing, then another in his excuse, when in truth he knew well he should thereby displease the people; and what the consequence might be of displeasing a Nation so combustible, and whose fury would assume the greater liberty in the absence of his Majesty, as he did easily foresee, so did he think it concerned him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>In the year 1618. King <hi>Iames</hi> published a Command or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration tolerating sports on the Lords Day called Sunday. This Declaration then caused so many impetuous clamours against it, as it was soon after called in. And was this <hi>October</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and ratifi'd by King <hi>Charles.</hi> The expresse design of this was to restore the Feasts of Dedication of Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Wakes to their ancient solemnity, and to allow the use of lawful pastimes in the lower row upon that day. It was also argued in favour of it, That there was in the Kingdome a potent tendency in many to Judaisme, occasioned by the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Doctrine and Positions of several Puritans, especially of one <hi>Theophilus Brabourn</hi> an obscure and ignorant School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, asserting the perpetual and indispensable morality of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the fourth Commandement. Again in other no small inclination to Popery, occasion'd by the rigour and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

of <hi>Sabbatarian Ministers,</hi> in denying People recreations on <note place="margin">Ann. Christi 1634.</note> the Sunday. But all these plausible insinuations operated little to a welcome entertainment. Nor was there any one <hi>Royal Edict,</hi> during all King <hi>Charles</hi> his reign, resented with equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret. The fault was least his <hi>Majesties,</hi> and not only ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, but ill custome was to blame: For the <hi>King</hi> might say of this his Day, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did once of God's House, <hi>Surely the</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> (you may if you please call it <hi>Candlemas</hi> night) had been time out of minde celebrated at Court with somewhat more then ordinary solemnity: and never was any more glorious then that of this year: the four <hi>Innes</hi> of <hi>Court</hi> presenting both their <hi>Majesties</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with a gallant Masque as a Symbole of their joynt affections. An exact account of this radiant shew, would make a bad shew in so grave a <hi>History,</hi> nor shall I need say more, then that for curiosity of fancy, for excellency of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, for lustre and dazling splendor, this age, though pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately addicted to the glory of such inventions, never before or since within this Ile afforded the like. So brave a spectacle it was, as it not only delighted the Court, but set the <hi>London</hi> Dames on longing to behold such gaiety within their City wals; upon this account some ten daies after both their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, with their train of Court Grandees and Gentlemen Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, were solemnly invited to a most sumptuous banquet at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> where that resplendent shew was iterated, and re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, so as not only this year, but this moneth may be said to have had two Candlemas nights. This entertainment was very costly to the City, so dear was then, I say not this <hi>King,</hi> but their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95383:70"/>
own vanity to them, and that their vanity was dearer to them then their <hi>King</hi> is evident, because some few years after, when they flourished, and he wanted most to represse the <hi>Scotish-darings,</hi> he could not obtain from them any the least pittance of supply.</p>
            <p>The next spring his Majesty fell upon <hi>Davids</hi> design, but not upon <hi>Davids</hi> sin, of numbring the People, the ground whereof was this.</p>
            <p>Forein Princes and States with whom he was in amity, were earnest suitors to him, that by his leave they might make some military levies within his Dominions. Willing he was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with those desires, but would first provide against his own prejudice; that he might therefore take the better notice of what was supernumerary to his own preservation, he caused a general mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to be made of all persons (under the degree of <hi>Esquires)</hi> fit to bear arms from the age of sixteen to sixty, and after the return of the Roll he condescended to their requests.</p>
            <p>This summer the <hi>King,</hi> following the Counsel of <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> began to apply himself to the mastery of the British seas, to which he had most potent provocations: for his coasts were not only infected with <hi>Pickroons, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk-</hi>Pirats to the great dammage of traffique, but his very Dominion in the narrow seas actually usurped by the <hi>Holland-</hi>Fishers, and the right it self in good earnest disputed, by a late Tract of learned <hi>Grotius</hi> called <hi>More liberum:</hi> These were craving occasions and concernments not of honour only, but of safety also. And how these could be provided for was the grand difficulty, for the charge of the enterprise would be excessive, and his <hi>Exchequer</hi> empty, how that vacuity should be filled up was a <hi>Question,</hi> and that <hi>Question</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> his infelicity; for without all question the most natural and proper resort had been to his Subjects in <hi>Parliament,</hi> but his and their late so unfriendly, so unkinde parting, gave him slender assurance of relief from them, and made him loth to give himself the trouble of their denial. And for such Subjects, to deny such a <hi>King,</hi> upon such an occasion was (he thought) a deplorable case. Had he wasted and decocted his Treasure in luxury and riot, had he been profuse in bounty to his Favourites, and had contracted want that way; had he prest upon his Peoples liberties above the mode of his progenitors, and so alienated their affections; had not his people been in state to supply him, all these had been considerable and every one some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But never King was more frugal, never <hi>King</hi> more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive in his largesses, never <hi>King</hi> had made more obliging concessions to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>This disinclination of the Parliament to assist the <hi>King,</hi> and his impendent necessity, had power, I will not say cause, enough
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95383:70"/>
to urge in another <hi>King</hi> a repetition of <hi>Privy Seals, Loans,</hi> and such disgustfull impositions. But to King <hi>Charles</hi> it was sufficient they were illegal, resolved he was no extremity, no not an invincible, and fatal one, should provoke him to temerate, to violate those Lawes; yet if any thing did happily escape (as he hoped there did) the curiosity of the late restraint upon him by the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> or was left at the dispose of his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> he doubted not but he might without scruple of conscience to himself, or offence to the publique, take benefit thereof. Therefore for a cunning man (the cunning'st at such a Project of any within his three Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) he sends, that is, for his Atturney generall <hi>Noy,</hi> tels him what he had in contemplation, bids him contrive the mode (but a legal one) for defraying the expence. Away goes the subtile engineer, and at length from old records progs and bolts out an ancient Precedent of raising a Tax upon the hole Kingdome, for setting forth a Navy in <hi>case of danger.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> glad of the discovery, as of <hi>Treasure trouve,</hi> presently issued out writs to all Countries within the Realm, declaring that the safety of the Kingdome was in danger (and so it was indeed) and that therefore every County should for the defence of the Kingdome, against a day prefixt, provide ships of so many Tun, with Guns, Gunpowder, Tackle, and all other things necessary. But before these ships could be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to flote upon the main, they were dry-foundred at land. For the Tax being a burden, every man began to study how to decline the weight. The <hi>Clergy</hi> pleaded immunity from all secular and civill charges. But the Judges argued against them that there is <hi>Trinoda necessitas, a threefold necessity</hi> which binds all, as well Clergy as Laity; <hi>viz. Aid in War,</hi> (such as this) <hi>the building of Bridges, and making of Forts;</hi> neverthelesse the <hi>King</hi> upon the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi> entreaty granted them exemption. Again the <hi>Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> the Highlanders muttered at the Imposition, alledging that it being a Naval Tax, it ought in reason and equity to be born by the Par-alious, the Maritime parts. But the objection paramount, and above all was, that it was charged out of Parliament, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Petition of right.</hi> The severall processes and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Difference, and how at length it reposed, are not now in season, but will more tempestively occurre in the ensuing series of this narration. For</p>
            <p>Next to the <hi>birth</hi> of the <hi>Project,</hi> succeedeth the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Projector.</hi> That <hi>Atturny Generall</hi> ending this life <hi>August</hi> the ninth. His decease following his invention of Shipmony so close at the heels, seemed to the people as an overture of some benignity from heaven, and almost perswaded them that <hi>God</hi> was interested in what they accounted their <hi>oppression.</hi> He was a man passing humorous, of a Cynical rusticity, a most indefatigable plodder, and searcher of ancient Records, whereby he became an eminent instrument both
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95383:71"/>
of good and ill (and of which most is a great question) to the <hi>Kings</hi> prerogative. For during the time that Parliaments were frequent, he appeared a stout Patriot of the Comminalty, and in the last was an active opponent in the difference concerning <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> But when the Dissolution of that was, in most mens appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, the end of all; No sooner did the <hi>King</hi> shew him the lure of advancement, but quitting all his former inclinations, he wheel'd about to the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and made amends with his future service, for all his former dis-obligations.</p>
            <p>About the same time <hi>Axel Oxenstiern,</hi> the grand <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and generall Director of the <hi>Swedish</hi> affaires, sent over his son (a Gentleman of singular Gallantry and accomplishments) in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an <hi>Ambassadour</hi> to our King, who treated him very nobly sutable to his both merit and extraction; but in regard he came without credential Letters from the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> was ignorant of the latitude and extent of his Fathers power as to constituting <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> he denyed him Audience, whereupon he returned in some disgust.</p>
            <p>This year there was a Parliament called in <hi>Ireland</hi> at the motion of the <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> founded upon very considerable reasons. In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> that Kingdome did yeeld to the Crown <hi>ultra reprisas,</hi> all charges born, thirty thousand pound <hi>per annum.</hi> But now his <hi>Majestics</hi> Revenue fell short of defraying the yearly charge twenty thousand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> which was supplyed by way of contribution from the Subject, and the Crown had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a debt of eighty thousand pounds. This contribution was to determine the next year, and renewed it could not legally be but by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and if that Parliament would but grant three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies, they would advance enough to maintain the Army, and providently ordered to discharge his Majesties debt; and that the Parliament should be inclined thereto, the <hi>King</hi> had many reasons to hope. First, they had granted but one Subsidy since the initiation of King <hi>Iames</hi> his reign. Secondly, the Kingdome was now grown-rich, peace begetting plenty. Lastly his Majesty had lately obliged them by setling all Estates where there had been twenty years continued prossession; nor did his expectation mis-carry, the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> proceeding with that prudence, that he obtained his ends.</p>
            <p>The same time also there was in that Kingdome a <hi>Synod</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, wherein the System, the Body of Articles formed by that Church <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. were repealed, and in their place were substituted the 39. <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> intending to create an uniformity of belief between both Churches. Many were not very well pleased at this alteration, in regard the former <hi>Articles</hi> contained expressely the <hi>nine Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> framed in opposition to the <hi>Arminian Tenets;</hi> and were inserted there by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95383:71"/>
especial direction and order from King <hi>Iames.</hi> Again there was another <hi>Article</hi> of the same edition, wherein the Sanctification of the <hi>Lords-day</hi> was asserted as a duty of Divine Right, for default of which, in those of the English model, men were left at liberty to opine what they pleased concerning its sacred institution, and by consequence a wide door opened to its profanation by licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous libertines.</p>
            <p>I must not leave <hi>Ireland</hi> before I have vindicated the innocence of the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> from an accusation, or rather a calumny of Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who extracts from Sir <hi>Thomas Duttons</hi> letter, a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a great mutiny of Papists in <hi>Dublin,</hi> which he fixeth upon this year, and delivereth it as the effect of the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence, and fomenting that faction: in both which the man is grosly mistaken, for that mutiny he mentioneth anteceded this Lords <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> two years, as this Narrative hath placed it. And for the Popish <hi>Recusants</hi> certain it is, they never were kept within stricter duty, nor held closer to loyal obedience then during the time he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scottish</hi> discontents I mentioned in the last Annal, which <note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to plot against the King.</note> the <hi>King</hi> left behinde him boyling upon a soft and gentle fire, began now to contract a little more confidence in his absence, and to tempt his patience by a most mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tious plot against his fame, as preambulatory to another against his Person. The peoples mindes were not yet made susceptible enough of, not sufficiently infected with, their mischievous impressions; and because the first work and operation in the method of sedition, is to leaven that masse, first they whispered and instill'd into them close intelligence of some terrible plot against their liberties; then they sent abroad a venemous <hi>Libel,</hi> wherein they endevoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame the <hi>Kings</hi> proceedings in the last Parliament, as indirect, to charge him with the suborning of, and corrupting the then suffrages, and suggested formidable fictions of his tendency to the <hi>Romish</hi> Belief.</p>
            <p>This virulent paper passing through many hands, fell at length into some of disaffected inclinations, who presently as duty dictated, informed the Lords of the <hi>Privy Councel</hi> thereof; upon which ensued a strict and narrow search into the authors and abetters thereof; the contrivet was discovered to be one <hi>Hagge</hi> then escaped, and the chief of the abetters was the Lord <hi>Balmerino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Lords Father was a creature of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and by him <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merino</hi> arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> advanced to be his chief Secretary of State; a seeming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, but inside Romanist. Being a Minister of so neer admission to the King, he had been often tampering with him to send a letter of compliment (contrived by himself) to Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> which the King as oft refused not without indignation
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95383:72"/>
at the motion. Whereupon <hi>Balmerino</hi> taking advantage of the Kings haste when he was going on hunting he being to sign several other dispatches, he cunningly shuffled in that Letter amongst the rest, so as the King signed it unawares. Some years after Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> mentioning that Letter to the <note place="margin">Matth. Tort ad Apolog. Anglic. Responsio.</note> Kings dis-advantage, and the King taking notice thereof questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned his Secretary for it, who upon his triall confessed the whole truth, for which he was by his Peers found guilty, and sutable to his merit adjudged to be hang'd, drawn and quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and his estate confiscated to the <hi>Crown.</hi> But that <hi>King</hi> was mild beyond measure, some thought beyond policy, and all this notwithstanding would not spill his bloud, which was a clemency most transcendent, had his mercy ended there; but that pardon which was too much mercy for so high an offender, was, he thought, too little for so great a <hi>King,</hi> therefore in tract of time he shined upon him with such grace, as restored him both in bloud and estate. This <hi>Lord</hi> being heir <hi>ex asse</hi> (even to his very perfidiousnesse) of what was his Fathers, being thus lapsed into a similary crime, underwent similary proceedings of trial and arraignment, was also by his Peers found guilty, and sentence of death ready to be pronounced against him. True it is, the verdict of his <hi>Peers</hi> past amongst those who wished well both to him and that <hi>Libel,</hi> as over severe. But the malefactor finding himself convicted, and by consequence his life at the dispose of his Majesty, had the wit his Father taught him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to the Kings mercy, which (that the parallel might still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) was a gratiously dispensed to him. This Princely favour the <hi>Lord</hi> received (as well it merited) in the lowest posture of a suppliant on his knees, with highest recognizance of his <hi>Majesties</hi> goodnesse, and deepest vowes of future loyalty that an obligation so high could deserve. But long he held not to the conscience of those protestations, so ingratefully relapsing some few years after, as if he had only craved leave to offend againe.</p>
            <p>During these proceedings against this <hi>Lord,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Kenoul</hi> Lord Chancellor of that Kingdome dyed, next whom succeeded the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> a thing not known in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for the space of three hundred years before, for a Clergy man to bear that office.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> fell two great Favorites of different parties, of the Comminalties one, of the Kings another: of the Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> who dyed about the latter end of this <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> dyeth.</note> Summer. Full of dayes he dyed, most whereof he had spent in eminent place and honour. His abilities in the Common Law, whereof he passed for the great Oracle, raysing him to the dignity first of <hi>Atturney</hi> General to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95383:72"/>
of Lord <hi>Chief Iustice</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> under King <hi>Iames.</hi> His advancement he lost the same way he got it, by his tongue. So rare is it for a man very eloquent, not to be over loquent. Long lived he in that retirement to which Court indignation had remitted him, yet was not his re-cesse in-glorious; for at improving a disgrace to the best advantage, he was so excellent, as King <hi>Iames</hi> said of him, <hi>He was like a Cat, throw her which way you will, she will light upon her feet.</hi> And finding a cloud at the Court, he made sure of fair weather in the Countrey; applying himself so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly to popular interest, as in succeeding Parliaments, the Prerogative felt him, as her ablest, so her most active oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Upon which account he was once made <hi>High Sheriffe</hi> of <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> on purpose to exclude him the ensuing Parliament, there being an especial <hi>Nolumus</hi> and clause in his Commission prohibiting his election; notwithstanding which elected he was in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and those words of Restraint, upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the Question in the House of Commons voted void.</p>

               <hi>Weston</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> this year and he almost expiring together, he ending this life <hi>March</hi> the thirteenth. A sad losse to the <hi>King,</hi> and the sadder because he thought it irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. The truth is, he was a person very able for the office, and the <hi>Exchequer</hi> was in the mending hand, while he enjoyed that place, for he had a singular artifice both in improving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, and in a frugal moderation of his Masters expences: But the Kings sorrow was not so extreme for him, but the peoples joy was full as great. For there was now grown so sad an antipathy between his <hi>Majestie</hi> and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that like those two Emperors <hi>Antonine</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> they <note place="margin">Xiphiline.</note> were alwayes of contrary senses and minds, rarely agreeing in any one particular. The deportment whereby he so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged the Comminalty was his promoting Monopolies, and other advantages of Regality. The Archbishop and he were usually at great odds, yet both in high favour with the King. His vacant place was for the present entrusted to Commissioners untill the King should otherwayes dispose thereof.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop was now grown as great as power could make him, and active in the exercise of that power beyond the practice of his Predecessor, whereby he set many tongues about his ears: Men beginning now to rant it in their petulancy to Libel and reproaching; and more then men, women also, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these the Lady <hi>Purbeck</hi> meditating a piece of petty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for his so severe censure of her in the high <hi>Commission,</hi> vented words of deep disgrace against him, for which by the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi> procurement she was committed <hi>March</hi> the 24.</p>

            <p>Affairs of the Treasury being managed by Commissioners, <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Iuxon</hi> made Lord Treasurer.</note> many hot disputes were generated amongst them, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Archbishop</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cottington;</hi> so as the <hi>Kings</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:95383:73"/>
discretion was called in to part the fray, by committing the staffe of that office into the hands of <hi>William Iuxon Lord Bishop</hi> of <hi>London, March</hi> 6. who though he was none of the greatest Scholars, yet was withall none of the worst Bishops. <hi>Men of the most re-searched nations are not usually the best qualified for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either Ecclesiastical, or Political, to know, and to be wise, are two.</hi> And as his moderate and equal temper in Church affaires gained love, so in those of the State he preserved it by the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant calmnesse, and withall exhibited therein clear demonstration of his intemerate integrity, qualities meritorious of good esteem.</p>
            <p>About this time began great commotions and stirres in the Church concerning ceremonies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishops</hi> of late years supinely, either carelesse, or indulgent, <note place="margin">Commotions about ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church.</note> had not required within their Diocesses that strict obedience to Ecclesiasticall constitutions, which the law expected: Upon this the <hi>Leiturgy</hi> began to be in a manner totally laid aside, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity the uniforme practise of the Church. The now <hi>Archbishop</hi> was of another mind and metall; that the external worship of God should follow the fashion of every private fancy, he did not like; and what he did not like in that subject, as he was in state, so he thought it was his duty to reforme. Therefore keeping this year his Metropoliticall <hi>visitation,</hi> he cals upon all both Clergy and Laity to observe the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Can it give just offence to say that, thus far, he did but what sorted with the office of so great a Prelate? <hi>Where there is not a legal settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt for the upholding uniformity,</hi> Schisme <hi>will flow in apace;</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> hath experimentally found, <hi>Schism</hi> in things adio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorous, is as fatall to her well being, as <hi>Heresie</hi> in points Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical. And better no lawes at all, then that notwithstanding such establishments, men be permitted in practise to go lesse. But his zeal to order, that carried him thus far, transported him a little too far. The Communion Table which formerly stood in the midst of the Church or Chancel, he injoyned to be placed at the East end, upon a graduated advance of ground, with the ends inverted, and a woodden traverse of <hi>railes</hi> before it, to keep <hi>Profanation</hi> off, to which <hi>Railes</hi> all <hi>Communicants</hi> were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort. These things were decent and comely in contemplation, and had been so in practise, had they been within the rule of the Church directions, but being anomalous, innovations, and so severely urged, many became thereupon <hi>precise,</hi> and separated themselves into factious fidings; nor was this a Schisme of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary assise, but grew to that processe, to that degree, as, to speak in the primitive mode, <hi>Altar was erected against Altar,</hi> that is, one <hi>Bishop</hi> impugned and opposed another; for the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (being affronted by one <hi>Titly</hi> Vicar of <hi>Grantham)</hi> published a Tract under a conceiled name, positively asserting therein, <hi>That the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

anciently did in the Primitive times,</hi> and ought so in ours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Ann. Christi 1636.</note> to the Dictates of our Church, stand <hi>in gremio,</hi> and have of the quire. And as the Archbishop whilst he so vehemently pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed order, did a little out run authority; so was he unhappy in those he did imploy as instruments and subordinates under him, some whereof endevoured to superinduct many things as will-worship of their own, and which came within a Mathematical line of Popery; nor were they blamelesse in their lives, some being vicious even to scandal, nor of so meek and humble behaviour as was to be wisht, but insolent at a rate so intolerable, as one was bold to say, <hi>be hoped to live to see the day, when a Minister should be as good a man, as any Iack Gentleman in</hi> England: to such an heighth of infatuation, had a petty blaze of mistaken honor elevated this high Flyer; who in lieu of those frolique days he looked to see, lived to see that very Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy extirpated, and lived to see himself de-plumed of all his Pomp. These exorbitances of those <hi>sons of Eli,</hi> from the rules of Ethicks, created a very great disgust against them, and many well enough affected to their <hi>Empire,</hi> did exceedingly blame their <hi>imperiosity.</hi> The Presbyterians were gainers by all this, being men for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality free of any moral scandal, saving that they were thought Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largyrous, and over solicitous <hi>of filthy lucre,</hi> and pretended to a most demure formality and supple mildnesse, plausible insinuations into vulgar esteem, whereby they daily prevailed upon the affections of such, who little thought such outside lambs, had clawes and asperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (so cunningly did they conceal them) far more sharp and terrible then the Prelates, whereof they gave shortly after sensible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>
            <p>The next Summer the Royal <hi>Fleet</hi> now completed to sixty sail of tall ships, set sail from the <hi>Downes</hi> for the North, to scour that Sea as of Pirates, so of the <hi>Flemish Busses;</hi> which they did to so good effect, as they were soon reduced to a precarious condition, and to entreat the favour of fishing by his <hi>Majesties</hi> commission: a veniality the <hi>King</hi> was most ready to indulge them; For first, in that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he had no design paramount to the preservation of his Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the <hi>British</hi> Ocean; this gained, he sought no more. Again, he knew well that nothing was more pettinent to the Prince <hi>Electors</hi> interest then the correspondence of those States, nor was any assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance more like to mean and procure his Restauration then theirs, and therefore it was good policy to oblige them with all fair shews of amity. For the <hi>Kings</hi> passion for his Nephews restauration did not at all languish, but rather contracted new vigour from his presence at the <hi>English</hi> Court. And because there was indicted an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Ratisbone, Septemb.</hi> the 16. of this year, for the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an <hi>Emperor,</hi> he was resolved once more to solicite his cause, hoping the change of the person might dispose to a change of minde. The instrument he made choyce of for this affair, was the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95383:74"/>
Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> Lord Marshal of <hi>England,</hi> in most gallant equipage he went attended with a noble train, and coming to the Imperial Court, he presented his Masters request to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; who reply'd that it was probable that Prince might be <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Arun del</hi> sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador into <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> re-admitted to enjoy the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> but as to the higher it was not likely that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who then possest himself of it, would listen to any proposition destructive to his present interest therein. A very sharp and fierce encounter there was between the Ambassadour and the Deputies of the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upon this subject, so as they could hardly temper themselves from offensive contumelies. Some of the Electors in the <hi>Diet</hi> were very inclinable to the restitution, conceiving that it would be very difficult to found a stedy peace without it, but the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> said peremptorily he would neither part with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, nor Dignity Electoral, while he was able by the sword to hold them: whereupon the Lord Ambassadour much incensed that he so long attended to so little purpose, without deigning any the honour of an <hi>a Dieu,</hi> made haste away: and though the Emperour did send the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Pologn</hi> Ambassadors after to appease him, and to request his patience but a moneth longer, yet would he not be exorated or be prevailed with, but came direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly home, having first dispatcht Letters of advice to his Master, concerning the state of his Negotiation; whereby the <hi>King</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at the small regard his Ambassadour found at the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial <hi>Diet,</hi> was prompted to return an equal slight upon an Agent imployed soon after by the Emperour hither about the same affair.</p>
            <p>This breach between our <hi>King</hi> and the Emperour, did not <note place="margin">Overtures of a match between the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
               </note> at this time more seem to frown upon, then another occasion to flatter that Princes fortunes; for now the King of <hi>Poland</hi> sent Prince <hi>Ratzevill</hi> to treat with our King of a marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that King and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> sister of the Prince <hi>Elector;</hi> which was prosecuted to a very neer point of conclusion. Certain it is, that <hi>King</hi> was seriously inclined to the match, but he being an Elective Prince, was in such an affair to submit to the Diet of that Kingdome, and in that it found so fair accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as two of the three Estates had once accorded to it. But the Clergy making a pawse in their consent, upon a seeming suggestion, that the businesse was of too high importance to be so precipitated, in the interim interveneth a proposition from the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Cecilia Arch-Dutchesse,</hi> and second sister of the Emperour. This overture so soon wrought upon that Nation, as renouncing all further treaty with <hi>England,</hi> or any other State, the match was instantly concluded with that <hi>Austrian Lady,</hi> and the Prince Elector remitted to his former state of diffidence, if not of despair.</p>

The <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> having in his Provincial visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the last year setled Church affairs in most places to his minde, though thereby he had unsetled and discomposed the mindes of others, began now to cast a narrow eye upon the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Some spies had informed him, that not only Divine Service was performed, but also Sacraments administred in several <hi>Chappels</hi> there, as in those of <hi>Emanuel</hi> and <hi>Sidney-Suffex</hi> Colledge, which had not yet been consecrated. This he thought an high indignity to Religion, and such as created a necessity of his visitation.

            <p>The next month presents us with the recidivation, a second <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> sentenced in the Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> fall of the insolent Prelate <hi>Williams</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> His first was mentioned in the first year of this <hi>Kings</hi> Reign, which though but from one stage, yet because a fall, that is, a constrained and no spontaneous descent, he stomacht with most high indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. That by the munificence of Royal Majesty he exchanged his woodden for a silver mace, that from a Countrey <hi>Pedant,</hi> he became in a double relation a <hi>Peer</hi> of the Realm, that the in-trados and in-comes of his promotions, enabled him to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate vast sums of money, and to make acquist of large reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and that of his dignities he still retained the greater part, these things he little minded (so powerful is with worthlesse spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, one seeming discurtesie, to dis-oblige from the recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of antecedent favours, though never so, either great or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.) Thus malevolently inclined, he thought he could not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie beloved revenge better, then to endevour the supplanting of his Soveraign, to which end finding him declining in the affection of his People, he made his apostrophe and applications to them, fomenting popular discourses tending to the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, so long, untill at length the incontinence of his tongue betray'd him into speeches which trespast upon Loyalty. For
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95383:78"/>
which words, they having taken a vent, he was questioned by a Bill in the <hi>Star-chamber, 4. Car.</hi> But the information being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lame, as being taken up upon refracted and second hand report, the Accusation took a nap till about 8. <hi>Car.</hi> when it was revived again. And the Bishops purgation depending principally upon the testimony of one <hi>Prideon,</hi> it happened that the <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> after, one <hi>Elizabeth Hodson</hi> was delivered of a base childe, and laid it to this <hi>Prideon.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> finding his great witnesse charged with such a load of filth and infamy, conceiv'd it would in-validate all his testimony, and that once rendred in-valid, the <hi>Bishop</hi> could easily prognosticate his own ruine, therefore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirs himself a main, and though by order of the Justices at the Publique Session at <hi>Lincoln, Prideon</hi> was charged as the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted father, the Bishop by his two agents, <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> procured that Order suppressed, and by subornation and menacing of, and tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with witnesses, at length in <hi>May 10. Car.</hi> procured the childe fathered upon one <hi>Boon,</hi> and <hi>Prideon</hi> acquit. These lewd practises, for the supportation of his favorites credit, cost the Bishop, as he confest to Sir <hi>Iohn Munson</hi> and others, twelve hundred pounds, so much directly, and by conquence much more. For being accri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> for this corrupting of witnesse, and being convicted (I will not not say convinced) by evident and full proof, <hi>Iuly</hi> the 11. of this year, he received a most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign censure of ten thousand pounds fine to the <hi>King,</hi> imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Tower during his <hi>Majesties</hi> pleasure, suspension <hi>ab Officiis &amp; Beneficiis,</hi> and to be referred to the High Commission for the rest. In this state I leave him, untill the series of a few years shall render him in a better.</p>
            <p>Nor must I leave him only, but even <hi>England</hi> her self almost, for now began <hi>Scotland</hi> to be the great scene of action, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must my discourse make its next transition. Of this and the next years commotions there, a true account I shall give you, though not an exact one, as to descend to every particular; that is done already as by a Royal hand, so <hi>stylo Imperatorio,</hi> in a full body, and Historical systeme: from whence I shall extract such occurrences as are of prime remarque, and as contractedly as may be, having regard to the symmetry of the other parts of this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And because the precognition of their first extraction will be necessary to the relation of those occurrences, themselves, I shall there commence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> observing his Father had it once in design to settle <note place="margin">Original of the <hi>Scottish</hi> troubles.</note> in <hi>Scotland</hi> a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> in order to uniformity, like that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but was taken away before he could accomplish it; thought himself concerned to pursue his Fathers purpose: to which end he gave directions to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and to divers <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Kingdome, to revise,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95383:78"/>
correct, alter and change, as they pleased, the <hi>Liturgie</hi> compiled in his Fathers t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me. This <hi>Service-Book</hi> so altered, and very little differing (as he was unhappily perswaded by them) from the <hi>English,</hi> he sent to his Councel of that Kingdome, ordering them to proclaim the reading of it upon the next <hi>Easter</hi> day, 1637. who upon better consideration respited it until <hi>Iuly</hi> the 23. but gave publique notice of it the Sunday before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuly</hi> the 23. being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> began to <note place="margin">Stirs about the Liturgy.</note> read the Book in St. <hi>Giles</hi> Church (the chief of that City) but he no sooner began, then the inferiour multitude began in a tumultuous manner to fill the Church with uproar; whereupon the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> stept into the pulpit, and hoping to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them by minding them of the sanctity of the place, they were the more enraged, throwing at him cudgels, stooles, and what was in the way of fury, unto the very endangering of his life: upon this the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Lord Chancellor, was enforced to call down from the Gallery the <hi>Provost, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs,</hi> and other Magistrates of the City (then sitting there) to their assistance, who with much ado at length thrust that unruly rabble out of the Church, and made fast the doores: This done, the <note place="margin">The Bishops affronted.</note> 
               <hi>Dean</hi> proceeded in reading the Book, the multitude in the mean while rapping at the doores, pelting the windowes with stones, and endevouring what in them lay to disturb that Sacred exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; but notwithstanding all their clamour, the Service was ended, but not the peoples rage, who waiting the Bishops retiring to his lodging, so assaulted him, as had he not been rescued by a strong hand, he had probably perisht by their violence. Nor was St. <hi>Giles</hi> Church only thus pester'd, and profan'd, but in other Churches also, (though not in so high a measure) the peoples disorders were unison and agreeable. The morning thus past, the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> and Councel assembled to prevent the like darings in the afternoon, which they so effected, as the Liturgy was read without any disturbance: only the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> was in his return to his lodging rudely treated by the people, both by execrations and other wayes, though in the Earl of <hi>Roxboroughs</hi> Coach.</p>
            <p>All this time, the Magistrates of the City seemed so utterly to abhor those tumultuous proceedings, as some they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and were industrious to enquire out others actors therein: and whereas the Ministers of that City craved dispensation from reading of the Book untill security were given for the safeguard of their persons; the Magistrates and Councel of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> draw up an obligatory Act, both for indemnity of their persons, and also for their setled maintenance.</p>
            <p>Now the long vacation and Harvest began to come on, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being the businesse of idle men, the distempers began a while
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95383:79"/>
to slumber; but their corn being inned, and chief imployments over. <hi>Edenburgh</hi> began to swarm again to a formidable number, and the City to relax so far in their former earnestnesse for the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book,</hi> as many of them presented a <hi>Petition</hi> to the Lords of the Councel, craving the Book might be no further prest upon them, untill the <hi>King</hi> should signifie his further pleasure. The Councel <note place="margin">Proclamations against those tumults.</note> upon this observing so great a confluence, and the City so dis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and fearing some dangerous consequence, issued out <hi>Octob.</hi> the 17. three <hi>Proclamations,</hi> the first <hi>to notifie the dissolving their meeting in relation to Church matters, and that every man forthwith repair home to their own dwellings, (except such who shall shew just cause of their stay to the Lords) upon pain of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi> The second <hi>for removing of the Session (the Term) from</hi> Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh <hi>to</hi> Lithgow. And the third, <hi>for calling in and burning a seditious Book, entituled A Dispute against the</hi> English <hi>Popish-Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, obtruded upon the Kirk of</hi> Scotland. These Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were not water, but rather fuel to the flame. For the next day the Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> being to sit with the Lord <hi>Chief Iustice</hi> upon some especial businesse in the Councel house, he was persued all along the street with bitter raylings to the very Councel door, and being drawn in from the rage of the people, they immediately beset the house, demanding the delivery of him, threatning his destruction. The Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised of the Bishops danger came presently to his relief; and, with much adoe, forced an entrance through the press of the Mutineers. But being got in, he was in no better plight then the Bishop, the clamour encreasing still more and more, and encompassing the Councel house with terrible menaces. Hereupon the Lord <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost</hi> and City Councel was called upon to raise the siege; but they returned answer, that their condition was the same, for they were surrounded with the like multitude, who had enforced them, for fear of their lives, to sign a Paper importing, First, <hi>That they should adhere to them in opposition to the Service Book.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Restore to their places Mr.</hi> Ramsey, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Rollock, <hi>two si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced Ministers, and one</hi> Henderson, <hi>a silenced Reader.</hi> No bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter answer being returned, the Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi> with the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Wigton,</hi> went in Person to the Town Councel house, where they found the heat of the fury somewhat abated, because the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates had signed the Paper, and returned with some hope that the Magistrates would calm the disorders about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel house, so as the Bishop might be preserved, but they no sooner presented themselves to the great street, then they were most boisterously assaulted, the throng being so furious, as they pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> took away his hat, cloke, and white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wand, <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair</hi> assaulted.</note> and so haled him to the Councel house. The <hi>Lords</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves in so great hazard, at length pitcht upon the best
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95383:79"/>
expedient for their safety, and sent to some of the Noble-men and Gentry, who were dis-affected to the <hi>Service Book,</hi> to come to their aid. These Lords and Gentlemen came, as was desired, and offered both their persons and power to protect them; which the Lords in the Councel house readily embraced, and so were quietly guarded to <hi>Haly-rood</hi> house, and the Bishop to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The Lords of the Councel now thinking themselves secure, that very afternoon commanded a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made at <note place="margin">Another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</note> the Crosse of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> for the repressing such disorders for the time to come; but slender obedience was yeelded thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for the Citizens sent Commissio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rs to the Councel Table demanding the restauration of their Ministers, and performance of what was promised before their <hi>Pacification:</hi> and not long after the Councel was boorded with a <hi>Petition,</hi> not of a rude multitude, but of <hi>Noble-men, Barons, Ministers, Burgesses</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> against the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Canons.</hi> This <hi>Petition</hi> was <note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition against the <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
               </note> sent to the <hi>King,</hi> who, displeased with the contents thereof, gave instructions for adjourning the Term to <hi>Sterling,</hi> twenty four miles from <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> that so the former confluence might be precluded, and also for publishing a Proclamation interdicting, upon the highest penalty, such tumultuous resorts. Upon the very day, being <hi>February.</hi> 19. and immediately after the reading of this Proclamation at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hume,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lindsey,</hi> with some others, caused their <hi>Protestation</hi> against it to be read; and agreeable to their Protestation, in despight of the <hi>Kings</hi> Proclamation, erected Four <hi>Tables,</hi> one of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> another of the <hi>Gentry,</hi> a third of the <hi>Burroughs,</hi> a fourth of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;</hi> these four were to prepare and digest what was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded at the General <hi>Table,</hi> formed of several Commissioners chosen from the rest.</p>
            <p>The first-born and eldest-brat of this General <hi>Table,</hi> was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing <note place="margin">1638.

The Councel, upon the first publication of this combination, sent a dispatch to the <hi>King</hi> by Sir <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> to advertise him thereof; the <hi>King</hi> animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted every prevarication from the ancient mode, and wondred at their unparallel'd impudence, to prefix a title so self-destructive; for they had contrived it thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Confession of Faith subscribed at first, by the</hi> Kings Majesty <hi>and his</hi> Houshold <hi>in the year of</hi> God

               <hi>by</hi> Ordinance of the Lords of the Secret Councel, and Acts of the General Assembly. <hi>Subscribed again, by all sorts of persons in the year</hi> 1590. by a new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Councel at the desire of the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; <hi>with a General</hi> Band <hi>for the maintenance of the true Religion and the</hi> Kings <hi>Person; And now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the year 1638. by us</hi> Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers, <hi>and</hi> Commons, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der subscribing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence the <hi>King</hi> observed, that in the three first subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either his <hi>Fathers</hi> own act is exprest, or an <hi>Ordinance of the Lords of the secret Councel,</hi> which is equivalent to Regal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was obtained, and <hi>at the desire of the General Assembly;</hi> whereas in the last, neither was his <hi>Own,</hi> nor his delegated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his <hi>Councel</hi> implored, nor was there any <hi>General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> to entreat it. So that the exacting of a Publique Oath, which could not legally be done without the highest authority, was actually done without the least shadow of it.</p>
            <p>Again, in the frame of the Covenant he noted a difference of <note place="margin">Differing from former prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</note> dangerous consequence, from former precedents; for whereas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding <hi>Bands</hi> annext to Confessions, were formed in <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Himself,</hi> his <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> this new edition hath a Combination <hi>against all persons whatsoever,</hi> not Himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>

To the first they replyed, that nothing but a <hi>General Assembly</hi> and a <hi>Parliament</hi> could give them satisfaction. To the second they answered, that they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed any retreat from their Loyalty, and therefore needed no return towards it. And for the <hi>Covenant, That they would sooner renounce their Baptism then it, And that this was a proposition they would never endure to hear a second time:</hi> which they took speedy care to prevent, for they resented it with so much wrath, as they doubled their <hi>Guards</hi> both upon the Castle and City: <note place="margin">Double their guards.</note> whereupon, the <hi>Marquesse</hi> in order to his safety returned to <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi> and sent to the King for new instructions; to which his <hi>Majesties</hi> answer was, that he would have him forthwith publish by Proclamation his Declaration, wherein he assured that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his constancy in the Protestant Religion; that he would <note place="margin">The King yeelds to their desires.</note> never further presse nor urge the practise of the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book,</hi> but in a fair and legal way, and had given Order for the discharge of all Acts of Councel concerning them; And that he had taken into consideration the indicting of a <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> wherein might be agitated what should most concern the peace and welfare of the <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Whereupon he expected that those his subjects, sensible of his gracious favour, would give testimonial of their future loyalty, and no further provoke him to make use of that power which God had given him, for the reclaiming disobedient people.</p>
            <p>This Proclamation was no sooner ended, but the <hi>Covenanters</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters obstinate.</note> were ready with a traversing <hi>Protest</hi> against it, wherein they seemed highly to distaste to have their actions branded with the notion of disobedience, and declared, that they would never abandon their <hi>Covenant</hi> upon such suggestions, and <hi>that they would not wait the Kings conveniency for calling of an Assembly; but if he did not approve of their proceedings, they would call a General Assembly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Marquesse</hi> finding them still thus obstinate, told them that <note place="margin">The Marquesse returns into <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> the stock of his instructions was spent, and that he must resort to <hi>England</hi> for a fresh supply, thereupon they acquainted him, that they expected his Majesties answer, and his return upon the 5. of <hi>August</hi> next at the furthest, they promising in the interim to continue in a peaceable condition, nor to act any thing untill his return.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marquesse</hi> coming into <hi>England,</hi> and making known to the <hi>King</hi> the state of his affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he dispatcht him away with new orders, so as he might be there at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:95383:81"/>
The <hi>Marquesse</hi> upon his return, found a strange rumour spread abroad, as if he were well satisfied with, and did approve of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> so as to vindicate his own reputation, he was compelled to call in aid of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Councel,</hi> and others of the Nobility to be his compurgators. This aspersion being <note place="margin">And again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> as he thought sufficiently wiped off, he presently fals upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Covenanters about the indicting of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, demanding first to know of what members it shou'd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and of what matters it should treat: whereat they flew out into an extreme rage, giving out that these Propositions were destructive to their liberties, and a prelimitation of that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, which ought to be free, and told the <hi>Marquesse, that the Assembly it self should be Iudge both of their own Members, and of the matters whereof it should take cognisance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things put the Commissioner to a plunge, and made him <note place="margin">Proposals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Assembly.</note> explicitely declare his instructions, which were to indict an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but upon concession of these ten <hi>Articles.</hi>

            <p>These <hi>Articles</hi> would no way be condescended to, and the main answer to them was, an appeal to the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> where they were properly to be decided. Upon this refusal the <hi>Commissioner</hi> entertained a resolution of another journey, which the <hi>Covenanters</hi> understanding, they bruited abroad amongst their adherents, that he neither had power from the <hi>King,</hi> nor any inclination in himself to give the people any satisfaction: which seemingly so incensed him, that he contracted all his former Propositions into these two,</p>

               <hi>Then I will presently indict a</hi> General Assembly, <hi>and promise, upon mine Honour, immediately after to call a</hi> Parliament.</p>
            <p>These propositions put the <hi>Covenanters</hi> into such a fit of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as they presently gave order for a General Assembly, but when the fit was off, and they began to cool, upon second thoughts they conceived it meet to forbeat, untill the Commissioner should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>King,</hi> with a more pleasing answer, for which they limited him to the 21. of <hi>September</hi> next; promising, in the interim, not to proceed to election.</p>

Counsellors then present, and persuing the advice of his Councel in <hi>Scotland,</hi> resolved, as he thought, upon a way which would not leave any remnants of discontent, and sent back the <hi>Marquesse</hi> with ample instructions agreeable to it, who returned within his time limited, but found the <hi>Covenanters</hi> had given order for an <hi>Election</hi> to be on the 22. of <hi>September,</hi> the very next day after that prefixt; this the Commissioner interpreted to be a kinde of equivocation, but would take no notice of it, but according to his instruction on that 22. of <hi>September,</hi> assembling the Councel, delivered them a letter from the King, acquainting them with what course he meant to persue for the benefit of that Kirk and State. Then he appointed the <hi>Kings</hi> Declaration to be read; <note place="margin">The Kings gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</note> wherein he nulled the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> the <hi>High Commission,</hi> discharged the pressing of the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> Ordered that all persons whatsoever, Ecclesiastical or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, should be lyable to censure of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi> That no other Oath be administred to Ministers at their entry, but what was contained in the Act of Parliament. That the ancient Confession of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Band</hi> thereunto annexed, should be suscribed and renewed, as it was in his Fathers time. That a <hi>General Assembly</hi> be holden at <hi>Glasgew, November</hi> the 21. 1638. and a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the 15. of <hi>May,</hi> 1639. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he pardoned all by-gone offences, and indicted a General Fast.</p>
            <p>Immediately after this Declaration published, the <hi>Confession</hi> of Faith was read, and subscribed by the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Councel. Then a Proclamation for the <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> next another for the Parliament. And lastly were proclaimed an Act of the Lords of the Councel, requiring a general subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Confession of Faith, and a Commission directed to divers for taking the subscription.</p>
            <p>These Acts of Regal authority being past; the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Protested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.</note> their usual mode, brought up the rear with a Protest, wherein they moved the people <hi>to consider with whom they were to deal,</hi> and mightily de-cry'd the new subscription to the confession of <hi>Faith,</hi> excepted against the Archbishops and Bishops, as not to have any votes in the Assembly.</p>
            <p>This done, they proceeded to Election of Commissioners for the Assembly, and first issued Orders from their Table, <hi>That every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish should send to the Presbytery of their limit one Lay man, whom they called an Ruling Elder, who should have equal vote with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in the Presbytery.</hi> Then they stept on, and moved the Commissioner, that he would grant out Warrants of citation against the Archbishops and Bishops to appeir at the Assembly, as <hi>Rei,</hi> or guilty persons; which he refusing, they presently framed a <hi>Bill</hi> of complaint against them, charging them with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95383:82"/>
many mis-demeanors. This <hi>Bill</hi> was presented to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which <hi>October</hi> the 24. thereupon warn'd them all to compeer, at the next <hi>General Assembly</hi> to be holden at <hi>Glasgow, November</hi> the 21.</p>
            <p>The day of the Assembly being come, the <hi>Marquesse</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <note place="margin">Bishops Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against the Assembly.</note> was read in the afternoon, and nothing else done conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably that day. The next day a <hi>Declinator</hi> and <hi>Protestation</hi> was presented to the Commissioner, in the name of the Archbishops and Bishops, against the Assembly, and containing a Nullity of it. But it was denyed to be read, whereupon the <hi>Commissioner</hi> entred a <hi>Protestation</hi> against the refusal of it, and took instruments thereupon. The main cause of this refusal, was pretended to be, because nothing could be done, untill the Moderator were chosen, which was their next work: but when he was elected, and the Commissioner offered again the Declinator to be read, then they reply'd, that the Assembly must first be fully constituted. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this they proceeded to debate of the Elections, which they did with so cautelous a scrutiny, as they left no man standing in the quality of a Commissioner, who was not clearly agreeable to their minde. Though the admission of <hi>Lay Elders</hi> past not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some high contest. Many places (even the Presbytery of <hi>Glasgow</hi> for one) protesting against the legality of their <hi>Session;</hi> which was also the deeper resented by the <hi>Commissioner,</hi> because the <hi>King</hi> having nominated six <hi>Lords</hi> of his Privy Councel to be Assessors to his Commissioner in that Assembly, they absolutely refused to entertain them, or allow their suffrage, affirming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that <hi>were the King himself present, he should have but one vote, and that no negative one neither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commissioner concluding from these premises, that no good was like to be done by continuing the Assembly longer, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> the 28. consulted with the Councel about its dissolution, and it being agreed in the affirmative, he went to the Assembly, and told them,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are now about to settle the lawfulnesse of this Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, and the competency of it against</hi> Bishops, <hi>neither of which I can allow; I am glad I have seen this</hi> Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>met, a thing which was supposed his Majesty never intended, and for the further clearing the integrity of his intentions, let this Paper which I deliver to the</hi> Clerk <hi>to be read hear witnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The paper being read by the <hi>Clerk,</hi> was a <hi>Declaration</hi> the same in every substantial point with the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> discharging the <hi>Service Book, Book</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Declaration</hi> soon after
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95383:83"/>
the reading, was signed by the <hi>Commissioner,</hi> and required to be entred into the Books of the <hi>Assembly;</hi> Provided that this <hi>Act</hi> of Registring this <hi>Declaration,</hi> should be no approbation of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of this <hi>Assembly,</hi> to the dissolution whereof he was next to <note place="margin">The general Assembly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</note> proceed, and therefore <hi>protested,</hi> that whatsoever should be done or said in it, should not be obligatory, or be reputed an Act of a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly.</hi> The very night of the dissolution of this <hi>Assembly,</hi> the <hi>Commissioner</hi> assembled the <hi>Councel</hi> to draw up a <hi>Proclamation</hi> for dissolving it, which being resolved upon, was subscribed by <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argile</hi> declares for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters.</note> all, but the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> who began now to shew himself for the <hi>Covenanters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proclamation</hi> being formed, and published, <hi>Nov.</hi> 29 was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with a <hi>Protestation</hi> of the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> That it is lawful for them to sit still, and continue the Assembly, and that they would still adhere to all their former Protestations; and accordingly pursuing the tenor of their Protestation; presently declared six former General <hi>Assemblies,</hi> (which they thought would dis-serve them) to be null, deprived all the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and some they excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and soon after abolished <hi>Episcopacy</hi> it self as inconsistent with the laws of that Church. And the Commissioner being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in discontent for <hi>England,</hi> began might and main to levy <note place="margin">Covenanters begin to arm.</note> Souldiers, to impose taxes, to raise fortifications, to block up some and seise others of the <hi>Kings</hi> Castles, and to prepare for Warre.</p>
            <p>Now because this Warre was the <hi>Epoche,</hi> the Nativity day from whence all the series of this Kings troubles are to be computed, and all for the advancement of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> it may perhaps give satisfaction to some if I deliver the first rise, the motions, the processes thereof, and how it contracted such power within this Isle.</p>
            <p>It was this year an exact Century since <hi>Calvin</hi> first set his <note place="margin">The rise and growth of Presbytery.</note> foot into <hi>Geneva,</hi> where the <hi>Bishop</hi> being expelled, necessary it was some other Government should be succenturiated in stead of the former. <hi>Calvin</hi> being of high esteem there, the contrivance thereof was committed to his care. He observing the Town <hi>Democratical</hi> in the <hi>Civil,</hi> thought an <hi>Ecclesiastical state</hi> elemented of respondent principles, would sure best: upon which consideration he formed a <hi>Consistory</hi> of <hi>Elders,</hi> whereof a great part were Lay. And these were to manage all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical concernments. Famous was he for this new-model, no lesse then <hi>Columbus</hi> for his <hi>America,</hi> nor was it enough it was reputed a prudent institution, it must also be entituled to <hi>Divine,</hi> and Sacred Scripture tortured to declare as much. Most kind reception it found with the <hi>Gallican,</hi> and <hi>Belgique Churches.</hi> Where planted and setled, the next design was to dispatch it over into <hi>Great Britain;</hi> to which effect <hi>Beza</hi> writes a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95383:83"/>
complying Epistle Commendatory to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Geneva</hi> Plat-form, as the only <hi>desideratum</hi> wanting to <hi>Englands</hi> Reformation. The <hi>Queen</hi> was loath to proscribe so long a standard as <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> to entertain such an upstart in-mate as <hi>Presbytery,</hi> therefore gave <hi>Beza</hi> his saying, but not his desire; this was <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. And shortly after not only <hi>She,</hi> but the <hi>hole Parliament</hi> (whereof some members began now to incline to the Disciplinarian Sect) were summoned again by <hi>Libels,</hi> called, <hi>An Admonition to the Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Defence of that Admonition,</hi> to the Abolition of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian. But all this notwithstanding both <hi>She</hi> and her <hi>Pan-Anglium,</hi> or great Councel, stood fixt and inexorable, so that all the efforts and attempts of the other party, could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any considerable unsettlement of that ancient discipline. In <hi>Scotland</hi> true it is, the new projected model prospered better; for the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> or rather the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> (base brother to the <hi>Queen)</hi> with his complices, <hi>Knox, Buchannan</hi> and others in their first Reformation, about <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. gave so terrible a shock to Popery, as made every thing, and by consequence Episcopacy, which stood neer it, to reel. Which neverthelesse held them tug a skore of years, nor could they supplant it all at once, but gained upon it by degrees. First an Assembly at <hi>Dundee, Anno</hi> 1580. Ordered <hi>all Bishops upon pain of Excommunication, to resign up their Offices;</hi> and about three years after prevailed with the <hi>Parliament</hi> (the <hi>King</hi> being then in Minority) to annex their Temporalities to the <hi>Crown.</hi> Though this was acted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet was it not without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation from <hi>England,</hi> and from some of her prime Nobility, animated by some Ministers who began to be now so pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and busie, as to preserve Ecclesiastical unity, the then Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> by command from the <hi>Queen</hi> that very year contrived those three eminent Articles in the late <hi>Canons,</hi> whereto all who desired to enter into sacred <hi>Orders</hi> were strictly enjoyned subscription. <hi>The first acknowledging the Queenes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The second, professing conformity to the Book of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, and approbation of the book of ordering of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. And the third assenting to the thirty nine Articles of the Church of England.</hi> Nor was the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy thus quite outed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but somewhat revived again by the Parliament, ratifying the Clergy as the third Estate, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. But the other party being resolved never to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce, untill they obtained their minds, grew so impetuous as they, I cannot say perswaded, but even forced that State <hi>Anno</hi> 1592. to ratifie their Discipline. Thus did <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> play <hi>Leve-le-queve,</hi> and take their turns of Government for about 30 years; but in the year 1598. <hi>King Iames,</hi> the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95383:84"/>
Queen of <hi>England</hi> now declining, hoping his wardship to these hot spirits began now to exspire, took up resolutions of animosity, and caused the Prelates to be restored to their ancient vote in Parliament, and published his Book called <hi>Basilicon Doron,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing therein no great good will to the Consistorian Sect. And though <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. upon his first accession to the <hi>English</hi> Crown, he was saluted here with a Petition, pretended of a thousand Ministers, that they might appear the more formidable, yet did he slight their boldnesse, and in <hi>Scotland</hi> by severall Acts of a Pirliament rescinded what had formerly been introduced to the prejudce of Episcopacy, so that from 1589. untill this present, the Presbyters durst never appear in opposition.</p>

For they did not like her train, and followers, which had often been observed to be the Sword, or Pestilence, so that she was beheld as some meteor of ill signification. Nor was one of these cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities thought more the effect of her fortune, then inclination, for her restlesse and uncessant spirit was prone to imbroyl all whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she came. Her impetuous banding and combining with <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the improsperity of that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise made <hi>France</hi> too hot for her, and drave her in the year 1631. to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> where the Cardinal <hi>D' Infanta</hi> treated her a while with most honorable caresses and respects, but <hi>Flanders</hi> which at first seemed her place of <hi>Refuge,</hi> became afterward her greatest danger, she being (as her own <hi>Manifesto</hi> sets forth) so hunted and pursued with continual imprecations and curses there, as she began to fear some violence to her Person, so that quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Countrey, she betook herself to the protection of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> 1637. long she staid not there, but having received an invitation from the <hi>Queen</hi> her daughter she resorted hither.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> perceiving the <hi>Scots</hi> meditated nothing but war, <note place="margin">The King raiseth an Army.</note> thought it slender policy to strain curtesie with them, and to yeeld them the start, therefore by the advice of the Archbishop hastned the levies both of men and monies with all possible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and because it was the <hi>Bishops war,</hi> he thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite they should contribute largely towards the preservation of their own <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and accordingly orders were issued from the Lords of the Councel to the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> commanding them to send forth directions to all the Bishops within their Provinces, to convene the Clergy of their <hi>Dioceses,</hi> and to invite them to a liberal aid. What the precise product of the Clergy offerings was is not material to insert, nor could my information reach it, only it is presumable it was very ample,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95383:84"/>
so as with that and the spontaneous contributions of divers of <note place="margin">Ann.

               <hi>Iune</hi> the 18. the <hi>King</hi> signed his Declaration, and the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters</hi> their Articles: This pacification did at first generally excite exceeding great tokens of joy, wherein none had more reason to be sincere then poor <hi>Aberden;</hi> for the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ross,</hi> General of the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> was that very time march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards that <hi>University,</hi> with a Commission to consume it by fire to ashes, upon suggestion that the Inhabitants had falsified their Oathes.</p>
            <p>The Declaration and Articles being signed, and affairs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying so calm a front of peace, the <hi>King</hi> had intentions of being present at the General Assembly; but this lucid interval proved but a weather-breeder, and the apprehensions of a <hi>Pacification,</hi> were soon transformed into an opinion that they were but dreams, inward hostility appearing through the diaphanous body of all the <hi>Scots</hi> actions.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Declaration</hi> was no sooner published, but at that very <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters still refractary.</note> hour the Covenanters produced a <hi>Protestation.</hi> First, of adhering to their late <hi>General Assembly</hi> at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> as a full and free As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of their <hi>Kirk,</hi> and to all the proceedings there, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the sentences of deprivation and excommunication of the, sometimes pretended, Bishops of that Kingdom.

            <p>Nor did they punctually perform any one <hi>Article:</hi> For they still kept their Officers in constant pay; they did not slight their Fortification at <hi>Leith,</hi> distant a mile from <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> they still continued their meetings and consultations; they still disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, molested, and frighted all of different inclinations.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95383:85"/>
which was worst of all, they dispersed a scandalous libel, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Some conditions of his Majesties Treaty with his Subjects of</hi> Scotland, <hi>before the</hi> English <hi>Nobility, are set down here for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:</hi> what these conditions were, I never could learn, but they being delivered into the hands of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, whereof some had been Commissioners, they dis-avowed any such consent of his Majesty in their hearing, and by an Act of Councel the <hi>papers</hi> were appointed to be burnt by the Hangman.</p>
            <p>Matters being in this doubtful posture, the <hi>King</hi> had little minde to see himself affronted, and thought these distempered disorders would be better born at a distance; therefore towards the latter end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> he plyes him home to <hi>England. August</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The generall assembly meet.</note> the 6. according to the <hi>Kings</hi> indiction, the <hi>Assembly</hi> met and sate at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and continued until the 24.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Assembly</hi> now risen, the <hi>Parliament</hi> being prorogued to <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assemble.</note> 
               <hi>August</hi> the last convened. The first four dayes produced an high debate about chusing the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Articles;</hi> in regard <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was abolished. The ancient usage was constantly this. The <hi>King</hi> first named eight <hi>Bishops;</hi> then those <hi>Bishops</hi> chose eight <hi>Noblemen;</hi> those <hi>Noblemen</hi> chose so many <hi>Barons;</hi> and these the like number of <hi>Burgesses:</hi> these thirty two, with eight Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Crown, made up a compleat <hi>Committee</hi> of forty, who were to consider upon such <hi>Articles</hi> as were to be voted in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and this <hi>Committee</hi> were called <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Articles.</hi> Now the <hi>Kings Commissioner</hi> demanded, that seeing the <hi>King</hi> anciently had the nomination of eight <hi>Bishops,</hi> his <hi>Majesty</hi> might not be prejudiced in his right by their expulsion, but that he might have the choice of the eight Noblemen: which the <hi>Parliament</hi> yeelded to for this once, but voted for the future every State should chuse their own Commissioners.</p>
            <p>Then they entered into consideration of constituting the <hi>Third</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Incroach upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</note> Estate, and what succenturiation, what supplement should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon in the lieu of <hi>Bishops;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> urged the having of fourteen laicks, of such as were called <hi>Abbats</hi> and <hi>Priors,</hi> to represent the third <hi>Estate;</hi> but the <hi>Parliament</hi> voted, That Estate should be compleated by small <hi>Barons,</hi> who represented the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty. Next they fell upon forming an Act <hi>Rescissory,</hi> whereby former Acts concerning the Judicatory of the Exchequer; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Prexies,</hi> and concerning confirmation of Ward-lands should be nulled.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> finding such pertinacity of endevours, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <note place="margin">Is prorogued.</note> abuses, but to new-model a <hi>Government,</hi> and totally to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95383:86"/>
eclipse his <hi>Regal</hi> power, gave speedy Order to his <hi>Commissioner,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> to prorogate the <hi>Parliament</hi> untill the 2. of <hi>Iune</hi> next: which command being signified by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> they presently entred into a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein they positively affirmed, that this <hi>Prorogation</hi> was in-effectual in Law, and of no force, it being made without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of <hi>Parliament;</hi> that they might justifie their sitting still, yet out of their reverend regard to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved for the present only to make remonstrance to him, of the reasons of their propositions, and proceedings in this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that if it should happen, that after their Romonstrance, their Enemies should prevail by false suggestions against their Informations, that then it should not be to them an imputation, that they were constrained to take such course as might best se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Kingdome,</hi> from the extremity of confusion and misery.</p>
            <p>After, and as a consequent of this Declaration, they sent their Deputies the Earl of <hi>Dunfermlin,</hi> and the Lord <hi>London,</hi> to present their Remonstrance. When the Commissioner came to the Court to make report of the proceedings of that Parliament, and the <hi>King</hi> appointed a select <hi>Committee</hi> of his Councel, to heat both the one and the other; many very fierce and fiery recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations there were counter-changed between the <hi>Commissioner</hi> and <hi>Deputies.</hi> But the Deputies insisted not at all upon quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but direct justification of all the Assemblies and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> transactions, so far as they desired ratification of their constitutions; which the Committee thought could not be granted without lessening the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Authority, and then concluded that the <hi>Covenanters</hi> were no way reducible but by force. Thus stood matters between the King and them about the beginning of <hi>December.</hi>

            <p>And now it is high time for me to change my quarters, and for a while to visit <hi>England,</hi> and to survey the most noble parcels of occurrences there.</p>
            <p>About the later end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Prince <hi>Elector</hi> arrived here, <note place="margin">The Prince <hi>Elector</hi> his ill successe.</note> into whose ensuing mis-fortunes I shall introduce you by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of a late by-past adventure hitherto supprest, through the interposition of the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> troubles. The <hi>Prince,</hi> with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rupert,</hi> had the last year gathered together in <hi>Holland</hi> a considerable beginning of an Army, with these they advanced into <hi>Westphalia,</hi> and sate down before <hi>Lemgea;</hi> whereof <hi>Hatz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> General of the Imperialists, having notice, came speedily upon them, enforced them both to rise, and fight, and in the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter slew two thousand of the <hi>Paltzgraves</hi> party, took Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> and the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> Prisoners, the <hi>Prince Elector</hi> very narrowly escaping. The Prince thus despoyled even of his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95383:86"/>
very hopes, indulged himself for the present a total repose of all designs tending toward his restauration. Now it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning that the last moneth Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> (that Heroique Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander) dyed, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> advised this Prince to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to his Uncle the King of <hi>England</hi> for his assistance, and therewith to enter upon the head of Duke <hi>Barnards</hi> Army. But the <hi>King</hi> told him his home affairs were in that doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as he feared they might require all the force he could command, but in regard the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador was then here, he promised to use the utmost of his interest with that <hi>King</hi> for his re-investing, and accordingly told the Ambassador, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised his Nephew to apply himself to his Master, and to joyn in League with him, and assured him what assistance he could spare. The Ambassador seemed to be very well pleased with the offer, and perswaded his <hi>Majesty,</hi> that the Cardinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> who was the grand directer of all the <hi>French</hi> Councels, would be glad to serve his <hi>Majesty</hi> or his Nephew, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispatcht letters of intimation to the Cardinal. But in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim of this Treaty, in <hi>November</hi> the Prince was most unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly advised to passe through <hi>France</hi> in a disguise, and so to come clandestinely to the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army: But the plot was not so closely carryed, but he was more then once discovered; for when he passed by the <hi>Kings</hi> Fleet at the <hi>Downes,</hi> he was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with a volee of shot, and the ship which landed him at <hi>Boullen</hi> discharged all her Ordinance; from <hi>Boullen</hi> he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and so to <hi>Lions,</hi> where meeting with the Gentleman who was sent from the Ambassadour, he was discovered, and he denying himself, arrested. This the King of <hi>France</hi> took as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of no fair intentions towards him, and as a most perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part in a time of <hi>Treaty,</hi> so that he was kept a great while in the nature of a Prisoner, with a strict guard both of Horse and Foot about him.</p>
            <p>But the grand businesse of this Summer, was a terrible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter between the two Fleets of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> in the <hi>Downs.</hi> The relation whereof from Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington</hi> was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet consisting of neer seventy sail, bound and <note place="margin">Engagement between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the <hi>Downes.</hi>
               </note> designed for <hi>Dunkirk</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with a recrute both of men and money, met with the Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, having in his company seventeen tall ships, <hi>September</hi> the 7. and entred a very fierce dispute between them, untill the <hi>Hollander</hi> perceiving himself too weak, got to the wind-ward, sailing along with them towards <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> continually fiering their Ordinance to give warning to their Admiral, who lay before <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with the residue of the Fleet; in this encounter the <hi>Hollander</hi> had two ships sunk: the next morning by two of the clock, the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95383:87"/>
               <hi>Admiral</hi> came up, and joyning with the Vice-Admiral, between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calais,</hi> they set upon the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> and continued a very sharp fight till past noon, wherein they had much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having taken two Gallions, sunk another, and much shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the rest, though they were but twenty five sail, to the <hi>Spanyards</hi> sixty and upwards, and at length forced them upon the <hi>English</hi> coast neer <hi>Dover;</hi> where they left them, and ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e off for the coast of <hi>France,</hi> not willing to attempt any thing against them within the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> liberties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanyards</hi> being now got, as they thought, under the lee of <hi>Englands</hi> protection, began to plot how to get rid of their bad neighbours. And the <hi>Spanish Resident</hi> importuned the <hi>King,</hi> that he would keep the <hi>Hollander</hi> in subjection two tydes, that in the interim they might have the opportunity of shipping away for <hi>Spain;</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> being in amity with them both, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to stand neuter, and whereas the <hi>Spanyards</hi> had hired some <hi>English</hi> ships to transport their souldiers to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> upon complaint of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embassadour, strictly commanded that none should take in any <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor passe beyond <hi>Graves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end</hi> without License; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> plotting a great while counter the one to the other, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> at length somewhat outwitted his Enemy, and by a strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem in the night conveyed away fourteen <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ships, and in them four thousand men.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> the King sent the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> to the Admiral of <hi>Spain, Don Antonio D' Oquendo,</hi> desiring him to retreat upon the first fair winde, because he would not they should engage within his Seas; but the winde continued Eastwardly so long (a thing not usual at that season) as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had daily fresh supply from <hi>Zealand,</hi> so that at length their <hi>Armado</hi> was compleated to an hundred ships, wherewith they encompassed their Enemies within pistol shot for some dayes. But that which was so long an enterview of these two great Fleets, at last turned to an engagement.</p>
            <p>For the 11. of the same moneth <hi>Van Trump</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, charged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with Canon and fire-ships so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as made them all cut their cables, and being fifty three in number, twenty three ran on shoare, and stranded in the <hi>Downes,</hi> whereof three were burnt, two sunk, and two perished on the shore: one of these was a great Gallion the Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Gallatia, Don Andrea de Castro,</hi> and had fifty two brasse pieces of Ordinance: the remainder of the twenty three deserted by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who went to land, were mann'd by the <hi>English</hi> to save them from the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The other thirty <hi>Spanish</hi> ships under the command of the Admiral's <hi>Don Antonio d' Oquendo,</hi> and <hi>Lopus</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> went to Sea, and kept in close order, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95383:87"/>
a great fogge fell upon them, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, interposed betwixt the Admirals and their Fleet, and fought them valiantly till the fogge cleared up, when the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Portugal</hi> began to flame being fired with two <hi>Holland</hi> fire ships, which <hi>D' Oquendo</hi> perceiving, he presently took his course towards <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> with the Admiral of that place and some few ships more, for most of the rest were taken; of these thirty, eleven were sent prisoners into <hi>Holland,</hi> three perished upon the coast of <hi>France,</hi> one neer <hi>Dover,</hi> five sunk in the fight, and only ten escaped. This Narration was sent from <hi>Van Trump</hi> himself to <hi>Ioachimi</hi> the then <hi>Dutch</hi> Agent here.</p>
            <p>The first apparition of this <hi>Armado</hi> upon our Coast, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by Countrey people as a representation of that <hi>Invincible.</hi> One in 88. and that the main design of this, was like that, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion. They thought the imbarquing of twenty five thousand Land-Souldiers, besides Mariners, were too many for a recrute. They thought the Admiral of <hi>Naples</hi> his refusal to shew his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, though required by the <hi>King,</hi> was but of ill significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they wondered that the Town of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> should so much dispute the reception of the four thousand which were conveyed thither, till the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> sent expresse order, had those Forces been designed for their recrute. And this perswasion is so implanted in many, as it is still very difficult to make them unbelieve it: or not knowing, or not considering, that those <hi>Souldiers</hi> were unarmed, very few Officers amongst them, and the hole <hi>Fleet</hi> so poorly accommodated for invasion, as they had not powder enough for their own defensive offence, so that when they lay at anchor in the <hi>Downes, London</hi> was their choice Magazine, from whence they had their constant and daily supply.</p>
            <p>These two potent Enemies, being both friends to <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Brittish</hi> Seas ought by rule of State to have been an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of retreat to secure the weaker from the stronger, not the <hi>scene</hi> of their hostile engagement; and had this presumptuous attempt of the <hi>Hollander</hi> met with a <hi>King,</hi> or in <hi>Times</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temper, it would not, it's like, have been so silently connived at, and their victory might have cost them the losse of <hi>Englands</hi> correspondence. <hi>But Self-denyal is a Christian, not a Martial vertue,</hi> and who is able to resist the temptation of an advantage, whereby he may destroy his foe, upon the nicety of exceeding his just limits? Besides the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> well knew, was of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, as not querulous, so if provoked, very placable; and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his affairs, as well as of his minde, disswaded from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulating the matter with them.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> dyed Sir <hi>Thomas Coventry,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Thomas Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi> dyeth.</note> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> a Dignity he had
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95383:88"/>
fifteen years enjoyed, if it be not more proper to say, That Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had enjoyed him so long, this later age affording not one of every way more apt qualifications for the place. His front and presence bespake a venerable regard, not inferiour to that of any of his Antecessors. His train and suit of followers was disposed agreeably to shun both envy and contempt; not like that of the Vicount <hi>St. Albans,</hi> or the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> whom he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, ambitious, and vain; his Port was state, theirs ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They were indeed the more knowing men, but their learning was extravagant to their Office: Of what concerned his place he knew enough, and which is the main, acted conformable to his knowledge; for in the administration of justice, he was so erect, so in-corrupt, as captious malice stands mute in the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish of his fame: a miracle, the greater when we consider that he was also a <hi>Privy Counsellour.</hi> A trust wherein he served his Master the <hi>King</hi> most faithfully, and the more faithfully, because of all those Councels which did dis-serve his Majesty, he was an earnest disswader, and did much dis-affect those sticklers who laboured to make the <hi>Prerogative</hi> rather tall, then great, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that such men loved the <hi>King</hi> better then <hi>Charles Stewart.</hi> So that although he was a Courtier, and had for his Master a passion most intense, yet had he also alwayes of passion some reserve for the publique welfare. An argument of a free, noble, and right principled minde. For what both Court and Countrey have alwayes held as in-compossible and in-consistent, is in truth erroneous. And no man can be truly <hi>Loyal,</hi> who is not also a good <hi>Patriot,</hi> nor any a good <hi>Patriot,</hi> who is not truly <hi>Loyal.</hi> To this worthy Gentleman succeeded Sir <hi>Iohn Finch</hi> formerly Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scot'sh</hi> Revolters in the state I left them, were not like to meliorate nor to goe lesse in animosity, but every day administred recent matter of discontent, and of somentation to the differences: and every event, of any considerable assise, must be interpreted as configurating and complying with the great <hi>cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It fortuned that <hi>November</hi> the 19. being the <hi>Anniversary</hi> night <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle-wals fall down.</note> of the <hi>Kings</hi> birth-day, a great part of the wals of the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> fell to the ground, with the Canons mounted: which caused such a consternation, such an Alarm in the Castle, as if they had been undermined and surprized; but that was not all, for this casualty upon a time of so much remarque, could then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no other construction from the Grammar of Superstition, then an ominous presage of the ruine of the <hi>Kings</hi> design; especially considering that at that very same night the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners returned from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> so that the dilapidation seemed to import an humble prostration to the idolized <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the craftiest (I say not the wisest) of the Combination,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95383:88"/>
would not trust to such fallacious conjectures; but willing to apprehend, and lay hold of any thing which offered its service to their enterprise, made a politique use thereof, and the <hi>King</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appointed the Lord <hi>Estrich,</hi> Colonel <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">Their repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hindred by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters.</note> of the Castle, to take order for the re-edification of what was lapsed, they refused to permit any materials to be carryed in for reparation: which so incensed the <hi>King,</hi> as he concluded the indignity intolerable, and presently entred into deliberation how to relieve himself by force under this oppression; but with whom he should consult, there lay the difficulty, the transactions of his Councel must be more closely carryed then heretofore, for fear of correspondency with the <hi>Covenanters;</hi> to this end a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Iuncto</hi> for the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> affairs, are selected from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and great care taken, that those <hi>hunting Lords</hi> (as the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> called them) <hi>Pembroke, Salisbury, Holland, &amp;c.</hi> who were Commissioners at the Pacification, be excluded, though <hi>Hammil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was retained, more dangerous, and fallacious then all. At this close and secret Councel, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 5. it was agreed his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> should call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> to assemble <hi>April</hi> the 13. The <hi>King</hi> told them he exceeding well approved of that Councel, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he said, <hi>My Lords, the Parliament cannot suddenly convene, and the subsidies they grant will be so long in levying, as in the interim I may be ruin'd; therefore some speedy course must be thought upon for supplies.</hi> Whereupon the Lords told him they would engage their own credits, and the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> giving the onset, subscribed for twenty thousand pounds; the other Lords had, some the same loyal zeal, and others the modesty not to refuse. The Lords of the Councel did in this example implicitely give a law to the other Nobles, who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conformed most cheerfully, saving some few whom singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, or somewhat more portentous, restrained. Nor staid the project there, but every man must be in the mode. All the Judges, both of the Common and Civil Law, with all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and appendants of their Courts, were sent for not to lend, as they were spontaneously inclined, but to contribute what others had assessed them. But the greatest non-Recusants, were the <hi>Recusants,</hi> who did strive with the forwardest, as ambitious to be reputed the <hi>Kings</hi> most loyal Subjects, and some Preachers were so bold, and withall so in-discreet, to style them so; the truth is, the <hi>Queen</hi> who could not be but equally concern'd in the <hi>Kings</hi> interest, finding they both now had all at stakes, bestir'd herself as eagerly with those her correspondents in religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and imployed Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> to negotiate with the <hi>Romish</hi> Catholiques for a contribution, who yeilded it in a proportion agreeable to their abilities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> thus busie in providing against the <hi>Scots,</hi> (who
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95383:89"/>
began now to be bruited all over <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Rebels)</hi> they were as industrious to form their deportment in so supple a posture, as might de-marque and deface all tokens of so horrid an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They resorted to the <hi>King,</hi> humbly craving leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the state of all their transactions to his <hi>Majesty;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> said, he was accostable by any subject he had, and sure he would not deny that <hi>congeable</hi> accesse to an hole Kingdome, which he was ready to yeeld to any private man: therefore bad them come with confidence of impartial hearing.

            <p>Though this was a <hi>Conclave</hi> secret, communicated to a very few, and kept under a most strict guard, yet did it at length evade from that close captivity, and was by some false Brother discovered to the <hi>King.</hi> His Majesty having had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation with those about him concerning the character, it was at length assured him, that it must be the cheirography of the Lord <hi>Lowden,</hi> whereupon he was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and kept there in close confinement.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>Presbyerian</hi> party stand charged in vulgar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as the principal and most notorious authors of these troubles, yet were they not the only men in the conspiracy, nor must it be thought but others were (though invisibly) accessary fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them: For in case of general disturbance, nothing is more familiar then for several <hi>Factions,</hi> of several, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of contrary inclinations and interests, to protrude and drive on one and the same design, to several intents and purposes. And a foul blemish it would have been to the Mercurialists, to the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> should they have sate out in a work so proper to their imployment (the incitation of <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> to turbulent commotions) as these <hi>Scot'sh</hi> broyls. No, (good men) they slept not all this while, but were as diligent in their machinations as possibly they could be, the external glory of the enterprise their ambition did not reach, but they willingly rendred it up to the Presbyters: hoping in the interim to be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95383:90"/>
the greatest gainers in the product and fruits of their labours.</p>
            <p>How far they were of combination in this plot, though in a more subtile, secret and scarce discovered way, (their usual mode) the ensuing Narrative shall set forth; which I insert, not upon the account of Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> faith, who first made it extant, but because I am further assured of the truth of it, by a more credible person, and one of principal relation to Sir <hi>William Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;</hi> and because it may serve to illustrate some former passages of this History.</p>
            <p>The first discoverer of this Plot was one <hi>Andreas ab Habern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A plot of the Papists disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered against the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Archbishop.</hi>
               </note> a Nobleman of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and Physitian to the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> the <hi>Paltzgraves</hi> relict. This Gentleman by a Confident of his first made it known to Sir <hi>William Boswell,</hi> and by his means addrest himself to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p>Most Illustrious and Reverend Lord,</p>
            <p>We have willingly and cordially perceived that our offers have been acceptable both to his Royal <hi>Majesty,</hi> and likewise to your <hi>Grace.</hi> This is the only index to us, that the blessing of <hi>God</hi> goeth along with you, whereby we are the more extimulated, chearfully and freely to declare and discover those things, whereby the hazard of both your lives, the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Realms both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the tumbling down of his Excellent <hi>Majesty</hi> from his Throne is projected. Now lest the discourse should be enlarged with superfluous circumstances, we will only premise some things which are meerly necessary to the matter.</p>
            <p>First, be it known to them, that this good man, the Informer of the ensuing discoveries, was born and bred in the Pontificial <hi>Religion,</hi> and spent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years in Ecclesiastical Functions. At length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judged a fit person for carrying on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent design, by the advice and command of the Lord Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi> he was made co-adjutor to <hi>Con,</hi> (the then Popes <hi>Nuncio)</hi> to whom he appeared so diligent, and sedulous in his office, that hope of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95383:90"/>
great preserment was given to him; But he guided by a better inspiration, was not wun by those su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar baits, and conscious to himself of the vanities of that <hi>Religion,</hi> (whereof he had sometimes been a strenuous Defender) having also observed the malice of the <hi>Romish</hi> party, found his Conscience much oppressed; for ease whereof he resorted in his belief to the Orthodox <hi>Religion.</hi> And thought it his best way to reveal a plot, tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of so many innocent souls, conceiving his minde would better repose, should he vent what he knew into the bosome of some confiding friend. This done, he was seriously admonished by that friend, to give manifest tokens of his Conversion, and to deliver from imminent danger so many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent souls. To this counsel he willingly consigned himself, and delivered the subsequent matters to writing, whereby the Articles lately presented to your Grace may be clearly explicated and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the main of the businesse may be known, it is to be considered, that all these factions which this day make Christianity reel, have their rise from the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> off-spring of <hi>Cham,</hi> which branch it self into four Orders.</p>
            <p>The first are <hi>Ecclesiasticks;</hi> these take into care the promotions of Religious affairs.</p>
            <p>The second are <hi>Politicians;</hi> their office is to take care for the raising of civil combustions in, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>The third are <hi>Seculars,</hi> who are properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for to intrude into offices of neer relation to the persons of Princes, to infinuate themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to civil affaires of the Court, as bargains, and sales.</p>
            <p>The fourth are men of a lower orb, <hi>Intelligencers,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:95383:91"/>
and spies; then to creep into the services of eminent persons, Princes, Earls, Barons, or the like, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pervert or cheat them.</p>
            <p>A society of so many Orders the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> nourisheth; for scarce all <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> can yeeld so great a multitude of <hi>Iesuites</hi> as <hi>London</hi> alone, where are found more then fifty <hi>Scotch Iesuites;</hi> there the said Society hath elected for it self a seat of iniquity, and hath conspired against the <hi>King</hi> and his greatest confidents, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally against the Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and likewise against both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>For it is most certain, that the said Society hath resolved upon an Universal Reformation in the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the end, necessarily inferreth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the means.</p>
            <p>For promotion therefore of the undertaken villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, this Society is dubbed with the title of <hi>The Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for the propagation of the Faith,</hi> which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> for their Principal, and Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> for his Substitute and Deputy.</p>
            <p>The chief Patron of this Society is the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, who hath special care of the businesse; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bosome this rabble of Traitors weekly depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site their Intelligences. The Residence of this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was obtained at <hi>London,</hi> in the name of the Pope, by whose mediation it might be lawful for Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> to work so much the more easily and safely upon the <hi>King</hi> and Kingdome. For none could so easily circumvent the <hi>King</hi> as he, who should be palliated with the Popes Authority.</p>
            <p>Seignior <hi>Con</hi> was at that time the <hi>Popes</hi> Legate, the Universal Minister of that conjured Society, and a vehement promoter of the plot, whose secrets, as likewise those of all other intelligencers, the present
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95383:91"/>
informer of all these things, did receive and dispatch as the businesse required.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con</hi> tampered with the chief men of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and left nothing unattempted by which he might corrupt them all, and incline them to the <hi>Romish</hi> party: he inticed with many various baits, the very <hi>King</hi> himself, he sought to delude with gifts of Pictures, Antiquities, Idols, and such like trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet prevailed nothing with the King.</p>
            <p>Thus familiarly entertained by the <hi>King</hi> oft at <hi>Hampton-</hi>Court, and at <hi>London,</hi> he was entreated to undertake the cause of the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> that he would interpose his authority, and by interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion perswade the Legate of <hi>Colen,</hi> that the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> (in the next <hi>Diet</hi> for the treating about Peace) might be inserted into the conditions; which he promised, but performed the contrary. He intimated indeed, that he had been solicited by the <hi>King</hi> to such an effect, but did not advise any such consent, left peradventure the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should say that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> did patronize an heretical Prince.</p>
            <p>In the interim <hi>Con,</hi> smelling from the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, (the <hi>Kings most</hi> Confident) that the <hi>Kings</hi> minde was altogether pendulous, and doubtful, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to move every stone, and bend all his strength to gain him to his side; being confident he had prepared the means. For he had a command to make offer of a Cardinals Cap to the Lord <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> in the name of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he should allure him also with higher promises, that he might corrupt his sincere minde. Yet a fitting occasion was never offered whereby he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate himself into the Lord Archbishop, to whom free accesse was to be impetrated by the Earl
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95383:92"/>
and Countesse of <hi>Arundel,</hi> as also by Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> all whose intercessions he neglected, and did shun (as it were the Plague) the company or familiarity of <hi>Con.</hi> He was also solicited by others of no mean rank, well known to him, and yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued immoveable.</p>
            <p>Trial also was made of another, Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> who impeded accesse to the detestable design; an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy he was to the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> whose accesse to the <hi>King</hi> he obstructed. He treated many of them as they deserved, he searcht into their factions, by which means every incitement breathing an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power to the <hi>Romish</hi> Catholiques was ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual with him; for nothing was so dear to him as his own innocence: whence being rendred odious to the conspirators, he was in perpetual hazard of losing his <hi>Place,</hi> which being laboured for three years, was at length obtained.</p>
            <p>But for all this the <hi>King</hi> had left him a knotty peece, for the Lord <hi>Archbishop</hi> by his constancy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself as an immoveable rock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Con</hi> and his party finding the Lord <hi>Archbishop</hi> so impregnable, and that they laboured in vain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to boyl with malice, and to plot how the Lord <hi>Archbishop</hi> together with the <hi>King</hi> should be taken.</p>
            <p>Sentence also is passed against the <hi>King</hi> (who was the main concernment in the Plot) because nothing is hoped from him which might seem to promote the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, but especially when he had once declared himself that he was of the minde, that any good and pious man may be saved in his own Religion.</p>
            <p>To act the Treason undertaken, the criminal execution at <hi>Westminster,</hi> caused by some Puritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writing, gave the first spark; a thing so much
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95383:92"/>
exasperated and exaggerated by the Papists and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, that if it went unrevenged it would be thought a blemish to their Religion, the flames of which fire the subsequent <hi>Liturgie</hi> encreased.</p>
            <p>In this heat a certain <hi>Scottish</hi> Earl, one <hi>Maxwel,</hi> if I mistake not, was dispatcht to the <hi>Scots</hi> by the <hi>Popish</hi> party, with whom two other <hi>Scottish</hi> Earls were correspondents, he was to excite the people to commotion: He was to raise commotions, to re-inforce the sense of every injury, and to spur on the people to rebellion, whereby the great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> liberty might be destroy'd.</p>
            <p>There by one labour snares are laid for the <hi>King,</hi> for which purpose the affair was so ordered, that very many <hi>English</hi> should adhere to the <hi>Scots.</hi> That the <hi>King</hi> should be inferiour to them in Armes, whereby he might be inforced to crave aid from the Papists, which yet should be denyed him, unlesse he would descend to conditions, by which he should permit a general toleration of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, which was the thing the Papists did aim at. And should he be difficultly brought to such tearms, there was a remedy hoped for.</p>
            <p>For the young <hi>Prince</hi> (who from his Cradle was educated in advantage to the <hi>Romish</hi> perswasion) growing on fast in his youthful age, the <hi>Kings</hi> death was contrived by an <hi>Indian</hi> Nut, stuffed with a most fierce poyson, kept in the Society, (which <hi>Con</hi> then shewed me in a boasting manner) and prepared for him, as there was another for his Father.</p>
            <p>During the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> troubles, the Marquess of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> was often imployed by the <hi>King</hi> as Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner to compose disorders there, and pacific the discontented party, but returned as often without fruit. His Chaplain repaired at that time to us, and had secret conference with <hi>Con.</hi> of whom I
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95383:93"/>
demanded in jest, <hi>Whether</hi> also <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>agreed with the</hi> Samaritans; To which <hi>Con</hi> answered, <hi>I would to God all Ministers were like him;</hi> you may conjecture of this as you please.</p>
            <p>Things standing thus there came to <hi>London</hi> from Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Chamberlain</hi> his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain and <hi>Almner,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> by Nation, who was to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Colledge of confederacy to advance the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and to attempt all wayes of exasperating the first heat: for this service a Bishoprick was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him. Four months space he co-habited with the Society, nor was he permitted to depart, until matters succeeding as he wished, he might return with good news.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> a Jesuited Priest of the Order of Politicians, the most vigilant of the chief Heads, (who never went to bed, but got a nap of an hour or two in a chair) day and night plotted mischief. A man principally noxious, and the very Plague both of <hi>King</hi> and Kingdome, a man most impudent, hunting all feasts called or not called, never quiet, alwayes in action and perpetual motion. Intruding into the company of all his betters, pressing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses whereby to fish out mens inclinations; whatsoever he sucketh from thence either of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or noxious to the conspiracy, he impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Pope's <hi>Legate,</hi> reserving the most secret intelligence for the Pope himself, or the Cardinal <hi>Barbarino.</hi> In short, he associates himself with any, not a word can be spoken but he layes hold of it, and accommodates it to his turn. In the interim all his observations he reduceth into a Catalogue, and every Summer carrieth it to the generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory of the Jesuites Politiques, which privately meet in the Province of <hi>Wales,</hi> where he is a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guest. There are Councels closely hammered
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95383:93"/>
which are fittest for the ruining of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique and Politique state of both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Read</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Long-Acre</hi> street neer the <hi>Angel</hi> Tavern, a Secular Jesuite, who for his detestable service performed (in perverting of a certain Minister of the Church, with secret intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the Popish Religion, with all his Family, taking his daughter to wife) obtained as a reward an impost upon butter paid by the Countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, procured for him from the <hi>King</hi> by some chief men of the Society, who never want a spur where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be constantly detained in his Office. In his house the whole plot is contrived, where the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which hath conspired against the <hi>King,</hi> the Lord <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and both Kingdomes, convene: but on the day of the Post's dispatch they meet in greater numbers; for then all their informers assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and confer their notes together; and that they may be the lesse suspected, convey all their secrets by <hi>Toby Mathew,</hi> or <hi>Read</hi> himself to the Popes <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> who transmits the pacquet of Intelligence to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the same <hi>Read</hi> are entrusted the Letters brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> under forged titles and names, and by him delivered to whom they belong; for all their names are known to him.</p>
            <p>Upon the same occasion Letters are also brought over under the covert of Father <hi>Philip</hi> (though he be ignorant of the plot) who distributeth them to the Conspirators.</p>
            <p>In that very house there is a publique Chappel, wherein an Ordinary Jesuite consecrates, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. In this Chappel Masses are daily said by the Jesuites, and the children of some of the Domestiques, and some Conspirators are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:95383:94"/>
They who meet there come often in Coaches, or a horseback in Laymens habit, and with a great train, wherewith they are disguised from notice, yet are Jesuites and Members of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie.</p>
            <p>All the Papists of <hi>England</hi> contribute to this <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,</hi> lest any thing should be wanting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the enterprise, upon whose treasury a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow owner of the Houses where now Secretary <hi>Windebank</hi> dwelleth, and dead above three years since, conferred forty thousand pounds, and for the driving on of the businesse others contribute as they are able.</p>
            <p>Besides the foresaid Houses, there are also other close Conventicles kept, but very distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of themselves, lest they should be discovered. First every of them (one not knowing of the other) are directed to certain Innes, and thence led by spies to the place of meeting, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ignorant of the place for feare of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
            <p>The Countesse of <hi>Arundel,</hi> a strenuous she-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith, bends all her powers for this Universal Reformation, nothing is done secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or openly at Court, but she imparts it to the <hi>Legate,</hi> with whom she meets thrice a day, sometimes at <hi>Arundels</hi> house, now at <hi>Court,</hi> or at <hi>Tari-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> himself being called about three years since, this year must goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> without doubt to consult there of matters pertinent to the design.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Greenwich,</hi> at the <hi>Earls</hi> cost, a feminine School is erected, which is but a Monastery of <hi>Nuns;</hi> for the young Girles therein are sent forth, hither, and thither, into forain Monasteries beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:95383:94"/>
Master <hi>Porter</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> Bed-Chamber, most addicted to the Popish Religion, is an utter enemy of the <hi>Kings,</hi> revealing all his secrets to the <hi>Legate</hi> by his Wife; for he rarely meets with him himself. In all his actions he is nothing inferiour to <hi>Toby Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> it is unexpressible how diligently he intends this businesse.</p>
            <p>His sons are secretly principled in the <hi>Romish</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but open Professors of the <hi>Reformed:</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest is now to receive his Fathers place under the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>King:</hi> A Cardinals hat is provided for the other, if the plot takes.</p>
            <p>Three years since, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was to be sent away by the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Morocco:</hi> But was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the Society, lest the businesse should suffer delay.</p>
            <p>He is a Patron of the Jesuites, providing Chappels for them to exercise their Religion in, both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>Secretary <hi>Windebank</hi> a fierce Papist, is the greatest Traitor to the <hi>King</hi> of all. He not only revealeth the <hi>Kings</hi> greatest secrets, but also communicates counsels by which the design may be best advanced. He at least thrice every week converseth with the <hi>Legate</hi> in the Nocturnal Conventicles, and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is fit to be known: to which end he hireth an house neer to the Popes <hi>Legate,</hi> to whom he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten resorts through the Garden door; for by this vicinity the meeting is facilitated. He is bribed with gifts to be a partner in the Conspiracy, by whom he is sustained, that he may more sedulously attend his charge; His son is sent expresly to <hi>Rome,</hi> on purpose to insinuate himself into his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> Knights, Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> who hath been at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sterlin,</hi> a Kinsman
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95383:95"/>
of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> a Knight, the Countesse of <hi>New-port,</hi> the Dutchesse of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, who have sworn to this Conspiracy, are all most vigilant in the plot: Some are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed with hope of Court, others of Political Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; others attend to the sixteen Cardinals caps vacant, which are detained, so to feed with vain hopes those who expect them.</p>
            <p>The President of the said Society was the Lord <hi>Gage,</hi> a Jesuited Priest, dead some three years since. He had a Palace adorned with wanton pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures as pretending to profanenesse, but palliating thereby a Monastery, wherein forty Nunnes were maintained, concealed in so spacious a Palace. It is situated in <hi>Queens</hi> street. The Jesuites have bought all this street, and have reduced it to a quadrangle, where a Jesuitical Colledge is tacitely built, with this hope, that it might be openly finisht assoon as the General Reformation was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht.</p>
            <p>The Popes <hi>Legate</hi> useth a threefold Character, one common to all <hi>Nuncio's.</hi> Another peculiar to himself and Cardinal <hi>Barbarino.</hi> A third where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he covers some greater secrets to be imparted. Whatsoever things he receiveth from the Society, or spies, he packeth up in one bundle, with this addresse, <hi>To Monsieur Stravio Archdeacon of Cambrai;</hi> from whom they are sent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These particulars considered, it will be evident to all,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Conspiracy against the <hi>King</hi> and Lord <hi>Archbishop</hi> is detected, and the means threatning ruin to them both is demonstrated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The imminent dangers to both Kingdomes is declared.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The rise and progresse of the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> fire is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>

               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:95383:95"/>
4. Means are suggested whereby their troubles may be appeased; for after the <hi>Scots</hi> shall see by whom, and to what intents their spirits are provoked, they will speedily look to themselves, neither will they suffer the Forces of both Kingdomes to be subdued, lest a middle party interpose, which seek the ruin of both.</p>
            <p n="5">5. With what sword the <hi>Kings</hi> Throat is assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even when these stirs shall be ended, <hi>Cons</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and visible demonstration sheweth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The place of Assembly in Captain <hi>Reads</hi> house is named.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The eight dayes dispatch by <hi>Read,</hi> and the Legate is described.</p>
            <p n="8">8. How the names of the Conspirators may be known.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Where this hole Congregation may be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented.</p>

            </p>
            <p>If these things be warily proceeded in, the strength of the hole businesse will be brought to light, so the arrow being foreseen, the danger shall be avoided, which that it may prosperously succeed, the <hi>Almighty</hi> Creator grant.</p>
            <p>They who will diligently compare this Information with what <note place="margin">An objection answered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the discovery.</note> hath conformably occurred in the preceding part of these <hi>Annals,</hi> and shall withall well consider the practices both ancient and modern of these pragmaticall spirits, will finde cause enough to think there was in it somewhat more then fiction, and that it may make some impression upon faith, without setting it upon the rack. Only one objection I shall rid out of the way, which may seem to discredit the truth thereof. And it is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>stands aspersed in common fame, as a great friend at least, and Patron of the Romish</hi> Catholiques, <hi>if he were not of the same belief. And it were a policy mis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95383:96"/>
such subtile Serpents, causelesly to plot the death of their so eminent well-wisher.</hi> To which I answer, by concession; True it is, he had too much and long favoured the <hi>Romish Faction,</hi> but as upon what account it was he favoured them is uncertain, so was it but the <hi>Romish Faction,</hi> not the <hi>Romish Faith</hi> he favoured. He tampered indeed to introduce some ceremonies bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on superstition, disused by us, and abused by them: from whence the <hi>Romanists</hi> collected such a disposition in him to their Tenets, as they began, not only to hope, but in good earnest to cry him up for their <hi>Proselyte.</hi> Upon this hypothesis, this supposition, they grew excessive proud and insolent, as well they might (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how grand a Confident and Trustee he was of the <hi>Kings)</hi> had not their perswasion misled them; But the <hi>Archbishop</hi> finding that his tacite reservednesse in point of opinion, and former compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Papists, was no longer expedient for his designes, and did begin to create ill-boading jealousies in another party, resolved to speak out, and un beguile them both. And first in the year 1637. openly at the Councel <hi>Table,</hi> he passionately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the <hi>King</hi> of their audacious resort to <hi>Denmark</hi> house, using some expressions of vehemency more particularly against the haughty deportment of Mr. <hi>Walter Mountague,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ioby Mathew.</hi> But that which most despighted them, was his publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next year the <hi>Relation of his conference with the Iesuite.</hi> Fisher, wherein he declared himself so little theirs, as he hath for ever dis-abled them from being so much their own as they were before; it being the exactest, the master peece of <hi>Polemique</hi> Divinity of all extant. Pity it is his <hi>thoughts</hi> which were in other affairs a thought too high, had so fatal a diversion from his studies. But what one is excellent in every thing? Now the <hi>Archbishop</hi> thus professedly owning the <hi>Protestant</hi> cause, and having so potent an influence upon the <hi>King,</hi> it was no wonder if he became as formidable to the <hi>Romanists,</hi> as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was to <note place="margin">Ubi <hi>Hannibal</hi> est, ibi caput at<expan>

               <hi>April</hi> the 13. the <hi>Parliament</hi> sate according to preappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">1640. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</note> when the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Strafford</hi> was led into the upper House by two Noble-men to give them account what feats he had wrought in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having there obtained the grant of four Subsidies for the maintenance of ten thousand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horse: implicitely hinting agreeable to what scheme <hi>England</hi> should proportion their supplyes. Some few dayes after a report was made to the Lords, by the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> (who with Secretary <hi>Windebank</hi> and the <hi>Atturney</hi> General were sent by the <hi>King</hi> to the Lord <hi>Lowdon</hi> to examine
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95383:96"/>
him, concerning the Letter before mentioned) that the Lord did <note place="margin">Ann. Christi 1640.</note> acknowledge the hand-writing to be his, that it was framed before the <hi>Pacification</hi> at <hi>Barwick,</hi> and was never sent to that <hi>King,</hi> but only prepared in a readinesse, should need require, and that it was supprest upon that <hi>Pacification;</hi> neverthelesse it was thought fit he should continue in the same state untill clearer evidence should be given, either for, or against him.</p>
            <p>Soon after the the King sent a message to the lower house about supplies representing to them the intolerable indignities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries wherewith the <hi>Scots</hi> had treated him, and withall declared to them, that if they would assist him sutable to the exigency of his sad occasion, he would for ever quit his claime of Ship-mony, and into the bargain give them full content in all their just demands. But they reply'd they expected first security from his Majesty in these three particulars. First, for clearing the Subjects property; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for establishment of Religion; Thirdly, for the priviledge of Parliament. Many conferences there were had between the Lords and Commons about this old contest which should precede, the Kings supply, or the Subjects grievances. The Lords after a stong division among themselves at length voted for the <hi>King,</hi> and the Commons for the <hi>Subjects.</hi> But it was not long before this unhappy difference was most unhappily decided. For Secretary <hi>Vane</hi> who was imploy'd to declare the particulars of the Kings desires, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red twelve Subsidies, whereas twas said, his expresse order was for only six. Some there are suspect this mistake to have been not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary but industrious in him; but leaving that indetermined, the House of Commons was raised by this Proposition to such animosity, as the <hi>King</hi> advising with his <hi>Iuncto,</hi> their compliance was represented to him so desperate, as <hi>May</hi> the 5. he ordered the Dissolution of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus expired this short-lived, or rather thus ended this stil-born Parliament; a Parliament I know not whether more unfortunate, in beginning so late, or ending so soon. A Parliament which had power, and probably will enough to impede the torrent of the late civill War: for the breaches between the <hi>King</hi> and People were grown so high, as one might already discern all the lineaments of an insurrection in <hi>Embryo,</hi> but the head, whose Abortion nothing could cause but an happy union in Parliament, a thing not very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, much lesse impossible at this time. Had the King yeelded to a detrenching some luxuriances of his Prerogative, to the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Episcopacy to its primitive institution, that is to the frame by Divine Right (a root which had not sap enough to maintain so spreading and flourishing a top as was contended for) to a more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and sociable communication of Councels with the grand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative; in short to such fluent and spontaneous concessions, as eing resolved upon too late, were (in reference to his personal
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95383:97"/>
safety) lost and thrown away in the ensuing Parliament, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood he had much quieted the distempers of his subjects, much calm'd their animosities, why not totally gained their affections? and in order to all this his Majesty had now already modelled all his passions, all his inclinations. And as the King was disposed towards this blessed conjunction, so was there not so intense an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Kings satisfaction in the mind of the generality of the members of this Parliament, as was like to obstruct it. So that to counsel the dissolution of an Assembly so importing to the Kings and Kingdoms welfare must be the advice of men who understood not so well as they meant, whereof many laid the blame upon the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a learned, pious and morally a good man, but too full of fire. As affaires of the Church then stood, Bishops might in reference to Ecclesiastical concernments be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able assessors in Privy Councel, but in civil matters perhaps it had been better, had they been lesse active, according to the example of this <hi>Archbishops</hi> predecessor, <hi>penultime,</hi> and last but one Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who being a Privy Counsellor, it was his constant mode to attend the Table early in the morning, and after the usual apprecation of a good morrow to the Lords, he alwayes requested to know if there were any Church businesse to be debated that forenoon; if the answer returned was, yea, he stayed; if negative, he craved leave to be dispensed withall, saying, <hi>Then my Lords there's no need of me,</hi> and so departed. A most laudable and prudentiall practise.</p>
            <p>This convention was not more unhappily dissolved then another was continued, that is, as a witty Gentleman said well, <hi>A new Synod made of an old Convocation,</hi> which by new Commission from the King, were impowered to sit still: the impulsives to it are easily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from what resulted from it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> fires had already in that Kingdome consumed and burnt up to nothing Episcopacy both root and branch, and just cause <note place="margin">The Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sitteth.</note> there was to fear the like proceedings here in <hi>England,</hi> where many began not only to sit upon the Bishops skirts, that is, to controvert the motes and bounds of their authority, but to claim a <hi>co-parcenery,</hi> and equall share in the main possession, asserting, in good earnest, that though the Bishops had long Lorded over them through tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral indulgence, yet in the sacred Dialect they were as good men as themselves, <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> in Scripture phrase being of equivalent import, and denoted the self same persons, without the least distinction, they whom Holy Text cals <hi>Bishops,</hi> having an <hi>Identity,</hi> a same-nesse of Name, of Ordination, of Office, of all qualifications necessary to that <hi>office,</hi> with <hi>Presbyters.</hi> The Prelates finding their dear <hi>Palladium</hi> so deeply concerned, and heaved at, were as eager to conserve it, the Presse swarmed with Books setting forth the Right upon which Episcopacy was founded, but all advantaged
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95383:97"/>
them little, for such a prejudice there was against them, and the Truth contended for lay then so deep, as few had perspicacity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to discern it, so it did them little service, therefore the Bishops observing these levelling principles growing into such request took measure from their profest adversaries the generall Assembly of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with whom they so interfered. For as that Assembly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formed a <hi>Covenant</hi> for the destruction of Episcopacy, severely urged subscription to it: so did this Synod for the support of their <hi>Hitrarchy</hi> frame as an Anti-covenant this Oath following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>do swear, That I do approve the Doctrine and Discipline of Government established in the Church of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">They impose a new Oath.</note> England <hi>as containing all things necessary to salvation. And that I will not endevour by my self or any other, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, to bring in any Popish Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which is so established. Nor will I ever give my consent to alter the Government of this Church by Archbishops, Bishops, Deans and Arch-Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as it stands now established, and as by right it ought to stand, nor yet ever to subject it to the usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and superstitions of the Sea of</hi> Rome. <hi>And all these things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear according to the plain and common sense and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same words, without any equivocation or mentall evasion, or secret reservation whatsoever. And this I do heartily, willingly, and truly upon the Faith of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. So help me God in Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many things were exceedingly blamed in the contrivance of this Oath;</p>
            <p>First, that seeing a clear notion of the thing sworne to (which the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> comprehendeth under the word <hi>Iudgement)</hi> is a necessary qualification to the legality of an Oath, this <hi>[&amp;c.]</hi> was of so mysterious import as the very Imposers, much lesse the Jurours, were not able to decypher what it meant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, some things were expresly to be sworn to, which were never thought to have any shew or colour of sacred Right, but were conceived arbitrary, and at the disposition of the State, and to exact an Oath of dissent from civil establishments in such things of indifferency, was an affront to the very fundamentals of Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:95383:98"/>
Lastly, because the Juror therein declared he sware willingly, to which he was constrained under the highest penalties, that is, as that noble Lord said, <hi>Under the losse of both Heaven and Earth, of Heaven, by excommunication; and of Earth, by deprivation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, they ran parallel with the Covenanters in another consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, for as the <hi>Scots</hi> condemned the <hi>Arminian</hi> tenets without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining what those Tenets were, which King <hi>Charles</hi> noted as a strange proceeding in them, so did these the <hi>Socinians</hi> not declaring wherein they were culpable.</p>
            <p>There was also framed by this Synod a Canon wherein the situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Communion Table should be at the East end severed with Railes to preserve it from profanation, and for permitting the practice or omission of bowing towards the East as men never perswaded within themselves, concerning the lawfulnesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency thereof.</p>
            <p>And that his Majesties ratification of these Rules might as well <note place="margin">Great Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the King.</note> be thought an act of gratitude as grace, they granted him a most ample Benevolence of four shillings in the pound assest upon all the Clergy for six years towards his expedition against the <hi>Scots,</hi> which was beheld as an act of very high presumption and an usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the preeminence of Parliament; no Convocation having power to grant any Subsidies, or aid without confirmation from the Lay-Senate.</p>
            <p>This Synod ended <hi>May</hi> the 29. and the first offender who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obnoxious to the animadversion of their new Law, was one of its late members, <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who refused subscription to the Canons, and was thereupon suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This Bishop had been long suspected as addicted to the Romish belief.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> having sped so well in their adventures against Soveraignty, <hi>England</hi> began now to be bewitched with their Principles, and to learn their Discipline of daring. Liberty is so sweet as few are of a temper too sober not to attempt it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when successe hath opened the advenues of atchievement, and rendered it seemingly attainable. Nor did we derive from them only the rudiments, but the method also of revolt. Our first probationary tumult commencing in a rude assault upon this <hi>Archbishop,</hi> as theirs upon the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences they wanted not to honest, to justifie the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. That <hi>Parliament</hi> from which the hole Kingdome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Reformation of all enormities both in Church and Common-wealth, a total dissipation of all foggie jealousies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>King</hi> and People, an accommodation of all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> that <hi>Parliament</hi> had an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature, miserable, deplorable dissolution; and who bare the odium of that unfortunate advise comparably to <hi>Canterbury?</hi> Upon this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95383:98"/>
score a Paper was posted upon the <hi>Old Exchange, May</hi> the 9. <hi>Exhorting Prentices to rise and sack his House at</hi> Lambeth <hi>the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following;</hi> whereof the <hi>Archbishop</hi> having notice, prepared for his defence; and it was well he did so, for the <hi>Munday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shòps Palace beset by pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices.</note> in the dead of night, about five hundred beset his Palace, and made many attempts to force an entrance, but all in vain, such provision had the <hi>Archbishop</hi> made for his security; but though he escaped the violence of their hands, yet did he not the virulence of their tongues, which did most impetuously rage against him, now with menaces, now with imprecations. The next day many of these riotous delinquents upon narrow inquiry were apprehended, and imprisoned in the <hi>White-lion,</hi> but within three dayes after some of their either complices, or adherents came in the day time, brake open the Prison, and enlarged them. Neverthelesse one of their Captains was re-taken, condemned at <hi>Southwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Parliament being blown away without affording any thing in nature of supply to the <hi>Kings</hi> wants, all the wheeles of the Prerogative are put into motion to carry on the War: First, the City of <hi>London</hi> were invited to a Loan, then all Knights and Gentlemen who held Lands in Capite of the King were summoned to send men, horses, and Armes agreeable to their abilities.</p>
            <p>The City was sullen, would not give down their milk, and pleaded want of Trade and poverty: a very poor plea as her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then stood, for how could want flow in upon a Nation from a Peace of forty years duration? And where Kingdomes thrive, the Mother Cities, which usually grasp and gripe all they can from the body, will be sure to secure themselves against necessity. No, she was luxuriant in wealth never more, and pampered with ease, so as her high repletion brought her into a <hi>Cachexy,</hi> an ill habit of body, this set her on longing and lusting after strange gods. She began now to be disciplined by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian emissaries, and resolved to fashion herself to the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> designes. Again, the Prerogative had lately, as she thought, treated her somewhat roughly. Her Plantation of <hi>London-Derry</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was for some alleadged misdemeanours, not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore questioned in the Star-chamber, and there declared forfeited to the King, and fines imposed upon the Planters; This was of no pleasing re-sentment, and operated not a little towards their denyal.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Gentry</hi> for the generality exhibited inclinations more prompt, and afforded their help to relieve the <hi>King.</hi> By this and other fore-mentioned aids the Royal Army began to Rendevous, whereof the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was appointed <hi>Generalissimo,</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:95383:99"/>
and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> Lieutenant General, but the first fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently into a great sicknesse, so as his conduct was dispensed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the second was not of so perfect health as to undertake the chief command; whereby, the <hi>King</hi> resolved to assume it himself, and having staid the <hi>Queens</hi> safe delivery of her son <hi>Henry</hi> in <hi>Iuly, August</hi> the 20. he set forward towards the North, his Army <note place="margin">The King goes against the <hi>Scots.</hi>

The next morning he sent to the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> desiring his leave to passe towards his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> with their Petition; the Lord answered that he would permit a few, but not an Army to passe; whereupon <hi>Lesly</hi> commanded three hundred Horse to advance into the River, whom the Musqueteers from behind the Brest-works so galled, as they were enforced to retire, which <hi>Lesly</hi> perceiving, played upon that blinde with his Canon so furiously, as made them abandon <note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> routed.</note> their post, cast away their Armes and fly: then the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallery re-advanced, who were gallantly charged by Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> Commissary General of the Horse, but they were so annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> Canon, and withall so over-numbred, all the burden of the encounter being born by the Gentlemen, as they were compelled to retire in disorder. In this hostile aggres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the <hi>English</hi> received far the greater losse, three hundred being slain and taken. The Lord <hi>Conway</hi> perceiving the Cavallery thus routed, and the Infantry run all away, hasted his retreat to the <hi>King,</hi> and for the same reason Sir <hi>Iacob Astley</hi> then Governour of <hi>New-castle,</hi> deserted it, having first sunk the Ordinance in the River, being well assured it <note place="margin">
                  <hi>New-castle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.</note> was not tenable, as having nothing in it tending to Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Army retreating now from <hi>New-castle,</hi> was taken into the command of the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who brought up the Rear, and being come back to <hi>York,</hi> where the

               <hi>King</hi> then was, he charged the principal miscarriage of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> who with as stout an animosity vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his own reputation.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>Covenanters</hi> prospered in <hi>England,</hi> yet an odd <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Haddingtons</hi> mischance at <hi>Dunse.</hi>
               </note> accident in <hi>Scotland</hi> discoloured their affairs into a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick complexion. For General <hi>Lesly</hi> having left some peeces of Canon at <hi>Dunse,</hi> which he thought more then necessary for his service; the Garrison of <hi>Barwick</hi> issued out to fetch them from <hi>Dunse,</hi> and possest themselves of them; upon this an Alarm was given to the Earl of <hi>Haddington,</hi> then commanding in <hi>Louthian</hi> and the <hi>Merse.</hi> The Earl with two thousand Horse and Foot persues the <hi>English,</hi> and after a short skirmish rescued the Canon, which he carryed to <hi>Dunglasse.</hi> And being there at Dinner the next day with about fourteen or fifteen Knights and Gentlemen of note and neer alliance to him, very frolique and merry, in a moment the Magazine of powder which was in a Vault under the room where they dined, took fire and blew up himself with all his guests. Whether this was an accident or some industrious plot, was not known.</p>

                  <p>The evils and dangers whereof your <hi>Majesty</hi> may be pleased to take notice, are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. The sundry innovations in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Oath and Canons lately imposed upon the Clergie, and other your Majesties Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="5">5. The urging of ship-money, and prosecution of some Sheriffs in the Star-chamber for not levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The heavy charge upon Merchandise, to the discouragement of Trade, the multitude of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, and other Patents, whereby the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Manufactures of the Kingdome are much

                  <p>For remedie whereof, and prevention of the dangers that may arise to your Royal Person, and to the hole State; they doe in all humilitie and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse beseek your most Excellent Majesty, that you would be pleased to summon a Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in some convenient time, whereby the causes of these, and other great grievances which your People lie under, may be taken away, and the Authors and Counsellors of them may be there brought to such legal trial, and condign punishment, as the nature of their several offences shall require. And that the present War may be composed by your Majesties wisdome without bloud, in such manner as may conduce to the Honor and safetie of your Majesties Person, the comfort of your People, and the uniting of both your Realms against the common Enemie of the Reformed Religion.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Before the receipt of your Petition, his Majesty well fore-saw the danger that threatens himself and Crown; and therefore resolved the 24. of this moneth to summon all the Peers, and with them to consult, what in this case is fittest to be done, for his own Honor, and safety of the Kingdome, where they with the rest may offer any thing that may conduce to these ends.</hi>

            <p>According to this resolution, the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> had directions from the King to issue out writs of Summons for their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at <hi>York</hi> on the 24. day of <hi>September,</hi> which he punctually persued.</p>
            <p>Soon after the presenting of this Petition from the Lords, came another from the <hi>Scots,</hi> the substance whereof was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that his Majesty would call a Parliament, for setling a firm peace between the two Nations.</p>
            <p>To this Petition the <hi>King</hi> reply'd, with signification of what he had ordered before in reference to the welfare of himself and both Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And it was high time for an accommodation to be effected, for <hi>Lesly</hi> now began to rant it in <hi>New-castle,</hi> and the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, <note place="margin">The <hi>Scot'sh</hi> oppressions in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</hi>
               </note> as <hi>Brennus</hi> did at <hi>Rome,</hi> with a <hi>Vae victis:</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a tax of three hundred and fifty pounds <hi>per diem</hi> upon the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> and three hundred pound upon <hi>Northumberland,</hi> upon pain of plundering, and yet permitted souldiers to rifle houses, break up shops, and act what insolencies they pleased, seised upon four great <hi>English</hi> ships laden with corn, as lawful Prize, they not knowing in whose possession the Town was, till they entred the Haven.</p>
            <p>The first day of the <hi>Lords</hi> assembling at <hi>York,</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that a Parliament should be summoned to convene <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> and <hi>Scotch.</hi>
               </note> the 3. Then a message was sent to the <hi>Scots,</hi> desiring a speedy Treaty at <hi>York.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> reply'd they held that no place of security for their Commissioners, considering that he (the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>Ireland)</hi> who commanded his <hi>Majesties</hi> Army, was one
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95383:101"/>
who had proclaimed them Traitors in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the <hi>King</hi> had done the same in <hi>England,</hi> and who had threatned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their Nation both <hi>root and branch.</hi> And against whom, as a chief Incendiary of the late troubles, they intended to complain. Hereupon it was concluded that the Treaty should be held at <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</hi> The place being agreed upon, the next stage of resolutions was to the nomination of persons thought fit to treat, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined, and assented to on both sides, and the <hi>Commissioners</hi> met to fall upon consultation, the <hi>Scots</hi> took exceptions at the Earl of <hi>Traquairs</hi> being present at their debates, he being not nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either by the <hi>King</hi> or Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> as a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner; whereof the King being advertised, and advising with his Counsel, this answer resulted from them, <hi>That though the Earl was not authorised to treat as a Commissioner, nor to Vote in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; yet was it very reasonable he should be present, in regard all things which require debate, as the Laws and Customes of the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and all Passages of the Assembly and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to which the</hi> English <hi>Commissioners are strangers) are best known to him.</hi> This answer being returned, the <hi>Scots</hi> superseded from further opposition in that subject, so that the Commissioners fell directly upon their imployment.</p>
            <p>The first thing propounded by the <hi>English,</hi> was a Cessation of Arms: but the <hi>Scots</hi> said many other things were to be of anteriour consideration. As their affairs stood, untill they had obtained what they came for, home they must not return; &amp; forward they durst not advance, his Majesty having commanded the contrary, so that there was an urgent necessity of their continuing their present quarters, which they were unable to do, unlessesome way were stated for their subsistence: Again, some particulars were to be predetermined of necessary relation to the Treaty; therefore <hi>October</hi> the 2. they presented the <hi>English</hi> Lords with these subsequent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. We desire your Lordships to take into your considerations, <note place="margin">The <hi>Scots</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> how our Army shall be maintained until the Treaty be ended, and our peace secured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a greater number of Commissioners be required, that a convoy begranted for their safe arrival.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A safe convoy for all letters from us to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and from them to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That for the benefit of both Kingdomes, there may be a free commerce; and that the common trade of <hi>New-castle</hi> be not hindered, but especially for victuals.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The first of these demands seemed very harsh to the <hi>English,</hi> who thought it most unreasonable to maintain the <hi>Scotts</hi> at such a time when the Kings Army was in more distresse: but the sword oft gives law to reason; so when accosted by sturdy beggers, our
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95383:102"/>
fear is more liberal then our charity, and to deny the Scots any thing, considering their armed posture, was interpreted the way to give them all, upon which apprehension our Commissioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themselves very sedulously to such results, as did both comply with their demands and were serviceable to the ease and quiet of the oppressed Countries; these were formed into thirteen Articles and agreed upon the 16. of <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These previous obstructions being thus removed, the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners next proceeded to the Treaty of Cessation, which after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral debates produced, <hi>Octob.</hi> 26. these ensuing Articles, and were after signed by his Majesty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there be a Cessation of Armes, both by Sea and Land, from this present.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all acts of hostility doe henceforth cease.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That both parties shall peaceably return, during the Treaty, whatsoever they possesse at the time of the cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all such persons who lived in any of his Majesties Forts beyond the River of <hi>Tees,</hi> shall not exempt their lands which lye within the Counties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and the Bishoprick, from such contributions, as shall be laid upon them for the payment of eight hundred and fifty pounds <hi>per diem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That none of the <hi>Kings</hi> Forces upon the other side of <hi>Tees,</hi> shall give any impediment to such contributions, as are already allowed for the competency of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, and shall fetch no victuals, nor forrage out of their bounds, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which the Inhabitants and owners thereof shall bring voluntarily unto them, and that any restraints or detention of Victuals, Cattle, or Forrage which shall be made by the <hi>Scots</hi> within those bounds for their maintenance, shall be no breach.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That no recrute shall be brought into either Armies, from the time of cessation, and during the Treaty.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the contribution of eight hundred and fifty pounds <hi>per diem,</hi> shall be only raised out of the Counties of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Bishoprick,</hi> Town of <hi>New-castle, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland:</hi> and that the nor payment thereof, shall be no breach of the Treaty, but the Countries and Towns shall be left to the <hi>Scots</hi> power to raise the same, but not to exceed the sum agreed upon, unlesse it be for charges of driving, to be set by a priser of the forrage.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the River of <hi>Tees</hi> shall be the bounds of both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, (excepting alwayes the Town and Castle of <hi>Stockton,</hi> and the Village of <hi>Egystiff)</hi> and the Countries of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Bishoprick</hi> be the limits, within which the <hi>Scot'sh</hi> Army is to reside, having liberty for them to send such convoyes as shall be necessary for the gathering up only of the contribution, which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95383:102"/>
shall be unpaid by the Counties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. That if any person commit any private insolence, it shall be no breach of our Treaty, if, upon complaint made by either parties, reparation and punishment be granted.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If victuals be desired upon the price which shall be agreed upon, and ready money offered for the same, and refused, it shall be no breach of the Cessation to take such victuals paying such prices.</p>
            <p n="11">11. No new fortifications to be made, during the Treaty, against either parties.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That the Subjects of both Kingdomes may in their Trade of commerce freely passe to and fro, without any stay at all; but it is particularly provided, that no member of either Army, passe without a formal Passe, under the hands of the General, or of him that commands in chief.</p>
            <p>This Treaty at <hi>Rippon</hi> was but the <hi>Parasceue,</hi> the preparation to another of higher import, for the time being far spent and the <hi>Scots</hi> chief demands to be considered of, the Lords by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the <hi>Scots</hi> became humble sutors to his Majesty, that the general Treaty should be transferred to <hi>London,</hi> to which the King agreed. Hostility being thus sopited, thus laid to sleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King and Lords posted to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing very remarkable may here have a commodious situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines from the Covenanters.</note> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi> having long and faithfully adhered to the Covenanters, began at length, as he thought, to smell out the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, and ill favour of their intentions, and that they really minded nothing lesse then what they so solemnly professed, <hi>The Honour of his Majesty, and preservation of Religion;</hi> no sooner did this apprehension seise upon him, then he meditated dis-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, but finding the work would require his best artifice, he dissembled his intent a good while, seemed as active as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was the first man of that Army, who in this last expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on set foot on <hi>English</hi> ground; thus studying to appear faithful and forward in petty things; that when time served, he might <hi>betray</hi> them to better purpose; but the <hi>Scots</hi> marching over the <hi>Tine</hi> lesse disturbed then he expected, he was much disappointed, of that opportunity he so longingly attended, yet kept the same loyal inclinations toward the King, which taking advantage of the Treaty, he found means to notifie to his <hi>Majesty</hi> by letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he professed his fidelity and most ready obedience to him; these letters were by some of the Kings Bedchamber-men, the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">The Kings pockets rifled.</note> instruments of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> secretly taken out of his Majesties pocket in the night, copyed out, and communicated to the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>New-castle,</hi> who concealing their information, did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conceal their malignity against the Earl, but laboured all they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95383:103"/>
could to render him odious to the people, and thereby unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Majesty. This rifling of his Majesties pockets (worse then of his Coffers) was not the first experiment made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in that kinde, but of too familiar practise, to the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his most secret Councels, so that the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> writing to the <hi>King</hi> concerning the plot against him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by <hi>Andreas ab Habernfield</hi> puts in this caution, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those letters. <hi>Sir I beseech you trust not your own Pockets with them.</hi> Tacitely hinting what Legerdemain had been formerly exercised upon the Kings Pockets.</p>
            <p>The Parliament was approaching, whose convening was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this Kingdome with so much longing, such impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of desires, as every moment which retarded it was interpreted a kinde of grievance to the subject: for we began now to think nothing could make us happy but a Parliament, and that no Parliament could make us miserable: this was the sense of the greater part of this Nation, and if this Parliament succeeded not adequate to some mens vote, perhaps the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of their hopes may be somewhat imputed to this sense. Over-ruling Providence delights oft to order the operations of Agents, both free and natural, counter to mans expectation; to teach us the vanity of that Faith, which is founded upon causes subaltern.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Kings speech.</note> Subjects, was the cause of my calling of the last Assembly of <hi>Parliament,</hi> wherein if I had been believed, I do most sincerely think that things had not faln as we now see; but it is no wonder that men are so slow to believe that so great a sedition should be raised upon so little ground. But now (my <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen)</hi> the honour and safety of this Kingdome lying so heavily at stake, I am resolved to put my self freely upon the love
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95383:103"/>
and affections of my <hi>English</hi> Subjects, as those of my Lords that waited on me at <hi>York</hi> very well remember I there declared.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (my Lords) I shall not mention mine own interest, or that support I might justly expect from you till the common safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be secured: though I must tell you, I am not ashamed to say, those charges I have been at, have been meerly for the securing and good of this Kingdome; though the successe hath not been answerable to my desires. Therefore I shall only desire you to consider the best way both for the safety and security of this Kingdome, wherein there are two things chiefly considerable. First, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out of the <hi>Rebels.</hi> And secondly, that other, in satisfying your just grievances, wherein I shall promise you to concur so heartily and clearly with you, that all the world may see my intentions have ever been, and shall be to make this a glorious and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Kingdom. There are only two things more that I shall mention to you. The one is to tell you, that the Loan of mony which I lately had from the City of <hi>London,</hi> wherein the Lords who waited on me at <hi>York</hi> assisted me, will only maintain my Army for two months from the beginning of that time it was granted. Now (my Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen)
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95383:104"/>
I leave it to your consideration, what dishonour and mischief it might be, in case for want of money my Army be disbanded, before the <hi>Rebels</hi> be put out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Secondly, the securing of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities the Northern people endure at this time, and so long as the Treaty is on foot. And in this I may say not only they, but all this Kingdom will suffer the harm, therefore I leave this also to your consideration. For the ordering of the great affairs whereof you are to Treat at this time; I am so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of your love to me, and that your care is such for the honour and safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that I shall freely leave to you where to begin: only this, that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know the state of all affairs, I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> to give you a short and free account of those things that have happened in this <hi>interim,</hi> with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, that if his account be not satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, as it ought to be, I shall whensoever you desire it, give you a full and perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of every particular. One thing more I desire of you, as one of the greatest means to make this an happy Parliament, that you on your parts, as I on mine, lay aside su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion one of another, as I promised my Lords at <hi>York,</hi> it shall not be my fault

            <p>The King having ended, the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> in persuance of his Majesties commands, gave them a summary relation of all things relating to the Scotish Invasion, I dare not say Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that the King represented them under that disgustfull cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, was very ill resented by some considerable persons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Majesty having notice, told the Parliament two dayes after, <hi>He must needs call them Rebels, so long as they have an Army that do invade</hi> England.</p>
            <p>The remainder of that week was spent partly in setling Committees for general Grievances, and partly in set spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Rhetorically declaiming against, and dissecting them.</p>
            <p>Munday being the 9. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> Petitions came thronging <note place="margin">Several Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Grievances.</note> in from all Countries of the Kingdom, craving redresse of the late general exorbitances both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as also from particular persons who had smarted under the lash of the Star-Chamber, Councel-Table, and High Commission Court. <hi>Novemb.</hi> the 10. these Petitions were delivered to Grand Committees, and divers ordered to be enlarged out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to make their defences, especially <hi>Prynn, Bastwick,</hi> and <hi>Burton.</hi>

            <p>In the House of Lords, <hi>Novemb.</hi> the 10. there was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint <note place="margin">Priviledges of the Lords House violated.</note> made that their priviledges had been temerated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, by the search of the Earl of <hi>Warwicks</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brookes</hi> studies, Cabinets and Pockets, upon the dissolution of the last Parliament, and Sir <hi>William Beecher</hi> the instrument imployed in that action, was sent for to give account by what authority he proceeded, who alleaged he had a warrant therefore from the two Secretaries of State, whereupon he was committed to the Fleet.</p>
            <p>The next day Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> was sent from the Commons to the <note place="margin">The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Ireland</hi> impeached of Treason.</note> 
               <hi>Lords</hi> with a message of Impeachment of High Treason, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereupon he was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted from the Parliament house, and committed to the Usher of the Black Rod, and in order to his further accusation, Sir <hi>George Ratcliff</hi> a great confident of the Lieutenants, and a supposed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminary with him, was two dayes after sent for out of <hi>Ireland</hi> by a Serjant at Armes.</p>
            <p>The two Armies in the <hi>North</hi> lay heavy upon these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <note place="margin">The Northern Armies in want.</note> where they quartered, and their pressures were like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease unlesse some supply were speedily dispatcht to them; therefore <hi>Novemb.</hi> the 12. the House resolved upon an 100<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Munday the 16. the Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was set free of <note place="margin">Bishop of <hi>Lin coln</hi> enlarged.</note> his imprisonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon the suit of the House of Peers to his Majesty, and the next day (being a day of Humiliation) he was brought into the Abbey Church by six Bishops, and officiated there as Dean of <hi>Westminster</hi> before the Lords. The House of Commons assembling according to their ancient mode in St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Church, while the second-service was reading at the Communion Table (sutable to the late and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent practise,) it was disturbed by a Psalme begun, at which many were amazed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Strafford</hi> entring now into his state of trans-figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, from the high pitch of honour, to the condition of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, found his friends active and awake to serve him with their best endevours, in all things relating either to his reputation, or safety. In order to which it was the 19. day precariously moved, 1. That he might be bailed, divers Lords freely tendring themselves to that end; But the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> declared it was against the lawes of the Land, and priviledge of the House, in which opinion the major part of the Peers acquiesced.

Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> was committed to the Gatehouse, and the King sent an expresse to the Commons that they should proceed severely against him.</p>
            <p>The 28. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> were brought into <hi>London</hi>

            <p>The Parliament began now to appear so formidable to all who <note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debank</hi> flyeth.</note> laboured of any bad character, as the very terrour was a kind of proscription and exile; upon this very skore Sir <hi>Francis Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck,</hi>

            <p>The 7. it was unanimously voted by the Commons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the charge imposed upon the subject for the providing and furnishing of Ships, and the Assessements for raising of money for</hi>

               <hi>that purpose (commonly called</hi> Shipmoney) <hi>are against the Lawes of the Realme, the Subjects right and property, contrary to former resolutions in Parliament, and the Petition of Right.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>From the damning of the Tax, to the censure of the contrivers of it, the motion is natural, as to a proper consectary of it; and this consideration led the Parliament first to fix upon the (so thought) leading man therein, the Lord Keeper <hi>Finch,</hi> and the rest of the Judges; and accordingly the next day a Committee was appointed to draw up a charge of high Treason against them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decemb.</hi> the 11.

            <p>Dependent upon this Declaration next follows the appointment of a Committee to prepare a charge against the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as one of prime re-marque in forming of these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and for other supposed Delinquences: the <hi>Scots</hi> having

            <p>The next day he was accused before the Lords, but he was <note place="margin">Flyeth.</note> early up, and before day gave <hi>justice</hi> the slip, withdrawing to a more habitable Region.</p>
            <p>The dys-crasie, the distempers of our state both Ecclesiastical and Political, were eminently derived from the long dis-use of Parliaments, which are in truth the strongest ligaments of the relation Paramount betwixt King and People: for where a correspondency necessary to their joynt interest, is over-long dis-continued, there must needs be generated from that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintance, many mis-understandings between, much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of each other; and passions severed and not determined to publique concernments. To encounter which inconvenience, the Parliament were now modelling a Bill for a Triennial Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and at the same time Petitions came thronging one upon the neck of another from several Counties, and one subscribed by 700. Presbyters, against the Hierarchy of Bishops; which finding a reception in the House dis-agreeable to his Majesties sense, he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95383:106"/>
called both Houses together, <hi>Ian.</hi> 23. at which time he first minded them of their slow proceedings, and the inconveniences emerging there-from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As first the maintaining two Armies in the Kingdom at a charge so excessive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next the weak condition of his Navy and Forts whereby his enemies are much encouraged, and his friends dis-heartned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which, he said;</p>
            <p>I Cannot but take notice of some very <note place="margin">The Kings Speech for Bishops.</note> strange Petitions, given in the name of several Counties, against the present establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Government of the Church, and of the great threats that Bishops shall be no better then Cyphers, if not clear done away. Now I must tell you that I make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Reformation and Alteration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: though I am for the first, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give way to the latter. I will not say but that the Bishops may have over-stretched their power, and encroached upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which if you will correct, and reforme the abuse, according to the wisdome of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, so far I am with you. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if upon serious debate you shall shew me that Bishops have some temporal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority inconvenient to the State, and not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95383:107"/>
so necessary to the Church for the support of Episcopacy, I shall not be unwilling to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to lay it down. Yet by this you must not understand that I can consent to the taking away their voyce in Parliament, which they have so anciently enjoyed under so many my Ancestors, even before the Conquest, and ever since, and which I conceive I am bound to maintain, as one of the fundamental institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>There is another Rock I desire you to eschew, and that not in substance but in form, yet that form is so essential, that except it be reformed it will marre the substance. There is a Bill given in for frequent Parliaments, the thing I like well, that is to say, to have often Parliaments; but to give power to Sheriffes, and Constables, and I know not whom to do my Office, that I cannot yeeld unto; but to shew you that I am desirous to please you in formes which destroy not the substance, I am content you shall have an Act for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but so reformed that it shall never trench upon mine honor, nor on that inseparable Right of my Crown concerning Parliaments. To which purpose I have commanded my learned Counsel to wait on you, my Lords, with such Propositions as I hope will give you content. For I ingenuously confesse, that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95383:107"/>
frequent Parliaments are the best means to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme a right understanding beeween me and my Subjects.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I have now shewed you the state of my clear intentions, and the Rocks I wish you to eschew, in all which you may perceive the desire I have to give you content, as you shall finde also by those Ministers I have and do intend to imploy in my affaires, for the pursuance of my good intentions, which I doubt not will bring peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to my Subjects, to the contentment of us all.</p>
            <p>The same day one <hi>Goodman</hi> a Jesuite being condemned at the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Goodman</hi> a Priest reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> Sessions at <hi>London,</hi> was reprieved by the King; whereupon Mr. <hi>Glyn</hi> was sent with a message to the <hi>Nobles,</hi> to request their conjunction with them in a Petition to his Majesty, to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med who should dare to be instrumental in the retarding of Justice in the face of a Parliament: which being assented to by the Lords, the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Lord Privy Seal, Ian.</hi> 25. signifyed the cause to be, in regard he was found guilty, as being a <hi>Priest,</hi> upon which score only, neither his <hi>Father,</hi> nor Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ever exercised the rigour of the Law. This answer gave slender sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Commons, so that another conference <hi>Ian.</hi> 27. was had with the <hi>Lords,</hi> from which resulted a Remonstrance to his Majesty to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That, considering the state and condition of this</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Remonstrance against <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the Priest.</note> 
               <hi>present time, they conceive the Law to be more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be put in strict execution, then at any time before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, because by divers Petitions from several parts of this Kingdome, complaints are made of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Popery and Superstition, and the People call earnestly to have the Lawes against Recusants put in execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:95383:108"/>
               <hi>Secondly, Priests and Iesuites swarm in great number in the Kingdome, and appear here with such bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and confidence, as if there were no Lawes against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, it appeareth to the House that of late years, about the City of</hi> London <hi>Priests and Iesuites have been discharged out of Prison, many of them being condemned of high Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, the Parliament is credibly informed that at this present the Pope hath a</hi> Nuncio, <hi>or Agent resident in the City, and they have just cause to believe it to be true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, the Papists as publiquely, and with as much confidence and importunity resort to Masse at</hi> Denmark <hi>house, St.</hi> James, <hi>and the Ambassadors Chappel, as others do to their Parochial Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly, there is found already so bad consequence of this Priest</hi> John Goodman <hi>his reprieve, that the City of</hi> London <hi>being solicited by the Parliament for their assistance in the advancement of money for the supply of his Majesties Army, have absolutely denyed the same, for that very reason, which may become an ill Precedent in the levying of the Subsidies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, It is found that this</hi> Goodman <hi>hath been twice before committed, and discharged, and was somewhile a Minister in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore they humbly desire the said</hi> John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>may be left to the Iustice of the Law.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>That it was against his mind that Popery</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Kings Answer.</note> 
               <hi>or Superstition should any way encrease within this Kingdome, that he will restrain the same by causing the Lawes to be put in execution.</hi>

               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:95383:108"/>
               <hi>That he is resolved to provide against Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Papists by setting forth a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion speedily, commanding them to depart the Kingdom within one month, of which if they fail, or shall return, then they shall be proceeded against according to Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning the Popes Nuncio (Rosetti) he hath no Commission, but only to retain correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency between the</hi> Queen <hi>and the</hi> Pope, <hi>in things requisite for the exercise of her Religion, which is warranted to her by the Articles of marriage, which gave her a full liberty of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet he hath perswaded her, that since the misunderstanding of that Persons condition gives offence, she will within a time convenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <hi>Lastly, concerning</hi> Goodman, <hi>because he will avoid the inconvenience of giving so great discontent to his People, as his mercy may produce, therefore he doth remit his particular case to both Houses.

The <hi>Scots</hi> Army having possest such ample and five moneths quarters in this Kingdome, it may seem a wonder that all this while their affaires have not been assigned agreeable quarters in this Narration, especially perpending and considering the grand complication of interests, and how relative our highest concernments were to their present posture. A preterition, an omission, studiously and deliberatively resolved upon; a compart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment distinct and by it self, best sorting with such transactions, where the series of the story is not enterlined nor disturbed with matters independent, and of a different kind. I shall therefore summarily collect all those severall parcels of by-past occurrences, which had reference to them, not forgetting the true temporalities wherein they did emerge.</p>
            <p>What passed at the Treaty at <hi>Rippon</hi> hath been already mentioned, which only produced a respite, a cessation of Hostility; a plenary Pacification it could not effect: this was reserved for a Treaty at <hi>London</hi> to form; in order to whith the King <hi>Nov.</hi> the 23. issued forth a Commission to the former Lords, the Earls of <hi>Bedford, Hartford, Essex, Salisbury, Warwick, Bristow, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Berkshire;</hi> to the Lords <hi>Wharton, Paget, Kimbolton, Brook, Paulet, Howard</hi> of <hi>Estrick, Savil</hi> and <hi>Dunsmore,</hi> to any ten or more of them, to treat with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners, or any seven of them being the Earls of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and <hi>Dunfermling, Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Lowden,</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick Hepburn,</hi> Sir <hi>William Douglas, William Drummond, Iohn Smith</hi> Bailiff of <hi>Edenburgh, Alexander Wedderburn, Hugh Kennedy, Alexander Henderson,</hi> and <hi>Archibald Iohnston</hi> to take into consideration their Demands and compose all differences arising thereupon, in persuance of which Commission these particulars were demanded and assented to.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners demanded,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, that his Majesty would be gratiously pleased to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the Acts of the late Parliament may be published in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Demand.</note> 
               <hi>his Highnesse name, as our Soveraigne Lord, with consent of the Estates of Parliament convened by his Majesties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is answered, and agreed 30. <hi>Decembris</hi> 1640. That forasmuch as the Kings Majesty at the humble desire of his <note place="margin">Answer.</note> Subjects, did call and convene a Parliament to be holden at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the 2. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1640. wherein certain Acts were made, and agreed upon, which Acts his Majesty is pleased to publish in his own name with the consent of the Estates, and therefore commands that the said Acts bearing date the 2. day of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95383:109"/>
               <hi>Iune</hi> 1640. be published with the Acts to be made in the next Session of the same Parliament, and that all the said Acts, as well of the precedent, as of the next Session to be holden, have in all time coming the strength of Lawes, and to be obeyed by all the Subjects of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that the Castle of</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>and other strengths</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Demand.</note> 
               <hi>of the Kingdome should with the advice of the Estates of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to their first foundation, be furnished and used for defence and security of the Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreed unto. <note place="margin">Answer.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that Scotishmen within his Majesties Dominions of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. Demand.</note> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>may be freed from censure for subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Covenant, and be no more pressed with Oathes and subscriptions unwarranted by their Lawes, and contrary to their National Oath, and Covenant approved by his Majesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreed <hi>Decemb.</hi> the 8. 1640. that all those, who in his Majesties Dominions of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have been impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Answer.</note> or censured any way for subscribing of the Covenant, or for refusing to take any other Oath contrary to the same, shall be freed of these censures and shall be fully restored to their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Estates and Possessions; And for time coming that the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> shall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to any Oath contrary to the Lawes of that Kingdome, and the Religion there established; But such of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> as shall transport themselves into the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there be setled Inhabitants, either by way of having inheritance or freehold, or by way of setled Trades, shall be subject to the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to the Oathes established by the Lawes and Acts of Parliament in the said Kingdomes respectively, wherein they live. And the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> shall have the like privilege in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that his Majesty would be pleased to declare, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall be found, upon Tryal and Examination by the Estates</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4. Demand,</note> 
               <hi>of either of the two Parliaments, (they judging against the persons subject to their own authority) to have been the Authors and Causers of the late and present Troubles, and Combustions, whether by labouring to make and foment Division betwixt the King and his People, or betwixt the two Nations, or any other way; shall be liable to Censure of the said Parliaments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:95383:110"/>
It is answered <hi>Decemb.</hi> the 11. 1640. That his Majesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth he hath none such about him; therefore, concerning that point, he can make no other Declaration then that he is just, and that all his Courts of Justice are to be free and open to all men. Our <note place="margin">Answer.</note> Parliament in this Kingdome is now sitting, and the current Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> neer approaching the time of their meeting; In either of which <hi>Respectivè,</hi> he doth not prohibite the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states to proceed in trying and judging of whatsoever his Subjects.</p>
            <p>And whereas it was further demanded that none after the sentence of the Parliament should have accesse to his Majesty, or be maintained or enjoy places, or offices, and have credit or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to inform or advise his Majesty.</p>
            <p>It is declared in his Majesties name, <hi>Decemb.</hi> the 30. 1640. That he will not imploy any Person or Persons in Office or Place, that shall be judged incapable by sentence of Parliament. Nor will he make use of their service without the consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor grant them accesse to his Person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, that their Ships, and Goods, and all damages thereof may be restored.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5. Demand.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreed <hi>Ian.</hi> the 7. 1640. That all ships taken and stayed should be reciprocally restored on both sides. And that <note place="margin">Answer.</note> the Scotish Commissioners having informed that about eighty ships of <hi>Scotland</hi> are yet stayed in the Ports, and are like to suffer much losse if they shall not be delivered into some hands who may have care of them. It is agreed that warrants shall be presently granted for delivery of all their Ships. And that four thousand pounds be presently advanced, for Cauking, Sailes, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and other necessaries, for helping the present setting forth of the said Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly, they desire from the justice and the kindnesse of the Kingdome of</hi> England, <hi>Reparation concerning the losses which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6. Demand.</note> 
               <hi>the Kingdome of</hi> Scotland <hi>hath sustained, and the vast char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they have been put unto by occasion of the late troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Demand some did note in the <hi>Scots</hi> a tincture of oblivion, if not of ingratitude, for the service <hi>England</hi> did them in what they call their first Reformation, towards which work our Nation was so auxiliary, so assistant, yet at the end brought them in no Bill of Charges. It was also noted that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled these demands to <hi>Iustice,</hi> which some interpreted to imply that they came hither upon the invitation of eminent persons of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95383:110"/>
this Nation; it was supposed, and very like, of <hi>Pym,</hi> and <hi>Hambden.</hi> And though these Demands were not definitive nor terminated in any particular sum, yet did they compute their Losses and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences to 514000. <hi>l.</hi> a formidable and prodigious sum, more then ever was granted by the Subject to any King at once. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand took up long debate in the House of Commons, and at last <hi>Feb.</hi> the 3 this answer was returned.</p>
            <p>That this House thinks fit that a friendly assistance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief shall be given towards supply of the losses of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <note place="margin">Answer.</note> that the Parliament did declare that they did conceive that the sum of three hundred thousand pounds is a fit proportion for the friendly assistance and relief formerly thought fit to be given towards supply of the losses and necessities of their <hi>BRETHREN</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the House would in due time take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration the manner how, and the time when, the same shall bee raised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, that as his Majesty hath approved the Acts of the late Parliament, wherein all such Declarations, Proclamations, Books,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">7. Demand.</note> 
               <hi>Libels and Pamphlets that have been made, written and published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Loyal and dutiful Subjects of</hi> Scotland, <hi>are recalled, and ordered to be suppressed: So his Majesty may be pleased to give order that the same may be suppressed, recalled and forbidden in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>and that the Loyalty, integrity and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of his Majesties subjects of</hi> Scotland, <hi>towards his Majesties royal Person and Government may at the closing of this treaty of Peace, and at the time of Publique Thanks-giving for the same, be made known in all places and all Parish Churches of his Majesties Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreed upon the 10. of <hi>February</hi> 1640. That all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratons, Proclamations, Acts, Books, Libels and Pamphlets <note place="margin">Answer.</note> that have been made and published against the Loyalty and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifulnesse of his Majesties Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> shall be recalled, suppressed and forbidden in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And that this be reciprocal in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if any such have been made or published there in prejudice of his Majesties honour. And this upon diligent enquiry to be done by the Authority of Parliament next sitting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which the Commissioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> do promise to have an especial care. And we do also agree, that when it shall please Almighty God to grant an happy close of this Treaty of Peace, the Loyalty of his Majesties Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> shall be made known at the time of publique <hi>Thanks-giving,</hi> in all places, and particularly in the Parish Churches of his Majesties Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:95383:111"/>
               <hi>That all Monuments, Tokens and shewes of Hostility upon the borders of the two Kingdomes may be taken away. That not only the Garrisons of</hi> Barwick <hi>and</hi> Carlile <hi>may be removed, but that the works may be slighted and the Places dismantled.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">8. Demand.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this Demand, being offered but the 12. of this month, no answer was as yet returned.</p>
            <p>Unhappy <hi>Counsels</hi> have of late put the King out of possession of his Subjects affections, resolved he was no opportunity should <note place="margin">Suggestions.</note> escape him which might promove his re-endeerement with them; upon which inducement being lately solicited by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors for a match between <hi>William</hi> the young <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> his daughter, and he inclined to entertain it, yet <note place="margin">A match pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> and Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>

            <p>But these proceedings against him did not give plenary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all, most cryed aloud for a Reformation in the Hierarchy it self, many would detrench from them their secular power, and votes in Parliament, nay some were male-content unlesse the hole order were eradicated; and this was now vehemently pressed by the City Petition, now under consideration of the Committee: a mighty debate there was about this time in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon this Subject, and no arguments omitted which might officiate to either end; amongst the rest Episcopacy had not a faster friend, nor the City Petition a stouter Antagonist, then the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> who spake for the one and against the other no man to better purpose, and summarily thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he looked not upon that Petition, as a Petition</hi>

               <hi>from the City of</hi> London, <hi>but from he knew not what</hi> 15000. Londoners <hi>all that could be got to subscribe. That therein he discovered a mixture of things Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, Irrational, and Presumptuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contemptible. Did ever any man think that the fables of</hi> Ovid, <hi>or</hi> Tom Coriats <hi>newes, should by</hi> 15000.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95383:113"/>
               <hi>have been presented to a Parliament as a motive for the extirpation of Bishops; For the scandal of the Rocket, the Lawn-sleeves, the four-cornered Cap, the Cope, the Surplice, the Hood, the Canonical Coat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may passe passe as arguments of the same weight. He did not know whether it were more preposterous to infer the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bishops from such weak arguments, or to attribute, as they do, to Church Government all the civil grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Not a Patent, not a Monopoly, not the price of a Commodity raised, but these men make Bishops the cause of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Irrational. A Petition ought to be like a kind of syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism, the Conclusion, the Prayer, ought to hold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Premisses, that is, with the Complaints, and to be deduced from them: but in this Petition there was a multitude of Allegations, of Instances, of Abuses, and depravations in Church Government; and what is thence inferred? Let the use be utterly abolished for the abuses sake. For the moveables sake to take away the solid good of a thing; is just as reasonable, as to root up a good tree, because there is a Canker in the Branches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Presumptuous. What greater boldnesse can there be then for Petitioners to prescribe to a Parliament</hi> what <hi>and</hi> how <hi>it should do? for a multitude to teach a Parliament what is, and what is not, the Government according to Gods word? Again, it is high presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Petition point-blank against a Government in force by Law: the honour of former Acts must be upheld, because all the reverence we expect from future times to our own Acts, depends upon our supporting the dignity of former Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He said, <hi>We all agree that a reformation of Church Government is most necessary: But to strike at the root he can never give his vote before three things were cleared to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:95383:114"/>
               <hi>First, That no rule, no boundaries can be set to Bishops able to restrain them from such exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Such a frame of Government must be laid before us, as no time, no corruption, can make li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to inconveniences proportionable with those we abolish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Whether the new model is practicable in the State and consistent with Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the first, he was confident a Triennial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be a curbe sufficient to order them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the second, he was also confident that if we did listen to those who would extirpate</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>we should in state of every Bishop we put down in a Diocesse, set up a Pope in every Parish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the last, he was of opinion that it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe for Monarchy, for if the Presbyterian Assemblies should succeed, they would assume a power to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Kings, as well as other men. And if Kings came once to be excommunicated, men are not like to care much what becomes of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, though Episcopacy kept her essentials still, yet was she much mutilated in her former glory. The House of Commons voting <hi>March</hi> the 10. <hi>That no Bishop shall have any vote in Parliament, nor any judicial power in the Star-chamber, nor bear any sway in Temporal affaires, and that no Clergy man shall be in Commission of the Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now tending apace to the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> Tryal, in order and relative to which, it will be necessary to premise what antecedently occurred.</p>
            <p>The Commons having preferred their Accusation against him, as I said before, a formal charge disposed into Articles was <note place="margin">The Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> is given in.</note> next of course to follow. These at first they digested into 7. heads, which consisting only of generals, were after distributed into 28. particulars; and <hi>Ian.</hi> the 30. presented by Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> to the Peers, as their compleat charge against the Earl: who being immediately sent for, and having heard it read, he desired three months day to answer; the reason of this desire was after signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95383:114"/>
to the Commons to be, in regard some of the Treasons were of 14. years standing, and could not on the suddain be answered: Again as his Charge was long, so his Answer must be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate, the rough draught whereof being 200. sheets of paper, it could not be engrossed so soon as was desired. Neverthelesse the Commons ply'd the Lords with such incessant applications, as he was enforced to finish, and exhibit it to the Lords <hi>Feb.</hi> the 24. when it was read in the Kings audience; and in the House of Commons the next day after.</p>
            <p>The Earls Answer being given in, there ensued several questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">And his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> which were the subjects of great debate between the Lords and Commons.</p>
            <p>First, Concerning the allowance of Councel. The <hi>Commons</hi> alledging that in cases of high Treason Councel cannot regularly be allowed; which the <hi>Lords</hi> said was true in pleading matters of fact, not in matters of Law. This was in some sort granted at length by the lower House.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Concerning the place of Tryal, the <hi>Lords</hi> desiring it might be in their own House, but the <hi>Commons</hi> opposed it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they intended to manage their accusation by members of their own House in the presence of their whole House; to which purpose the <hi>Lords</hi> House was thought too little, whereupon <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> was agreed upon.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Commons were moved to declare in what quali<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty they would sit, whether as a full House with their Speaker, or as a Committee only; to which they replyed, that they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to come in the body of their House, which the Lords not assenting to, they at last yeelded to come as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> was the place, so Munday the 22. of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> appointed for his Tryal.</note> 
               <hi>March</hi> was the first day prefixt of the Earles compearing. Never was there in this Isle a scene of Justice more magnificent reared for any Subject, yea when even Majesty her self received a like sentence from that place, her Trial was nothing so majestique. Scaffolds were erected on either side of the Hall, there the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons sat uncovered, and in the middest of the lower ascent the Peers; behind, but raised above them, there was placed a Chair and Cloth of State for the King, on either side whereof was a close Gallery for the King, Queen and Prince to be private, sutable to the ancient mode.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishops</hi> were excluded by ancient Canon Lawes of the <note place="margin">Concil. Tol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </note> own interdict, which prohibs Lay-men a vote with them in the Act of Excommunication; this being a Spiritual slaughter, as the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95383:115"/>
other a Corporal. Upon which consideration they absented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was Lord <hi>High Steward,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> Lord <hi>High Constable.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> being brought to the Bar, the Lord High Steward declared to him, that he was called thither to answer to the impeachment of <hi>High Treason</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred against him by the Commons of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Then his Accusation was read, and next his Answer to it, in which most part of that day being spent, the Court arose.</p>
            <p>The next day he being brought again to the Bar, the House of Commons began with the first 7. General Articles, declaring how he had subverted the Fundamentall Lawes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> this particular was managed by Mr. <hi>Pym;</hi> next there was a Paper produced sealed, which being opened and read, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be sent from the Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> declaring that the Commons there had voted the Earl guilty of High Treason, whereat the Earl much astonisht and transported with passion said, <hi>There was a Conspiracy against him to take away his life.</hi> The words were no sooner out of his mouth, then the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (who stood diligent Sentinels to watch every syllable he spake) required Justice against him, because he standing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacht of High Treason, accused the Parliaments of two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of a conspiracy against him; whereupon he humbly craved pardon for the inconsideratenesse of the expression, protesting se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously he did not thereby intend either Parliament, but some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> moved that whereas there was a discovery made of three Articles more to be annexed to his charge, he might presently be commanded to reply to them; to which the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> answered, that the Processe being closed, he hoped he should not be ordered to answer any adventitious and unexpected charge without more convenient time assigned. But upon consideration of the Articles, the <hi>Lords</hi> finding them to be of no great importance, he was urged to a present reply. The Articles were;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, That he had withdrawn 24000. l. (some copies have 40000. l.) sterling from the Exchequer in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">New Articles against the Earl.</note> Ireland, <hi>and converted to his own use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That in the beginning of his Government the Garrisons of</hi> Ireland <hi>had been maintained by the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Treasury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:95383:115"/>
               <hi>Thirdly, That he had advanced Popish and Infamous persons, as the Bishop of</hi> Waterford, <hi>and others to the prime Roomes in the Church of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>To the first he said, That <hi>England</hi> was indebted <note place="margin">The Earls Answer.</note> to <hi>Ireland</hi> that sum, and that he took up the money upon his own Credit, and paid it in again, and that he had the Kings authority for the same, producing his Majesties Letter.</p>
            <p>To the second, That the Garrisons had been burdensome to <hi>England</hi> in former Deputies times; that he so found them, but that he had so improved the Kings Revenues there, as they were not onerous at all to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the last, That he never preferred any but such whom he conceived to be conscientious and honest men; that he could not prophecy of mens future conditions; and for the Bishop of <hi>Waterford</hi> he hath satisfied the Law.</p>
            <p>This dayes encounter between the Parliament and Earl seemed a dispute only at wasters, these generals being not impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with any deadly quality.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>March</hi> the 24. they fell to sharpe, that is to enforce the Particular Articles, in order as they were dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which in regard they were the formal principles of the Earles Tragique end, I reserved for this place, wherein I shall so represent them, as the Reader may (as in the same Table) at once behold the Commons Charge and the Earls Defence run lateral and in pale each with other, omitting such as not being urged, signified nothing.</p>

                  <p>That nothing hath been more ordinary in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then for the Governours to put all manner of sentences in execution by the help of souldiers, that <hi>Grandison, Falkland, Chichester,</hi> and other Deputies frequently did it. <hi>[Sir Arthur Teningham to this point deposed, that in</hi> Falklands <hi>time he knew 20.

                  <p>That he was not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cause of dissolving the last Parliament, for before he came to the Councel Table, it was voted by the Lords to demand 12. Subsidies, and that Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was ordered to demand no lesse; but he coming in the in terim, he perswaded the Lords to vote it again, declaring to his Majesty (then present) and them the danger of the breach of the Parliament: whereupon it was
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95383:125"/>
again voted, that if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not grant twelve Subsidies, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to eight, and rather then fail, to six. But Sir <hi>Henry</hi> not observing his instructions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded twelve only, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement, or going lower; that the height of this demand, urged the Parliament to deny, and their denial moved his Majesty to dissolve the Parliament, so that the chief occasion of the breach thereof, was, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi> He confesseth that at the Councel Table he advised the <hi>King</hi> to an offensive war against the Scots; But it was not untill all fair means to prevent a war had been first attempted.

Which words might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be incircumspectly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but he conceives cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to treason, especially when no ill consequence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them; and it would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men in a sad condition, if for every hasty word, or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given in Councel, they should
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95383:126"/>
be sentenced as Traitors. But that he said it were well for the Kings service, if some of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen were hanged up, he utterly denieth.

                  <p>That the said Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> by his wicked counsel ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought his Majesty into excessive charges without any just cause, he did in the month of <hi>Iuly</hi> last (for the support of the said great charges) counsel and approve two dangerous and wicked Projects: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To seise upon the Bullion and the Money in the Mint.</p>
                  <p>And to imbase his Majesties Coin with the mixtures of Brasse.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly he procured one hundred and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, which was then in the Mint, and belonging to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Merchants, strangers and others, to be seised on and stayed to his Majesties use. And when divers Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> owners of the said Bullion, came
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95383:126"/>
to his house to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the great mischief that course would produce here, and in other parts, what prejudice it would be to the Kingdome, by discrediting the Mint, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the importation of Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he the said Earl told them, that the City of <hi>London</hi> dealt undutifully and unthankfully with his Majesty, and that they were more ready to help the Rebel, then to help his Majesty: and that if any hurt came to them, they might thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and that it was the course of other Princes, to make use of such monies to serve their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>And when in the same month of <hi>Iuly</hi> the Officers of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Mint came to him, and gave him divers reasons against the imbasing of the said money, he told them that the French King did use to send Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Horse with Commission to search into mens estates, and to peruse their accompts, that so they may know what to levie of them by force, which they did accordingly levie: and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> then present, said, <hi>That this was a point worthy his Lordships con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</hi>

                  <p>That he expected some proofs to evidence the two first parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but hears of none.

Nor did he think it much amisse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering their present posture, to call that faction <hi>Rebels.</hi> As for the last words objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him in that Article, he said that being in conference with some of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> there came to his hands at that instant a letter from the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> then at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein were the <hi>Gazets</hi> inclosed, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had given order to levie money by Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

                  <p>That his Majesty coming to <hi>York,</hi> it was thought necessary, in regard the enemy was upon the borders, to keep the Trained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands on foot for defence of the County: and therefore
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95383:127"/>
the King directed him to write to the Freeholders in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> to declare what they would do for their own defence; that they freely offered a months pay, nor did any man grudge against it. Again it was twice propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the great Councel of Peers at <hi>York,</hi> that the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it as a just and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Act, and none of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel contradicted it, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived seemed a tacit allowance of it. That though his Majesty had not given him special order therein, nor the Gentry had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it, yet he conceived he had power enough to impose that Tax by virtue of his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But he never said that the refusers should be guilty of little lesse then high Treason, which being proved by Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Ingram,</hi> he was but a single testimony, and one who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mistaken himself in what he had deposed.</p>

                  <p>The Earl having thus answered every particular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle against him, it was moved by the house of Commons, that if he had any thing to say further in his Defence, he should do it presently, whereupon he desired time until the next morning, which was though difficultly granted him. The next morning the Houses met, but the Lieutenant of the Tower appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without his prisoner, certifying that the <hi>Earl</hi> was taken with a terrible fit of the Stone that night, and continued still so ill, as he could not stir abroad without danger of his life. The Commons thought this excuse but counterfeit, meerly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the time, but the <hi>Lords</hi> were more inclinable to credit the relation, yet an order was agreed upon between them both, that if the Earl came not the next day, they should proceed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his dis-appearance, and that in the <hi>interim,</hi> some of the Upper House should resort to the Tower to see in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was. These Lords coming in the afternoon, found nature and medicamental applications had so far prevailed over his disease, as gave assurance of his ability to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forth next day without prejudice to his health; and what else should dismay him? for to every Article of his accusation he had given, as he hoped, so apposite, so full an answer, as confident he should not be found culpable within the sphear of Treason, and offences of a lower orb were beneath his trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But (whether it was that his hope elevated to the highest
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95383:128"/>
pitch, might minister the more to the grandure of his fall, or for some other cause unknown, the Commons had kept dormant, and in reserve, their evidence of most fatal and pernicious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which the next day <hi>April</hi> the 10. the <hi>Earl</hi> appearing at the Bar, they desired liberty to produce. Then the Earl craved <note place="margin">New proofes offered against the Earl.</note> the same freedome for himself, concerning some testimonies not yet exhibited on his behalf. Upon this ensued a hot contest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Houses, the Lords conceiving that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dispensation of equity, the accused should have equal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to superinduct new proofs, as well as the accusers, or else that all further testimony should be waved on both sides. This sense of the <hi>Lords</hi> was so vastly differing from the mind of the Commons, as up they rose in much discontent, not so much as appointing the day of their next meeting there. So that Munday the 12. the Nobles and Commons sat in their distinct and proper Houses. In the Lower Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> produced a Copy of some notes taken by <hi>Secretary Vane,</hi> of certain opinions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at the Councel Table, <hi>May</hi> the 5. 1640. being the day of the last Parliaments dissolution, the discovery said to be thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secretary Vane,</hi> upon some occasion, delivered to his sonne Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> the Key of a Cabinet, to fetch some papers laid <note place="margin">Secretary <hi>Vanes</hi> notes how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> therein. In this Cabinet young Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> finds a key of another Cabinet, which he openeth, and there accidentally lights upon these notes, who presently gives thereof an account to Mr. <hi>Pym.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This produced a conference that afternoon with the <hi>Lords,</hi> at which Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> re-minds the Peers of the Commons request on Saturday last, concerning some supplemental proofs they desired to offer in the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> cause; he acquainted them that the proofs related to the 23. Article, and were founded upon the Notes which he then produced, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons moved their Lordships to order that the Earl might be sent for the next day, to make his defence at the Bar at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-hall.</hi> Which being condescended to by the Nobles, and <hi>April</hi> the 13. the Earl appearing, the Notes were brought forth and read, the Title whereof was;</p>

                  <p>First, That it is proved by the solitary testimony of one man (Secretary <hi>Vane)</hi> which is not of validity enough in Law to create faith in a matter of Debt, much lesse in point of life and death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Deposition was exceeding dubious; upon two examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he could not remember any such words, and the third time his testimony was not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but that I spake those words, or the like, and words may be very like in sound, yet differ much in sense, as in the words of my charge, <hi>here</hi> for <hi>there,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> for <hi>this,</hi> puts an end to the controversie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there were present at this debate but eight Privie Counsellors in all, two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Windebank)</hi> are not to be produced; Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

affirmes the words, I deny them: then there remain four still to give in evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> The Marquesse <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cottington;</hi> who have all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared upon their Honours, that they never heard me speak those words, nay nor the like.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, suppose (though I grant it not) that I spake those words, yet cannot the word <hi>This</hi> rationally imply <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the debate was concerning <hi>Scotland,</hi> as is yeelded on all hands, because <hi>England</hi> was not out of the way of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> well observed, and because there never was any the least intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of landing the <hi>Irish</hi> Army in <hi>England,</hi> as the foresaid <hi>Lords</hi> of the Privie Councel are able to attest.</p>

Where hath this fire lain hid so many hundreds of years, without smoak, to discover it, till it thus burst forth to consume me and my children? That pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment should precede promulgation of a law, to be punished by a law subsequent to the Fact, is extreme hard; what man can be safe if this be admitted? My Lords, it is hard in another respect, that there should be no token set by which we should know this Offence, no admonition by which we should avoid it. If a man passe the</hi> Thames <hi>in a boat, and split himself upon an Anchor, and no</hi> Buoy <hi>be floting to discover it, he who oweth the Anchor shall make satisfaction, but if a</hi> Buoy <hi>be set there, every man passeth upon his own peril Now where is this marke, where the token upon this Crime to declare it to be high Treason? My Lords, be pleased to give that regard to the Peerage of</hi> England, <hi>as never to expose your selves to such moot-points, such constructive interpretations of Lawes. If there must be a tryal of wits, let the subject matter be of somewhat else, then the lives and honours of Peers. It will be wisdome for your selves, for your posterity, and for the whole Kingdome to cast into the fire these bloudy and mysterious volumes of constructive and arbitrary Treason, as the Primitive Christians did their</hi> Books of curious Arts, <hi>and betake your selves to the plain letten of the Law and Statute, that telleth us what is, and what is not</hi> Treason, <hi>without being more ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to be more learned in the art of Killing then our
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95383:130"/>
fore-fathers. It is now full 240. years, since any man was touched for this alleged Crime to this height before my self, let us not awaken these sleeping lyons to our destructions, by raking up a few musty Records, that have lain by the wals so many ages, forgotten or neglected. May your Lordships please not to add this to my other misfortunes; for my other fins be-slave me, not for</hi> Treason; <hi>let not a president be desired from me, so disadvantageous as this will be in the consequence to the whole Kingdome; do not through me wound the interest of the Common-wealth. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever these Gentlemen say they speak for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, yet in this particular I indeed speak for it, and shew the inconveniences and mischifes which will fall upon it. For, as it is said in the Statute 1. of</hi> Henry 4. No man will know what to do, or say, for fear of such penalties. <hi>Do not put, my Lords, such difficulties upon Ministers of State, that men of Wisedome, of Honour, of Fortune, may not with cheerfulnesse and safety be imployed for the publique; if you weigh and measure them by grains and scruples, the publique affaires of the Kingdome will lie waste, no man will meddle with them who has any thing to lose. My Lords, I have troubled you longer then I should have done, were it not for the interest of these dear pledges a Saint in heaven hath left me</hi> [At this he stopt a while offering up some tears to her ashes] <hi>What I forfeit my self is nothing, but that my in-discretion should extend to my posterity it woundeth me to the very soul. You will pardon my infirmity, something I should have added, but am not able; therefore let it passe And now my Lords for my self I have been by the blessing of almighty God taught, that</hi> the afflictions of this present life, are not to be compared to the eternal weight of glory which shall be revealed hereafter. <hi>And so
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95383:130"/>
my Lords, even so, with all tranquillity of mind, I freely submit my self to your judgement; and whether that judgment be of life, or death,</hi>

                  <p>The Earl had no sooner ended then Mr. <hi>Glyn,</hi> and after him Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> undertakes him, endevouring to render his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences as odious as possibly they could; but their replications being fuller stuft with Rhetorical Declamations, then Logical conclusions, signifyed little as to judicial proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Matters of Fact being transacted, the Commons were next <note place="margin">The Commons justifie their Charge by Law.</note> engaged to just fie their charge by Law, which was a point very intricate and difficult; for his crimes were not as yet discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be specifically comprehended under the letter of any Statute declaratory of Treason; nor did that Statute of 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the third (which is the Index to all matters of Treason) directly charge him. But that Statute had a <hi>Salvo</hi> adnext to it, whereby it was provided that, <hi>because all particular Treasons could not be then defined, therefore what the Parliament should declare to be Treason in time to come, should be punished as Treason:</hi> and within the compass of this <hi>Salvo</hi> they doubted not to bring him, and to cut him off by Bill of <hi>Attainder.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Earl</hi> moved that he might be allowed to plead by his Councel, which the Nobles thought they could not in justice deny, but the Commons being of another perswasion, would not, till after three dayes conference with the Lords about it, assent thereunto. But at length the 16. the Peers prevailed, and it was agreed that the Earl with his Councel should have liberty to come next day, and they to plead such particulars only, to which they should be restrained:</p>
                  <p>Saturday, <hi>April the</hi> 17. the <hi>Earl</hi> with his Councel appeared <note place="margin">The Earl an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth by Councel.</note> at the Bar, being Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> the Princes Atturney, Mr. <hi>Gardiner</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Loe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> spake first, and insisted upon the Statute 25. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. saying it was a Declarative Law, and such are not to be interpreted by way of consequence, equity, or construction, but by the expresse letter only. Again it was a penal Law, and such can admit of no constructions or inferences, for penalties are to enforce the keeping of known, not of conjectural and dubious Lawes. Then he came to the <hi>Salvo,</hi> and affirmed that in the sixt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. a Petition was preferred in Parliament by the Nobility to have all Treason limited by Statute, that in that Parliament Chap. 10. an Act was made upon that Petition that, That <hi>Salvo</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:95383:131"/>
should be holden repealed in all times to come, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be esteemed Treason but what was literally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the Statute 25. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The Recorder said, he could add no more then what the former Councel had spoken for matter of Law, but if their Lordships would state unto him some further Questions, he was ready to give his resolution according to his best ability. Upon which motion the Lords and Commons adjourned, not profixing any time for their next meeting.</p>
                  <p>Nor was it of much import, for the Commons were resolved that day should set a totall period to the Earles defence, and next to speed their Bill of Attainder, which was debated the 19 and the <hi>Earl</hi> voted guilty of high Treason upon the evidence of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and his notes, but the final and decretory vote past not against him, till the 21 upon the reading the Bill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grost, <note place="margin">He is voted by the Commons guilty of high Treason.</note> at which time they went to the Poll, and took the names of the dissenters, the total amounting to 59, whereof the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> appeared most eminent, having spake much to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of the House in that particular. The Bill being passed the Lower-house, long they would not let it rest there, but that afternoon transmitted it to the Lords, who being slower paced in that concernment, were reminded of it the 24. with a desire they would nominate a time certain for the reading thereof, who returned answer, that on <hi>Munday</hi> and <hi>Tuesday</hi> next they would not fail to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t. And they were as good as their words, but it seemed to them so perplext a businesse, and started so many scruples, as they were enforced to request a conference with the Commons to resolve them; whereupon the Lower-house promised that Mr. <hi>St. Iohn</hi> the Kings Solicitor should Thursday the 29. justifie the Bill by Law and give their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships an account of the reasons impelling them to that mode of proceeding; ordering also that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> should then be present.</p>
                  <p>While these things were in agitation, the Parliament had addrest themselves to his Majesty in way of Petition for three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, For removing of all Papists from Court.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Commons Petition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Papists.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, For dis-arming of them generally throughout the Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, For dis-banding the Irish Army.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all which the King the 28 delivered answer contractly thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the first, they all knew what legal trust</hi>

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:95383:131"/>
                     <hi>the Crown hath in that particular, therefore he shall not need to say any thing to give them assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he shall use it so, as there shall be no just cause of scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the second, he is content it shall be done according to Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the last, he had entred into consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about it, and found many difficulties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and he doth so wish the dis-banding of all Armies, as he did conjure them speedily, and heartily to joyn with him in dis-banding those two in</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>The next day the <hi>Earl</hi> being brought to the Bar, the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Attainder</hi> was read, and Mr. <hi>St. Iohn</hi> opened the several branches thereof, affirming it to be legal, by many Presidents, and Acts of Parliaments, which he quoted. What effects the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors arguments wrought, either in rendring the Earls Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons more luminous and discernible, or in removing the former dysopsy and dimnesse of the Peers understanding, I am not able to say; but infallibly certain it is, they thenceforward shewed greater propensity towards the Earls condemnation, and clearly discovered it in their House the next day, whereof the King having notice thought it high time for him to interpose (lest silence should make him accessary to a fact so much condemned by his own conscience) and calling both <hi>Houses</hi> together <hi>May</hi> the 1. said,</p>

                                 <hi>First, That I had never any intention of bringing over the</hi> Irish <hi>Army into</hi> England, <hi>nor ever was advised by any body so to do.</hi>

Nay I must confesse for mis-demeanours I am so clear in them, that, though I will not chalk out the way, yet I will shew you, that I think my Lord of</hi> Strafford <hi>is not fit hereafter to serve me, or the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in any place of trust, no not so much as a Constable Therefore I leave it to you, my Lords, to find out some such way as to bring me out of this straight, and keep your selves and the Kingdome from such inconveniences.</hi>

                  <p>This Speech of his Majesty, as any other not formed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients deleterious, was ill relisht by both Houses, so that they went away in much discontent.</p>

                  <p>The late disgust taken at the Kings last Speech, was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95383:133"/>
it stayed not in the Parliament, but became transient and passed to the lower Row; and when the feculent part of the body politique is once stirred, it soon flies up to the disturbance of the whole: so it fared with some tumultuous citizens <hi>May</hi> the 3. who male-content at what the King had said, came downe that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">A Tumult in <hi>Westminster,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Justice against the Earl.</note> to <hi>Westminster,</hi> to the number of five or six thousand, most armed with Swords, demanding justice of the <hi>Lords</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> complaining also that their trade was decayed, and they like to perish for want of bread, because justice was delaied. Their special application was to the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> who went out of his Coach, and with much adoe and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises appeased their fury; neverthelesse to strike the greater ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into all such as did not adhere to their party, they posted upon the gate of <hi>Westminster,</hi> a Catalogue of those whose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages were for the Earles acquital, under the Title of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That day intimation was given to the House of Commons of some practises in the North to distract the <hi>English</hi> Army, and <note place="margin">A Protestation framed by the Commons.</note> to render the Parliament displeasing to them; to en-counter, and as a defensative against which they fell presently upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Protestation: for <hi>maintenance of the true reformed Protestant Religion, expressed in the doctrine of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>The power and privileges of Parliament, and liberty of the Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Protestation being formed, was the next day read in the Lower House, and generally taken by all the members; then was it sent up to the Lords, who took it also, and an order was made for the printing and dispersing it over all <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> the 5. there was an offer made in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <note place="margin">A Bil propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the continuation of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> by one of the Knights of <hi>Lancashire,</hi> that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Majesty the loan of 650000. <hi>l.</hi> untill such time as the subsidies should be raised, if his Majesty would be pleased to passe a Bill that the Parliament might not be adjourned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued or dissolved, without the consent of both Houses, until the general grievances of this Kingdome were redrest. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion occasioned a great debate, and seemed to be of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as presently order was given for a bill to be drawn up in persuance of it.</p>
                  <p>That evening the Lords sent a message to the Commons cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying that they had considered, and consulted upon the Bill of Attainder, but found it the safest course to lay the same aside, because it brought the <hi>King</hi> in as <hi>Iudge,</hi> wherefore they agreed to fall upon the several Articles of his Accusation, and would the next day send them their finall resolution.</p>
                  <p>The next morning <hi>May</hi> the 6. 26. Lords of 45. then present,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95383:133"/>
being directed by the opinion of the Judges, voted the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> guilty of high Treason, upon two Articles; the 15. <hi>for levying of monies in</hi> Ireland <hi>by force in a warlike manner,</hi> and upon the 19. <hi>for imposing an Oath upon the Subjects in</hi>

                     <hi>Ireland,</hi> and gave thereof speedy information to the House of Commons, who were then exceeding busie about the Bill for the continuation of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which the next day being compleatly voted, was sent to the Lords for their conjunction with them, withall requesting they would hasten it with all convenient speed, in regard they desired that and the Bill of Attainder might by si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In this concernment the Lords needed no great stimulation of resolves, the design was plausible, no criticismes of law to be discust, no difficulties to be contended with, so that <hi>May</hi> the 8. they were in state to acquaint the Commons that they fully concurred with them in these votes also; whereupon a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ensued, at which it was resolved that some <hi>Lords</hi> should be dispatched with those Bils to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and to request his <note place="margin">The two Bils tendred to the King.</note> Answer: which was accordingly done, and the King told them they should receive his Answer on Munday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The Sunday intervening was no <hi>Sabbath,</hi> no day of rest to <note place="margin">Heis much per plext what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to return.</note> the <hi>King,</hi> who never found the Royal office to presse, yea so oppresse him as at this instant; infinitely was he distracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>People</hi> and a <hi>Conscience,</hi> both male-content, both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clamorous, one for <hi>mercy,</hi> the other for <hi>justice;</hi> his passion was most intense for both, please both he could not, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please either, pierced his very soul. In this anxiety, in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity <note place="margin">The Bishops advise him to passe the Bils.</note> of thoughts, he consults with four Bishops, desires them as Casuists to advise him what course to steer between these two great Rocks.

                  <p>Munday <hi>May</hi> the 10. in the morning his <hi>Majesty</hi> signed a <note place="margin">He yeelds most unwillingly.</note> Commission to the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> the Lord <hi>Privie Seal,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> and others for the passing of the two Bils, one for the continuation of the Parliament during the pleasure of the two Houses. The other was the Bill of Attainder against the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> but this with an <hi>Utinam nescirem literas.</hi> Never any act past from him with greater reluctancy at the present, or which he bewailed afterward with greater re-morse of conscience, then the frailty of that concession. True it is, he had all the outward motives to it that could be wished, the vehement
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95383:134"/>
importunity of his Nobles, of his venerable Bishops, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the grave Judges, a pretended urgent necessity in order to the satisfaction of his people, yea and the Earls Petition; but what were all these while his conscience remained unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed? Princes may, and ought to hold intelligence, to keep correspondence with their subjects, but be their advice as sound as may be, yet still must it be still <hi>Le Roy,</hi> not <hi>Le Peuple veult;</hi> the Councel may be theirs, the Command must be the Soveraignes. Minatory affronts must not subdue, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their subjects perswade them to concessions repugnant to the dictates of their own consciences. It was excellently said by another Man, not by another King, <hi>That it is a bad exchange to wound a mans own conscience, thereby to salve State-sores;</hi> a maxime so infallibly true, that the first experiment we have in sacred writ of the contrary being acted by the first of <hi>Israels</hi> Kings, cost him no lesse then the losse of his Kingdome, and all upon that solitary account, because, <hi>He feared the people, and obeyed</hi>

                     <hi>their voice.</hi> So fatal is it for a Prince sometimes to resigne a complacence to popular lust.</p>
                  <p>As his Majesties reflexes upon this concession, were never <note place="margin">Censures upon his passing the Bill for the Parliaments continuation.</note> without great regret, so many behold his passing the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant Bill, not a little destructive to his Regal interest, and consequently to his person, as without which the Parliament could not have been in state, and capacity to act what they did against him. On the other side it was argued by others; That his Majesty was not worsted, but rather a gainer by that grant. That it raised in the Subject still further assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his clear intentions to the common-good; that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the entertainment of sinister thoughts against him; that it impowered the Parliament only to sit during pleasure. That his denyal would have generated ill boding jealousies and turbulent animosities. That had it come to the pinch, and had his Majesty endevoured to dissolve the Assembly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Parliament would have disputed his power, and have asserted it as incident to the office of so great Trustees of the the Kingdome, still to continue session in times menacing the ruine of the Kingdome. Did not the late Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> positively declare as much, in the concernment of that Kingdome? And <hi>Scotland</hi> it is well known gave the rule to <hi>England</hi> in most of her late actions.</p>
                  <p>The Kings compliance with his people, and acting yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to the extremity of justice, could not alter his more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural disposition to Mercy, he had still a passion most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for her, and was resolved upon all occasions to act in favour of it; hereupon he this day <hi>May</hi> the 11. wrote to the

Which being accomplished, and more expressions offered, His Majesty suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no more words to come from us, but out of the fulnesse of his heart to the observance of Justice, and for the contentment of his people, told us, that <hi>what he intended by his Letter was with an</hi> If, <hi>If it may be done without discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his people.</hi> If it cannot be, <hi>I say again the same that I wrote, Fiat Iustitia.</hi>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95383:136"/>
At his Majesties departure, we offered up into his hands the Letter it self which he had sent. But he pleased to say, <hi>What I have written to you, I shall be content it be registred by you in your House.</hi> In it you see my mind, <hi>I hope you will use it to mine honour.</hi>

                  <p>This upon return of the Lords from the King, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently reported to the House by the Lord Privie Seal.</p>

Upon his first coming forth being to passe neer the Archbishops lodging (who stood at the window waiting for his approach) he lifted up his eyes and espying the Archbishop, made low obeisance towards him, saying withall, <hi>My Lord your prayers and your blessing.</hi> The Archbishop had scarce ability to lift up his hands and heart in the apprecation, so soon did extremity of passion; strike him into a leipothymie and swounding fit. This was thought by some an argument of too much pusillanimity in so grave a Christian; but the Archbishop said he doubted not but when his own turn came, God would so strengthen him that he should tast that bitter cup with a most Christian courage.</p>
                  <p>The Earl proceeding further, and the passage more throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with people, he heard a great noise amongst the crowd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, Which is he? with that, his countenance all composed to meeknesse, off he puts his hat, and said, I am the man good people, not shewing the least emotion of mind at the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

                  <p>This said, he desired all present to assist him in his prayers, wherein he continued neer a quarter of an hour, then rising up, he bad all his friends farewel, especially by name his brother Sir <hi>George Wentworth,</hi> by whom he sent his love to his wife and blessing to his children, willing him to charge his son, never to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Patrimony of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Then he addrest himself to the block, and having prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, he gave the Executioner the token of his preparednesse, whereat the Heads-man doing his office, severed his head from his body at the first stroke. Thus died this unhappy Earl. And to die thus, by the stroke of Justice, cannot but consign him up to posterity under some more horrid Character, yet lest that ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish should orespread all his fame (drawing aside the traverse) I shall (and I hope without just offence to any) represent such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellences as were in him impaled with, and which might seem if not to ballance, yet somewhat alleviate his other failings.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman he was of rare, choice and singular endowments, <note place="margin">His Character.</note> I mean of such as modelled, fashion'd, and accomplisht him for State concernments; of a searching and penetrating judgment, nimble apprehension, ready and fluent in all results of counsel. Most happy in the vein of speech, which was alwayes round, perspicuous and expresse; much to the advantage of his sense, and so full stockt with reason, that he might be rather said to demonstrate, then to argue. As these abilities raised him to State administration, so his addressing, his applying those abilities so faithfully in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Royal interest, soon rendred him a Favorite of the first admission. So that never King had a more intelligent, and withall a firmer servant then he was to his Master. But these qualities which rendred him so amiable to his Majesty, represented him formidable to the <hi>Scots,</hi> so that some who were not well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95383:138"/>
of the justnesse of his sentence, thought he suffered not so much for what he had done already, as for what he was like to have done, had he lived, to the dis-service of that Nation; and that he was not sacrificed so much to the <hi>Scots revenge,</hi> as to their <hi>fear.</hi> And certainly his fall was, as the first, so the most fatal wound the Kings interest ever received. His three Kingdomes not affording another <hi>Strafford,</hi> that is, one man his peer in parts and fidelity to his Majesty. He had a singular passion for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Patrimony of the Church, both which he was studious to preserve safe and sound, either opining them to be of sacred extraction, or at least prudent constitutions relating to holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. And had he wanted these positive graces, yet in so great a person, it may be commendable, that he was eminent for privative and negative excellencies, being not taxable with any vice, wl ether it was that those petty pleasures are beneath the satisfaction of a soul such as his, and of so large a stature; or that grace had put a restraint upon his appetite. In short, he was a Man who might have passed under a better notion had he lived in other times, or had he in these not played his byas another way.</p>
