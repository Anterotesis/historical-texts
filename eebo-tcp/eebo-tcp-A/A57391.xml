            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This sole point and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath beene the occasion, that some States have beene of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thought that this doore should be opened, to the adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Merchant to attaine unto No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, so as the Father and the Sonne, have continued succesfully for some ages therein; and which is seene in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence would grow many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,<note place="margin">The benefit of the Trade of Nobles and rich in a kingdome.</note> both to the publike and private, for that they that thus deale in traffike, having thus meanes, courage, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, for this Conduct and Enterprise, the same would bee farre greater, and more eminent in it selfe, then now it is, setting thus more ships to sea, and by be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing consequently better armed, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furnished; and whereof the state in time of need, might make good use of, for its safety and defence; and withall it would carry the reputation of that Nation, farre further into remote Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the which they cannot doe, who being poore, and having lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And for other particular Interest, this Commerce being wisely managed, and

discreetly handled, what hazard soever they should run, there is more to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereby, then to be lost: And if Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in generall would thus apply themselves to traffike, as some within these late yeares have beene observed to doe, and that without wasting of their estates by vast Expences, or importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Soveraigne by disorderly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and gifts, they should by all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods benefit themselves more in one yeare, by a well govern'd traffick at sea, then peradventure at Court by ten years waiting and solicitations.</p>
            <p>Finally, to conclude this point, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught, and teacheth us daily, where those of great purses, and good judgements have exercised traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke, and where such have beene bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and encouraged by a gracious, and furthering Soveraigne, and by a Prince that loveth Navigation, and favoureth Traffick; it hath mightily enriched both themselves, and the Princes and Estates, under which they have liv'd; as by the

which are both many and usefull, will againe be transported from the said sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to those Southerne and Westerne Countries, and hereby the Merchants would mightily flourish by this inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of trade.</p>
            <p>Secondly, diverse sea-Townes, where this staple should be kept would be very much enriched.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Mariners and shipping of this Kingdome, would hereby come to be very much enlarged and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, the honour and reputation of this Kingdome will be much advanced in other countries, and much Bullion would thereby come to be imported.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it will keepe all sorts of graine at a reasonable price, both for the buyer and seller, and the countrey should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bee well provided with corne,

if dearth should happen, and thereby also retaine our coine, which upon such an occasion is usually exported.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96715:55"/>
and now which is not above 24. in 25. yeares past, the best of their ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels have not above ten peeces, and of those but very few neither.</p>

               <note place="margin">English East-India trade.</note> Here I could also particularize, the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Incroachments, and Intrusions that have within these late yeares beene laid upon the <hi>East-India</hi> traders of <hi>England,</hi> and their liberties, and what they have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both abroad and at home, by the ill wishers of their prosperity; but what will it availe them, or benefit our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to travell into the disturbations, crosses and afflictions, which they have, to their prejudice, felt, and to their losse suffered? It sufficeth me here to say, that the want of due and timely protection, and incouragement from the Estate, hath reduced them to that bad point, and low passe, wherein we now observe them to bee; and that for the future erecting of such a brave society, a great deale of time, and mony must be expended, and many larger immunities then formerly must be granted, ere the same can be reduced to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96715:55"/>
that pristine flourishing estate we lately have beheld it to be in.</p>
            <p>I could also here,<note place="margin">Turke, and Moscovia Company in

               </note> by way of addition, say somewhat of those disturbances, that the <hi>Turky, Moscovia,</hi> and other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>London</hi> have groaned under; but I trust the goodnesse of our Soveraigne, and the wisdome of his Counsellors, will rectifie the same, or remunerate them by fitting encouragements some other wayes; lest thereby the same be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the present condition of the

            <p>Now, having thus handled the 3. first considerations of trade, &amp; observed that neither naturall nor artificiall commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a kingdom can inrich a countrey without the helpe and hand of traffike; and then shewed what commodities by a well ordered traffike, a Kingdome must suffer entrance, and what prohibit, and what againe to send out, and also what

to forbid, and withall shewed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meanes and wayes that Princes are observed to use to gaine, settle, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and augment the same with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and studious courses that have beene taken by sundry late Princes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and purchase this so beneficiall a commodity: I come now to the last point and consideration before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wherein the rest is for the most part comprehended,<note place="margin">The reasons that doe move Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to covet trade in their Kingdomes.</note> being the reasons and causes that move all estates, Kings and Empires to covet the same, which I may say doth extend it selfe into foure heads and principall parts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> The first is, that traffike with foraine nations is notable in respect of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation thereof.</p>

            <p>First then,<note place="margin">Ttraffike is honourable to the people and country.</note> a well governed traffike, practised in a Kingdome, by judicious and expert Merchants, to foraine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote countries will easily bee granted, and confessed to bee both honourable, and of singular reputation, both to the Soveraigne in his particular, and to the nation in generall. I need not seeke farre for examples, nor search much for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make this good and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, but only looke upon this our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wherein wee live.

Many parts of the world had, peradventure even to this day, lived
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96715:57"/>
in ignorance thereof, and never dreamt of the inhabitants of so small an Iland, had not the traffike of the Merchants by Navigation made it famous over all those remote Regions.</p>

               </note> It is not our conquests, but our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; it is not our swords, but our sayls, that first spred the English name in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> and thence came into <hi>Turky, Armenia, Moscovia, Arabia, Persia, India, China,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed over and about the world; it is the traffike of their Merchants, and the

What part is there unsearched, what place undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, or what place lyes unattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their endeavours, and couragious undertakings? most of which hath beene accompanied with such fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,<note place="margin">League con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the English Merchants with foraine Princes.</note> that they have contracted Leagues and Amity with the Mogull, Persian, Turke, Moscovite, and other mighty fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Princes in their Soveraignes name, and to his honour; which even in our Fathers dayes was not knowne to us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have any such condition, or being the Merchants of <hi>England.</hi> And to speak truth of <hi>London,</hi> maintaining now at their charge an Agent in <hi>Moscovia,</hi> an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and three Consuls in <hi>Turky,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Presidents and Agents also in <hi>India, Persia,</hi> and many other places thereof, which by computation cannot cost them lesse then one hundred thousand pounds yearely (which though it may<note place="margin">At their own charge 100000. l. yearely.</note>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Danes, Sweeds and Germans not knowne in <hi>India,</hi> &amp;c.</note> The Danes and Swedish nations are potent, and the French are yet more powerfull in Europe; yet if you travell into <hi>India, Persia,</hi> and many of those Easterne Kingdomes of the world, they know of no such people, Kings or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but hold all Europe to be inhabited by the Portugals, English and Dutch; nay the French are hardly knowne in

for some leagues, which the Sophy would sometimes have contracted with him, to the prejudice of <hi>Turky,</hi> and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
            <p>So that by what hath beene said, the Commerce of Merchants, though many times it be accompanied with losse and prejudice to themselves, and estates, and that they are enforced to expose their fortunes to the mercy of mercilesse stormes and tempests, &amp; be subject to the Lawes of Heathenish Princes, and groan under the heavy customes of many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes and Infidels; yet is it still at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon with a great deale of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their owne Prince, and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his subjects: Therefore I will conclude here this point, that a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered traffike managed by skilfull Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, hath beene, and ever will be, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to that Kingdome and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, where the same is duely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and carefully protected, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96715:61"/>
the State and good Iudgement, that the same doth not onely supply their owne occasions, with what warlike provisions they want, but withall have thereof in such abundance, that from their owne states they furnish freely all other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring countries whatsoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; for the Arts-men that are by them employed daily, in building of ships, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of Artillery, making of Muskets, shot, powder, swords, pikes, corslets, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Canvas, and the like Habiliments of warre, doe not only supply their owne turnes, and necessities, and that both cheape and plentifull; but herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so farre, contrary to the politike Rules of many countries, that they sell, and vent their over-plus; yea even to the Spaniards their very enemies conceiving it, no ill trick of thrift, nor yet small point of State-stratagem, to draw thus the monies and wealth of their greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to be a reward to their owne labour and industry, and so sell as it may be said (for monies to their foes) the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96715:61"/>
very sword, which peradventure may aftewards be imployed in the cutting of their owne throats, but being instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments considerable, and which must necessarily be had in warre, and which will be by their enemies had else-where for monies, if not of them, they chuse rather thus to sell them, and so by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting an unusuall policy of state, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour for their monies to give them with their owne consents, and that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and of their owne accord, what they cannot with their best of policie otherwise prevent, and what their enemies will bee furnished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in despight of their utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours else-where.</p>
            <p>I need not insist further upon this point, having declared the honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and strength, both offensive and defensive, which doth arise to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth or Countrey by a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered traffike, managed by Regular and Iudicious Merchants, I could here adde to what I have said before in the behalfe
