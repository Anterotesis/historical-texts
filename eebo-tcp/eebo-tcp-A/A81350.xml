            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And laſtly; I requeſt thoſe, who are ſo prone to term us
Schiſmaticks, to examine, what obligation there lieth upon us
to conform any more to <hi>Rome</hi> then <hi>Geneva;</hi> and why not to
the poore <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as well as to either, if it have as
much truth; or indeed, why not to the <hi>Primitive</hi> rather than
any. Certain I am, that they will never be able to prove out
of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that if the Biſhop of Rome (or any other Biſhop)
require ſubſcription to any errour (eſpecially to any that is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119957:6"/>
damnable or dangerous) as the condition of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
any man was any longer bound to communicate with them
(becauſe then he were bound to communicate in ſinne) or by
conſequence to be obedient to them. Whence it will follow,
That if the Pope make a new Creed: and put in ſome things
that contradict the Apoſtolicall (as he did at Trent: If he
will force us to profeſſe and practiſe the contrary to Chriſt's
precepts (as in mutilating the Communion; and ſeverall
kinds of ſuperſtition, idolatry, and tyranny,) We are not in
a <hi>Schiſme</hi> for not ſubſcribing and obeying, but He for <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
And alſo it will follow, that Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Daillé hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a very right method; And that the queſtion of ſchiſme
ought to <hi>follow,</hi> and not <hi>go before</hi> that of hereſie or errour.
For if the Biſhop of Rome be in <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> we are not then in
fault for not remaining under his government, although we
had been under it ever ſince the firſt plantation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
in England (<hi>hoc dato, non conceſſo</hi>) ſince he now
exacteth our aſſent &amp; ſubſcription to a damnable errour, as a
part of our Communion. And therefore I cannot but wonder,

define <hi>the Church</hi> to be <hi>a ſocietie of thoſe whom God
hath called to ſalvation, by the profeſſion of the TRUE
FAITH, ſincere adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and
adherence to lawfull Paſtours:</hi> and yet that he ſhould both
uſe the Romaniſts method, and find fault with them that do
not, ibid. c. 4. For if the Church be ſuch a Society; Either
every member of that Church is obliged to know, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to examine) <hi>the true Faith, and ſincere adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacraments;</hi> or he is obliged to make profeſſion
of that which he doth not know, and hath not examined.
Which is far beneath a rationall man, much more a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And in truth, this I take to be the firſt particular that ſhould
be conſidered. For unleſſe men before they diſpute, will be

it, to do him a courteſie, c. 5. §. 85. In requitall
whereof, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. K. firſt blames him for it, and then begs the
queſtion; ſaying, That in the queſtion between the Church of
Rome and us there is a divine command, not to depart <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi>
ſhe impoſe. So that till the queſtions be ſtated right, &amp;
in due method, that is, till it be examined whether the
Church of Rome have corruptions and impoſe them, 'twill
never appeare, whether <hi>ſhe</hi> or <hi>we</hi> be in the ſchiſme.</p>
            <p>And certes, methinks it is not fair, to beg the queſtion ſo oft
as he doth, &amp; tell us that we are no Chriſtians, unleſſe we
are infallibly certain that the Church is infallible; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pretend to prove it ſo, by any other motives than thoſe of
credibility, which at beſt are but <hi>probable:</hi> and to me they
ſeem not ſuch. I proteſt, I have oft wiſht heartily they did,
having found ſo many diſcouragements for a ſcholar in late
years, that I long ſince concluded him a wiſeman, who ſaid, <hi>He

that the <hi>love</hi> of learning and truth (which is the moſt that

could be attained full as well without it: which it might,
if it were infallibly certain, that the Romane Church is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
And ſo while M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Knot goes about to prove that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
overthroweth Chriſtian Religion; and tells us that it muſt
be built onely upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church, and then

builds that Authoritie onely upon <hi>reaſons,</hi> and thoſe very
weak ones, and no way able to ſupport his ſuperſtructure, he
will let all fall, unleſſe the ſame faculty be a <hi>pillar</hi> under his

uſe of interjections in exclaiming againſt Chillingworth and
other Proteſtants in England, for pulling down, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            </p>
            <p>Yet give me leave to adde one thing more; That 'tis cleare
to me, None of the Ancient Chriſtians believed the Church of
Rome to be a Guide, or Judge of all Controverſies in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity:
wherein M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. K. may do very well to ſatisfie me,
or [as his friends do] blame <hi>them,</hi> for this reaſon among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Becauſe in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others their
Catalogues of Hereticks, none are branded for denying <hi>this</hi>
which they all did. And if it had been believed at all (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
as it is generally now, <hi>viz. to be the original of all
other hereſies,</hi> it had been farre more rationall to have put
in <hi>this;</hi> and left out <hi>all the reſt;</hi> then to have dealt with
poſterity as we ſee they have. That <hi>Tertullian, Vincentius
Lirinenſis,</hi> and ſeverall others ſhould give us <hi>rules</hi> to know
Hereticks by, and forget this, <hi>the main and cleareſt.</hi> And,
which is ſtranger yet, that not onely <hi>Optatus</hi> (l. 5. <hi>contra

            <p>And again, That not onely all the Fathers of the firſt
CCC yeares, ſhould paſſe over this opinion of the Romane
Churches great Authority in ſilence (the believing or disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
which alone, with the Romaniſts now, denominates
every man a Catholick or an Heretick) but that the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
alſo of thoſe dayes ſhould ſay nothing of it, if ſhe had any
ſuch thing, ſeemeth no more probable to me, then that any
learned man hereafter will write the Chronicle of England,

            </p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much in generall concerning the manner
of M. <hi>Knots</hi> diſputes, and his unfitting Topicks, wherein he
miſtaketh Antiquity for Truth, &amp; citations out of Proteſtants
(oft falſified) for <hi>infallible</hi> concluſions: and beſeeching
M. <hi>Knot,</hi> if he ſhall vouchſafe an anſwer to this paper, not
to skip over theſe two laſt leaves, but to give me ſome reaſon,
<hi>Why any Chriſtian is BOUND to believe ſuch poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as are confeſſedly novell?</hi> And if he will ſay, that
<hi>all</hi> (which he cannot with modeſty; or that <hi>any,</hi> which he

that which is not true; that he would conſider how he puts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

now to take a ſhort view of his particular diſcourſes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at his <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 4. <hi>and</hi> 5. After he hath given his Readers ſome
<hi>admonitions how to read his book</hi> [I wiſh that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to anſwer the whole, had printed M. <hi>Chill's</hi> with
it, that we might the more readily have compared them] and
told them, <hi>that one half of CHARITY MAINTAINED
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119957:14"/>
is yet unanſwered</hi> [he who readeth Mr. <hi>Chill's</hi> book, or but
the laſt lines of it, ſees the reaſon of <hi>that]</hi> he profeſſeth,
<hi>That he will not meddle with Mr.</hi> Chill's <hi>anſwer to the
direct. to N. N.</hi> (very ingenuouſly ſpoken!) but why? <hi>becauſe
it is confuted by a book entituled,</hi> THE J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DGEMENT
OF AN <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NIVERSITY-MAN CONCERNING Mr.
CHILLINGWORTHS PAMPHLET: 'twas a pretty
little Pamphlet! but whether that <hi>Judgement of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity-man,</hi>
which I never met with any man whoſoever that
ſaw (unleſſe ſuch to whom I have ſhew'd it) be a reall anſwer
to <hi>any</hi> page of Mr. <hi>Chill's</hi> book, any more then <hi>Chaucers
tales</hi> are, I deſire any unprejudiced man to determine. Onely I
muſt take notice (as I paſſe) that Mr <hi>Knot</hi> doth very well,
to obſerve ſo ſoon that precept, which <hi>Tully</hi> gives his <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
(and <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in <hi>Ovid,</hi> againſt <hi>Ajax,</hi> practiſeth) to skip
over the hardeſt arguments. What 'tis in an <hi>Oratour</hi> I'le not
ſay; but I am ſure, it is no great ſigne of a good <hi>Diſputant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing he telleth us is [§. 10. and 11. and ſo to
the end af the Preface] how the very title of Mr. <hi>Chill's</hi>
book may be conſuted out of Mr. <hi>Chill's</hi> own words: for
which he citeth p. 21. <hi>mihi</hi> lin. 3. from whence M. <hi>Knot</hi>
concludeth, <hi>That millions of Proteſtants erre damnably;</hi>
and that Mr. <hi>Chill.</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is no ſafe way to ſalvation.</hi> I anſwer: <hi>I confide,</hi>
(to uſe Mr. <hi>Knots</hi> words) <hi>that every indifferent Reader
will find this to be clearly</hi> falſe: For firſt, he ſpeaketh no
more of Proteſtants than Papiſts, but equally of both. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he ſaith not categorically they <hi>do erre,</hi> but <hi>it is to be
feared</hi> they (both Proteſtants and Papiſts) do. Thirdly, he
ſaith not <hi>abſolutely</hi> neither, but on ſuppoſition, <hi>IF any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
or Papiſt be held in any errour by any ſinne of
their will, then ſuch errour is as the cauſe of it, ſinfull
and damnable.</hi> And this none that I know, unleſſe himſelf,
will or can deny. It being a truth ſufficiently manifeſt; and
aſſerted by his great Maſters, <hi>P. Lombard,</hi> and <hi>T. Aquinas,</hi>
and the greateſt ſtream of Schole-men and Caſuiſts. And to
tell Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> my mind freely, I am clearly of Mr. <hi>Chill's</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:119957:14"/>
opinion, viz. That <hi>Proteſtant Religion is a ſafe way to
ſalvation,</hi> and yet that many Proteſtants go to hell: That
there are millions of Proteſtants, who think, <hi>not to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi>
is enough not to be damned: and millions of Papiſts who
think <hi>not to be a Proteſtant,</hi> is enough to oblige Almighty
God, and merit heaven. And I take both parties to be extreme
blame-worthy for deeming ſo; and Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> muſt give me
leave to wonder, if any rationall man ſhall blame me for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, without giving his reaſons.</p>
            <p>Now we come to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knots</hi> very large Introduction,
where § 2. p. 38. he layeth down this propoſition to be
proved, <hi>Chriſtian Religion is abſolutely and infallibly
true.</hi> And ſo he ſpends you above fifteen ſheets in pretending
to prove it, and the <hi>Neceſſity of Grace;</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi>
of theſe by the <hi>laſt.</hi> And if <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chill.</hi> neither denied
the <hi>neceſſity of Grace,</hi> nor the <hi>infallibility of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion,</hi> I deſire the Reader to conſider whether
he have not fifteen ſheets together of <hi>impertinencies.</hi>
And that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chill.</hi> denyed neither of theſe, will clearly
enough appear to any that are not willing to be deceived, if
they can ſpare leiſure to read over <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chillingworth's</hi>
pamphlet (as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knots friend</hi> calls it) or but conſult
thoſe very paſſages from which <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi> taketh the occaſion
of theſe long diſcourſes, and which he citeth out of <hi>Maſter
Chillingworths</hi> ſixth Chapter; where his <hi>3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </hi> § begins thus,
<hi>I do HEARTILY acknowledge, and believe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our Faith to be in themſelves Truths, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and INFALLIBLE as the very common principles
of GEOMETRY and MATHEMATICKS.</hi> But as if
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi> (notwithſtanding the Metaphyſicks he boaſteth ſo much
of) knew not the difference between <hi>certitudo objecti &amp;
ſubjecti,</hi> he ſeeketh advantage from what followeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
viz. <hi>But That there is required of us a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them, and an adherence to them, of SENSE
or SCIENCE; That ſuch a certainty is required of us
UNDER PAIN OF DAMNATION: So that NO
man CAN HOPE to be in a ſtate of ſalvation but he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119957:15"/>
that finds in himſelf ſuch a degree of faith, ſuch a
ſtrength of adherence; This I have already demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be a great errour, and of dangerous and pernicious
conſequence. And becauſe I am more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in my perſwaſion, I will here confirm it with
reaſons, &amp;c. p.</hi> 311. From which paſſage whether any juſt
advantage can be taken, (eſpecially for a digreſſion of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſheets) let every unpaſſionate Reader judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap. 1. § 2. p.</hi> 38. He layes down this propoſition to
be proved, <hi>Chriſtian faith is abſolutely and infallibly
true:</hi> by Chriſtian faith he explains (two lines after his
propoſition.) himſelf to mean, <hi>the true Religion.</hi> Now
1. This is the ſame vein of Sophiſtry which I noted even
now, and runnes through the whole book, when he ſpeaks
of <hi>infallibility.</hi> The queſtion being not at all <hi>de certitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
objecti</hi> but <hi>ſubjecti;</hi> not whether <hi>divine truths</hi> be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<hi>infallible,</hi> (this none doubteth, who admits a <hi>God,</hi>
in the <hi>true</hi> notion) but whether we are <hi>infallibly</hi> certain,
That <hi>theſe</hi> or <hi>thoſe</hi> poſitions are <hi>Divine truths. 2. Maſter
Chill.</hi> tells us in the ninth § of his <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that the
<hi>end of his book was to confirm the truth of the divine
&amp; infallible Religion of Jeſus Chriſt. 3. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi> takes
notice of it, and citeth that very paſſage, and ſuch others.
<hi>[c. 1. § 39. p. 66.]</hi> So that to make a great noiſe againſt
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chill.</hi> and to endeavour to prove <hi>againſt him,</hi> what
he believeth and granteth (nay what he knoweth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
he grants; as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi> doth here, and oft elſewhere)
is ſuch a piece of Jeſuitical <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>civility,</hi> as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
never learnt. 4. He tells us, that in the proof of this
propoſition, he maintaineth the cauſe of <hi>All Chriſtians,</hi> and
of <hi>all men</hi> and <hi>mankind.</hi> 'Tis a comfort to meet with
ſuch a charitable perſon. But if he have <hi>all</hi> Chriſtians, nay
<hi>all</hi> men, <hi>all</hi> mankind, of his perſwaſion (and ſaith ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
who are his <hi>adverſaries?</hi> If <hi>all men, all mankind</hi>
be for the infallibility of <hi>all</hi> faith, then ſure <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chill.</hi>
is ſo too (for though I never ſaw or knew him, otherwiſe
then by his printed book, I ever took him for a <hi>man;</hi> and I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119957:15"/>
believe <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi> who hath reaſon to know him better then I,
hath found him ſo:) And if <hi>all</hi> be not of <hi>Maſter Knots</hi>
mind, then nothing can be concluded hence, but that he was
in a <hi>paſſion,</hi> when he wrote this book: &amp; ſo may be the better
excuſed for declaming againſt reaſon. But 5. Had <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi>
read <hi>Sextus Empericus,</hi> and been acquainted with the
<hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> he might have found many (and they no <hi>fools,</hi>
but famous <hi>Philoſophers</hi>) who were not for his <hi>abſolute
infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I wiſh Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> may never be one of them. I hope
be is, and will continue, <hi>a Chriſtian.</hi> Onely give me leave to
tell him, That if nothing elſe could be ſaid for the truth of our
<hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but what is in his <hi>Infidelitie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked,</hi>
and <hi>Vanninus his Amphitheatrum,</hi> heu! actum
eſſet de Palladio. Since (not to trouble you with tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
his poſitions, which I cited pag. 14.) having told us, That
it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> that ſupernaturall knowledge ſhould be moſt
certain and infallible; and, That a man is <hi>as</hi> happy without
any belief of Chriſtian Religion, as without one that is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
<hi>he ſaith,</hi> p. 52. <hi>That 'tis impoſſible Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
can retain the higheſt degree of probability, if it
have no greater perfection then it receiveth from the
ſole probable arguments of credibility.</hi> And then (through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole book) he hath not <hi>one</hi> argument which pretends
to reach higher than to a <hi>probability</hi> (I wiſh any of them
would reach ſo high) for the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the Church or
living Judge (upon which he endeavours to build all the
reſt) unleſſe you will grant (which indeed he contendeth
hard for) <hi>Concluſionem non ſemper ſequi deteriorem
partem,</hi> That the concluſion may ſometimes be <hi>ſtronger</hi>
than the premiſes. And indeed it concerns him, to deſire it
ſhould be granted: for the premiſes which he bringeth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly be any <hi>juſt</hi> foundation of his <hi>confident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us come to his proofs: p. 2. §. 2. he goes about to
prove, <hi>Chriſtian faith is infallible, and exempt from all
poſſibility of errour, or falſhood.</hi> His end is, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119957:16"/>
that he may prove the Romane Faith and Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible:
His medium is this, FAITH <hi>is the gift of God,
and the prime veritie cannot inſpire a falſhood.</hi> This I
confeſſe is an <hi>argument</hi> to prove the infallibility of the
Church, which I never met or heard of before. And I doubt
it will prove more then he would have it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
(ſince they have faith, as Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> in Cha. Ma. par.
1. c. 1. §. 3, 4. granteth they have [unleſſe he'l ſay, a man
may be ſaved without it, contrary to Hebr. <hi>xi. 6.]</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> ſaith expreſly in print, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantibus
credentibus, &amp;c. they neither want</hi> FAITH,
<hi>nor a</hi> CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH, <hi>nor</hi> SALVATION) are infallible, as
well as <hi>Romane-Catholicks.</hi> And then Romane Catholicks
cannot be <hi>infallible,</hi> unleſſe infallible men may contradictions
another.</p>
            <p>By the word <hi>ſaith</hi> in this argument, Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> meaneth
either the <hi>object</hi> of faith, or the <hi>act</hi> of ſaith. If he mean the
<hi>object</hi> of faith (the word of God revealed in the Goſpel)
he abuſeth <hi>himſelf,</hi> and <hi>us;</hi> for no Chriſtian ever denied it.
If he mean the <hi>act</hi> of faith (as he muſt, if he ſay any thing
againſt his Adverſary, or to the purpoſe) then by this diſcourſe
not onely the Pope, but <hi>every Biſhop, every Prieſt,</hi> nay, Thou
and I, and <hi>every Chriſtian man and woman</hi> in the world,
who hath infuſed ſaith, and that gift of God, are as <hi>infallible</hi>
as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet on this ſandy argument Mr.
<hi>Knot</hi> at the firſt entrance, layes the <hi>foundation</hi> of all his
Book; and chooſeth rather to build the infallibility of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion <hi>hereon,</hi> than (with his companions) upon the
infallibilitie of the Church.</p>
            <p>In reading Mr. <hi>Knot's</hi> book I ſtood amazed, to heare him
ſay ſo oft, that he had already proved the <hi>infallibilitie of
his Church;</hi> and ſearching from <hi>Chapter</hi> to <hi>Chapter,</hi> I
found no other argument, beſide what I mentioned p. 10. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the infallibilitie of faith</hi> (to which I conceive I
have ſaid enough) but the notes of credibility, p. 428. viz.
<hi>Miracles, ſanctitie, ſufferings, victory over enemies,
converſion of Nations, [wealthy,</hi> he might have ſaid.]</p>

Concerning which I come now to ſpeak ſomewhat briefly.
1. For <hi>Miracles;</hi> Chriſt and the Apoſtles bid us to take heed
of them; and ſo we have the evidence of their true miracles
then, to keep us from all falſe ones now; and we are bid to
examine the <hi>miracles</hi> by the <hi>doctrine,</hi> not the <hi>doctrine</hi> by

            <p>2. <hi>Sanctitie of life.</hi> This argument varieth with the
climate; and in moſt places proveth rather <hi>againſt</hi> Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
than <hi>for</hi> them. 'Tis not long, ſince <hi>Clemangis, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpencaeus,
Alvarez, Petrarch, Pelagius, Dantes, Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and the <hi>Cardinals</hi> delegated by <hi>P. Paul III.</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Romane Doctors complained, That all the miſeries
and civil warres in Chriſtendome, came from the ill lives of
their Monaſtical and Clergy-men; ſince <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſent great
numbers of Popes to hell together; and are they now come to
be the onely <hi>Saints</hi> on earth? 'Tis confeſſed, That <hi>diſcipline</hi>
(wherein even thoſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> calls <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi>
by the confeſſion of their moſt dreadfull Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
go beyond Romaniſts) <hi>dangers,</hi> and ſuch <hi>externals,</hi>
make great alterations on ſome mens lives. And in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
there cannot be many <hi>monſtrous wicked</hi> men of that
Religion (yet ſome there are) becauſe not <hi>many</hi> men, in
compariſon with Proteſtants. But what kind of people the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119957:17"/>
plurality of them be in <hi>other</hi> Nations, <hi>all the world</hi> knows.
And <hi>Salmeron</hi> [in epiſt. Pauli. de falſis ſignis Eccl. diſp. 3.]
<hi>Coſterus</hi> [Enchirid. controverſ. c. 2. p. 101.] <hi>à Coſta</hi>
[de tempor. noviſs. l. 2. c. 20.] are ſo ingenuous, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
expreſly, That <hi>a life apparently good and honeſt, is
not proper to any one Sect, but common to</hi> JEWS,
TURKS, and HERETICKS. <hi>And</hi> Card. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
confeſſeth it tacitely; while in his letter to his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle, he
mentioneth not the good lives of any Catholicks. And S.
<hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> [in Matth. <hi>iii.</hi> hom. 4.] is as plain and large to
my purpoſe, as any of them. It is too plain, that arguing from
the pretended <hi>holineſſe</hi> of mens <hi>lives,</hi> to the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of
their <hi>cauſe,</hi> or <hi>opinion,</hi> is a Paralogiſme, which hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<hi>Arianiſme, Pelagianiſme,</hi> and other <hi>hereſies</hi> of old,
<hi>Mahumetaniſme, Familiſme,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> of late:
And unleſſe God of His infinite Mercy prevent, may ruine
Chriſtendome now. His other Notes are ſo far from arguments,
that I am a little aſhamed to ſay any thing to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </hi> is <hi>SUFFERINGS.</hi> And do not <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
ſuffer more in moſt other parts of Chriſtendome, by the <hi>State,</hi>
or the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> (where ſome, as our worthy Confeſſour
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moll,</hi> have been and are kept in a cloſe priſon or dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
for above twenty years meerly for Religion) or by <hi>both?</hi>
So that thoſe arguments which their <hi>Chriſtian Moderatour</hi>
brings, ſuppoſing them <hi>rationall</hi> in themſelves, cannot be
ſuch coming from a Romaniſt, unleſs, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis,
alteri nèfeceris,</hi> be an <hi>unreaſonable</hi> Law; &amp; not <hi>Nature's.</hi>
Nay, do not the Socinians, Anabaptiſts, Arians, Atheiſts, ſuffer
too; and <hi>burn</hi> rather then <hi>turn?</hi> witneſſe <hi>Servetus, John
of Leiden, Hacket, Vanninus, Fontanier, Ket, Leggat,
Theophile, Gentilis,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Victory over all ſorts of enemies.</hi> This makes more for
Turciſm then Popery, for the Alcaron, then the Conc. of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>CONVERSION OF INFIDELS.</hi> I would fain
know what he means by <hi>Infidels</hi> (for he cannot but know,
that thouſands have been converted by <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>all</hi> of <hi>every</hi> nation? or how <hi>many</hi> converts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119957:18"/>
to make up this <hi>note?</hi> and whether <hi>ſo many,</hi> in
<hi>every</hi> age? 'Tis certain, that multitudes of <hi>Infidels</hi> have
been converted to <hi>Mahumetaniſme;</hi> and more <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
of late years to <hi>Judaiſme</hi> and <hi>Turciſme,</hi> then <hi>Turks</hi> or
<hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> or <hi>Popery.</hi> And to ſee what manner,
of Chriſtians the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> make in both the <hi>Indies,</hi> you
need read no other books then <hi>their own</hi> letters, their own
Biſhop, <hi>de las Caſas</hi> book, or <hi>Benzo's, cited p.</hi> 30. To turn
a rich fruitfull land into a deſolate wilderneſſe, is in the new
Romane language <hi>converſion.</hi> In a word, who ever ſhall pleaſe
to examine theſe notes (which are <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knot's laſt</hi> argument,
and other mens <hi>firſt, chief,</hi> and <hi>ordinary,</hi> for the infallibility
of the Church) or any other that he or his <hi>Society</hi> can bring
ſhall find that they offend againſt thoſe properties, which
<hi>Bellarmine, Salmeron,</hi> and other Romane <hi>Controvertiſts</hi>
require in all Notes; as That they ſhould be <hi>verae, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtae,
propriae, non communes, inſeparabiles, &amp;c.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt undoubted <hi>note</hi> of a diſtinguiſhing <hi>Note, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri
non quadrare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed his marks ſeem to me ſo weak arguments, that I
cannot find how any man can be convinced by them, unleſſe
through the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>propounder:</hi> ſo that if a
man yields upon them, it muſt be out of <hi>civility,</hi> or <hi>fear of
gainſaying.</hi> But when men are <hi>reſolved</hi> upon a Concluſion,
impertinencies are eaſily fancied to be as ſtrong demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as any in <hi>Euclide.</hi> The <hi>Pythagorians</hi> being bred up
in poſitions concerning <hi>numbers,</hi> fancied them the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
even of <hi>Naturall bodies.</hi> Every <hi>rack</hi> in the clouds
is a Regiment in a young <hi>ſouldiers</hi> eye, and the leaſt <hi>ſcratch</hi>
in the wall a babie in the <hi>childs:</hi> all chymnes ſound their
<hi>Whittington.</hi> I wiſh the <hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knots</hi> arguments were
as concluding as the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Drelincourts</hi> 100
againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>heartily</hi> wiſh (as I ſaid before) for an <hi>infallible
Judge,</hi> and ſhall come with as much prejudice <hi>againſt</hi> my
own perſwaſion (for as yet I ſee no hope of any in this
world) to hear <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knots</hi> argument, as he can deſire, in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119957:18"/>
any Reader. But I would be loth to run in a <hi>circle,</hi> and
miſtake a wiſh that ſome perſon were infallible for a <hi>proof</hi>
that he is. And therefore, if <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi> ſhall think this paper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
any anſwer, beſides an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which I ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in this Controverſie) I ſhall beſeech him, that before
he tell us again that he hath proved the Church of Rome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
He would be pleaſed to reſolve theſe following que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions:
which I think muſt neceſſarily precede the examination
of that, which he in moſt leaves taketh for granted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Whether there be any infallible Judge on earth? <hi>II.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Church be that Judge? and not rather ſome one of
thoſe ten things which Mr. <hi>Chill.</hi> nameth, and bringeth
Scripture for, chap. 3. §. 8? <hi>III.</hi> Whether the Romane
Church be that Church? <hi>IV.</hi> If it be, in what capacity? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Infallibility be 1. in the head (the Pope) as the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
generally, and many Canoniſts affirm; or 2. in the
body of the Church as <hi>Panormitanus, Occam, Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
Antoninus, Clemangis, Cuſanus</hi> and others hold, and
give their reaſons. And then whether in the whole body dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive,
or in the collective in a Councel? And if a Councel
be infallible, then whether it be ſo onely with the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
or without it? And which way ſoever they ſay, I
enquire further <hi>V.</hi> How we ſhall certainly know who muſt
be members of it, 1. <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laicks,</hi> or 2. onely <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy?</hi>
And if ſo, whether 1. onely <hi>Biſhops</hi> (as commonly they
ſay) or 2. <hi>Presbyters</hi> too and <hi>Deacons,</hi> or <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi>
at leaſt? for we find all theſe uſually ſubſcribing. <hi>VI.</hi> Or
(let the Councel be as they would have it) how ſhall I be
ſure they are infallible? For 1. Are they ſo <hi>abſolutely</hi> infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
as that they cannot determine falſly <hi>in rebus fidei,</hi> do
what they will? Or 2. Are they infallible onely <hi>if they uſe
all thoſe good means, which God hath given them, to
find truth;</hi> that is, if they read, ſtudie, diſpute, ſearch
records, pray, and lay aſide all paſſions, private ends,
and intereſts? <hi>VII.</hi> How ſhall I know when they
determine <hi>aright?</hi> what is required to a Synodicall
<hi>Conſtitution?</hi> Muſt <hi>all</hi> concurre in the Vote, or will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119957:19"/>
the <hi>major</hi> part ſerve the turn? <hi>VIII.</hi> What makes
a Councel <hi>Generall?</hi> Muſt <hi>all</hi> the Biſhops in the Chriſtian
world be <hi>called? IX.</hi> And when they are called muſt they
<hi>all come,</hi> elſe is it <hi>no General</hi> Councel? <hi>X.</hi> Who muſt
<hi>call</hi> the Generall Councel, the <hi>Pope,</hi> or Chriſtian <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Emperours?</hi> and how ſhall I be aſſured <hi>which</hi> of them
muſt? <hi>XI.</hi> How <hi>farre</hi> are their determinations infallible?
whether in matters of <hi>fact</hi> as well as <hi>faith?</hi> And <hi>XII.</hi> If
in matters of <hi>faith</hi> onely: then whether in <hi>fundamentals</hi>
onely (as <hi>many</hi> Catholicks ſaid of old, and <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Holden</hi> the
Sorboniſt at preſent) or in <hi>ſuperſtructures</hi> too, as others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?
And then <hi>XIII.</hi> How ſhall I infallibly know which
points are <hi>fundamental,</hi> which not? <hi>XIV.</hi> But admit
all this were determined, and our infallible Judge were a
General <hi>Councel</hi> with the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet in a time of <hi>ſchiſme</hi>
when there be two or three <hi>Popes</hi> at once [as there were
<hi>Clement III, &amp; Greg. VII. Gelaſius II, and Greg. VIII.
Celeſtin II, and Honorius II. Anacletus II, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
II. Victor IV, and Alex. III. Clement VII,
and Urbane VI. Eugenius IV, and Felix V. Gautier</hi>
the Jeſuite will help you to a larger catalogue] and theſe
warring one against another; as when there were <hi>two</hi> triple-crowns,
one at <hi>Rome,</hi> the other at <hi>Avignon;</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi>
for the firſt, the <hi>French</hi> for the latter: the <hi>Court</hi> and the
<hi>Cardinals, bulls</hi> and <hi>indulgences</hi> at both places. And
thus were there ſaith <hi>John le Maire,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">de la difference entre les Schiſmes, &amp; les Conciles. 3. part.</note> many Popes at
once, one againſt another, for 40
<hi>years together: ſo that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt
Clergy-men alive knew
not which was S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peters true ſucceſſour:</hi> and thus ſaith
<hi>reaſon</hi> may there be again. Then I ask, how I ſhall know
which is the <hi>infallible</hi> judge? And if <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. K.</hi> give us <hi>in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>
that generall rule which he ſets down p. 369. <hi>When</hi> de
facto <hi>any Pope defines ſome truth to be a matter of faith,
we are ſure even by his doing ſo that he is true Pope.</hi>
Then I'le reply, (to omit the circle he runs in) that there may
be not onely two but twenty true Popes together, for twenty
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119957:19"/>
men may define twenty ſeverall poſitions at the ſame time,
and all true: and yet all theſe men may be foulely miſtaken
another time; and if ſo, I deſire to know whether all theſe
will be true Popes? Or by what rule a Romaniſt may tell
when a truth is defined and when not? ſince <hi>Sixtus V.</hi>
defined one Bible to be true <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. and <hi>Clemens
VIII</hi> another, two years after; and each of them prohibited
and condemned all but his own: and theſe two Bibles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
many contradictions each to other [See <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> James of
the contrariety of the vulgar Latine Bibles]</hi> and certainly
contradictory propoſitions cannot both be <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And if not,
then either one of theſe two was not ſuch really (whence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
enough will follow) or they were <hi>both</hi> true
Popes; and ſo both their definitions true: and ſo no true
Papiſt hath any true Bible. <hi>XV.</hi> But ſuppoſe there be
no <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and all agreed on the <hi>Pope,</hi> and a General
<hi>Councel</hi> met; How ſhall I be ſure that he who is reputed
<hi>Pope,</hi> is ſo indeed? ſeeing (by their own principles) <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi>
makes him none; [See the <hi>Bull of P. Julius II.

it is impoſſible for me to know. The election of <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus

the See, to come to a Councel at <hi>Sevil</hi> in Spain, where the
<hi>original</hi> writing was produced, and the crime was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
proved. And if ſo, all the Cardinals which were
made by this <hi>Sixtus</hi> were in reality no Cardinals, and then
all the Popes which have been made by thoſe Cardinals ſince,
[as <hi>Montaltus (Sixtus</hi> his Nephew) <hi>Urban VII. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory

are <hi>Biſhops</hi> indeed? For if they be no Biſhops,
then it is no Councel. And that they are true Biſhops,
it is for ever impoſſible for any Papiſt certainly to <hi>know.</hi>
For if he that did ordain them did not <hi>intend</hi> it, when
he gave Orders, (and whether he did or no, God onely
knows) then, by their own principles, they are no <hi>Biſhops;</hi>
and by conſequence no <hi>Councel. XVII.</hi> But further how
ſhall I know that the Pope and Biſhops ſo met (at <hi>Trent</hi>
for example) are <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> For if not, then ſure they are
no legitimate <hi>Councel,</hi> or Church repreſentative: And that
they are Chriſtians, 'tis impoſſible for any Catholick to know,
with any infallible certainty. For if they be not <hi>baptized,</hi>
then I am ſure with them they are no <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and if the
Prieſt that baptized them, did not <hi>intend</hi> to do it, then (by
the Canon of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel) they are <hi>not</hi> baptized.
Now what the Prieſt <hi>intended,</hi> when he adminiſtred that
Sacrament, 'tis impoſſible that any (ſave God who knows
the heart) ſhould certainly know (without immediate <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
which they pretend not to) and conſequently,
'tis impoſſible that any of them ſhould certainly know, That
ever there was a <hi>Pope,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or a <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſince our
Saviours dayes: nay impoſſible that <hi>They</hi> ſhould know whether
there he now <hi>one Chriſtian</hi> in their Church, and therefore
much leſſe that there is or hath been a <hi>lawfull Councel.
XVIII.</hi> But admit all theſe doubts were clearly ſolved,
and a Councel (in their own ſenſe <hi>lawfull</hi>) ſitting and
determining matters in Controverſie; yet how ſhall we know
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119957:20"/>
certainly (with that abſolute certainty <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knot</hi> ſpeaks of)
that theſe are <hi>their</hi> determinations? (ſpecially ſince the
Greek Church above two hundred years ſince accuſed the
Romane for foiſting a Canon into the Nicene Councels in
behalf of the Popes being <hi>Head of the Univerſal Church,</hi>
which could never be found in the authentick copies, though
the African Biſhops ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople, Alexandria,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Antioch</hi> to ſearch for them. Codex. Can. Eccleſ. Afr. Juſtel.
p. 39, 40.) We were not in the <hi>Councel,</hi> nor ever <hi>ſaw</hi> any
of the men that made the Canons, we muſt rely on the honeſty of
the <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> or of thoſe other perſons that <hi>conveigh</hi> them
to us, and thoſe are (certainly) not <hi>infallible:</hi> and we know
there are ſuch things as <hi>Indices expurgatorii,</hi> foyſting
in, and blotting out of <hi>Manuſcripts. XIX.</hi> But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
all this cleared, yet (when I have indeed the <hi>genuine</hi>
Canons, and am ſure of it) how ſhall I be aſſured of the
true meaning of them? for <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> K.</hi> tells us, that we cannot,
without His Churches determination, know what <hi>faith</hi> or
<hi>repentance</hi> (or any word elſe in the <hi>Scripture</hi>) meaneth;
though I ſuppoſe the Apoſtles intended as well as he or I
<hi>to be underſtood;</hi> and though he tell us <hi>That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are as perfect a rule as a writing can be.</hi> I am
<hi>fallible,</hi> and may <hi>miſtake;</hi> and in his opinion ſo may <hi>any</hi>
man but the <hi>Pope,</hi> or a <hi>Councel.</hi> This is no vain ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
for we know that <hi>Vega</hi> and <hi>Soto</hi> (two famous
and learned men in the Councel of Trent) write and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
contradictory opinions, yet each thinketh the <hi>Canon</hi> of
the Councel to determine on his ſide. Now of neceſſity one
of them muſt mistake the doctrine of the Councel (unleſſe
you'l ſay the Councel determined contradictions, and then the
Councel is not infallible it ſelf) and if either of them miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the Councel, then it was not an infallible guide to <hi>him.</hi>
Now if <hi>learned</hi> men, who were <hi>members</hi> of the Councel,
(ſuch as diſputed much in it) could not <hi>infallibly</hi> know the
meaning of it, how can I who am <hi>neither? XX.</hi> Lastly, (not
to trouble M. <hi>Knot</hi> with any more queries then are neceſſary)
what <hi>neceſſity</hi> of an <hi>infallible Judge</hi> at all? The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119957:21"/>
world had no ſuch Judge ſor <hi>CCCXXIV</hi> years (for
the Nicene <hi>Councel</hi> was the firſt <hi>General</hi>) and if They
<hi>vnderſtood</hi> Scripture, and were <hi>ſaved</hi> then, when they had
no ſuch thing, why may not We <hi>now?</hi> And if they were not
ſaved, the Church of Rome muſt blot out many <hi>hundreds</hi>
and <hi>thouſands</hi> of Saints &amp; Martyrs out of her <hi>Martyrology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till theſe twenty queſtions be inſallibly reſolved, it ſeems to
me impoſſible that any man ſhould have any infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Church of Romes</hi> Infallibility. And I am
the more confirmed in the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a plain reſolution to
this laſt querie, becauſe (though <hi>M. Knot</hi> be ſometimes hot
and poſitive, in grounding all Chriſtian Religion upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Church) I find (beſide what I ſaid p. 22.)
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> intimating the contrary, <hi>Joh. v. 39.
Act. iv. 19. xviii. 11. 2. Theſſ. v. 21. 1. Joh. iv. 1.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving a deſigne to juſtifie in this Book,
That it is not permitted to a conſcience
which is ſatisfied in the knowledge of
our Religion, to continue in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Romane; and deſiring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that by example, which I think I have proved by
reaſon; I have not found any more illuſtrious than that
which you have been pleaſed to give in the ſight of
heaven and earth, in quitting the Romane Communion
(which is ſo ſweet, ſo pompous and advantageous in
worldly reſpects) to caſt your ſelf into the lap of the
true Church; as low and deſolate as it appeareth in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
eyes. This brave and gallant action highly befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
your Name and Bloud, hath demonſtrated, more
evidently than any words of mine are able, That the
ſouls of thoſe who believe as we do, cannot enjoy the
peace of God, nor aſſurance of his grace, nor hope of
his glory, in the communion which You have quitted.
For theſe things are all that you find among us worth
ſpeaking of; all other advantages do far more abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; nothing but theſe can you look or hope for
'midſt us, who are deſtitute of all the reſt. But You
have judged, that this rich pearl of the Goſpel is alone
worth far more then all other commodities beſide; &amp; ſo
have rather choſen to hazard the reſt, to aſſure your ſelf
of this, than to endure for aſſuring the reſt to run any
the leaſt danger in the world of miſſing this jewell.
MADAM, It is the Almighty who hath inſpired into
<pb facs="tcp:119957:24"/>
You, ſo holy and ſo wiſe a reſolution, and hath given
You ſtrength to put it in execution at ſo unfavourable a
time: Whereat the <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven rejoyce, whereat
the <hi>Church</hi> on earth praiſeth Him. Amidſt ſo many
evils which ſhe ſuffereth, and more which ſhe foreſeeth,
'tis matter to Her of great comfort, that in an age ſo full
of ill examples, ſhe can find ſome ſouls of your quality
and merit, that have courage to diſdain reproach, and
can rank themſelves under the Croſſe of their Saviour.
Even they who approve not your change, admire your
vertue, and cannot deny, but that 'tis a rare and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
generoſitie, which cauſeth you to preferre the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment</hi>
of your <hi>conſcience,</hi> before all other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But beſides the joy that your converſion hath
brought to thoſe of the Church, and the admiration
that it affects them with who are out of it, I hope that
your example will be to the great <hi>edification</hi> of <hi>all;</hi>

the grace of Heaven, before the intereſts of
earth; and the ſolid hopes of Eternity, before the petty
joyes of theſe few moments which we paſſe here below.
Which favour if I may (as I hope I ſhall) obtain from
your goodneſſe; I ſhall earneſtly pray our Lord, that he
would communicate to You more and more of his dear

            <head>CHAP. I. The Occaſion and importance of this
Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all thoſe actions and perſwaſions of
us (Proteſtants) that are ill taken by our
<hi>Adverſaries,</hi> there is ſcarce any that is
worſe reſented, or for which we are more
bitterly and generally reproached, then
our <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> and
the Churches of her Communion. For they charge us
of having by this means rent aſunder the bowels of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt,</hi> and miſerably torn in pieces that holy Body,
which He formed of His own bloud. An horrible crime
(queſtionleſſe) and ſuch an one as comes but little (if
at all) behind the impiety of thoſe outragious murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
who nailed our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the croſſe, pierced his
ſide, and hands, and feet, with their abominable ſpear
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119957:26"/>
and nails. And whereas other parts of our doctrine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
onely our <hi>enemios,</hi> this hath the ill luck to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
ſome of our <hi>friends:</hi> For ſuch I take them to be
who approve our <hi>belief,</hi> and yet blame us for being out
of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> It therefore doth behove us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
(for the common rectifying and enlightning of
both parties) to examine this accuſation, and to ſhew,
if it be poſſible, the injuſtice and nullitie of it: to the
end, that they who approve our <hi>belief</hi> may joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to <hi>our Communion,</hi> ſeeing the weakneſſe of thoſe
reaſons, which have hitherto kept them on a ſide in
which they acknowledge ſome errours; and that they
who entirely reject our perſwaſion may hereafter conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the grounds whereon we go, without any more
troubling themſelves to throw upon us this invidious
<hi>but vain</hi> reproach. This is the ſubject, which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to treat on in this paper; moſt humbly beſeeching
thoſe who ſhall vouchſafe to reade it, to bring with
them a mind free from paſſion, which turning its eyes
from the Perſons, may regard nothing at preſent but the
worth and weight of the ſubject in hand.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II. The neceſſity of an union of Believers.</head>
            <p>IN the firſt place, we confeſſe that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
both by the will of their <hi>Maſter,</hi> and by their own
<hi>welfare</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> to continue united one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all together to make up but <hi>one</hi> body. And as
this union is their ſoveraigne happineſſe, and the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effect of <hi>charity,</hi> without which they cannot be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
ſo the breach of it, and diviſion is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of their infelicities, and the moſt grievous of their
crimes. And they who either procure it or foment it,
ſhall never be able to avoid that curſe, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
doth often denounce, of <hi>not inheriting the kingdome
of heaven;</hi> into which place none is received without
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119957:26"/>
this <hi>charity,</hi> which <hi>ſuch men</hi> want. For as the being
and perfection of a <hi>naturall body</hi> conſiſts in the union of
its parts; which diſſolving and falling aſunder, the whole
doth preſently loſe not its form and beauty onely, but
likewiſe its force and life: ſo is it in all humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which are called <hi>Bodies</hi> onely by ſimilitude. Their
being and their excellence depends upon the union of
the members whereof they are compoſed. We ſee <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi>
and <hi>States</hi> flouriſh while the Subjects are <hi>united</hi>
and knit together with the lovely bond of concord, but
ſtraight crumble to nothing when diſſenſion ſeparates
them each from other. And among all the evils that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
them there is none ſo pernicious as <hi>diviſion,</hi> which
ſtrikes at the very foundation of their being, and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
the <hi>originall</hi> of their life and ſtrength. So that
to kindle ſedition and ſow faction by breaking the
peace of Subjects, is queſtionleſſe the higheſt crime that
any man can commit againſt a <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, the Church being the heavenly <hi>Kingdome</hi>
and everlaſting <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all the <hi>Societies</hi> that ever have been either ſeen or
ſancied in the Univerſe; We muſt needs conclude, That
by proportion their crime who trouble and diſturb it (ſo
farre eſpecially as to rend away from the Body any of its
parts) is the blackeſt of all crimes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Thus farre we all agree. Nor are any ready to ſpeak
ought further in behalf of <hi>union</hi> or againſt <hi>diviſion,</hi>
which we are not ready to ſigne and conſent unto; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſtill, if poſſible, to outbid any for unity.</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. III. That it is ſometimes lawfull to ſeparate from
a Company of men profeſſing Chriſtianitie.</head>

an extreme miſchief, it followeth not thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:119957:27"/>
That it is not ſometimes permitted us to ſeparate in
ſome ſort, from ſome Societies, who make profeſſion of
ſerving God. Indeed how can it but <hi>be</hi> ſo, in a ſchole
that is full of precepts and examples to that purpoſe? in
a ſchole wherein we are commanded <hi>to reject a man that
is an heretick, after the firſt and ſecond admonition?</hi> Tit.
iii. 10. <hi>to exclude them out of our houſes, and to eſteem them
not fit to be greeted,</hi> who bring us any other doctrine
then that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> 2 John x. to abhorre the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> nay even <hi>Angels,</hi> and to avoid them as curſed
and excommunicated perſons, if they ſhould take the
boldneſſe to preach ought elſe but that <hi>Gospel</hi> which
is already delivered? Gal. i. 8, 9. To depart ſtraight
out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not to be kept in there, leſt we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
at once of her <hi>ſinnes</hi> and <hi>plagues?</hi> Revel. xviii. 4.
In a ſchole, where thoſe of <hi>Epheſus</hi> are commended for
having hated the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Pergamus</hi>
blamed for having tolerated their doctrine? Rev. ii. 6,
15. In a ſchole where, even at the beginning, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Church had continually ſo much care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the communion of hereticks, as Samoſate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
Arians, and others?</p>
            <p>Who ſeeth not, that according to this diſcipline, it is
ſometimes not lawfull onely, but even <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from ſome Societies that make profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie?
and that in this caſe we muſt blame not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and ſimply <hi>all</hi> that make a ſeparation, but <hi>thoſe
onely</hi> who make it either <hi>lightly</hi> and without reaſon, or
<hi>unjuſtly</hi> and without neceſſity. The matter ſeems ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
cleare. For ſince the <hi>conſervation</hi> of ſuch things
as are united is the <hi>end</hi> of union, 'Tis evident that we
are not to entertain any union but onely with them, who
may help forward that deſigne, and ſo farre onely as they
may help it forward.</p>
            <p>If therefore there be any, who under colour of the
bleſſed name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſubvert His <hi>doctrine,</hi> annihilate
His <hi>authority</hi> and our <hi>ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 'tis ſo far from being our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119957:27"/>
duty to <hi>unite</hi> our ſelves to them, that on the contrary we
are obliged to <hi>part</hi> from them; becauſe to unite with
<hi>them</hi> were in effect to diſunite from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and from His
<hi>body,</hi> and in ſtead of coming to ſalvation to fall into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ruine. If in a <hi>State,</hi> a City or Province ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
thoſe that live within it, to perform actions that are
contrary to the Majeſtie and ſervice of the <hi>Soveraigne,</hi>
the loyal inhabitants may thereupon ſeparate themſelves,
and even oppoſe and reſiſt the <hi>rebels</hi> with all their
power, if occaſion be offered. For 'tis a law generally
engraven by <hi>nature</hi> in all parts of the Univerſe (even
in inſenſible creatures) That every thing ſeeks after the
company of that which is like it, and with equal vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
avoids to be near (or have any thing to do with)
that which is contrary to it.</p>
            <p>So then, both the diſcipline of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the
lawes of <hi>Civil ſocieties,</hi> and even thoſe of <hi>nature</hi> her ſelf,
permit us to avoid the communion of ſuch as under any
pretence, name, or colour whatſoever, go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
and ruine Chriſtianity. What, did I ſay that they
<hi>permit</hi> us? nay they <hi>command</hi> it ſo expreſly, that we
cannot refrain from ſuch ſeparations without offending
God, ſcandalizing our neighbours, and deſtroying our
ſelves. And though this be a truth received among <hi>all</hi>
Chriſtians, yet there is no Society or company of them,
wherein it is more ſtrictly and more ſeverely practiſed,
then among thoſe againſt whom we now diſpute. For
who knows not with what rigour <hi>Rome</hi> hath continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected the Communion of thoſe who diſſent from
her? In the infancy of Chriſtianitie ſhe anathematized
the Churches of Aſia for a matter of nothing, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they celebrated <hi>Eaſter</hi> otherwiſe then ſhe: and in
theſe later dayes how hath ſhe perſecuted with fire and
ſword all thoſe that would venture never ſo little to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her power and greatneſſe? How many ages have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
over her head ſince ſhe broke with the <hi>Eaſtern,
Northern,</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Churches, with which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119957:28"/>
ſhe boaſteth much of her having ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of belief and ſervice? So nice is ſhe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
in this point, that we have ſeen not long ago the
chiefeſt of her <hi>Monks,</hi> the moſt exquiſite of her <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Orders,</hi> fly off and ſeparate from the <hi>State of Venice,</hi>
and renounce <hi>there her</hi> Churches and Altars (where all
the Articles of her faith were dayly publiſht, where all
her devotions and ſervices were continually celebrated)
onely upon pretence, That this wiſe <hi>Commonwealth</hi>
would not endure, that <hi>Pope Paul the fift</hi> ſhould bereave
her of the power ſhe had, to make and execute lawes for
the government of her ſubjects. So that if ſeparation
ſimply be a crime, who ſeeth not that <hi>our Adverſaries</hi>
are faulty too, and conſequently are not to be admitted to
<hi>bring in</hi> the accuſation againſt us?</p>

was <hi>juſt, lawfull,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> according to all the laws
of heaven and earth? Now it is very apparent, that
they were forced to make this ſeparation for reaſons
which they in their conſciences judged to be very great
and important. For excepting the motives of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
all other conſiderations evidently obliged them to
the contrary. In ſeparating from the Church of Rome
they pluckt upon themſelves all the <hi>disfavours</hi> of the

uſe of ſenſe and reaſon (as well as their neighbours)
ſhould ever chooſe (with chearfulneſſe, where there is
no neceſſity) to embrace ſuch a ſide? And though, <hi>they</hi>

would be the event of their deſigne (which yet is not a

as not to diſcern the danger? We, who follow
their ſteps, and have ſeen the whole world in a conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for to reduce them with all poſſible <hi>force</hi> and <hi>artifice</hi>
from this ſeparation, and to reunite us to Rome. One
muſt needs think then, that both our Anceſtours and
We were carried on to this motion, ſo apparently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119957:29"/>
to our own good and welfare, by ſome <hi>very ſtrong</hi>

the edification of men, and do really abhorre the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of this diſunion, why are ye not again <hi>reconciled</hi> to
the <hi>Romane</hi> Church? <hi>ſhe</hi> opens her arms wide unto you,

<hi>her,</hi> but for to gain you is willing to yield to ſome
Accommodation, and in favour of you to <hi>mitigate</hi>
ſome of thoſe things that offend you moſt. What, I

that ſhould cauſe you to forſake her communion, to
avoid the <hi>ancient</hi> Churches, and Religion of our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
to renounce the ordinary publick aſſemblies of
Chriſtian people, to ſever from all the reſt of the world,
and to ſuffer all ſorts of extremities? <hi>Our Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores
the ſame JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
to be the Prince and Authour of</hi> your <hi>Religion. She
confeſſeth the unity of His perſon, and the veritie of His
two natures. She believes Him to be God eternal, of the
ſame ſubſtance with the Father and with the Holy Ghoſt,
and likewiſe man made in time, of the fleſh of the bleſſed
Virgin, like to us in all things, ſinne onely excepted, truly
Immanuel, as the ancient Propheſies foretold. She acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
the truth, benefit, and neceſſity of his ſufferings,
and preacheth (even as you) That His bloud expiated the
crimes of mankind; That the freedome and ſalvation of
the world is the fruit of His death. She exalteth His glory,
and believes That He ſits at the right hand of God in
heaven; and, That He ſhall come in the laſt day to judge the
world; and ſhe hopes after the renovation of this world, for
a bleſſed immortality (through his grace) in one to come.
She gives to her children baptiſme, which Chriſt did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and refreſhes them with His Euchariſt, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
to them piety toward Him, and charity toward men.
She reverenceth the Goſpels, and the Epiſtles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
as books divinely inspired.</hi> And if there be any
other Article in the diſcipline of our Lord, ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119957:30"/>
and embraceth it as well as you, and curſeth the
names and memory of thoſe, who have gone about to
overthrow or ſhake them, whether in former or latter
ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The truth is, We neither can nor will denie,
that the Church of Rome doth at this day believe all
theſe holy truths; We thank our gracious <hi>Lord,</hi> that ſhe
hath preſerved them through ſo many ages, midſt ſo
many diſorders. But we would to God, That ſhe had
been as carefull of <hi>not adding</hi> as of <hi>not diminiſhing;</hi>
That ſhe had <hi>foiſted in</hi> nothing of her own, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
us to content our ſelves with that, which ſufficed
the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians to bring them to ſalvation.
For had ſhe kept within thoſe bounds, neither our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
nor We had ever had any cauſe of withdrawing
from her Communion. We had then ſworn to her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and performed her ſervice without any ſcruple,
finding abundantly in this brief but full and admirably
complete rule of wiſdome, enough to repleniſh our
faith, and ſeaſon our manners, underſtandings, and wills
with all perfections neceſſary for attaining to that <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Happineſſe,</hi> which both you and We naturally
deſire. But who knows not, That to the aforeſaid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Articles (clearly expreſſed in the Holy Scriptures,
authentically preach'd and founded by the Apoſtles, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly
believed and confeſſed by Chriſtians of all
places and ages) Rome hath added divers others, which
ſhe preſſeth <hi>equally</hi> with them, forcing all thoſe of her
communion to receive them with the ſame faith as they
do thoſe aforeſaid; thundring out horrible anathemaes
againſt all them that doubt of them, and uſing for the
ruine of ſuch all the power and credit that ſhe hath,
whether in the <hi>Church,</hi> or in the <hi>world?</hi> For beſides
<hi>J. Chriſt</hi> (whom ſhe acknowledgeth with us to be the
Mediatour of mankind, the High-Prieſt and chief So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
of the Church) ſhe would have us hold the
<hi>Saints departed</hi> to be our <hi>Mediatours,</hi> and her <hi>Prieſts</hi> our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119957:30"/>
               <hi>Sacrificers,</hi> and her <hi>Pope</hi> to be the <hi>Head and Husband</hi> of
the Church. Beſides the ſacrifice of the Croſſe, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
upon us that of the <hi>Altar.</hi> Beſides the bloud of
Chriſt, ſhe commands us to expect our cleanſing from
the <hi>ſufferings of Martyrs,</hi> and from the vertue of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>fire</hi> which ſhe hath <hi>kindled</hi> under ground. Beſides
the water of Baptiſme, and the refection of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi>
ſhe preſſeth us to receive unction with <hi>oyles,</hi> and the
myſteries of her <hi>private Confeſſions.</hi> Beſides the Great
God, whom ſhe adores and prayes to as we do, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
us to <hi>adore the holy Sacrament,</hi> to invocate <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
and beatified <hi>Spirits.</hi> Beſides that ſervice of the
Goſpel wherein ſhe agreeth with us, ſhe impoſeth upon
us divers ceremonies, <hi>abſtaining from meats, diſtinction
of times, veneration of images.</hi> Beſides the H. Scriptures
which are divinely inſpired, which ſhe confeſſeth with
us, ſhe would have us receive with the ſame faith and
reſpect all the <hi>traditions</hi> which ſhe approves of. Beſides
the repoſe and reſt in the <hi>Kingdome of heaven,</hi> which ſhe
with us promiſeth to the faithfull, ſhe will have us to
believe another <hi>in Limbo,</hi> a priſon for <hi>children</hi> that die
without baptiſme. And beſides the torments of hell,
which ſhe with us threatens to the wicked, ſhe denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to the faithfull another like it in <hi>purgatoric.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe (and ſeverall others like to theſe) are the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
which ſhe addeth to the true and fundamentall
Articles of the good <hi>Old</hi> Chriſtianity; and which are
the points that divorce us from her Communion. For
every one knows, how carefully ſhe hath eſtabliſhed them
in her <hi>Councels,</hi> how daily ſhe recommendeth them in
her <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>pulpits,</hi> how rigourouſly ſhe exacteth
them in confeſsion; having long ſince pronounced, and
oft ſince (daily ſtill) proclaiming and repeating, <hi>That
ſhe eſteems them Hereticks, Enemies of Chriſt, and worſe
then Infidels, that reject theſe opinions or any of theſe.</hi>
And (which is more offenſive yet) not content to teach
them by the voice of her Doctours, ſhe imprints them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119957:31"/>
in the hearts of her people through continuall obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and uſe; ſo that among them of her communion,
the practiſe of theſe additionall Articles makes more
then a full <hi>half</hi> of what they eſteem <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> For
the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of their ſervice conſiſts in invocation
of Angels and Saints, in adoring the Sacrament, in
worſhipping images, in offering up the Sacrifice of the
Altar, or in partaking of it, in making Confeſsions,
and exerciſing other ceremonies. But as for <hi>us,</hi> all the
world knows that we have quite another opinion of
theſe matters. We content our ſelves with the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſacrifice, and monarchy of <hi>J. Chriſt,</hi> and can joyn
to Him neither Saints, nor Prieſts, nor the Pope in any
of thoſe three qualities, which the Scripture of the New
Teſtament attributes to none but Him alone. We deem
His bloud ſufficient for the purgation of our ſouls, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
never learnt that either S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other <hi>Saint</hi>
was crucified for us; nor, That after this life the <hi>Saints</hi>
ſhall enter into any other place, but onely <hi>one</hi> of repoſe
and reſt. After <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> we deſire
no other <hi>Sacraments;</hi> not having heard in <hi>His Word,</hi> that
he hath obliged us neceſſarily to go to the eare of any
<hi>Prieſt</hi> to receive his abſolution, or to the hand of any
<hi>Biſhop</hi> to have his chriſme. We dare not <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>bread</hi>
which we break, nor the <hi>cup</hi> which we bleſſe; becauſe
all confeſſe, That it is not permitted us to adore any
but <hi>God</hi> onely. We can neither invocate creatures, ſince
we have in the Scripture neither commandment nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for it; nor proſtrate our ſelves before images, ſince
we have expreſſe commands therein againſt it. We
ſcruple at making any thing an Article of our Faith,
which we have not heard in the Word of God; be he
an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> or an <hi>Angel</hi> that evangelizeth. So that ſince
we find nothing in the Scripture of <hi>abſtinence from
meats, diſtinction of times,</hi> and other <hi>Romane ceremonies,</hi>
nor of the <hi>Limbus</hi> of infants, or <hi>purgatory;</hi> we cannot
yet be perſwaded that it is <hi>neceſſarie</hi> for us to believe
them.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. That our Separation ariſeth not from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
matters of fact or private opinion, but
from ſuch things as are believed generally
by all the Romane Church, and ſo that it is
not like to the ſchiſme of the Donatiſts.</head>
            <p>I Might yet alledge many other differences: but this
little may ſuffice, to let you ſee, what are the main
reaſons which oblige us to ſeparate from Rome. Whence
it appears, how <hi>unjuſt</hi> a compariſon it is (that I ſay not
<hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>ſilly</hi>) which ſome make of <hi>our</hi> Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that of the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> For they pretended not to
find any thing in the doctrine of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church
from whence they ſeparated, which was contrary to their
belief. Both the one and the other taught the <hi>ſame</hi> faith,
read the <hi>ſame</hi> books, exerciſed the <hi>ſame</hi> ſervices. The
Donatiſt entring with the Catholicks found nothing
either in their belief or diſcipline, which he had not
ſeen and learn'd in his own. But as for us, 'tis impoſſible
that we ſhould enter into the Communion of the
Church of Rome, without ſwearing to many do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which we formerly never learn'd in the ſchole
of the Scriptures; without receiving Sacraments which
are utterly unknown to us; without bowing our knees
before images which is abſolutely forbidden; without
adoring a thing for God whoſe Deitie we know not;
without acknowledging him to be the Head and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of the Church whom we know to be but a mortall
man; without ſubjecting thoſe conſciences to an <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
which are taught and wont to ſubmit unto none
but a <hi>divine</hi> Authority. And as for that which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts
alledge, <hi>That Felix the Ordainer of Cecilian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Carthage did in former times deliver up the Holy
Scriptures to the Pagans, during the perſecution,</hi> though
it had been true (as indeed it was not; the Catholicks
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119957:32"/>
having clearly juſtified their innocence in this point by
many irrefragable teſtimonies) ſuppoſing, I ſay, it had
been true, that he had committed this fault, who ſeeth
not, that this is not a cauſe in nature like to thoſe for
which we make our ſeparation? For this was a matter
of fact and not a doctrine, a fact of <hi>one</hi> man, that is of
<hi>Felix</hi> alone, and not of the whole body of the <hi>African
Church;</hi> So that it ſhould have given the Donatiſts no
occaſion or cauſe of ſeparating from <hi>Cecilian,</hi> much leſſe
any juſt cauſe of breaking communion with all Africk.
For ſuppoſe that <hi>Felix the Ordainer of Cecilian</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this fault, yet 'tis cleare, That he did not teach or
think that it was lawfull for him to deliver the H. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
up to Infidels; but on the contrary, by <hi>denying</hi>
that he committed it, and ſtanding upon his <hi>defence</hi> as
he did, he confeſſed plainly by conſequence, that it was a
fault. The Donatiſts then might have continued in
that communion without any way ſtaining either their
Creed or their manners, without being forced either to
do or believe any thing againſt their conſciences. But
for all that, ſuppoſing (which yet is manifeſtly falſe)
that <hi>Cecilian</hi> had defended, and preach'd publickly in his
pulpit, <hi>That it was permitted Chriſtians in times of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
to deliver up the books of HOLY WRIT to the
enemies of the Church;</hi> and ſuppoſing again (which 'tis
not fit now to examine) that this errour were pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and inconſiſtent with a <hi>true faith,</hi> I cannot diſcern
how the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had any juſt cauſe of avoiding the
communion of the ſucceſſours of <hi>Cecilian</hi> or other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of Africk, who unanimouſly held, taught, and
preached that to commit ſuch a fault was a <hi>weakneſſe</hi>
unbefitting the ſoul of a Chriſtian, and made all ſuch
ſubmit to the rigours of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline whom
they found guilty of it. This crime (or what ever you
will imagine it) was onely <hi>Felix</hi>'s, or perhaps <hi>Cecilians;</hi>
but not any mans elſe: The <hi>whole Church</hi> had no ſhare
in it: ſo that it was an intolerable piece of injuſtice, a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119957:32"/>
ſtrange pride, and mad fantaſticalnes, to abhorre <hi>a whole</hi>
Church for the errours of offences of <hi>one</hi> particular man.
I would to God the caſe between the Romane Church
and us had been the like! That we had ſeen nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
but onely the faults of her <hi>Pastours,</hi> and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of her <hi>manners!</hi> or That ſuch of her doctrines
which we cannot receive, had been the thoughts of
ſome <hi>particular</hi> men onely! Had there been nothing elſe
we ſhould have lived ſtill together. Our Fathers would
never have ſeparated from Her Communion; or if ſome
ſtrange paſſion, which we dream not of, had precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
them into a rupture and ſchiſme like that of the
Donatiſts; We do in our Conſciences proteſt, that we
would have been afraid to follow their errour, and that
we would have loſt no time of uniting our ſelves with
them, from whom we had been ſo <hi>imprudently</hi> ſeparated.
For we cannot but confeſſe, That 'tis a piece of very
high injuſtice to impute the faults of <hi>men</hi> to their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
and to accuſe their <hi>Religion</hi> of thoſe extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which <hi>they</hi> commit, eſpecially if <hi>againſt it.</hi> In ſuch
a caſe we ſhould queſtionleſſe practiſe the doctrine of
our Saviour, ſpeaking of them who ſit in Moſes chair;
Matt. xxiii. 3. <hi>All thoſe things which they bid you obſerve,
thoſe obſerve and do; but do not after their works.</hi> The
<hi>Church</hi> wherein they live is not guilty of their errour,
eſpecially when it highly (and oft out of the mouthes
of thoſe very men) <hi>condemneth</hi> the faults and diſorders
of their lives. The Church may ſay to ſuch fugitives,
<hi>The faults of my children are no fit reaſon to induce you to
abhorre Me. Live in my communion you may, and not be
obliged to communicate with their wicked deeds. Thoſe
very men who are thus wicked ſhould drive you from the
vice, in ſtead of bringing you to it: for, if you mark it,
They carry preſervatives in their mouthes againſt the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of their manners.</hi> But, alas! 'Twas not this that
drove us from the Church of Rome. 'Twas not the fall
of <hi>one</hi> Felix, nor the weakneſſe of ſome <hi>Cecilians,</hi> 'twas
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119957:33"/>
not the covetouſneſſe of her <hi>Prelates,</hi> the licenciouſneſſe
of her <hi>Monks,</hi> the filthineſſe of her <hi>Court,</hi> the exceſſe and
abuſe of her Sovereigne <hi>Pontifes.</hi> For though ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
theſe diſorders with too much indulgence, yet ſhe
neither doth command them, nor openly approve of
them. Though ſhe very gently <hi>tolerate</hi> ſuch as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
or vicious, yet ſhe did not <hi>force</hi> any to be ſo.
No man was for entring into her communion <hi>conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
to be a ſlave to any of thoſe vices which bore ſway in
the midſt of her. No, a man <hi>might</hi> have lived within it,
and yet addicted himſelf to <hi>honeſty and goodneſſe:</hi> And
as yet corruption had not gained ſo farre, as that ill
manners were authorized by <hi>publick</hi> laws. But on the
contrary during the worſt of times, though her voice
was weak and languiſhing, yet ſhe made <hi>ſome</hi> noiſe
againſt the impietie of the age. And oftentimes thoſe
very men that gave ill example in their <hi>lives</hi> preached
againſt it and decryed it horribly in the <hi>pulpit.</hi> That
which hath pulled us from her communion is her <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
and not her <hi>actions;</hi> that which ſhe <hi>commands,</hi>
and not that which ſhe <hi>ſuffers;</hi> that which ſhe requires
of <hi>us all,</hi> and not that which ſhe tolerates in <hi>ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
the articles of her <hi>faith,</hi> and not the faults of her
<hi>life.</hi> For the adoration of the Euchariſt, invocation of
Saints, veneration of images, and thoſe other articles
which we rehearſed before, are not ſuch things as ſhe
<hi>onely</hi> tolerates as bad, or excuſeth as doubtfull; but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs</hi>
which ſhe <hi>commendeth</hi> as true, and obſervations
which ſhe <hi>commandeth</hi> as uſefull and <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nor doth ſhe onely practiſe them in the houſe and
privately, but likewiſe preach them in the Temple, as
perpetuall parts of her <hi>Faith.</hi> So that if we continue in
her communion, we muſt needs make profeſſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
them, that is, make our ſelves guilty of an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
hypocriſie, <hi>confeſſing</hi> with our mouth what we do
not <hi>believe</hi> with our heart. Now if theſe were onely the
opinions of ſome one of her Doctours, if it were onely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119957:33"/>
ſome <hi>one</hi> Divine that were to be blamed, and the reſt
of their. Church diſavowed theſe things; we ſhould not
for ſuch a matter make any ſcruple of communicating
with Her; acknowledging ingenuouſly, That 'tis an
unreaſonable thing to impute the opinions (and ſo the
faults) of a few <hi>particular</hi> men to a <hi>whole entire body.</hi>
Since we ſee it often happens, that they who live in the
Communion of a Church, are neither in whole nor in
part of the ſame belief with that Church. Thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> The ſect of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> had
their doctrines apart, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had likewiſe
theirs. And for a mans being a <hi>Jew,</hi> he was not at all
obliged to embrace or hold preciſely the opinions either
of the one, or of the other ſect. And at this very day in
the Church of Rome (whence we departed) the order
of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> hath ſome opinions proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> have others, and ſo likewiſe
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> others, <hi>peculiar</hi> to their reſpective Orders.
If therefore there were in the midſt of Her, onely ſome
one ſocietie of men that held affirmatively thoſe things
which we cannot believe, and others lived at liberty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to receive or reject them, In this caſe I confeſſe, that
it were very difficult to excuſe our <hi>Separation,</hi> ſince the
Communion with that body whence we have departed
doth not oblige us preciſely to any points contrary to
our conſciences, But who knows not that thoſe Articles
which we cannot receive, are <hi>publick</hi> not <hi>private</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
common to the <hi>whole</hi> Church of Rome, and not
<hi>peculiar</hi> to the Pope and his party? eſtabliſhed authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly
in her <hi>Generall</hi> Councels, by the ſuffrages of the
Deputies of <hi>all</hi> the Churches in the world <hi>that live in
her Communion?</hi> Articles, to the belief and obſervation,
whereof, ſhe obligeth <hi>all</hi> ſorts of perſons whatſoever,
Clergy and Laity, Monks and Seculars, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
little and great? anathematizing <hi>all</hi> as Hereticks,
who teach or believe otherwiſe; and beſides the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts
of the Church (excommunications) making
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119957:34"/>
uſe of fire and ſword and what elſe they can againſt
them, where ever ſhe hath power.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that our cauſe is no whit like that of
the Donatiſts, our Separation ariſing from publick and
univerſall Doctrines of the Church of Rome, whereas
<hi>Theirs</hi> had no foundation or reaſon, but onely <hi>a pretended</hi>
act of <hi>one</hi> particular man, neither confeſſed nor proved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>African</hi> Church (whoſe communion they fled
from) preſented them nothing in her <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
which was contrary to their faith; whereas <hi>Rome</hi>

and this difference dependeth upon the nature of errours
themſelves. For as the truths which we are to believe
are not all of equall importance, ſome being eſteemed
fundamentall and ſo <hi>abſolutely requiſite,</hi> that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to the kingdome of heaven if he be ignorant
of them; others being <hi>profitable,</hi> yet not ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> but
that a man may without the knowledge of them <hi>ſerve
God</hi> and <hi>enjoy ſalvation:</hi> ſo it is with errours, Some are
pernicious and no way conſiſtent with a true piety;
others are leſſe hurtfull and do not neceſſarily draw in
men to perdition. S. Paul doth clearly enough diſcover
to us this diſtinction, 1 Cor. iii. 13, 15. <hi>where,</hi> after he
had ſaid, <hi>That none could lay any other foundation but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119957:35"/>
that which he had laid,</hi> to wit, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he addeth,
That <hi>they who builded upon this foundation wood, hay,
ſtubble, ſhould have loſſe in their work, when it comes to
be tried; nevertheleſſe they ſhould be ſaved, yet ſo as by
fire;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>with difficulty,</hi> their perſon onely, or
that wherein their chief good conſiſted, eſcaping a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
An evident ſigne that there be errours, which do
not deprive the Authours thereof of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> much
leſſe exclude ſuch from happineſſe as believe them <hi>after</hi>
Them, and take them up (when they are dead or gone)
meerly upon their truſt and credit. And to conclude, who
doth not ſee plainly, That there be errours which utterly
overthrow the foundations of Chriſtianity, ingaging us
unavoidably in ſuch things as are inconſiſtent with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
and that there be others which do not ſo?</p>
            <p>As for example, if one ſhould think <hi>that he were bound
to worſhip the Sunne.</hi> (For ſeeing the Sunne is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and thoſe who worſhip creatures have no portion
in the kingdome of heaven) 'Tis evident that he who
hath ſuch an opinion cannot attain eternal happineſſe.
And 'tis ſo with all other errours which overthrow any
of the firſt, neceſſary, and fundamentall articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
religion. But the errour of thoſe, who believed of
old, That the Church ſhall continue a thouſand yeares
(or ſome long time) with J. Chriſt upon earth after
the reſurrection, is no way repugnant to <hi>piety</hi> towards
God, or <hi>charity</hi> towards our Neighbour, nor doth it <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi>
overthrow any of the foundations of the <hi>Gospel;</hi>
Though it be in my opinion contrary to divers paſſages
of S. Paul and ſcarce conſonant to the nature of <hi>Chriſts
Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man would ſcarce believe how neceſſary it is, to
mark this difference among the errours of men in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of religion, for preventing that vain ſcrupuloſitie
and importunate penſiveneſſe, which many melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpirits are troubled with, who condemne all errours
alike, and thunder out one and the ſame anathema a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119957:35"/>
what ever differs (though never ſo little) from
their apprehenſions: yet for keeping them from falling
on the other ſide, into the indifferencie of profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who conform to any thing, and ſwallow a <hi>camel</hi>
as well as a <hi>gnat.</hi> Indeed the true <hi>pious</hi> perſon will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to keep himſelf from all errour; and will purge
his neighbour too, as well as himſelf, ſo farre as he is
able. For any deviation from truth though it may be a
light and ſmall errour, yet 'tis an errour (that is to ſay
an ignorance, and contradiction to the truth) and by
conſequence an evil. But a man muſt be very diligent
and circumſpect in obſerving this diſtinction among er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and acknowledge that one is much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
then another, and he ſhould more or leſſe abhorre
them all, according as he ſhall judge them to be more or
leſſe dangerous. If they be of the firſt rank, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe
which overthrow the <hi>foundations</hi> of Chriſtianitie, he
will beſtirre himſelf with all poſſible prudence and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie,
according to his vocation and gifts, to free his
neighbour from them; and if he cannot gain upon him,
he will yet be ſure to ſave and deliver his own ſoul from
the communion of ſuch as hold them. This was the
practiſe of the Faithfull in reference to <hi>Paulus Samoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Arius</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
who held that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was a meer creature,
throwing down Chriſtianitie from top to bottome by
this abominable doctrine. But if the errour be of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſort, not pernicious nor inconſiſtent with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of our faith, we ſhould do well (if we could
handſomely) to free our brethren from it: (for it
were to be wiſht that we might be entirely exempt from
errour) but if we cannot get out, we muſt not therefore
ſtraight ſever from them, but gently and quietly beare
with what we cannot alter; yet ſo, that we prejudice
not any mans ſalvation, much leſſe our own. For, as in
civil ſocietie, we keep not company with ſuch perſons as
we diſcover to be guilty of infidelitie or enormous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119957:36"/>
vices, becauſe friendſhip or familiarity with ſuch people
ſlurrieth the honour and reputation of thoſe, that make
any ſhew or profeſſion of vertue; but we do with a deal
of ſweetneſſe and ingenuitie, beare with the faults and
frailties of ſuch as are not miſcreants at the bottome,
though notwithſtanding their converſation be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>free</hi> from humane frailties: So are we to do in
Religion, to avoid communicating with thoſe, whoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
overthrows the foundations of piety; but chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to teach thoſe, who retaining the principles cannot
free themſelves entirely from all perſwaſions contrary to
truth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ancients</hi> muſt pardon me, if I venture to take
notice that they were ſometimes too <hi>ſcrupulous,</hi> and (if
I may ſo ſpeak) too curious and ſtrait-laced in this
particular; rejecting oftentimes innocent opinions with
very <hi>tragical</hi> termes, and handling ſuch perſons as gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed
them, with as much rigour as if they had <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown</hi>
the whole <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt. 'Tis a wonder to
ſee, how ſome of them did in a manner ſport, with
changing errours into hereſies, and all faults into crimes.
<hi>Philaſtrius,</hi> Biſhop of Brixium (who lived in the time
of S. Ambroſe) was among others very hot; for he <hi>lib.
de Haereſ. cap. 4. Bibl. P P. parte 1. p. 22. cap.</hi> 39. rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among hereſies the opinion of thoſe, who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
the Epiſtle to the Hebrews to Clement, or to
Barnabas, and to S. Paul; and of thoſe who thought
the <hi>CL. Pſalmes</hi> in the Pſalter were not all compoſed
by <hi>David;</hi> and of thoſe who thought <hi>the ſtarres</hi> were
faſtned to the <hi>orbs</hi> of heaven. But none were ever ſo
ready to excommunicate, as thoſe very men; who keep
ſuch a complaining of our quitting their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
upon too ſlight cauſes. To ſay nothing here of
the lightnings and excommunications of <hi>Victor</hi> againſt
<hi>Aſia,</hi> of <hi>Stephen</hi> againſt <hi>Africk,</hi> and divers other <hi>Popes,</hi>
as well <hi>one</hi> againſt <hi>another,</hi> as againſt <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
moſt an end of very <hi>ſmall</hi> concernment: Let any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119957:36"/>
man reade onely the laſt <hi>Councel</hi> held at <hi>Trent;</hi> he ſhall
ſoon ſee how liberall they were of <hi>Anathema's.</hi> They
were not there content, as thunder doth from <hi>Heaven,</hi>
to ſtrike the cedars and the tops of the mountains:
ſcarce was there any herb in their adverſaries fields
(though never ſo low and ſmall) that ſcaped their
thunderbolts. They who doubted, whether <hi>marriage was
a Sacrament,</hi> or whether <hi>the Church can diſpenſe with the
degrees eſtabliſhed in Leviticus,</hi> or whether <hi>a Biſhop be
above a Presbyter,</hi> or whether <hi>the reaſons that moved Rome
to deprive the Laity of the cup were of ſufficient validity
to that purpoſe,</hi> (things as every one may ſee of none, or
at leaſt very little importance to pietie) were <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,</hi>
anathematized, as well as they that denyed <hi>the
divinitie of our Saviour, or the truth of the laſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
And for my part I underſtand not how it agrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with the <hi>mildneſſe</hi> and gentle behaviour, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt doth ſtrictly recommend unto us, to
have ſuch an inhumane ſeveritie as to be able to beare
with nothing, to ſpare no opinion; but to make ſo high
a market of the pretended <hi>thunderbolts,</hi> as to let them fly
indifferently, againſt the <hi>leſſe</hi> errours as well as againſt
the <hi>greateſt</hi> crimes. Well, this I am ſure of, If we would
imitate Their examples, and juſtifie our proceedings by
the maximes of theirs, we might end this queſtion in
three words. For if he that thinks marriage is not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is an anathema to him that holds it is, I pray,
What ſhould they who believe that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not
<hi>bread</hi> but the <hi>Creatour</hi> of heaven and earth, be deemed
by thoſe that hold the contrary? And if to think that a
<hi>Presbyter</hi> was originally the ſame with a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> give the
Church of Rome ſufficient cauſe to curſe my commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
how much more doth her elevating (as ſhe doth)
the <hi>Pope</hi> above the <hi>Church,</hi> and above <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> in
Chriſtendome, give me juſt cauſe to run away from her?</p>
            <p>But 'tis now time we ſhould (by Gods aſſiſtance)
clear our own innocence, of thoſe crimes which our ſide
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119957:37"/>
is accuſed of. We confeſſe, That Chriſtian charitie is
not ſo active and hot as their zeal: Charitie often bears
with what it doth not approve of, and rejects nothing,
but what it cannot ſuffer, without hazarding the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our neighbours and our own ſouls. 'Tis ſo farre
from excommunicating (as the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> doth)
Chriſtians for ſmall errours, that I think it would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beare with in faithfull perſons that opinion of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> (for which they are ſo roughly anathematized)
touching the <hi>proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For though I
grant it is an errour to believe, that the H. <hi>Ghoſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not from the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Sonne,</hi> but from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
onely <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> yet if you obſerve 'tis hard (if
not <hi>impoſſible</hi>) to underſtand what prejudice this errour
brings to <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>holy life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difference that is between us and ſuch of our
<hi>brethren</hi> as are called <hi>Lutherans</hi> is of the ſame nature.
I confeſſe, 'tis as impoſſible for us to believe, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Poſition, concerning the body of our
Saviour being <hi>really preſent in the bread</hi> of the Euchariſt.
But yet 'tis poſſible (and I think according to the laws
of charity, neceſſary) to bear with that in their doctrine
which we cannot believe. For this opinion, in the
terms and ſenſe wherein They hold it, hath no <hi>venome</hi>
in it that I ſee. It aboliſheth not the Sacrament, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
not the ſigne whereof it conſiſteth, it adoreth
it not, it neither divides nor mutilates it, it makes it
not an expiatory ſacrifice for our ſinnes, it leaves it both
the nature and the vertue of a Sacrament, and doth not
take any thing, (formally, directly, and immediately)
from Chriſt, either of his ſubſtance or his properties:
onely it would have even <hi>the humanity of Chriſt</hi> preſent
in the Euchariſt (that we may receive the vertue of his
death, and <hi>communicate of his body and bloud,</hi> (as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) 1 Cor. x. in ſuch a manner as they confeſſe
incomprehenſible. Which hypotheſis (whiles it goes
no further) engageth us not in any thing that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119957:37"/>
either to piety or charity, either to the honour of
God or the good of men: And ſo it may and ought to
be tolerated. And this hath been continually our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo declared by <hi>the French churches</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
<hi>Synod</hi> held at <hi>Charenton</hi> in the yeare MDCXXXI.
by an expreſſe act, wherein they receive ſuch as are called
<hi>Lutherans</hi> into their Communion, unto their <hi>Holy
Table,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>this</hi> opinion, and ſome <hi>few others</hi>
of leſſe importance, wherein They and We differ.</p>
            <p>Oh what a gentleneſſe was this, excellently becoming
Chriſtians! worthy to be imitated by all believers in the
world, and conſecrated with commendation to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of all ſucceeding ages! a plain, illuſtrious, irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
teſtimony, of the innocence, of our Churches in
this particular! For had we been animated with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of preſumption, untractableneſſe and deſpight (as
ſome fondly imagine) how could we thus gently bear
with thoſe which are at difference with us? and in whoſe
communion there are ſome who either blinded with
paſſion, or deceived with calumny, have a very <hi>ill opinion</hi>
of us, and do outragiouſly <hi>defame</hi> us.</p>
            <p>This example, one would think, might ſhow any man
clearly, That it is not want of <hi>charity,</hi> but ſome other
<hi>very urgent</hi> cauſe, which moved us to ſeparate from the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For had the differences between us
and <hi>them</hi> been like thoſe between us and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
what likelyhood is there, but that we ſhould have been as
ready to joyn hands with them as with theſe? why
ſhould we be willing to offend our Countreymen, and
bear with ſtrangers? ſeparate from thoſe that have in
their hands, our honours, our goods, our lives; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
keep in with ſuch as we have nothing to do
with, but onely as they are <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> what likelyhood
is there that we ſhould not in this point have that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence
for our Princes and naturall Magiſtrates, which
we have for ſuch as in reference to civil Societie concern
us not? Certainly men muſt needs ſay, we are either very
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119957:38"/>
furious and ſenſeleſſe creatures (which cenſure I think
many <hi>wiſe</hi> people will not caſt upon us) or that 'tis ſome
great and weighty reaſon that made us ſeparate from the
Church of Rome. And this is indeed the <hi>chief point</hi>
of the queſtion. For if the doctrines whereupon we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
were of the ſame nature with thoſe, that we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with the <hi>Lutherans</hi> about; if they were tolerable, and
ſuch as we could bear with, without violating our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
I confeſſe that our ſeparation was, if not <hi>raſh,</hi>
(as being not grounded upon a <hi>ſufficient</hi> cauſe) yet <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt</hi>
at the leaſt: no ſeparation in any matter being juſt
if it be not neceſſary. But we may truly affirm, (and
confidently call heaven and earth to witneſſe) that 'tis
not poſſible to accommodate our ſelves to thoſe things
which the Romaniſts require of us, without forcing our
thoughts, violating the peace of our conſciences, and
overthrowing the foundations of Chriſtianity, which
we firmly believe. For we are at conteſtation, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matters that are ſmall and of little importance,
but concerning <hi>the head of the Church,</hi> concerning <hi>the
foundation of faith,</hi> concerning <hi>the cauſes of ſalvation,
the ſervice of God, the object to which that ſervice ſhould
be given, the ſtate both of our conſciences in this world,
and of our ſouls in the world to come.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="8" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. VIII. That the adoration of the Euchariſt, as it is
practiſed by the Church of Rome, doth (as we
believe) overthrow the foundation of pietie
and ſalvation.</head>
            <p>MY intention is not to examine all the particulars
of the differences between us, one by one; to
know the weight and importance of each in particular.
That would cauſe me to be more large then I intend to
be on this ſubject, and would be more tedious to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119957:38"/>
Reader then neceſſary for the end I propoſed. We may
with leſſe adoe juſtifie our ſelves. For if among all thoſe
points wherein we differ there be but <hi>one,</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the foundations of Chriſtianitie; That is enough
to prove the neceſſity of our ſeparation, whether the reſt
be light or weighty: No man being bound to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
thoſe who are in any communion ſo farre, as to
joyn with them to the prejudice of his own ſalvation.
Leaving therefore at preſent all other Articles, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
whereof Rome would oblige us, I ſhall onely conſider
this one, viz. <hi>the adoration of the Hoſt</hi> (as they call it)
which is in my opinion a very important one; and I
hope, I ſhall ſhew briefly and clearly, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to receive it, without overthrowing the foundation
of our <hi>piety</hi> here, and eternall <hi>happineſſe</hi> hereafter. 'Tis a
Doctrine held by all Believers from the beginning of the
world to this preſent, that the Soveraigne and higheſt
kind of honour and ſervice, which is ordinarily called
<hi>adoration,</hi> is due to none but <hi>God</hi> alone, who created the
heaven and the earth, and redeemed us through <hi>J. Chriſt.</hi>
This is the foundation of all the doctrine and diſcipline
of Gods people of old; the firſt and principall Article
of the divine Law, which God pronounced from heaven
with the voice of thunder, and which he wrote for them
with his own finger, upon the tables of ſtone given to
Moſes. <hi>Thou ſhalt not have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>any other God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my face.</hi> I can not well here (if I would) ſet down
all the places wherein His holy Prophets repeat this
commandment and comment on it. 'Tis likewiſe the
great and chief foundation of the Goſpel. <hi>This is life
eternall,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>to know thee the onely true God,
and him whom thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Joh. xvii. 3.
For this knowledge of God and of Chriſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
likewiſe the <hi>ſervice</hi> which is due to them. The
ſame God who taught us this truth, declareth in an
infinite company of places, That He can hold them for
no other then Enemies and Rebels, that break this His
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119957:39"/>
commandment, then for ſuch who have broke His co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and renounced His communion; proteſting,
That He will puniſh them very ſeverely both in this
world, and in the next; that He is <hi>jealous</hi> of His <hi>glory,</hi>
and will not by any means ſuffer it to be given to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi>
And to make us the better to conceive the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
of this crime, He repreſents it to us under the
image of the moſt baſe and abominable tranſgreſſions
that are committed in the life of man: comparing it to
<hi>whoredome, adultery,</hi> and all the moſt foul and infamous
ſymptomes and denominations of weakneſſe: ſo that He
uſeth ſometimes, upon this ſubject, terms and expreſſions
that a man can ſcarce reade or pronounce without <hi>bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
deſiring certainly thereby to ſhew how hatefull this
fault is, and unbefitting any Believer. The truth is,
Since our Great God hath done us the favour, to call us
by His infinite goodneſſe to His Communion, and to
enter with us into ſo cloſe a Covenant, that to expreſſe
it to us, he tells us that He is our <hi>Husband,</hi> and that we
are His <hi>Spouſe;</hi> it is ſufficiently evident, that they who
render to any other the honour and ſervice which is due
to God, commit the ſame fault, which a woman that is
married doth, when ſhe abandons that to another,
which is due to none but her own husband. So that as
<hi>adultery</hi> is the greateſt fault that can be committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the bond of wedlock; ſo may we be aſſured, that
no man can more grievouſly infringe his covenant with
God, then by devolving that ſervice which belongs to
him, upon any creature whatſoever. And as adultery
doth diſſolve marriage; ſo the crime of thoſe who ſerve
creatures diſſolves the Covenant with God. Which
may the better be underſtood by another compariſon.
God is our <hi>King</hi> and Soveraigne, and we are His <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
Juſt therefore as a ſubject cannot more hainouſly
offend his <hi>King,</hi> nor more openly renounce his ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and that allegiance which he oweth him, then
by giving to ſome other beſides him the name, glory,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119957:39"/>
honour, and ſervice of his Soveraigne; ſo tis not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that we ſhould offend <hi>God</hi> more mortally, then in
attributing to any other but His Majeſty the name of
<hi>our God and Lord,</hi> which appertains to Him alone, and
ſo the honour and ſervice agreeable to theſe names.
This was the main crime of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who thus
broke Gods Covenant, and pulled upon themſelves
moſt dreadfull wrath and curſes in this world, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death in the next. S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us Rom. i. 25.
That this <hi>rendering to the creature a ſervice due to the
Creatour,</hi> was the ſource and fountain whence all the
miſchiefs iſſued forth upon them. And 1 Cor. vi. 10.
he ſaith plainly, That <hi>idolaters</hi> (that is to ſay, Such as
render to any creature the ſervice due to God) <hi>ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inherit the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> And conformably
to this, S. <hi>John</hi> Rev. xxi. 8. proteſteth, That <hi>their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall be in the lake burning with fire and brimſtone,
which is the ſecond death.</hi> For of all the truths that are
taught in the Old and New Teſtaments, there is not
any <hi>one,</hi> which is ſo clearly and ſo often expreſſed as this
very thing; not any <hi>one,</hi> which hath been leſſe conteſted
by hereticks, or more univerſally and affirmatively for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the Church; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath ever conſtantly broke
off from thoſe that under any pretence whatſoever will
render to the <hi>creature</hi> the ſervice due to <hi>God.</hi> Even
<hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf (of whom we complain) diſagrees
with us but very little, if at all, in this point. For
though ſhe render great honours to divers creatures, yet
ſhe ever acknowledged, That there is a kind of religious
ſervice which cannot without ſacriledge be given to any
thing but God alone: this ſhe commonly termeth the
adoration of <hi>latria,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from other honours
and ſervices, which ſhe beleeves may without ſin be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to that which is not God. If therefore there be any
Article in all the Chriſtian faith, which ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>fundamentall,</hi> it is this. If there be any, which we
ſhould preſerve inviolably with the price of all that is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119957:40"/>
deare unto us, it is this. Nevertheleſſe, this very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oblige us to violate, if
we will communicate in her ſervices. For ſhe doth moſt
expreſſely command all ſuch as be of her communion,
to render that ſoveraigne and higheſt kind of ſervice,
which ſhe calleth <hi>latria,</hi> (and confeſſeth to be due to
none but God) unto a thing which we believe to be a
<hi>creature,</hi> and not <hi>God</hi> himſelf. She would have us to
take for our great <hi>God,</hi> for the <hi>Creatour</hi> of Heaven and
earth, for the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of mankind, this <hi>ſacrament,</hi>
which is indeed holy and precious; but which yet our
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> our <hi>reaſon,</hi> and our <hi>faith</hi> grounded on the H. <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
findeth to be but bread. She would have us give
to this ſubject all the praiſe of the creation and redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the univerſe; to inveſt it with all the glory that
is due to our Soveraigne and higheſt <hi>Lord;</hi> and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>proſtrate</hi> our ſelves moſt humbly (our bodies and
ſouls) before thoſe altars, whereon this is laid; and in
thoſe ſtreets where we meet it; that we ſhould celebrate
the day which ſhe hath conſecrated to the honour of
the Euchariſt, under the name of <hi>the feaſt of our great
God;</hi> and ſhould pronounce <hi>anathema maran-atha</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all them who approve not this doctrine, and this
practiſe. Here I ſhall venture to addreſſe my ſelf to any
the moſt <hi>paſſionate</hi> among our Adverſaries, and take
them for my Judges in this cauſe, for my Counſellours
in this difficultie.</p>
            <p>You, Sirs, command me to adore the Sacrament of
the Euchariſt, with the adoration of <hi>latria.</hi> Now I
cannot, I muſt not conceal from you, That I believe
this <hi>Sacrament</hi> in its ſubſtance to be an <hi>inanimate</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
having not yet been able to reſiſt the Authority
of my <hi>ſenſe,</hi> of my <hi>reaſon,</hi> and of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi>
which tell me that it is nothing but bread. My belief
being thus, what ſhould I doe? Shall I <hi>adore</hi> that which
I know to be but a <hi>creature?</hi> Why, you cannot but ſee
how God forbids the adoration of a creature, under peril
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119957:40"/>
of <hi>eternall damation. Your</hi> Authoritie pulls me on one
ſide, and <hi>Gods</hi> on the other. In my judgement, He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the very <hi>ſame</hi> thing that you deſire. Whither ſhall I
turn me in this condition.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but hereupon they'l ſoon drive me from
their Altars, and forbid me to make uſe of <hi>that,</hi> the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie</hi>
whereof I neither <hi>can</hi> nor will acknowledge. For
they oblige not men to adore their Hoſt, but becauſe of
a belief they have, that it is truly <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> God
bleſſed for ever. Did they not believe it ſo to be, they
would not adore it, they would not bring it to others
to be adored. So that ſince I have not that belief, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
they ſhould not judge it fitting for me to adore
it: and if I ſhould adore it, they would impute this
action to nothing but an extreme <hi>puſillanimitie,</hi> and
baſeneſſe of ſpirit, which for fear of men can cauſe me
to doe a thing, that I my ſelf eſteem unlawfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to God.</p>
            <p>And let them not here alledge, That I am deceived
in the opinion that I have of the ſubſtance of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.
For the queſtion is not, whether the <hi>Euchariſt</hi>
be <hi>bread</hi> or not, (this ſhould be diſputed apart) but
whether he who believes that it is bread in ſubſtance,
can <hi>adore</hi> it, without making himſelf guilty of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
and giving a creature that honour which is due
to the Creatour. For if one ſhould grant, That he <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
(which we now are coming to demonſtrate from
the premiſes very evidently) I have gained the point
that I intended to prove: it being cleare, that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<hi>We</hi> have had reaſon to ſeparate from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we believe that the Euchariſt is bread in ſubſtance;
it being impoſſible for us to yield to that worſhip, which
ſhe deſires we ſhould give it, unleſſe we give to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that, which we are bound to give onely to the
Creatour. Whence all the odious queſtion concerning
<hi>ſchiſme</hi> is ended.</p>
            <p>For we call that <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> which is <hi>a ſeparation made
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119957:41"/>
without neceſſity.</hi> So that when my conſcience forbids
me under pain of Gods wrath, and my own damnation,
to obey that which you command me in this particular,
'tis evident, that it is not fancie, pleaſure, or faction, but
a pure neceſſity that conſtraineth me to ſeparate from
you. If you cannot tax this my opinion, much leſſe
can you condemne my ſeparation. Accuſe me if you
pleaſe of ſtupidity, For not being able to conceive, how
a <hi>body</hi> that is in <hi>heaven</hi> can be at the ſame time in a
<hi>thouſand places on earth;</hi> how all the quantity of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
man can be brought within one ſingle point; how
a thing, that my ſenſe and reaſon knoweth to be <hi>bread,</hi>
and the H. Scripture calleth oftentimes <hi>bread,</hi> can <hi>not</hi>
be <hi>bread</hi> at all for all this; but the very <hi>Creatour of the
world.</hi> Blame as much as you pleaſe the <hi>dulneſſe</hi> of my
ſpirit, that cannot comprehend a whit of theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
myſteries. But once preſuppoſe my belief to be true,
and then you cannot ſhew me wherein I do amiſſe in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
from you. At this time 'tis ſufficient, that I
have ſhown, that our ſeparation is not contrary to chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which obligeth no man to embrace that, in favour
or love of his neighbour, which he believes diſagreeable
to Gods will, and pernicious to his own ſoul.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. That the opinion of the Lutherans which we
bear withall, doth not bring with it the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Euchariſt, either de jure, or
de facto.</head>
            <p>BUt becauſe this buſineſſe ſeems to me of very great
importance, I am well content for the clearing of
it to examine, yet more particularly, all that can be ſaid
in favour of this adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to render
it unto us more tolerable then as yet it doth appeare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Firſt then, ſome men may object, That we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119957:41"/>
ſhould not ſo grievouſly abhorre it, ſeeing that the very
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> with whom we promiſed that we would live
in communion, hold opinions about the Sacrament of
the Euchariſt, that ſeem to come very neare this. For
they believe (as every one knows) <hi>that the body of Jeſus
Chriſt, is really preſent in the conſecrated bread;</hi> which
being once preſuppoſed, it ſeems to follow, That we
muſt <hi>adore</hi> the Sacrament. Seeing then we believe this
opinion (which ſeems the principle and foundation of
<hi>adoration</hi> of the Sacrament) tolerable; a man may think
that we ſhould not ſo fiercely reject the concluſion
thence enſueing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This conſideration is but a vain and falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which doth no way conclude that which it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth.
For there are very great and evident differences
between the doctrine of ſuch of our brethren as are
termed <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and that of <hi>Romaniſts</hi> about this
point. At this time I ſhall onely take notice of ſo much
as concerns our preſent purpoſe. Truly what ever their
opinion be in other things, 'tis cleare that they do not
practiſe among themſelves, nor enjoyn any others who
joyn with them (nor otherwiſe approve) this adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and this ſoveraigne <hi>latria</hi> of the Euchariſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we now ſpeak. So that my conſcience (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yield for the reaſons above rehearſed to this <hi>latria</hi>
and adoration) findeth nothing in their Communion,
which wracketh it or offendeth it in this regard. But for
the Church of Rome, 'tis clean otherwiſe there. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe practiſeth this ſervice very ſcrupulouſly, and
cauſeth it to be obſerved by all ſuch as are in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
with all circumſpection imaginable; as being
in her opinion one of the moſt principall devotions in
Chriſtian Religion; and is ſo rigorous in it that where
ſhe doth abſolutely beare rule, ſhe conſtraineth all thoſe
whoſe hearts ſhe cannot bend, to bow at leaſt their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
before the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> as oft as they meet it; whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that it is a very great Paralogiſme and abuſe, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119957:42"/>
argue from the opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> to that of the <hi>Pope</hi> in
this point, there being a manifeſt difference between the
one and the other. The firſt leaving my conſcience at
liberty, without requiring of it any ſervice towards the
Sacrament contrary to my <hi>belief:</hi> and contrarywiſe, the
ſecond forcing me extreme violently, to adore that
which I firmly believe to be but a mere creature.</p>
            <p>And to that which they ſay concerning the opinion
of the Lutherans about the H. Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,
That it follows thence neceſſarily, That we
muſt adore it; I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. That it is falſe. For becauſe they think, that
our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is really preſent in the Sacrament,
it doth not thence follow that they believe, That
the Sacrament is really Jeſus Chriſt. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they hold with us, That the Sacrament is
true bread in the ſubſtance, the conſecration changing
nothing in its nature, but onely cauſing that fleſh of
Chriſt, ſignified by the bread, to be there preſent, and
to be exhibited to them who communicate. Or ſuppoſe
that it were as they hold, it follows not thence, that we
muſt adore the Sacrament. For becauſe God is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
preſent in all creatures, will you conclude, That we
muſt therefore adore all creatures? Who ſees not, that
if a man ſhould under pretence of this adore any one, he
would be ſtraight by all Chriſtians held an idolater?
The Holy Spirit dwels in the <hi>bodies</hi> of the faithfull,
which have the honour to <hi>be His temple,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 19.
as S. Paul witneſſeth. Is this to ſay that a man muſt or
may adore the bodies of Believers? The Hoſt of the
Church of Rome is in the <hi>Pix,</hi> and in the <hi>mouth,</hi> and
then in the <hi>ſtomach</hi> of them who receive it in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating.
Will they allow that becauſe of this a man
ſhould adore the <hi>Pix,</hi> and the <hi>mouth,</hi> and the <hi>ſtomach</hi>
where it entreth? They would certainly hiſſe at a man
that ſhould conclude, that we muſt adore theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the hoſt is there preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:119957:42"/>
Since it appears by theſe inductions, that thoſe things,
wherein is any ſubject worthy of adoration, ought not
thereupon to be adored; 'tis cleare, not onely that a man
may hold the reall preſence of our Lord's body in the
Sacrament, without being obliged to adore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but alſo <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> That if a man be preciſely
of another opinion, he is obliged not to adore it; whence
it follows, that the belief of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which doth
onely affirm the reall preſence of our Lords body in
the Euchariſt, is ſo farre from inferring the <hi>adoration,</hi>
that on the quite contrary it inferreth, That we muſt
<hi>not</hi> adore it.</p>
            <p>2. But then in the ſecond place, I ſay, That though,
according to the laws of diſcourſe, it ſhould follow law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and neceſſarily from the opinion of the Lutherans,
that we muſt adore the Sacrament; yet 'tis enough to
keep me from abhorring their communion, To ſee that
they hold not this adoration to be the conſequence of
that opinion, but on the contrary reject it, as well as I.
For a man may hold the principle, who doth not at all
believe the concluſion. Poſſibly he never thinks of it,
or if he doth think on it, he doth not perceive it to be a
conſequence from thoſe premiſes. 'Tis at this day gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received in our ſcholes for a good conſequence,
That if the ſoul of man come from the ſubſtance of the
Father into the body of the Sonne, it may die and is
mortall: for (ſay we) if it depend upon the matter in
its <hi>original,</hi> it depends likewiſe on it in its <hi>being.</hi> So
that when the matter (that is the body) comes to die,
the ſoul muſt likewiſe neceſſarily be extinguiſhed, ſeeing
the ſubſiſtence of the one depends upon the ſubſiſtence
of the other. Will you hereupon ſay, that none ever held
the principle of this diſcourſe, <hi>viz. that the ſoul is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and paſſeth from the ſubſtance of the Father to the
Sonne,</hi> who did not likewiſe hold the concluſion, <hi>viz.
that the ſoul is mortall.</hi> With what face dare you ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to aſſert it; ſince <hi>Tertullian</hi> and many other <hi>Authors</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:119957:43"/>
of <hi>very great</hi> eſteem were of that opinion, and S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
did rather approve it then condemn it? ſince I
ſay, they did openly believe the firſt of theſe poſitions,
and expreſly deny the ſecond. So S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the true conſequences of that opinion which he
held concerning the impaſſible nature of Chriſts body,
ſeems to me to have been obliged to denie the truth and
<hi>realitie</hi> of our redemption. And yet who dare impute
ſo grievous an impietie to ſuch a <hi>Saint?</hi> I ſhould never
have done, ſhould I reſolve to ſet down here all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
that may be alledged to this purpoſe. Theſe two
ſuffice to ſhew that whoever maintains an ill opinion, is
not therefore to be held guilty of the <hi>conſequences</hi> of it.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppoſe then it were true, (as it is not) That from
the belief of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> concerning the Euchariſt,
it would follow, That we muſt <hi>adore</hi> the Sacrament;
Since they own not this <hi>conſequence,</hi> nay on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſtrongly reject it, It would be an extreme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
to aſcribe <hi>it</hi> to them. And as it would have been
a want of charity in the primitive Chriſtians, to have
avoided the Communion of <hi>Tertullian</hi> or S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
protence, that from their opinions, touching the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
of the ſoul of man and the nature of the body of
Chriſt, there followed many propoſitions which are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi>
and <hi>contrary</hi> to our <hi>faith,</hi> ſince they rejected and
abhorred them: ſo would it be in my mind a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
now, to ſeparate from the <hi>Lutherans</hi> upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
conſequence from their opinion concerning the
holy Sacrament, if it could be deduced thence (as it
cannot.) Since they themſelves proteſt, that they will not
acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>But as for them of Rome, 'tis quite otherwiſe. For
the adoration of the Euchariſt is a conſequence of their
doctrine concerning this point both <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de
facto,</hi> that is, it plainly follows from it, and they expreſly
profeſſe and practiſe it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>De jure; it follows from it:</hi> For if the ſubject
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119957:43"/>
which we call the <hi>Sacrament of the Euchariſt,</hi> be in its
ſubſtance not bread (as we believe) but the body of
Chriſt (as they hold) 'tis evident that men both may
and ought to adore it, ſeeing that the body of Chriſt is
a ſubject adorable. And then it follows from it</p>
            <p>2. <hi>De facto; they practiſe it.</hi> For who knows not,
that there is not any one Article in all the <hi>Romane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
which is profeſſed more publickly, preſſed more
ſeverely, exerciſed more devoutly, then this <hi>of adoring
the Hoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then they hold this article both <hi>de jure,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the plain conſequences of their belief in the
point of the Euchariſt: and <hi>de facto,</hi> in their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and practiſes; and That the Lutherans on the
contrary hold them not, neither in one manner nor the
other, neither <hi>in theſi,</hi> nor <hi>hypotheſi;</hi> 'Tis cleare, That
our bearing with the latter, without ſeparating from
them for the diverſitie that is between them and us about
the point of the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> doth no way inferre that we
ſhould do as much with the former.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. That the dignitie and excellency of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> BUt you'l ſay, That you eſteem it a rude

that the profane <hi>Pagans</hi> or debauched <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
gave to <hi>mere creatures.</hi> For they adored idols, whereas
the Euchariſt is a divine Sacrament. So that it ſeems an
abuſe of the Scripture to ſcare us with thoſe threats and
curſes that it denounceth againſt ſuch kind of people;
ſeeing the object which they ſerved was ſo different
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119957:44"/>
from that which Rome will have us to adore. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
we perform this action, but 'tis to one of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of our Maſter, and for you to equall that and
compare it with an idol, 'Tis very unbeſeeming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thanks, be to <hi>God,</hi> we have a clean other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Euchariſt. We hold it (as it is indeed) a
very <hi>holy</hi> Sacrament of the body and bloud of our <hi>Lord,</hi>
to be one of the moſt precious inſtruments of his grace,
which being lawfully and rightly celebrated, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth
to us all the treaſures of heaven, the fleſh and
bloud of Chriſt, the pardon of our ſinnes, the peace of
our conſciences, the ſanctification of our ſouls, and the
right to a bleſſed immortalitie. Farre be it from us to
give it the profane and infamous name of an <hi>idol.</hi> We
will not ſay, that it is ſimply and onely bread: and if any
of us do chance to ſpeak ſo, in ſaying that 'tis <hi>bread,</hi> he
means in regard of the ſubſtance of the thing, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of its vertue or dignity; in regard of which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it is quite another thing from bread. We
ſhould take the word in the ſame ſenſe that Gregory
Nyſſen doth on the like ſubject, who ſpeaking of the
<hi>water in Baptiſme [Orat. in Bapt. Chriſt. p. 803. tom.</hi> 2.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.] ſaith, <hi>That it is
nothing elſe but water,</hi> he means in its nature. For in
the grace, 'tis another thing beſide water, and both the
Scriptures teach it to be ſo, and all Chriſtians believe
it, and this holy Doctour particularly witneſſeth it in
divers places. <hi>[Id. ibid. p. 801. c. 4. &amp; orat. Catech. c. 33.]</hi>
We therefore do willingly give to the Sacrament all
thoſe advantages and reſpects that juſtly belong to it,
and not to any idol.</p>
            <p>But if this be a creature, as we believe it to be, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
and dignitie thereof (as great as you ſet it forth)
will not at all excuſe their crime who adore it. For the
Lord forbids us to adore, not baſe or vain things onely,
as onions, and the Cats of the Egyptians, and the idols
of the Pagans, which have not any ſubſiſtence in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119957:44"/>
or any where elſe except in their falſe imaginations;
but he forbids us generally and abſolutely, to adore any
creature what ever it be; whether it creep upon the
ground, or ſhine in heaven; whether it ſwim in the
water, or flie in the aire; animate or inanimate; viſible
or inviſible; corporeall or ſpiritual; profane or ſacred;
comprehending under the ſame condemnation all thoſe,
who worſhip any creature what ever it be, as guilty of
the ſame crime, and ſubject to the ſame puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And <hi>de facto,</hi> the thing is very evident; for this adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which we give to God, being an acknowledgement
of his Soveraignty, &amp; a duty like to the love which a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
oweth to her lawfull husband, Who doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that it is a manifeſt crime to give it to any other
but to him, &amp; that the differences of the ſubjects to which
men give it are no way conſiderable in this particular;
ſeeing (though they may differ in other things) they
are all one in this, That they are <hi>not</hi> God Almighty, to
whom alone we are to give that kind of homage? The
dignity of <hi>Charles Cardinall of Bourbon,</hi> and the affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
he had with the late <hi>King of France</hi> of Glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
(being his Nephew) did not excuſe them who
gave him the name and honour of <hi>King,</hi> and did not
keep their fault from being a true <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and a
crime of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> againſt the Supreme Governour. And
the honour which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had in the houſe of Potiphar,
being his deare and beſt beloved ſervant, did not at all
juſtifie the love his Miſtreſſe bore him. Who ever ſhe
be that yields to <hi>another</hi> man the affection ſhe ow's to
none but to her <hi>husband,</hi> renders her ſelf manifeſtly
guilty of adultery. 'Tis not needfull to know <hi>who</hi> it is
that ſhe loveth: 'Tis enough for her condemnation that
it is <hi>not her husband.</hi> If then the thing to which you
render the adoration of <hi>latria,</hi> be any thing but the
Great <hi>God,</hi> Creatour of the univerſe, you are extremely
blameable for it. It matters not a whit what elſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or the dignity thereof be. What ever it is, its not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119957:45"/>
being <hi>God</hi> (to whom alone you owe ſuch a ſervice) is
enough for your condemnation and conviction of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
committed Treaſon againſt the Majeſtie of your
Soveraigne, of having violated the promiſe of ſacred
wedlock, which he hath vouchſafed to contract with
you. You are evidently a rebell, and a faithleſſe ſpouſe,
and will never be able to avoid the infamy and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
due to this crime, unleſſe you waſh your fault
with tears of a reall and ſad repentance.</p>
            <p>If it were otherwiſe, a man might quit (or at leaſt
excuſe) them that adored <hi>the Sun,</hi> the eye of the world,
the moſt beautifull and expreſſe image of the Creatour
that can be beheld in all nature, His punctual and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
ſervant, which bears ſo clearly upon it ſelf the
marks of his power and wiſdome. A man might then
defend the ſervice that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gave to the <hi>brazen
ſerpent,</hi> offering thereto incenſe; ſince it was not an
Idol which they ſerved, but a precious memoriall of the
bounty of God, an inſtrument of his goodneſſe, and in
ſome ſenſe a Sacrament of his grace. A man might then
maintain the action of the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> who adored the
<hi>Bleſſed Virgin;</hi> ſince the object of their ſervice was not
a <hi>Pagan Idol,</hi> but the moſt Holy and moſt excellent of
all women, the <hi>Mother</hi> of our Common <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>
wherein he vouchſafed to lodge his glory, the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
veſſell</hi> where he did ſo ſpread abroad his graces. A
man might juſtifie the Soveraigne ſervice that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
gave to their <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for though they made him a
creature, yet they ſuppoſed him the moſt noble and
moſt excellent of all the creation, and the inſtrument
that the Eternall Father made uſe of, for the <hi>creation</hi>
firſt, and then the <hi>redemption</hi> of the world.</p>
            <p>But the honour of theſe things, and the dignity they
have in coming ſo neare our Lord and great Maſter,
hinders not thoſe who adore them from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as worſhippers of the creature. For who knows
not, that God in the Scriptures, Job xxxi. 26, 27, 28.

<hi>Chriſt</hi> whom they believed on, they thought him but a

ſervice due to the Deitie, without manifeſtly adoring a
creature.</p>
            <p>The vanity of this pretence doth yet more plainly
appear, in that the moſt excellent ſervants of God have
refuſed that adoration which ſometimes hath been
yielded to them. For even as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſeized with a
juſt horrour, ſeeing the ungodly luſt of his <hi>Miſtreſſe;</hi>
and oppoſed her deſigne, who would have given him
that which ſhe owed onely to her husband; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able by his grave and wiſe Remonſtrances to quench
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119957:46"/>
her baſe heat, he fled away from her, eſteeming it a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
to him to be in ſuch <hi>unchaſt hands;</hi> ſhewing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
that he held this attempt of hers to be a great
abomination. Semblably, the faithfull ſervants of God
have often very rudely thruſt away them, who would
have given Them that ſervice, which is due onely to
their Maſter; and have taken ſuch honour in very great
indignation. <hi>S. John</hi> in a tranſportation of Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
twice caſt at the feet of an <hi>Angel</hi> (who diſcovered
to him the ſecrets of heaven) intending to adore him,
was <hi>twice</hi> taken up. That Sacred <hi>Miniſter</hi> of God would
by no means conſent, that S. <hi>John</hi> ſhould render unto
him that honour; <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaith he, Revel. xix. 10.
&amp; xxii. 8, 9. <hi>that thou do it not, I am thy fellow ſervant,
and of thy brethren which bear witneſſe to Jeſus, Adore
God.</hi> In the ſame ſort did S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle of our
Lord take up <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, when he was at
his feet, adoring him. <hi>Stand up,</hi> ſaid he, Act. x. 26.
<hi>I alſo am a man.</hi> In like manner S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi>
ſeeing that the Lycaonians would offer them
thoſe ſacrifices, which they were wont to offer to
their Gods, took ſuch a diſpleſure, that they rent their
garments; crying out, Act. xiiii. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Sirs, Why
do ye thus? We alſo are men, ſubject to the ſame paſſions
with you.</hi> And we need not doubt, but that the ſunne,
moon, and ſtarres, and other inanimate creatures would
reject thoſe ſervices, which are given them by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
with the like indignation, were their nature ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it. <hi>[Et ſi indignari poteſt, acerbius indignatur

S. Auguſtine <hi>T. 8. fol. 216. in Pſal. 93. praef.] Could the
Sun be angry, he would chafe leſſe to ſee himſelf ill uſed,
then falſely honoured by mankind.</hi> And let them not
here object, That Gods people have ſometime worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Angels; It being cleare out of the Scripture, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all Chriſtians, That at ſuch times either
the <hi>Angel</hi> adored was the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> who under the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119957:46"/>
Old Teſtament appeared ſometimes to the Fathers in
ſhape of an Angel; or if it was a <hi>creature,</hi> That the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
given to him by the people of God, was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
farre below that which we give to God, and that
which the Romaniſts commonly call <hi>the adoration of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria.</hi>
Otherwiſe they ſhould openly have broken the
firſt and principall article of the Law, which ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbids giving the other ſervice (adoration) to any
but to God alone.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe paſſages of the Bible, which tell us, in
the Old <hi>vulgar Latine</hi> tranſlation Pſal. xcix. (<hi>Lat.</hi> xcviii.)
5. That the <hi>Ark</hi> of the Ancient Covenant <hi>might be
adored,</hi> or in effect that it <hi>was</hi> ſo. Either we muſt ſay
(as our Authours do) that the People of God were
wont to proſtrate themſelves before the Ark (the ſervice
of God being in thoſe dayes to be made particularly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that place where the Ark was) or That this ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Ark was a kind of honour leſſe then that
of <hi>latria,</hi> which is due to none but God; or we may
have recourſe to the ſubtility of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who in
ſeverall places underſtands by <hi>the footſtool of God,</hi> the
humanity of J. Chriſt, perſonally united to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and by conſequent truly and properly adorable;
and in concluſion, we may rather admit any interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then <hi>overthrow</hi> the foundation of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi>
by granting that the higheſt worſhip is to be given to
any but the <hi>Higheſt God.</hi> For, as for that <hi>relative</hi> and
<hi>mediate adoration,</hi> which ſome of the Divines of the
Church of Rome talk of upon this occaſion, 'twill do
us no good, and that for <hi>three</hi> reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe this diſtinction of <hi>abſolute and relative</hi>
ſervice, <hi>mediate and immediate</hi> (as they ſpeak) is an
invention of their own brain and not able to ſatisfie
conſcience. For though the honour which we give to
Embaſſadours, or to other repreſentations, are referred
indeed to the perſons whom they repreſent; whence it
comes to paſſe that a Prince is honoured in his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119957:47"/>
and God in his Miniſters, and in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
yet nevertheleſſe the honour which we give to
one, differs farre from that which we give to the reſt.
This is evident in <hi>civil converſation.</hi> For what King
would ſuffer ſubjects to give the name of King or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
to his Miniſters and Officers, under colour
that they repreſent his Majeſtie, and exerciſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
every one in their charge. The reſpect which
we give them redounds indeed to their Maſter, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it, but 'tis clean another kind of honour then that
which we render <hi>Him.</hi> 'Tis iuſt ſo in the Sacraments of
Religion. For example, the reverence wherewith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Holy Baptiſme, redoundeth doubtleſſe to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of J. Chriſt, who inſtituted it, and of the H. Ghoſt
whoſe efficacy it repreſents. Now if a Chriſtian ſhould
hereupon, pretending this, affirm, That a man might
lawfully <hi>adore baptiſme</hi> with the ſame adoration that is
due to J. Chriſt or to the H. Ghoſt, Would not he be
ridiculous even to our Adverſaries?</p>
            <p>But we need not further examine this diſtinction in
this place. For Secondly, if you look to the bottome of
it, Rome doth not make uſe of it in this diſpute, ſhe
would have us render to the Euchariſt an adoration not
mediate, but <hi>immediate;</hi> not relative but <hi>abſolute;</hi> and
which terminateth in the ſame ſubject, which is <hi>there</hi>
preſent under the ſpecies of bread and wine; thinking
that it is really and perſonally <hi>the Sonne of God.</hi> So
that though the uſe of this diſtinction might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the ſervice given to a creature, yet it will never
ſerve to juſtifie that which They would have us give to
the Romane Sacrament, which they pretend is perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Creato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r.</p>
            <p>Finally, though others might with ſome reaſon uſe
the diſtinction, yet 'tis cleare, That 'tis of no uſe to us,
who eſteem it vain and without any foundation, who
hold all <hi>them</hi> really guilty of <hi>Creature-worſhip,</hi> and heirs
to all the <hi>curſes</hi> which God threatens againſt it, who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119957:47"/>
(under any pretence whatſoever) render to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that Soveraigne kind of homage and ſervice, which
is due to none but the Creatour; whether they termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their adoration in the object it ſelf which they
adore, or whether they let it paſſe to ſome other where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it hath reference. As men hold that Woman in all
reaſon guilty of adultery, who ſhall cauſe any but her
lawfull husband to ſhare of her love and marriage bed;
though ſhe may plead for her ſelf, That the deſigne in
committing ſuch an act, or the cauſe whereby ſhe was
moved, or the manner of her proceeding was <hi>this</hi> or
<hi>that,</hi> The buſineſſe is no way capable of being juſtified.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope, it appeareth cleare enough, that if the
Euchariſt be truly <hi>bread</hi> (as we believe it) neither the
dignitie of its uſe in religion, nor the reference that it
hath to the body and bloud of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> will ſave
us, either from the crime of having <hi>adored</hi> a creature, or
from the puniſhments and curſes that ſuch a deed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth;
if believing as we do, we ſhould dare to give
that ſervice and reverence to it, which the Romane
Church commandeth us.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, it is falſe. And 'tis plain that the Romaniſts

(though very raſhly) that the Euchariſt was in all ages
adored by Chriſtians, they ſay, <hi>That no man can doubt,
but that, if the Euchariſt were bread, all the Church for
M D. yeares were idolatrous. And ſo that as many of
our Anceſtours as adored the Sacrament were all damned,
adoring bread in ſtead of the Creatour. Joh. Fiſher Roff.
lib. 1. contra Oecolamp. cap. 2. fol.</hi> 3. b. And their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
were good, but that 'tis built on a falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Church for the firſt fifteen hundred
yeares adored the Euchariſt. For if the eſtimate of a
religious worſhip be to be taken from the opinion that
thoſe which uſe it have of it, ye ſhall ſcarce find any,
which either can be called juſtly an <hi>adoration of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or condemned in concluſion, as forbidden by our
<hi>Lord.</hi> The <hi>Pagans</hi> will by this means preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from that crime, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth them
with, of having <hi>adored the Creature,</hi> Rom. i. 25. and
<hi>ſerved them which by nature are no Gods,</hi> Gal. iv. 8. For
they will plead, That they believed that <hi>Jupiter</hi> (to
whom they gave ſoveraigne adoration) was the great
<hi>God,</hi> creatour and preſerver of the world, <hi>the Father of
Gods and men,</hi> as their <hi>Poets</hi> ordinarily term him. And
no man can denie, but that a perſon of ſuch a qualitie
deſerveth adoration: and ſo, according to theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
no man ſhould accuſe them of idolatry, for giving
adoration to a ſubject which they thought deſerved it.
And if the Iſraelites believed, that the golden calf was
really the <hi>God which brought them out of Egypt,</hi> Exod.
xxxii. (as the moſt part of the Romane Divines ſeem to
hold) they might with the ſame colour and ſhift excuſe
themſelves, for that worſhip which they did to <hi>it</hi> in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119957:48"/>
wilderneſſe, &amp; ſay that they took it for their <hi>Lord.</hi> They
might have affirmed, That it was their <hi>ignorance</hi> to take
their molten image for a God, but not <hi>idolatry</hi> to adore
it, having once impoſed upon it that name. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyridians
that adored the B. Virgin, as we ſaid even
now, would have been able by this means to defend
themſelves againſt S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (who taxeth them
expreſly of idolatrie) if they did but think, as Card.
<hi>Baronius</hi> ſuppoſeth, that the B. Virgin was really a
Deity, and that ſhe had nothing humane in her. For
they would have ſaid, ſuppoſe it were an errour to think
the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> a <hi>Goddeſſe;</hi> yet the ſervice which
We render her, who are of this opinion, cannot be ſo
ill interpreted, as to be <hi>Idolatry;</hi> ſeeing that ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is due to that nature which they attribute to Her.
S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his preface to his Sermons on the xciii.
Pſalme, <hi>p. 216. I. Tom.</hi> 8. ſpeaks of certain hereticks
that honoured the <hi>Sun,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That it was J. Chriſt.</hi>
Such may in the ſame manner excuſe the ſervice that
they rendred to this great luminarie; and ſay, that they
rendred it not to a creature, but that they believed the
ſubject to which they rendred it was <hi>J. Chriſt.</hi> Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
we ſee, that the Spirit of God calleth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
the ſervices rendred by Pagans to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and by
the Iſraelites to the golden <hi>calf, Idolatries,</hi> and thoſe
who rendred them <hi>adorers of creatures and idolaters.</hi>
And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> following that ſtyle, calleth the Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians
(as we obſerved even now) <hi>a ſect of ſuch as
made idols,</hi> and their opinion <hi>an hereſie.</hi> And S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
blameth the honour, that ſome whom he ſpeaketh
of gave to the Sunne; he eſteeming it a contempt caſt
upon the Creatour. And in truth who ſees not, that
this errour we now ſpeak of, is but a vain pretence, and
ſuch as can no wayes excuſe them that render divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to creatures? For if it were not, there would be
no ſinne, no crime ſo abominable, but it might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and excuſed without errour. <hi>Rebells</hi> having
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119957:49"/>
ſhaken off the yoke of their lawfull King, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and adhered to his Conſpiracy, might
ſay, They thought this was the true Governour of the
Nation, and conſequently pretend, That they who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them <hi>Rebells</hi> and <hi>Traitours,</hi> did them a deal of
wrong. And ſo we may ſay the ſame. I confeſſe, That
ignorance excuſeth, where it is againſt a mans will;
when the ſubject which we miſconceive is ſo concealed,
that whatſoever deſire we have, or pains we take to find
out the truth, 'tis not poſſible for us to diſcover it: As
if one ſhould ſuppoſe a Subject ſo like his Prince, that
'tis impoſſible to diſtinguiſh one from the other; in
this caſe ſuch would be excuſable as ſhould give him the
honour and ſervice due to their true Soveraigne. But
where the ignorance of the object proceedeth not from
the obſcuritie and difficultie of the thing, but from the
malice or negligence of the man, 'tis ſo farre from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
the fault, that it aggravateth it extremely. Such
was the errour of thoſe who during the <hi>holy League,</hi>
took the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> for the true <hi>King</hi> of
France: meerly their paſſion and not any obſcuritie
that was in the thing, made them ignorant of that
which was as clear as any thing in the world, viz. That
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> was the lawfull <hi>King</hi> of the Realm.
So that this errour, according to all laws divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
hindered not their crime from being great, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the name and puniſhment of a true <hi>rebellion.</hi>
Such, very ſuch, and indeed leſſe tolerable is the errour
of thoſe who take a creature for the Creatour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
adore it, as if it were really He.</p>
            <p>For what, I beſeech you, did the Pagans ſee in their
Jupiter, or the Iſraelites in their golden calf that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to believe one or t'other to be the Soveraigne
God, who made the heavens, and preſerves mankind by
his providence. Nay on the contrary, what did they
meet with in thoſe objects, that did not in a high and
evident manner declare, That they were nothing leſſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119957:49"/>
then <hi>that great Divinitie,</hi> whereof theſe mad men gave
them onely the name and the ſervice? And what cauſe
can the ſuperſtitious Collyridians alledge, why they
ſhould be ignorant of that, which <hi>reaſon</hi> and the H. <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
witneſſe ſo clearly, <hi>viz.</hi> That the holy Virgin is a
woman and not a Goddeſſe? or Thoſe that honoured the
Sunne, why they eſteemed, J. <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be truly the
<hi>Sunne?</hi> Take them out of their paſſion, and they had
nothing either in the nature of the thing, or in H. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that could bring them into ſo ridiculous an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
The ignorance of all theſe things then was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>affected and voluntary,</hi> bred from their vice onely,
and not from any obſcuritie of the things which they
were ignorant of: whence it followeth, that 'tis ſo farre
from being able to excuſe or diminiſh the impiety of
ſuch ſervices; that contrariwiſe 'tis one of their crimes,
for which God will enter into judgement with them,
and will ask them hereafter, why they were ignorant of
that, which was ſo clearly and graciouſly made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Now to apply what hath been ſaid to our preſent
purpoſe. If the Sacrament of the Euchariſt be truly
bread in ſubſtance (as we firmly believe it to be, upon
the credit of our <hi>ſenſe,</hi> of our <hi>reaſon,</hi> and of the <hi>word</hi> of
<hi>God</hi>) I ſay, That the contrary opinion, which thoſe
of the Church of Rome hold, thinking it to be not
bread, but the <hi>Lord of the world;</hi> doth not at all hinder
that ſervice, which they render to it in the conſequence
of their belief, from being truly the <hi>adoration of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and deſerving that name and rank which the
H. Scriptures give ordinarily to ſuch ſervices. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
that while our Lord was upon earth, preſuppoſing
that at His being in Judea, ſome perſon had reſembled
Him much in vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age, and coming to one of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
had been <hi>miſtaken</hi> for Him, and ſo one had adored this
man in ſtead of our Saviour; In ſuch a caſe, this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
might have excuſed the action; and there would
have been a deal of rigour in making that paſſe for a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119957:50"/>
criminall ſervice, as <hi>adoration of the creature.</hi> And if
the Hoſt (as they call it) were really to be adored, as
they believe it is, I confeſſe, that he, who ſhould adore
one <hi>not conſecrated,</hi> (or conſecrated <hi>without intention</hi>)
ſet before him upon the Altar, could not juſtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for having adored it: becauſe it was not his
paſſion or not heeding, that cauſed this miſtake; but the
likeneſſe and extreme uniformitie that was between the
one and the other, they being not diſtinguiſhable one
from another by any apparent mark. But ſuppoſe that
the Euchariſt be not J. <hi>Chriſt</hi> really; the errour then
of them, who take it to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> comes all from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and not from any thing that is without them. For
in your conſcience, what <hi>ſimilitude</hi> can you diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two things, that ſhould make us take them
<hi>one</hi> for the <hi>other?</hi> or what is there that doth not oblige
us moſt firmly to believe, that the one is not the other?
The one is a round thing, without ſenſe and motion,
and altogether uniform; the other hath a humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
organized, and furniſhed with ſenſe and other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
even as ours. The one is bread, which we have
ſeen kneaded, and made: the other a <hi>divine</hi> ſubſtance
formed of the fleſh of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> above MDC yeares
agoe. One is broken in our hands, and bruiſed between
our teeth, and conſumed in our ſtomacks, the other is of
an immortall nature, glorious, and impaſſible. I omit
other differences.</p>
            <p>But if I had nothing elſe but the doctrine of the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the belief of <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> That our
Lord is in heaven, whence he ſhall come at the laſt day;
and the forewarning that he gave us Himſelf, to beware
of being ſurprized, by them that ſay, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt,
or there, He is in the deſart, or ſecret cloſet,</hi> Matth. xxiv.
26. Is not this enough to render all errour inexcuſable
in this particular? For what will they be able to anſwer
our <hi>Lord</hi> againſt ſuch cleare marks, and ſuch expreſſe
forewarnings; when He ſhall demand of them a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119957:50"/>
of this great miſtake? To <hi>men</hi> I wonder not that
they alledge, <hi>This is my body;</hi> but to the <hi>Great God,</hi>
who ſeeth the ſecrets of the hearts (and in ſo glorious
and cleare a light) I am confident they will never dare
to bring for themſelves ſo weak a defenſe. For ſince they
have heard S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay oft, that the <hi>Church is the body
of Chriſt,</hi> without believing thereupon that the Church
is <hi>tranſubſtantiated;</hi> or <hi>not</hi> a creature but <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis called <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 27. Eph.
i. 23. And if the honour that the Church hath to be
called the body of Chriſt, doth not keep man from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that it were impietie (and not Religion) to
give to the <hi>Church</hi> the adoration of <hi>latria;</hi> how will
that hold good which they ſay, That they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
neceſſarily obliged to adore the Euchariſt, becauſe
it is called <hi>the body of Chriſt?</hi> If ſuch phraſes of ſpeech
be enough to ground that ſervice upon, which they give
to the Euchariſt, they muſt then alſo adore the <hi>rock,</hi>
whence Moſes brought water in the wilderneſſe; ſince
S. Paul ſaith, That that was <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>the body of
the faithfull;</hi> 1 Cor. x. 4. 1 Cor. vi. 15. ſince he ſaith,
That they are the members of Chriſt: and thoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
taxed by S. Auguſtine would be excuſable for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
adored the <hi>ſunne;</hi> ſince the Scripture ſometimes
gives that name to the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus.</hi> If they'l confeſſe
that theſe phraſes of ſpeech did not excuſe that abuſe,
they muſt likewiſe confeſſe that the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>This is my body,</hi> do not ſuffice to authorize that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which they give to the Euchariſt.</p>
            <p>All this they grant ſufficiently, when their great
Doctours confeſſe, That they do not build their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon <hi>thoſe words:</hi> and grant, they ſee no reaſon why
they ſhould not take the words in that ſenſe, which we
Proteſtants take them in. <hi>[Cajet. in 3. Thom. q. 75.
art. 1.]</hi> From the ſole Authoritie of the Church (that
is to ſay, in their language, of the Pope and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel)
they deduce their tranſubſtantiation. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119957:51"/>
is the onely foundation of the adoration of the
Hoſt, which they can no way collect but from the will
of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. So it appeareth, That laying aſide
the paſſion of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is nothing in heaven, or in
earth, or in the ſenſe of men, or in the Scriptures of
God, which ſhould (I will not ſay <hi>oblige</hi>) but any way
<hi>allure</hi> them to be ignorant, that the Euchariſt is bread.
So that all ignorance that they can pretend, is purely
affected and voluntary; and ſo not able to excuſe the
ſervice, which they render to the Hoſt.</p>
            <p>To which adde, that it excuſeth them ſo much the
leſſe, Becauſe the queſtion here is concerning the <hi>higheſt</hi>
adoration, the moſt holy and ſingular act in all religion,
which by conſequence a man ſhould give to none but
to Him, whom he knows moſt aſſuredly to be God, and
the Saviour of our ſouls. Nor is it enough, to have an
opinion or ſuſpicion of this. It muſt be certain. For
'tis juſt as the <hi>conjugall bed,</hi> to which a <hi>woman</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
none, but whom ſhe <hi>knows</hi> very <hi>certainly</hi> to be
her <hi>husband.</hi> If ſhe have any apparent doubt, that it is
not <hi>he</hi> in realitie, and if notwithſtanding this ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, ſhe thereby forfeits her troth. And here I
cannot but commend a ſaying I read (in <hi>Apothegm.
Anachor. Aegypt. lib. 15. cap. 70. Bibl. Patrum tom. 9.
p.</hi> 286.) of an old <hi>Egyptian Monk;</hi> who, when one
appeared to him in the reſemblance of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was ſo
farre from adoring what he ſaw, that he would neither
view it, nor hearken to it: but ſhutting his eyes, ſaid,
<hi>I ſhall ſee Chriſt in heaven; 'Tis enough for me to hope
and believe, while I am upon earth.</hi> But how? Was he
not afraid, that this refuſall would offend his <hi>Lord,</hi> in
caſe this had been He indeed, as the light, ſpeech, ſhape,
and other circumſtances obliged him to believe? Not a
a jot. For he was aſſured, that his <hi>Lord</hi> ſaw that this
refuſall proceeded, not from any want of reſpect toward
Him, but from a juſt and rationall fear of giving
(through miſtake) that to another, which belonged
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119957:51"/>
to Him onely, and which he earneſtly deſired to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
inviolably for <hi>Him.</hi> A qualitie, which is ſo farre
from offending our <hi>Lord,</hi> that it muſt needs be very
pleaſing to Him. And in the ſame place (c. 71.) an
<hi>Anchoret</hi> is mentioned, who, when the Devils askt him,
whether he would ſee <hi>Chriſt;</hi> anſwered, <hi>Be you, and
he whom you would ſhew me, anathema. For my part
I give heed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y Jeſus, who ſaid, If any ſay unto you,
here is Chriſt or there, believe him not.</hi> And to this
purpoſe is that, which the Egyptian Anchorets (c. 69.)
are reported oft to have ſaid; <hi>If a true Angel appear to
thee, be not very ready to entertain him; but humble thy
ſelf, ſaying, I am not worthy to ſee an</hi> Angel <hi>while I
live in ſinne.</hi> So that though we had ſome reaſon to
think <hi>Chriſt</hi> were preſent; yet 'twere good to refrain,
and not <hi>adore</hi> him, when we are not in all points aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that it is <hi>He:</hi> becauſe this were evidently to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
the act of adoration; which muſt by no means be
given to any raſhly, and at adventure. Now our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
find nothing in all this matter, which doth
not ſhew clearly, that the Euchariſt is really not the
<hi>Lord of the world,</hi> but bread. And therefore there is
farre leſſe reaſon, that the adoration which they give to
the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> ſhould be excuſed by that opinion, which they
pretend to have of it.</p>
            <p>II. But then ſecondly, Though the <hi>opinion</hi> of the
Romane Church concerning the Euchariſt ſhould (as
we have proved it doth not) juſtifie, or at leaſt excuſe
that adoration which they give it; yet 'tis cleare, That
to alledge that <hi>opinion</hi> of theirs here as an excuſe, were
nothing to the purpoſe. For the queſtion is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who profeſſe that they believe
that the Euchariſt is really and perſonally the Sonne of
God; but concerning <hi>us,</hi> who are ſo farre from believing
it, that we have not the leaſt ſuſpicion of it; being (God
be thanked) fully perſwaded, that the Sacrament is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>bread.</hi> And why ſhould we not believe it ſo? ſince
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119957:52"/>
our <hi>ſenſes</hi> witneſſe, our <hi>reaſon</hi> ſheweth, the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
teach, that it is bread; which are the three <hi>fountains</hi> of
<hi>all</hi> our knowledge; and we cannot be ſure of any thing,
but from one of them. Having therefore this belief of
the Euchariſt, how can we adore it, without rendring
our ſelves guilty of violating all thoſe precepts, wherein
God hath forbidden us to adore the creatures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
all thoſe deaths and curſes, which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt the breach of ſuch precepts?</p>
            <p>I meddle not with other mens conſciences, nor will I
take upon me to judge <hi>their</hi> actions. Almighty God
will do that one day. And I think I have ſaid enough
to ſhew them, that 'Tis their duty in the mean while,
to conſider it ſeriouſly. I ſpeak of <hi>my ſelf.</hi> Since <hi>my</hi> ſoul
is perſwaded, that the Euchariſt is a creature, I cannot
adore it without offending the laws of God, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the foundations of my own ſalvation. And
though my perſwaſion were falſe, yet ſince I believe it
(and that upon ſo many, and ſo certain, divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
aſſurances) Though the Sacrament were (as it is
not) really the Lord of glory; yet 'tis cleare, That if I
ſhall <hi>adore</hi> it believing as aforeſaid; ſuch my ſervice will
be falſe and unlawfull, addreſſed not to <hi>God,</hi> (who is
the ſole true and lawfull object) but to a creature,
which my imagination ſhall through miſtake have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in His place. Hereupon the Ancient Church
hath conſtantly accuſed the Arians of <hi>adoring the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and continually called the ſervice, which they
gave to Chriſt, <hi>idolatry and adoration of the creature:</hi>
and with very good reaſon. For though the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi>
is the true God, eternall, the Creatour of the world,
and Redeemer of the Church, and of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
with the Father; and though the adoration
which is given to Him by them, who believe Him to
be ſuch, be a lawfull worſhip, not condemned, but
approved and expreſſely commanded in the Scripture:
yet they, who by a deteſtable errour hold Him to be but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119957:52"/>
a mere creature, and think that the <hi>Father</hi> made Him
of <hi>nothing</hi> (either before or after the Creation of the
world) as well as the heaven and the earth; if they
give Him the ſame adoration, which is due to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they do evidently beſtow on a creature, that which
belongs to the Creatour onely. For they addreſſe this
ſervice not to the true <hi>Jeſus,</hi> coeternall and coeſſentiall
with the Father, but to a phantaſme of a creature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in their own brain: hereby rendring themſelves
guilty of a crime, ſo often condemned and deteſted by
the Lord in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that the truth of the <hi>word of God,</hi> and
the Authority of the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> forbids us to
adore that which we believe to be but a creature, under
peril of incurring the curſes denounced by the laws of
God againſt thoſe, who rob Him of His glory and give
it to another; We muſt conclude that neither the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church of Rome, nor any other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
can exempt us from the anathemaes of Heaven,
if we adore (as our Adverſaries do) the Sacrament of
the Euchariſt, firmly believing it to be <hi>bread</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and not (as they pretend) our B. <hi>Saviour</hi> really
and perſonally.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> BUt perhaps ſome will grant, That we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lawfully adore the Euchariſt, while we
are of this mind; but will ſay, That we may give that
worſhip to the Sacrament which the Church of Rome
commands without adoring it. For they'l ſay, Since
you acknowledge that the Euchariſt is a Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by our <hi>Lord,</hi> can you not kneel at receiving it,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119957:53"/>
and addreſſe your adoration and ſervice, not to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
which you eſteem to be a creature, but to J.
<hi>Chriſt</hi> the authour of it, whom you believe to be the
Creatour of the Univerſe, as he is indeed? If one of
you ſhould be be <hi>baptized</hi> at years of diſcretion, think
you that he might not receive that Sacrament on his
knees, without being blamed for <hi>adoring</hi> the water?
Nay would it not be his duty to put himſelf into this
reſpectfull poſture rather then any other, to ſhew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
which he bears to our Lord, and to the ſeal of
the new Covenant and adoption.</p>
            <p>And when your Paſtors are <hi>conſecrated</hi> by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands, do they not receive it on their knees?
Yet none thinks that they do therefore adore thoſe who
lay hands on them, or the ſigne which is uſed to that
end. And then why do you make ſuch ſcruple of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your knees, and bending your bodies in receiving
the Euchariſt, a Sacrament no leſſe precious then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
inſtituted by the <hi>ſame</hi> Lord, and for the <hi>ſame</hi> end:
one to regenerate us, the other to nouriſh us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one to help
us into the Church, the other to help us to perſevere?
Why are you afraid in this particular, rather then in
any other, of the crime and the puniſhment that attends
<hi>adoration</hi> of the Euchariſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But though this objection have ſome luſtre
in it, and dazleth many perſons, perſwading them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
themſelves outwardly to the Church of
Rome, retaining in their heart the ſame opinion which
we hold concerning the Euchariſt; yet nothing can be
more weak or vain. Thanks be to God, we are not ſo
ill taught as to ſcruple <hi>receiving the Sacrament on our
knees.</hi> Our <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>England</hi> never receive it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
and when we communicate with them, we do very
eaſily and readily conform our ſelves to their order.
And 'tis held among us a matter of ſuch indifferency,
that though we receive the Holy Supper <hi>ſtanding,</hi> yet
we do not exclude them from the number of Brethren,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119957:53"/>
who receive it ſitting or <hi>kneeling.</hi> And if the Church
of Rome had required no other thing of us, then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to receive the H. Communion on our knees, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
we ſhould have had no juſt cauſe in this particular
of ſeparating from it, ſince we might with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
perform what they demand. But, alas! how <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>
muſt we be, if we believe that ſhe requireth no more
of us in this Article? how <hi>hypocriticall,</hi> if we pretend
to believe it when we do not? For all the <hi>world</hi> knows
that the Romaniſts require us to believe that <hi>thing,</hi>
which we ſee on their <hi>Altars,</hi> and between the hands of
their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to be really and in truth the eternall <hi>Sonne
of God;</hi> and That it hath, under the ſpecies which
our ſenſes ſee and touch, no other ſubſtance but <hi>His;</hi> and
conſequently commands us to adore it, to bow our ſelves
before it, to give thereto all the humiliation of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and of our ſouls, terminating on it the act of our
veneration, as on its true object. She deeply and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excommunicates all ſuch, as doubt either of the

all them, who adhere to Her communion; and you
ſhall find theſe two points written, graven, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
all manner of wayes, in ſuch legible characters,
that you ſhall ſcarce find any point of the Apoſtles
Creed, which ſhe confeſſeth more clearly, or which ſhe
preſſeth more ſeverely.</p>
            <p>You'l ſay, I am willing to honour the Sacrament but
not adore it: No, ſaith She, you muſt adore it. And
leſt you ſhould pretend to hide, under that equivocall
word, any veneration leſſe then the higheſt (like that
which we may render to the creature, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Creatour) <hi>You muſt render it,</hi> ſhe ſaith, <hi>the

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:119957:54"/>
Well, you'l ſay, but I will addreſſe this ſervice of <hi>latria</hi>
which ſhe requireth of me to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is in
heaven; and not to the Sacrament of his bodie, which
is upon the earth: <hi>No,</hi> ſaith ſhe, I do not intend it
ſo. I would have you in the veneration which you
make in communicating, to render the ſervice of <hi>latria</hi>
to the <hi>moſt holy Sacrament. Nullus itaque dubitandi lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
relinquitur, quin omnes Chriſti fideles pro more in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica

ibid. c. 5. See, with what a deal of care ſhe hath
expreſſed her ſenſe, and excluded all others, without
leaving them the leaſt place? For if ſhe had ſaid that
the faithfull ſhould adore J. Chriſt in the Sacrament,
ſuppoſing the reſt of her doctrine had left us in doubt
of her meaning, we might yet have interpreted this
expreſſion, as 'tis uſed in the books of ſome of her
Doctours, viz. That in receiving the Euchariſt, we
ſhould adore the Lord, with whom we communicate by
the Euchariſt, and ſo we might have pretended that ſhe
doth not oblige us to adore any creature. But ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
to <hi>exclude</hi> all ſuch expoſition, uſeth quite another
expreſſion, ſaying, That the <hi>ſervice of</hi> latria <hi>ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Sacrament.</hi> So that now there is no reaſon
to doubt of her meaning. For what I pray you is it
that ſhe calleth the <hi>Holy Sacrament?</hi> Is it <hi>Jeſus Chriſt
reſiding in heaven?</hi> Who is ſo ignorant, as not to know
whether it be He or no? Is it not preciſely <hi>that</hi> which
the Prieſt bleſſeth upon the Altar? <hi>that</hi> which he puts
into the mouth of the Communicants? <hi>that</hi> which
they muſt ſwallow down into the ſtomach? <hi>Yes; that</hi> is
the very thing, to which ſhe would have you addreſſe
your adoration, the bending of your knees, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
of your body, and in a word all the parts of
that inward veneration, wherewith you communicate.
If this be not it, which you regard; when you bend
your knee to any thing elſe, She anathematizeth you;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119957:54"/>
ſhe holdeth you for an heretick and a rebell, one that
deſerves the anger of God and eternall fire. And that
you may know, that ſhe hath regard, not to the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the action which you celebrate, but to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the ſubject which is propoſed to you; ſhe
would have you proſtrate your ſelf before it: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the time of Communion, but likewiſe out of it;
in the very ſtreets, and publick paſſages, and in all places
where you meet it. An evident ſigne that Her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is preciſely ſuch, as Her ſelf explaineth it to be,
<hi>viz.</hi> That you hold this for your true God, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render it all the honours due to the Soveraigne <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
If then you eſteem this ſubject to be truly a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is not this an open mocking of God and men, and
a miſerable deceiving of your ſelf; To tell us, That you
can do that which the Romane Church requireth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adoring that at all, which you believe to be but a
bare creature? For as for that which you ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baptiſme, I confeſſe that being at yeares of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you may receive it upon your knees: But, if the
Church to whom you come for it, ſhould command
you to believe, that which you ſee in form of water
to be really and in ſubſtance (not water, but) <hi>the true
God,</hi> Creatour of heaven and earth; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
command you to render adoration to it, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>latria,</hi> and to that purpoſe to fall upon your
knees; I ſay, That in ſuch a caſe, you cannot obey ſuch
a commandment, without violating your conſcience,
and treading under foot the Law of God, and rendring
your ſelf really guilty of <hi>adoration</hi> of a creature. The
ſame I ſay concerning the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> which receive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of hands, and the <hi>Believers,</hi> who receive the
Euchariſt upon their <hi>knees.</hi> For if one ſhould teach or
command either the one or the other to believe, That
the Paſtor, who impoſeth hands on them, or the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Euchariſt which they receive, is truly and
in ſubſtance the great <hi>God</hi> who created the world, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119957:55"/>
by conſequence expreſly enjoyn men to adore, either
the one or the other of theſe two ſubjects; who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but that this were openly to denie our faith, and
to renounce our profeſſion, when we fall upon our knees
before theſe things, after ſuch a commandment? But
men neither teach nor command any ſuch thing among
us. God forbid they ſhould! We believe and preach,
That our Miniſters are <hi>men</hi> and mere <hi>creatures;</hi> ſo that
no man can take the kneeling, which is <hi>before</hi> them,
who give impoſition of hands, for an adoration ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
<hi>to</hi> them; all the profeſſion of our Churches,
and nature of the things themſelves directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
it. In like manner the Church of England
believeth and teacheth publickly, That the Euchariſt is
bread in ſubſtance, and that to adore it were grievouſly
to offend God: So that the kneeling, which is in their
communion, cannot be taken for an adoration of ought
elſe but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who is in heaven, and not of
bread which is upon the earth. Did the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
believe and likewiſe teach, that the Euchariſt were
bread in ſubſtance, and not a ſubject fit to be adored,
we think, that then we might bow the knee in her
Communion without wounding our conſciences. But
while ſhe teacheth that which ſhe now believeth, while
ſhe exacteth of us this kneeling as a true <hi>adoration</hi> of
the Sacrament; who is ſo blind as not to ſee that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obey her, without making our ſelves (according to
the judgement of our own conſciences) guilty of adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>meer creature,</hi> ſince we believe the Sacrament

He command that in <hi>piety,</hi> which regardeth Himſelf, we

as He abominates that man, who loving his neighbour

Him with his mouth, ſhall curſe Him with his heart.
'Twill ſtand <hi>one</hi> man in no ſtead to plead for himſelf,
That his ſoul did his duty, but the bodie failed of his;
nor <hi>another</hi> to excuſe the defaults of the ſoul by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the body. So that in effect, theſe excuſes will be
but a meer mockery. The union of the mind and the
body being ſo neare, that when the mind is diſpoſed as
it ſhould, the body cannot but perform its devoir: and
he that abuſing God or his neighbour with his tongue,
would have us believe that notwithſtanding all that, he
loveth them ſincerely in his heart; is a <hi>bold lyar</hi> deſerving
to be puniſhed, not onely for his blaſphemy or wrong,
but likewiſe for his <hi>impudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to theſe undoubted Maximes we are
bound, not onely to receive in our hearts the truths,
which God hath revealed in Religion; but likewiſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to profeſſe them: And we are all bound not
onely not to disbelieve with our hearts the errours and
impieties, which are contrary to the truth of God; but
likewiſe not to confeſſe them outwardly in any kind.
For if it be enough to retain in the heart the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and love of truth, and it be permitted to deny it
outwardly ſometimes; <hi>S. Peter</hi> had not fell in denying
his Maſter: for no man can doubt but that his heart
within, knew well enough what his tongue diſavowed
without. And ſo, to denie our Lord before men, would
be no ſinne; and confeſſion with the mouth would be of
no uſe: which <hi>all</hi> are things evidently <hi>falſe.</hi> For that
action of <hi>S. Peter</hi> is grievouſly blamed in the Goſpel,
and his <hi>tears</hi> (if we had no other proof) ſhew us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
that he thought he did <hi>extremely</hi> offend God.
And our <hi>Lord,</hi> Matth. x. 33. proteſteth expreſſely, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119957:56"/>
               <hi>He will denie him before His Father in heaven</hi> (that is
to ſay, that at the great day of judgement, He will not
own him for His; nor put him in the number of
His bleſſed children) <hi>who will deny him before men.</hi>
And laſtly, <hi>S. Paul,</hi> Rom. x. 9, 10. teacheth us, That
<hi>with the heart men believe unto righteouſneſſe, and with the
tongue they make confeſſion unto ſalvation,</hi> and to be ſaved
he doth not onely require, That you ſhould <hi>believe the
Lord in your heart,</hi> but likewiſe that you ſhould <hi>confeſſe
him with your mouth.</hi> The ſame reaſons do neceſſarily
induce us to believe, That it is not enough to baniſh
from our <hi>hearts</hi> the belief of impietie, and ſuch errours
as are contrary to the foundations of true Religion; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we alſo baniſh the confeſſion of them from our
<hi>mouthes.</hi> For to <hi>confeſſe</hi> an errour which overthroweth
the fundamentalls of Religion, is clearly to <hi>deny our R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
Since then we are forbidden under pain of an
eternall curſe, to confeſſe with our mouth the errours
which we deteſt with our hearts; Tis cleare, that if we
believe the adoration of the Hoſt of the Church of
Rome, to be an errour contrary to the foundations of
piety, as we do indeed: That we cannot confeſſe it,
without violating the commandment of J. Chriſt, and
pulling upon our ſouls eternall ruine and damnation.
For, where is the Chriſtian who firmly believing that
the Sacrament is a creature, and being asked if he ſhould
give it the adoration of <hi>latria,</hi> will not dread to anſwer,
<hi>Yes?</hi> and whoſe conſcience will not feel a thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes,
if any paſſion cauſe his tongue to ſay ſo? And
how can we ſay that <hi>the Sacrament is to be adored,</hi> or
confeſſe it more clearly, then by proſtrating our ſelves
before the Hoſt of the Church of Rome, and giving it
in the preſence of men the ſame outward veneration,
which is the mark and ſubſtance of that which we give
to Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you'l perhaps deny, That with your
mouth <hi>you</hi> ever ſaid, that a man ought to adore it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:119957:57"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, in this age wherein we live,
'tis very hard (if not impoſſible) to adhere to the
communion of Rome, without making this confeſſion
with the <hi>mouth</hi> and <hi>hand,</hi> and by the ſpeech and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
ſuch is the extreme rigour wherewith ſhe requireth
it of every one of her Communicants.</p>
            <p>But to paſſe by confeſſion of the <hi>tongue.</hi> 'Tis
enough for my preſent purpoſe, that you are upon your
knees before the <hi>Hoſt.</hi> For in ſo doing, you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
not with your tongue indeed, but (which is all
one) with all your body. Your action hath confeſſed in
publick, what your heart hath rejected and abhorred in
private. For <hi>to confeſſe</hi> in theſe matters, is to <hi>declare</hi> by
ſome <hi>outward ſigne</hi> what you believe, or on the contrary
what you do not believe; witneſſing it either by words
of the mouth, or by writing of the hand, or by any
other intelligible ſigne. Now ſecondly, this in civill
converſation would be eſteemed a meer illuſion and
mockery, to pretend that a man doth not own or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
a thing, though he declare as much by ſome evident
ſigne, under pretence that he doth it without ſpeaking:
as if a man that did <hi>homage</hi> to another, ſhould pretend,
that he did not acknowledge him for his Soveraigne,
under colour of his not expreſſing <hi>in words</hi> that he did.</p>
            <p>The <hi>actions</hi> by which men do ordinarily declare ſuch
things, are ſignes not onely equivalent to words, but
much <hi>more</hi> preciſe and <hi>ſignificative;</hi> ſo that to uſe them,
is to declare a thing more expreſly and openly, then if
a man ſhould ſpeak it in words. Now to <hi>kneel</hi> before
the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the Church of Rome, to <hi>uncover</hi> the <hi>head,</hi>
and <hi>proſtrate</hi> the <hi>body</hi> to the earth, at the ſound of a little
<hi>bell,</hi> or to go in <hi>proceſſion</hi> after it on the <hi>day</hi> of its <hi>Feaſt;</hi>
or to <hi>deck</hi> a mans lodging with <hi>hangings</hi> againſt it paſſe
by, and other actions like to theſe, are the plain and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſignes, whereby men acknowledge the <hi>Hoſt</hi> to
have a <hi>Soveraigne Divinity,</hi> and pay (as it were) ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>homages</hi> to it; as appeareth by the will of them, who
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119957:57"/>
command it in the Church of Rome, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
intention of thoſe, who practiſe it continually.</p>
            <p>So that every one who falleth on his knees before the

when 'tis made in honour thereof, on the day of
that <hi>Feaſt;</hi> or who goeth out of his lodging to honour
its pompe; Declareth and witneſſeth, that he holdeth

commonly ſerve to ſignifie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This anſwer is not onely vain and ridiculous,
but very dangerous; and the conſequence of it is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
not onely to Religion, but alſo to civil Societie.
For ſignes inſtituted by men to ſignifie things, whether
in nature or in Religion, ſhould be interpreted by the
publick and common cuſtome of thoſe who uſe them;
and not by ſecret and particular intentions, this or that
way. I confeſſe that in themſelves and in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they ſignifie, for the moſt part, no more one thing
then another: and that ſuch among them, as have any
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119957:58"/>
naturall reference to the things which they ſignifie, are
not ſo neceſſary; but that a man may at the beginning
make them ſignifie otherwiſe. But when once the will
of men (which is the Miſtris of ſuch inſtitutions)
hath limited and appointed them to ſome certain ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and publick uſe hath confirmed it; 'tis afterwards
(I conceive) an intolerable boldneſſe to go about to uſe
them in another ſenſe; and he that ſhall doe ſo, will be
eſteemed either a ſot or a liar by every reaſonable perſon.
For example, Such words as we ordinarily uſe to expreſſe
the thoughts of our underſtandings, have not, in their
own nature, any vertue or ſtrength to ſignifie this thing
rather then that. The word <hi>Father,</hi> of it ſelf may as
well ſignifie <hi>a ſtone,</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or <hi>fire,</hi> as that which it
doth ſignifie; and each of theſe words might as well
ſignifie that which <hi>Father</hi> doth, as that which now they
ſignifie. 'Tis cleare, That it is the will of man, and not
their own nature, that gave them the ſenſe and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which now they have in our language. But ſince
the publick uſe of our Nation hath limited and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
them to thoſe things which they ſignifie, who
doth not ſee, That 'tis not poſsible for any particular
man to uſe them hereafter in any other ſenſe; to uſe the
word <hi>Father</hi> to ſignifie <hi>a ſtone;</hi> or <hi>fire</hi> to ſignifie <hi>a Father?</hi>
'Tis juſt ſo with actions, which either by the will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
or cuſtome of men are uſed either in Religion,
or civil Societie to ſignifie any thing; as for example,
Homage to ſignifie the ſuperiority of him to whom it
is rendred: The giving a ring and a kiſſe in ſome nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to ſignifie the taking of a woman to wife: in the
dayes of old among the Iſraelites, to let one pierce the
eare with an awl, to ſignifie that one was willing to be
ſervant to him, from whom he endured it: and among
the Romaniſts, to be adored by Cardinals in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,
doth ſignifie that the man ſo adored is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be Pope: and the kneeling before the Hoſt,
that one adoreth it, and acknowledgeth it for his God.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119957:58"/>
I confeſſe that theſe ſignes and others like them, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
and of their own nature, ſignifie no more theſe
things then others; and that of themſelves they may be
applied to other ſignifications. But ſince they are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſecrated to theſe by publick uſe, 'tis an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled
folly for any man, to pretend to uſe them in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ſenſe. As if one ſhould ſay in Engliſh, <hi>That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
the Pope of Rome to be the Head and Monarch of the
Church of Chriſt;</hi> He muſt needs ſignifie the ſame thing,
that theſe words do uſually ſound in the common notion
and cuſtome of them in our Language: So that if he
do not believe ſo, he cannot in ſo ſpeaking exempt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from being held either a <hi>fool</hi> or a <hi>knave.</hi> So he who
falleth on his knees before the Hoſt, or who ſolemnizeth
the feaſt of it, or aſſiſteth at it, or trimmeth his lodging
in honour of it; He, I ſay, doth likewiſe ſignifie, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
kind of true language, yet nevertheleſſe as expreſſe
as the former, that he holdeth the Hoſt for a God, for the
true Creatour and Redeemer of the world; and if he be
of a contrary perſwaſion, he muſt neceſſarily grant, That
he is either out of his ſenſes, or a notorious liar; abuſing
the actions of his body, to ſignifie the contrary thoughts
of his heart. And as the former would be laughed at by
any judicious man, if, to excuſe his expreſſion, he ſhould
alledge, that by <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> he meant not what thoſe
words ſignifie in the common uſe of men, but ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things; as for example, <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> our Lord: ſo the
latter would be as ridiculous, who ſhould tell us, That
he uſeth kneeling before the Hoſt, and other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
not to let men know that he adoreth it (which is
the thing that theſe actions ſignifie in the common uſe
of men) but to ſignifie that he adoreth our Lord, who
ſitteth on high in heaven. If ſuch excuſes might take
place, if any one might be ſuffered to uſe the ſignes of
things to a clean other ſenſe, then that wherein they are
taken in the common and ordinary uſe of men; all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
publick and private, religious and civill, would
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119957:59"/>
ſtraight be plunged into an horrible confuſion. We
ſhould not hereafter have any credit, or aſſurance among
men. For as for words, every man might abuſe them to
ſignifie what pleaſeth him; the religion and great care
that ſhould be taken of oaths, contracts, promiſes (a
thing ſo abſolutely neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
would quite fall to the ground. <hi>A woman</hi> may think
that a man hath promiſed to be her <hi>husband,</hi> becauſe he
hath ſworn that he will take her for his <hi>ſpouſe;</hi> but the
perfidious diſſembling fellow will excuſe himſelf, ſaying,
That by the word <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> he meant a <hi>concubine,</hi> and not a
<hi>lawfull wife,</hi> which is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the word commonly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth.
A Judge in France may believe that a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is innocent, becauſe a witnes aſſureth him (upon his
oath) that he did not <hi>tuer,</hi> that is, <hi>kill</hi> ſuch a man; for
whom he is accuſed. And according to this rule, the
witneſſe ſhall quit himſelf from perjury, by alledging,
That he meant by <hi>tuer</hi> not to kill (as it ſignifies in
French,) but to keep alive, to defend and preſerve (as it
ſignifieth in Latine) by an impudence like that of the
French priſoner, who being asked, whether he ever paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the ſtraight of the ſea, ſwore that he <hi>never</hi> did;
meaning by the word <hi>ſtraight,</hi> not that between <hi>Dover</hi>
and <hi>Calis,</hi> whereof the queſtion was asked him, but that
of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> of which none of the ſtanders-by thought
a whit. Briefly, all the language of men (that admirable
organ of their diſcourſe by which they diſcover the
thoughts of their hearts to each other ſo uſefully) would
by this means become a meer ginne, a trick to couſen
and delude. No man would be able by this means, to
underſtand his neighbours meaning, any more then if
the ancient confuſion of Babel were again in the world;
every one would become a ſtranger and barbarian to his
companion. And then for actions which ſignifie any
thing, If particular men might be ſuffered to wreſt them
to another ſenſe and meaning then that, whereto the
publick hath appointed them, the ſame diſorder would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119957:59"/>
take place. A ſubject after he hath done homage to the
enemie of his naturall Lord, to exempt himſelf from the
puniſhment due to this undutifulneſſe, might alledge,
That he meant by this act, not to acknowledge the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for his Soveraigne, (which is the common ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that action) but onely to ſalute him, as we do
another man. And the ſervant of old time in Iſrael
might have denied the ſervice, which he promiſed to his
Maſter by the ſigne of his eare pierced, (an ordinary
thing in that nation) excuſing himſelf, that he meant
the clean contrary by that act, <hi>viz.</hi> to renounce his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſervice, &amp; not to oblige himſelf to it for the future.
The Souldier in warre might wear the enemies colours,
and pretend that he had not for all this renounced his
captain. But this abuſe will be more dangerous in <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
by how much that ſhould be kept more holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
among men. For if a man may be permitted
to practiſe actions, whicd are inſtituted to another ſenſe,
and that he may never intend them to that end for
which they are commonly uſed; there will be nothing
certain in Religion. For as you will preſume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
your ſelf before the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the Church of Rome,
and think you may not thereupon be accuſed of <hi>adoring</hi>
it; ſo another will as well proſtrate himſelf before <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and offer to them <hi>wax-candles,</hi> without being taxed
of having <hi>worſhipped</hi> them. Another may wear a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi>
and enter into the <hi>Moſques</hi> of the Turks, and there
perform <hi>their</hi> devotions, without being guilty of <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metaniſme.</hi>
For (he will ſay) 'Tis to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that
I perform theſe ſervices, and not to the God of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.
And another among the inhabitants of <hi>China</hi>
may proſtrate himſelf without ſcruple before their idols,
pleading that he addreſſeth this adoration not to the
<hi>Pagode</hi> there preſent (as the idolaters doe) but to God
the Father, or to Jeſus Chriſt. And if they be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to wreſt actions thus from their true ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
why not words likewiſe? For theſe are ſignes of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119957:60"/>
the ſame nature, both the one and the other are inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by men, and to the ſame end; ſaving that the nature
of the words hath oftentimes leſſe reference to their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification,
then the nature of an action, or a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
ſo that a man ſhould make leſſe ſcruple of abuſing
it. According to this account, a Proteſtant might ſwear
boldly, that he believeth, A man ſhould adore the Hoſt:
for he will ſay, that by the word <hi>Hoſt,</hi> he meaneth J. <hi>Chriſt</hi>
faſtened to the Croſſe, and not the Sacrament, which
they call <hi>ſo</hi> at Rome. A Chriſtian might anſwer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
infidelity, That he is a <hi>Muſelman,</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a
<hi>Pagan,</hi> according as it ſtandeth moſt for his advantage,
and may take his <hi>oath</hi> on it, if need be. For (he 'l ſay)
I take theſe words in a ſenſe different from that wherein
they are ordinarily uſed; I mean that I am a <hi>Muſelman</hi>
that is, a <hi>Believer</hi> (as the word in Arabick ſignifies) of
J. Chriſt, and not of Mahomet; <hi>a Jew</hi> ſpirituall, not a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
one; <hi>a Pagan</hi> by extraction or birth, and not by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For why may it not be as lawfull to wreſt <hi>words?</hi>
if it be lawfull to uſe kneeling before the Hoſt of the
Romane Church, to ſignifie any thing elſe beſides ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Sacrament. Do you not perceive that there
is the ſame reaſon? Since in the uſe of the Church of
Rome it ſignifies, as clearly, properly, and univerſally,
this adoration, as the words of <hi>Muſelman,</hi> of <hi>Jew,</hi> of
<hi>Pagan,</hi> ſignifie the men of theſe three <hi>ſects</hi> in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
language? It will ſoon appear how dangerous a
thing this libertie is, if permitted among men. But is
it permitted? God forbid. The laws both of <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>men</hi> cenſure them as cheaters, treacherous, faithleſſe
perſons, who offer to practiſe it; and puniſh them as the
worſt <hi>Malefactours.</hi> As for men, who knoweth not
that their tribunals are for the moſt part ſet up to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
faithfulneſſe and honeſtie in <hi>words,</hi> and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative
ſignes of our intentions? If one after he have
given his promiſe to a Maid, That he will take her for
his <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> ſhould refuſing to marry her be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119957:60"/>
a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and there be ſo impudent as to plead, that
he meant onely to take her for his <hi>concubine;</hi> who
queſtioneth but that ſuch a man would be taken, not
onely for a treacherous perſon and a perjured, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for a <hi>mocker;</hi> and that he ſhould be puniſhed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his excuſe? And the <hi>ſubject,</hi> who ſhall
leave his <hi>Soveraignes</hi> colours, and ſhall do homage to
his enemy, and wear his marks and badges; ſhall he
be quitted for ſaying, That his <hi>heart</hi> was <hi>loyall</hi> all this
while, and that he did theſe things with another inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Shall he not nevertheleſſe be held for a Rebell
and (which is more) for a mocker, and a man that
hath <hi>a heart and a heart,</hi> as the Scriptures ſpeak; and
one, whom errour and paſſion hath tranſported into the
contrary partie, againſt his Liege-Lord? And if he fall
into the hands of the Princes Officers, will theſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
excuſes poſſibly preſerve him from infamy, and
that puniſhment which ſhameleſſe and rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
deſerve, or will he not rather fare the worſe for
them? Now if the juſtice of man, in ſtead of accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this kind of excuſes, is offended and incenſed by
thoſe, who have the boldneſſe to alledge them, how can
we hope that the juſtice of God (which is infinitely
more pure and more holy) ſhall take <hi>ſuch</hi> for payment,
when queſtion is made concerning Truth, and His
Service? I cannot believe that there is any man ſo
brutiſh as to imagine, that after he hath expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
<hi>That we muſt adore a creature,</hi> he ſhall be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
for ſaying, that by the word <hi>Creature</hi> he meaneth
<hi>the Creatour.</hi> There is no man that hath common ſenſe
but ſeeth, that this would be a pure illuſion; and that ſo
dull and groſſe, as I cannot think any man ſhould ever
dream of making uſe of it. Thoſe very men who are
partly of our perſwaſion, and yet think That a man may
with a good conſcience proſtrate himſelf before the Hoſt
of the Romane Church, will yet make ſcruple of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
with their mouthes, that they <hi>muſt adore</hi> it.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119957:61"/>
Now the nature and reaſon of words, and of actions,
and ceremonies, is the ſame (as we have proved.) Both
the one and the other are ſignes and ſymboles, inſtituted
to ſignifie our thoughts.</p>
            <p>Since then all Chriſtians agree that in <hi>Confeſſions</hi>
and declarations of <hi>Faith,</hi> which we make either by the
mouth or writing, 'tis not permitted them to uſe words
in any ſenſe, but that wherein they are taken in common
uſe; we muſt conclude, <hi>That it is not lawfull for us to
abuſe the ceremonies and actions of one Religion, to a
ſenſe contrary to what they ſignifie in the ordinary practiſe
of men.</hi> Whence it followeth, That, even as by the
confeſſion of thoſe, who are our Adverſaries in this
point, he will ſinne grievouſly, that believing the Hoſt
of the Romane Church to be a creature, ſhall ſay with
his mouth, <hi>That he muſt render to it the adoration of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi>
(in what ſenſe ſoever he pretend to take theſe
words;) ſo is it a very ſottiſh fault, for any to proſtrate
themſelves before the Hoſt, having the ſame belief as we
have, the ſame intention in ſo doing: Since by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they <hi>pronounce</hi> as much or more expreſly, then if

               <hi>Object.</hi> ANd whereas they object the famous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, who, after he
was converted to the knowledge of the <hi>LORD,</hi> was
wont to bow himſelf <hi>in the temple of the Idol,</hi> and when
the King his Maſter went to perform his devotions,
he accompanied him; and bowed himſelf, that the King
might lean upon him at his devotions.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer, I ſhall not mention the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of this paſſage, that ſeem to draw the
words 2 Kings v. 18. to another ſenſe, then what is
now preſented. Suppoſe (which is yet contended for)
that <hi>Naaman</hi> deſired leave of the <hi>Lord</hi> to enter into
Rimmons temple, and bow himſelf there; That the
King might uſe him to lean on. Suppoſe that <hi>Eliſha</hi> did
on <hi>Gods</hi> part grant him thus much; ſo That this his
bowing was no way contrary to his <hi>piety</hi> to God, or
<hi>charitie</hi> to his neighbour: all this granted will conclude
nothing againſt what hath hitherto been ſpoken. For
Naaman doth not ſimply entreat the Lord to let him
proſtrate himſelf in the Temple of Rimmon: in no
kind. That had been to entreat a thing clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbidden, which the <hi>Prophet</hi> would never have
granted. But he requeſts leave, to yeild the King that
ſervice, which he had done formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> to wait upon
Him, and let Him lean upon him (as 'tis the cuſtome
of Princes and great Perſonages, in ſtate, to lean upon
their ſervants or Favourites) and, That if his Maſter
ſhould require that ſervice of him in the Idol-temple, he
might give it him without offending God. This acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(if well conſidered) differs exceſſively from that
we now ſpeak of. For we treat of ſuch actions, as have
reference abſolutely and ſimply to the ſervice of that
<hi>object,</hi> which men pretend to <hi>adore:</hi> whereas <hi>this</hi> is
terminated directly and immediately in the ſervice of
an earthly King, and Maſter. <hi>Thoſe</hi> actions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
ſignifie nothing in common uſe, but the <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>divinitie</hi> of the objects, to which they are
publickly conſecrated: <hi>this</hi> on the contrary, ſignifies
principally and directly, Onely that <hi>Naaman</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the King to whom he gave his ſervice to be his
<hi>Leige-Lord</hi> and Maſter. And therefore, as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as there is between the <hi>adoration</hi> of a <hi>creature,</hi> and
the <hi>ſervice</hi> of a <hi>Maſter;</hi> ſo much there is there between
<hi>this</hi> action of Naaman, and <hi>thoſe</hi> which the Romaniſts
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119957:62"/>
pretend to be permitted them. God no where forbids a
ſervant to obey his Maſter, to lend him a hand to move,
or a ſhoulder to lean on; or to kneel, that a man may
be the more commodious and ſerviceable to him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Nay on the contrary, He commands us in his H.
Word to keep all the degrees and offices of civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
inviolably, and bids ſervants particularly beware of
abating ought of what obedience is due to their earthly
Maſters, under pretence of giving ſome to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.
But as for adoration of the creature, He very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
forbids it. Whence it appears, that though
one may lawfully uſe words and actions that teſtifie
the firſt kind of ſubmiſſion; yet it follows not, that he
may exerciſe ſuch as ſignifie the ſecond.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, that Naaman's doing this in the Temple
of Rimmon, might (by the circumſtance of place)
give ſome occaſion to another interpretation. For this
action which he did for the ſervice of his Prince, being
the ſame, <hi>re</hi> and <hi>mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rially</hi> (as we ſpeak) with the
bowing which Idolaters make in honour to their God,
and <hi>both</hi> hapning to be in the <hi>ſame</hi> place and time,
where and when infidels were adoring their Idol;
ſome of the ſtanders-by might think he addreſſed it, not
to the <hi>King</hi> leaning on him, but to the image of <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
there preſent. And this was it that raiſed the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in this great Perſonage. For though in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this act was onely a <hi>civil</hi> honour to the King,
and though in the cuſtome of the world 'twas ſo eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet, becauſe time and place concurred ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
for it, that it might have been otherwiſe taken; he
doubted, it was not ſo free from fault as he imagined,
and conſequently deſired <hi>Gods</hi> pardon, and leave to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his ſervice to his <hi>King.</hi> So it was this, which the
Prophet ſeemeth to grant him in thoſe words, <hi>Go in
peace:</hi> and their opinion, who imagine that <hi>Naaman</hi>
here ſerved an idol, is not built upon any rationall or
ſtrong foundation. For ſince the Prince leaned on him,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119957:62"/>
why have they not as much reaſon to think, That he
was there in relation to <hi>His</hi> ſervice, as to the ſervice of
the <hi>Idol.</hi> Nay, it was probable that this act terminated
in his Maſter and not in the idol, ſince neither <hi>reaſon</hi>
nor the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of men would permit him to part Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
acts between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>men.</hi> And this one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
(if nothing elſe could be ſaid) were enough
to ſhew that he then minded not the <hi>devotion</hi> of his ſoul,
but the <hi>ſervice</hi> of his Maſter: It being cleare, that
though he were a Pagan in religion, this <hi>Rimmon</hi> whom
the <hi>Syrians</hi> ſerved (ſuppoſe him endued with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or ſenſe, as he were an odd <hi>Deity</hi> elſe) would
not have allowed a ſervice done to a Prince, to bear
a ſhare in the <hi>adoration</hi> to him. As ſuppoſe a Noble
man rendring homage to his Soveraigne <hi>lean</hi> on one
of his ſervants who is <hi>kneeling,</hi> can you with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
interpret this act of the <hi>ſervant</hi> an homage done to
the Maſters <hi>Prince?</hi> 'Twere unreaſonable, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
to ſay or think ſo. And for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of <hi>my</hi> meaning, Suppoſe this ſervant were a
vaſſal, and held a farm of that Prince for which he
were yearly to doe him ſome <hi>homage;</hi> would you believe
he had performed that homage, by this very <hi>aſſiſting</hi> and
ſerving his Maſter upon ſuch an occaſion? No, ſurely.
'Tis evident, that theſe are acts (though alike, yet)
plainly diſtinguiſhed; one, whereby he cometh to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an honour that is <hi>due;</hi> the other, whereby he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bendeth his knees to aſſiſt his <hi>friend.</hi> Naaman's caſe
was juſt the ſame. The <hi>King</hi> of Syria gave religious
worſhip to the <hi>idol;</hi> but <hi>Naaman</hi> in holding him up
ſerved onely his <hi>Maſter;</hi> not the idol, his Maſter's falſe
and unbeſeeming <hi>deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſide this Circumſtance, divers others free this
act of his from all ſiniſter interpretation. For <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
               <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
entred into the idol-Temple onely when he was
obliged to perform ſome <hi>duty</hi> to his <hi>Maſter;</hi> he offered
no ſacrifices; he performed neither this nor any other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119957:63"/>
homage, or peice of devotion there <hi>alone.</hi> Whence it is
evident, that what he did otherwhiles in the Temple,
was to his Maſter and not to the idol. But <hi rend="sup">2</hi> There
is more in it yet: for he did not onely abſtain from all
falſe and unlawfull acts of worſhip; but he made more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
an open publick profeſſion, by word and deed, of
reverencing and adoring the <hi>true God,</hi> who was known
in Iſrael. He proteſteth as much, expreſly to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
ſaying, 2 Kings v. 15, 17. <hi>I know that there is no
God in all the earth, but in Iſrael. Thy ſervant will
henceforth offer neither burnt offering,</hi> nor <hi>ſacrifice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other Gods but unto the LORD.</hi> Who ſeeth not that
all the circumſtances of this action were ſo plain, ſo
farre from equivocation, that no man of any ingenuity
could take them in an ill ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for adoration to the
falſe God <hi>Rimmon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as in common diſcourſe, an honeſt man
<hi>may</hi> uſe words which ſignifie divers things (as in all
languages there are very many ſuch) provided, he uſe
them onely ſo, as it may plainly appear by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of his diſcourſe in what ſenſe he takes them,
without any deſigne to <hi>deceive</hi> his auditors with the
ambiguitie: ſo it was lawfull for Naaman to ſignifie
by this act the reſpect he bore to his Maſter, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the ambiguity which the place and time ſeemed
to caſt upon it; ſince all the circumſtances of this act,
and his life, and words, ſhewed plainly what he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it, <hi>viz.</hi> a plain ſerving his Maſter, no <hi>adoring</hi> the
Idol.</p>
            <p>And now who ſeeth not, what a vaſt difference there
is between this act of Naaman, and thoſe which we
diſpute againſt in this place? For <hi rend="sup">1</hi> the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who
bow their knees before the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> declare not what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they have of the object, to which they addreſſe
that worſhip, by any other outward profeſſion unleſſe
they ſay, 'Tis <hi>God.</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Naaman ſerved the <hi>God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
openly, and offered him ſacrifices; and highly and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119957:63"/>
plainly proteſted, that he took not Rimmon for his
God; at the <hi>adoration</hi> of whom, the ſervice that he owed
his Maſter, cauſed him to be ſometimes preſent. But
all who communicate with, or continue in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> make publick profeſſion of her doctrine; they
renounce not (in word, or deed) the <hi>adoration</hi> of that,
to which they proſtrate themſelves. Who then, unleſſe
he can divine, will interpret their bowing and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
otherwiſe, then as a teſtimony they give of the <hi>DEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY</hi>
of that object, wherein they terminate it?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, when they bend their knees before the
<hi>Hoſt,</hi> or deck up their houſes againſt it come, or paſſe
by them in the ſtreet; theſe actions cannot be taken
but for a profeſſion of their <hi>adoring</hi> this, and taking it
for a reall <hi>deity.</hi> For ſuch in the common and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſe of men have no other interpretation then this:
whereas Naaman's act (as we have proved) was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a duty, which he owed to his Maſter, and a token
of that ſervice, which he was to render to him. But as
for the men we ſpeak of, we ſee no <hi>Maſter</hi> they have to
lean upon them, nor to enter into their houſes when
they thus deck them; We ſee nothing in their Temples,
or at their Proceſſions, whereto we can imagine they
terminate theſe actions, but onely the <hi>Hoſt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all reaſon, they cannot be taken for ought but
teſtimonies of that honour, which they bear to <hi>it,</hi> and
of the <hi>Deity</hi> which they acknowledge to be in <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that <hi>Naamans</hi> act doth not a jot
excuſe theirs, but rather evidently condemn it. For ſince
he was ſo <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> of the deed (though ſo many waies
qualified, and free from the ſuſpicion of idolatry) that
he dared not venture on it, without <hi>Gods expreſſe leave,</hi>
what think you would he have done, if he had been in
the Romaniſts caſe? with what horrour would he have
refuſed and deteſted it, ſince here is nothing but naked
and plain demonſtrations of honour and ſervice to a
creature. All that may hence be concluded, is in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119957:64"/>
to favour thoſe, who ſerve Kings, to aſſiſt them
at the ceremonies of the Religion of their Maſter; if ſo
be their ſervice obligeth them to render any ſervice to
their perſons; ſo that the action which they exerciſe be
one of the functions of their charge, and that elſewhere
they make a cleare and open profeſſion of fearing the
Lord onely, &amp; that they acknowledge not that for God,
which is adored in ſuch devotions. Yet I know not
whether the difference that is between the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New
Teſtament</hi> will permit us to extend the conſequence of
this example thus farre; God having formerly in the
time of the Churches infancy permitted in his children
divers things, which he forbids them now under the
light of the Goſpel; where our charitie ſhould be ſo
exquiſite, that we ſhould rather endure all ſorts of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
then give the leaſt cauſe of ſcandall to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
and I believe, it were more ſafe to renounce
thoſe Dignities, which oblige us to any appearances
contrary to our Religion, then to cauſe any to ſtumble
by our enjoying and exerciſing them.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVI. That to think it is lawfull for a man to exerciſe
the ceremonies of a Religion, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth

glory of, and caſt a blur on, the Martyrs.</head>
            <p>BUt to this one example, which they without any
reaſon bring out of the Old Teſtament, we may
juſtly oppoſe the belief and perpetuall practiſe of the
Saints under the firſt and ſecond Covenant; who have
not more abhorred <hi>confeſſing</hi> with the mouth errours
contrary to pietie, then they have deteſted <hi>practiſing</hi>
(amongſt thoſe who teach them) any of thoſe actions
that have reference to ſuch errours. Holding as well
thoſe to be Apoſtates and deſerters of the Faith, who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119957:64"/>
defiled themſelves with ſome falſe and unlawfull ſervice,
as thoſe who expreſly and publickly profeſſed errour.
For example, Had not the <hi>three Hebrew children</hi> in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
<hi>Dan.</hi> iii. been of this perſwaſion, why ſhould
they have been willing to have incurred the indignation
of the King their Protectour, and to have been deprived
not onely of all their goods and honours, but likewiſe
caſt into a hot fiery furnace, there to endure a very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and horrible death; rather then to proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at his commandment before the golden image,
which he cauſed his people to adore? Had it not been
eaſie for them, to have kept themſelves from all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
by doing that which the King commanded, but
in another ſenſe; and with an intention different from
that, wherein he required it? <hi>viz.</hi> by referring and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
their adoration (whereof bowing or proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was the mark) not to the <hi>golden image</hi> before them,
but to <hi>God</hi> the Creatour? But this illuſion and catch
was ſo farre from prevailing with them, that they never
once thought of it; but with a brave generoſitie, befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that piety whereof they made profeſſion, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
boldly, at the firſt word, <hi>that they would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
themſelves before the ſtatue;</hi> thinking (which was
very true) That ſince that action which was required
of them, ſignified (in the cuſtome of that people) an
acknowledgement of a Godhead in the inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they could not practiſe it without idolatry, or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
hypocriſie; and conſequently without rendring
themſelves guilty of a very enormous ſinne againſt
<hi>God,</hi> and an irreparable ſcandal againſt their <hi>neighbours.</hi>
The ſame may I ſay, of all the excellent and famous
Perſonages, that have from the firſt dawning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie
to this houre, with ſo much courage and glorie
ſealed the truth with their bloud. For if a man might
be permitted to counterfeit in this manner, and without
deſerving puniſhment to exerciſe impious ſervices and
ſuperſtitious adorations, (provided that in the ſecret of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119957:65"/>
his heart, he referre and give thoſe very ſervices to
God the Creatour, which other men give to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
why ſhould thoſe holy and bleſſed Witneſſes of
God have expoſed themſelves to ſuch troubles and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?
Why ſhould they continually have made ſuch
ſcruple of caſting two or three grains of incenſe into the
Cenſer, in preſence of their Soveraigne <hi>Prince</hi> who
commanded them? Why might they not have done
this, with an intention of rendring this ſervice either to
<hi>God,</hi> or to the <hi>Prince</hi> there preſent (that he might ſmel
the ſweet odour) and not to the <hi>idol,</hi> as others intend
and perform it? If this petty quirk of Logick might
have made the action co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable (or at leaſt tolerable,
and excuſable) what an incredible ſtupidity was it in
thoſe great men, not to have uſed it? Who perceives
not that after the rate of our new Sophiſters, all the
Chriſtian courage of thoſe holy Perſonages, was but a
piece of ſillineſſe; all their conſtancy a ſottiſh and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
opinionativeneſſe and wilfulneſſe? For who would
not judge them either infinitely ſimple, as not knowing
or not thinking on ſo eaſie a ſubtilty; or extremely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent,
if knowing it they would not have uſed it at
ſuch a time; ſince for want of uſing it, they miſerably
loſt both their goods, and lives, and all that was deare
and precious to them upon earth? But if the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
be in the right, the Martyrs, beſide ſuffering,
ſhould have had a deal of crime and ſinfulneſſe in their
fault: For to loſe a mans life needleſly, and to ſpill ones
own bloud in a bravery, is an enormous offence againſt
<hi>God;</hi> who forbids us to violate or take away our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
life, much more our own; and deteſting thoſe
who procure another mans death, cannot but extremly
abominate them, who are the cauſe of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
But God forbid, that in ſtead of ſetting forth
the praiſes and the glory, which all Chriſtians have ever
given to theſe holy <hi>Martyrs,</hi> we ſhould be ſo ungratefull
and malicious, as to reproach their memory (by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119957:65"/>
them either of imprudence or injuſtice) meerly to
gratifie ſuch, as having not courage enough to confeſſe
openly what they believe privately in their hearts, would
(in ſtead of condemning their own weakneſſe) tax all
thoſe of <hi>raſhneſſe,</hi> who are not ſo fearfull as <hi>they.</hi> Let
us rather acknowledge, that theſe Saints (whoſe names
have ever been precious and bleſſed in the Church) have
well and rightly judged, thinking that none can with
leſſe then ſuch a reſolution, perform the duty of a good
and faithfull Chriſtian, nor otherwiſe avoid the infamy
and puniſhments which they deſerve, who deſert ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>FOr in truth, God will not be put off with ſuch
quaint devices, which are but meer pretences, and
colours, wherewith fleſh and bloud endeavour to ſmooth
over their fearfulneſſe. He deals with us <hi>bonâ fide,</hi>
plainly and in earneſt, and will not own them, who goe

artificiall excuſes, He ſurprizeth them in their pretended
ſubtilties: leaving them with thoſe, whoſe marks and
badges they have accepted of, contrary to the judgement
of their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>There was doubtleſſe among the Iſraelites of old, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the corruptions that <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Religion, great ſtore of perſons, who overcome with
their tyrannicall threats, did bow their knees to Baal
ſore <hi>againſt</hi> their wills; and in their hearts deteſted thoſe
idols, which through fear they were driven to <hi>adore:</hi>
ſome who comforted themſelves with a vain imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they might bow indeed to the Idol with their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119957:66"/>
bodies, but keep their ſouls for God, and ſo inwardly
addreſſing to Him all their veneration, they ſhould not
deſerve either the name or puniſhment of idolaters.
Notwithſtanding, the Lord not regarding this excuſe,
excludeth them from the number of His ſervants; count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none for His, but onely ſuch as <hi>had not bowed their
knees</hi> to Baal. <hi>I have left me,</hi> ſaith he, Rom. xi. 4. 1. Kings
xix. 18. <hi>ſeven thouſand in Iſrael, to wit, all the knees
which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which
hath not kiſſed him.</hi> And then who would not take the
reſt, who did fall before the images of Baal, or did kiſſe
them, or ſalute them, if not for idolaters or hypocrites,
yet for ſuch, in a word, as God rejected from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</p>
            <p>Long time before this, while the Iſraelites were yet in
the wilderneſſe, where they caſt <hi>a golden calf,</hi> we cannot
imagine they were ſo brutiſh, as to believe, That that
image which they then caſt, was truly and really the
<hi>God</hi> which brought them out of the land of Egypt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was in the world. All the circumſtances of the fact
induce us to ſay, That they took it onely for a viſible
ſymbol of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> which ſhould be to them in ſtead
of Moſes, who they thought was loſt: ſo that they ſhould
have addreſſed to God the honours, which they gave to
that image. But becauſe ſuch ſervices were now become
the ordinary mark of idolatry, over all the land of Egypt,
where they lived; God without having regard to that,
which they might have ſaid was in their intentions,
handleth them and puniſheth them, (Exod. xxxii.) as
being truly and indeed <hi>idolaters:</hi> for ſo they are called by
S. Paul, where he recordeth their fault, 1 Cor. x. 7.
And that divine Apoſtle in the ſame place, is ſo far from
permitting us, under any pretence whatſoever, to do any
of thoſe actions, whereby ſuperſtitious men uſe to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their devotion to that which they ſerve (as <hi>proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
before the ſubject which they adore) that he forbids
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (1 Cor. x. 19, 20, 21.) to eat the fleſh
of thoſe living creatures, which <hi>they knew to have been
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119957:66"/>
ſacrificed to idols;</hi> and this under perill of rendring
themſelves in ſo doing, <hi>partakers of devils,</hi> and of their
Altars, and of depriving themſelves of the Table of the
Lord, and of his Communion. Was it, becauſe the
Chriſtians who eat of ſuch meats, had in ſo doing an
intention to honour Demons or Idols? In no wiſe.
They eat ſimply of it, for the refection of their bodies, as
they would have eaten of other meats, if they had been
at hand. Yet becauſe the idolaters eſteemed them ſacred,
and ſanctified by the altars of their falſe Divinities; and
becauſe eating at their feaſts was an action, which in the
common uſe ſignified, that one had them in eſteem and
veneration; or at leaſt, that one did not think, That the
ſervice which they uſed was impure and <hi>unlawfull,</hi> the
H. Apoſtle would not ſuffer Believers to eat as idolaters
did. But you will ſay, I do it not to be ſanctified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
I will in this repaſt, addreſſe my thoughts, praiſes,
and bleſſings, not (as the infidels do) to <hi>Idols</hi> upon
altars, whereon they lay their viands; but to <hi>God,</hi> our

ſerved. And therefore, what can become of ſuch people,
unleſſe they prevent the day of the Lord by a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;

it denounceth againſt them elſewhere the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but gives them a name which agreeth to them ſo
<hi>properly,</hi> as they will not know how to diſavow it, Rev.
xxi. 8. <hi>As for the fearfull, and unbelieving, and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
and murtherers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers,
and idolaters, and all liars, their part ſhall be in the lake
which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond
death.</hi> I would fain have theſe people ſeriouſly conſider,
what theſe <hi>fearful</hi> be, that are here thrown into hel-dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
with the worſt and moſt abominable malefactors.
For if the word ſignifie not preciſely thoſe, who (leſt
they ſhould diſpleaſe the world) do outwardly conform
themſelves to ſervices and ceremonies, which in their
heart they acknowledge to be a pernicious errour; I
know not what other ſenſe this paſſage can beare. The
H. Ghoſt meaneth not thoſe, who in this world are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>fearfull.</hi> For He is not uſed to put valour and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
force, among the qualities that be neceſſary for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
the Kingdome of heaven: nor doth He mean
thoſe who follow errour, and ſerve creatures with a full
heart, believing and approving inwardly, what they doe
outwardly. For He is not wont to call them <hi>fearfull;</hi>
They are rather ſuch as He calleth a little after, <hi>idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
Nor doth he mean hypocrites, who under an open
profeſſion of vertue, hide a filthy and infamous life:
though to call them ſo, were as bad as to call them
<hi>fearfull.</hi> The name of liars, which followeth ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
agreeth to them a great deal better. Nor is there any
likelihood, that by <hi>fearfull</hi> he meaneth profane, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,
or open ſinners, and malefactors. For who ever
heard them ſet out by this name? And then who can
be meant by theſe curſed <hi>fearfull</hi> perſons, which are here
ranked in the forefront of all, that ſhall be inheritours
of hell fire; but thoſe, who overcome with ſome carnall
fear, do not confeſſe outwardly that holy truth which
they believe inwardly; or thoſe who confeſſe outwardly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119957:67"/>
ſome errour, which inwardly they misbelieve and deteſt?
Thus was it in the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of Chriſt not imprudence,
but a very excellent piece of wiſdome, That they choſe
rather to <hi>ſuffer</hi> the moſt cruell deaths and puniſhments,
than through fear to <hi>conceal</hi> that opinion, which they
had concerning piety and errour. It was in them not a
cruelty, but an act of ſweetneſſe in their loving devout
ſouls, rather to undergoe death, then to perform any of
the actions of <hi>Pagan</hi> ſuperſtition; ſince they had no other
way to avoid thoſe puniſhments, which are threatned
to <hi>fearfull</hi> men. And on the contrary, it will be ſound,
That there are none more ſottiſh, nor more cruell to
themſelves, then thoſe pretended Politicians, who to
preſerve (as they ſay) the peace of the world, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
themſelves from temporall puniſhments, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
betide open Believers, accommodate themſelves to
the ſervices of one, and avoid the freedome and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the other. For as it is prudence for a man, to
loſe a ſmall benefit, to preſerve a far greater; and that is
truly and indeed to love a mans ſelf, when he ſuffers a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſorrow (as a cut of a <hi>razour,</hi> or a Chirurgions <hi>lancet</hi>)
to keep himſelf from death: ſo it is the higheſt degree
of imprudence, for a man to looſe his <hi>Soveraigne good,</hi> to
preſerve one that is <hi>incomparably leſſe;</hi> the worſt of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

            <p>BUt to the end that no man may accuſe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God of too much rigour againſt fearfull
people, Let us briefly conſider the greatneſſe and the
weight of their fault. Firſt, they are evidently guilty of
a grievous and inexcuſable lie. For by their action they
make profeſſion of believing that, which they do not
believe in realitie. As for example, he, that through fear
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119957:68"/>
proſtrateth himſelf before the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the Church of
Rome, declareth highly and expreſly, that he taketh it
for a <hi>Deity,</hi> deſerving adoration: ſince in common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
that is the ſenſe of this action. And yet he telleth
us privately, that his heart believeth, it is not a Deity,
but an inſenſible and inanimate creature. Who diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not here a manifeſt contrarietie, between the mind

though all lying be unpleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> and unbecoming

who can deſcribe or imagine how highly deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is in <hi>Religion,</hi> the moſt important thing in the
world? how abominable in the moſt ſolemn and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
act of Religion, where the queſtion is concerning
rendring to a Deity that Soveraign ſervice, which we
owe him? Is it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pparently a reproach to the <hi>Divine
Majeſtie,</hi> who hath ſo expreſly proteſted that He hateth
nothing upon earth, neare ſo much as a lying ſoul? and
to the holy <hi>Angels,</hi> who are ſpectatours of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
and to <hi>Men</hi> our neighbours, that are aſſembled
with us? for Us, in the preſence of them all, to ſay
and impudently declare a thing, directly contrary to
what we think; to ſwear and proteſt, as it were with
the hand lifted up, that we take a thing to be our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and Redeemer, which in reality we eſteem to be
as farre below the nature of Him, as earth is below
heaven. The moſt deſperate knaves will ſeldome endure
to heare of their having ſworn falſly, that the Oxen of
<hi>another</hi> man belong to <hi>them;</hi> or they come to do it
with a ſoul full of remorſe, and a face covered with
confuſion. The reaſon is, becauſe the Authoritie of the
Judges, the dignity of the Aſſembly, the holineſſe of
the Place, the hand which they lift up, and the tongue
which they move, cometh into their mind; and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
chaſtizeth them for violating the truth. So deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath Nature imprinted in all mens hearts the hatred
and horrour of a lie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:119957:68"/>
Ye then, who before the face of heaven and earth,
before the eyes of God, Angels, and Men, have ſworn
againſt your conſcience not a ſlight buſineſſe, but the
moſt important; that concerneth not this preſent and
ſading life, but that other which is eternall; who have
ſworn, not with two or three words let ſlip between the
teeth, but highly and expreſly, with the geſture and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all your perſon; who have affirmed, and as it
were ſealed, this lie by the moſt authentick act that is
in the Religion of your Countreymen; how can you
have the face after ſuch a dreadfull perjury to look again
up to Heaven? How can your conſcience chooſe but
trouble you and avenge it ſelf, for the horrible outrage,
that you have committed on it, for your having ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
and wretchedly ſtifled its thoughts? If after
this, it do not prick and torment you night and day, I
know not how you can make appeare, that it is <hi>alive.</hi>
For beſides the enormitie of the lie, ſuch faults are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
contrary to the reſpect which we owe to God,
and extremely injurious to His Soveraigntie. For is it
not one of the greateſt crimes that a ſubject can poſſibly
be guilty of towards his Soveraign, openly to beſtow
upon another, beſide Him, the Name and Honour,
which is due to Him alone. I know the Romaniſt will
ſay, That his intention is far from doing it, but 'Tis
enough to make him faulty, either to have ſaid, or to
have done the leaſt thing like it: ſo holy and ſacred
is the Majeſtie of <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> that no man may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impietie violate or profane the reſpect, that is due
to Them, with any intention, under any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
Now, to give unto any thing, which you do not
believe to have a <hi>Divine</hi> nature, the ſervices which are
given to ſuch and under this notion, by thoſe among
whom we live; is clearly to teſtifie, that you give to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
beſides God, the honour which belongeth to him
alone. As, to bring in our example, for You to <hi>proſtrate</hi>
your ſelves before the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the Church of Rome, or
to go on <hi>Proceſſion</hi> after it, on the day of its Feaſt; is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119957:69"/>
to declare that you give it the name and adoration of a
<hi>Deity.</hi> I do not affirm that you really adore it. I preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that you know in your heart, that it is but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that your heart addreſſeth all its ſervice to
God onely. But becauſe you make this declaration with
your body, you witneſſe and make it appeare that you
hold this for your God. Do you not in your conſcience
take it to be an horrible crime to commit ſo grievous an
offenſe againſt our Soveraign <hi>Lord?</hi> And here tell not
me, I beſeech you, that you do not make ſuch a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in proſtrating your ſelf before the Hoſt. For I
have ſufficiently ſhown before, that this is the true
cleare and preciſe ſignification of that action, and others
like it: and he that will interpret them otherwiſe, muſt
overthrow the laws and communion of all civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Societies among men. And to partake of ſuch
actions againſt our conſciences, is not onely an offence
againſt God, but likewiſe a moſt cruell outrage and
ſcandall againſt our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>For firſt, one cannot abuſe a man, or mock him in a
ſerious buſineſſe, without deeply violating the holy and
reſpective charity, which we owe to a creature, that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the image of our Lord, and hath the ſame nature
that we are of. And I do not ſee, how one can more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
mock his <hi>neighbours,</hi> then by making ſhew of
adoring that which <hi>they</hi> ſerve, and approving <hi>their</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
as good and uſefull to ſalvation; and yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nothing leſſe, and in our conſciences to hold that
to be a mere creature which they adore; and the honour,
which they give it, to be an unlawfull ſervice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to the true God. What greater affront can men
poſſibly put upon them, than thus to abuſe and ſport
with them? queſtionleſſe did they diſcern through
the mask, under which we hide our ſelves, the thoughts
of our hearts, and the gullery that we put upon them,
when we preſent our ſelves to them in this falſe viſage;
they would extremely abhorre us for brazen faced Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeners.
Did we diſguiſe our ſelves thus for <hi>their</hi> good,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119957:69"/>
or did not our diſſembling doe them a miſchief, they
would have leſſe reaſon to complain. But 'tis quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
This our vain diſſimulation, and fond conceit is
a very great <hi>ſcandall</hi> to them; This masking and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing
our ſelves is to aſſaſſinate and deſtroy them. For
do you not by exerciſing the acts and ſervices of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi>
in their preſence, plainly embolden (or as S. Paul
phraſeth it, 1 Cor. viii. 10. <hi>edifie</hi>) them in it? Is not
this to recommend the ſame things to them by your
example, and effectually to preach to them the belief and
practiſe of them? For example, when you are proſtrate
before the Hoſt of the church of Rome, doth not your
action authorize their belief? do not you thereby war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
them to be more confident in it? You tell them in
a language that is dumbe indeed, but yet more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
cleare, and ſignificative, then all the words which
you can uſe in this ſubject, <hi>That this Hoſt is not at all a
creature; That it is the Creatour, and Redeemer of the
world; That we ſhould adore it, and give it the ſame
honour, which is due to the Soveraign Deity.</hi> This, and
ſuch language as this, doth your action ſpeak to your
Neighbours: nor can they otherwiſe read or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
what is the ſenſe and meaning of your heart.
Seeing then, that in your conſcience you firmly believe
that this <hi>Hoſt</hi> is but a plain creature; do you not ſee,
how you perſwade them <hi>to adore a creature,</hi> which is a
pernicious and dangerous errour, as I have ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove?
You lay before them that which you eſteem mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
poyſon, and ſeem to take of it your ſelf, that you
may make them confidently ſwallow it down; which is
the moſt hurtfull and deteſtable treachery in the world.</p>
            <p>Now if thoſe, who poyſon the <hi>bodies</hi> of men, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
reckoned amongſt the moſt abominable male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours;
conſider how great the horrour of your crime
is, who plunge not their bodies onely, but as much as
in you lyeth, their <hi>ſouls</hi> alſo, into that, which is in your
judgement, a dangerous and deadly poyſon. And if he,
who offendeth the <hi>leaſt</hi> of Believers, never ſo little, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119957:70"/>
a rigorous puniſhment, and one <hi>more grievous
then to be thrown alive into the bottome of the ſea</hi> (as our
<hi>Lord</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>Matt.</hi> xviii. 6.) what thunderbolts
and hells ſhall he be thought worthy of, who caſts ſo
enormous a ſcandall before <hi>all the congregation?</hi> And
if thoſe, who through errour miſtake a creature for a
Deity, are nevertheleſſe <hi>inexcuſable</hi> (as we have proved
before) what pardon can you expect, who, knowing
well that this is a creature, ceaſe not to proſtrate your
ſelves before it? For the <hi>Lord</hi> proteſteth that <hi>the ſervant
who knoweth his Maſters will and doth it not, ſhall be
beaten with more ſtripes, than he who doth it not becauſe
he knew it not;</hi> Luke 11. 47. And common reaſon
teacheth us, that it is a very equitable ſentence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, that the fault of thoſe, who outwardly
practiſe the ſervices which they hold in their conſciences
to be falſe and unlawfull, is ſo many wayes contrary
both to our piety toward God, and our charity toward
men; let none think it ſtrange, That our Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
<hi>them</hi> with an <hi>eternall</hi> curſe, who are ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
as to commit it. For ſhould He do otherwiſe,
He would forget his own nature, and rob Himſelf of
all thoſe properties, wherewith the H. Scriptures inveſt
Him. He would be no longer the Father of <hi>truth,</hi> if
He left a lie unpuniſhed. He would not be zealous of His
glory, if He did not avenge ſo evident an affront. Finally,
He would not be the Prince &amp; Protectour of mankind,
if He did not condemne thoſe to the greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
who do ſo inſolently and cruelly abuſe poor men.</p>
            <p>And now let every equitable perſon judge, whether it
be poſſible for Us, in any manner to proſtrate our ſelves
before the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the Church of Rome, to deck our
houſes againſt it paſſe by, and to do other the like acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
inſtituted to the honour of it, believing (as, thanks
be to God, we do) that it is a plain <hi>inanimate creature,</hi>
and not (as ſome pretend) our Soveraign <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God.</hi>
and whether we are not obliged by all the rules of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119957:70"/>
Chriſts Doctrine, rather to ſuffer moſt grievous extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
then to comply with what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
requireth of us in this particular. Indeed, if it were
lawfull to <hi>lie</hi> ſometimes, and outwardly to witneſſe any
thing <hi>contrary</hi> to what we believe in our hearts; or to
make profeſſion of taking from our Lord the glory due
to Him alone, to give it to a creature; or finally to abuſe
men, and induce them to be confirmed in a belief of
that, which we eſteem pernicious and deſtructive to their
ſouls; If, I ſay, it were at any time lawfull for us to doe
any of theſe things, for <hi>fear of ſeparating</hi> from our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen,
I confeſſe, that we ſhould doe amiſſe in refuſing
to perform the honour, which Rome commandeth us, to
her Sacrament. But if all Laws divine and humane for
the moſt part command us under pain of damnation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to fear undergoing all ſorts of miſchiefs, then to
fall into any one of theſe faults; 'tis evident that having
the belief which we have of the Euchariſt in the
Church of Rome, we cannot perform thoſe ſervices
thereto which they require of us, without incurring the
anger of God, and deſtruction of our own ſouls.</p>
            <p>So that if there were no other difference between
them and us, but this alone, it were enough to ſhew, that
we were not tranſported out of an humour, or froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or other ſmall cauſe; but forced by an extreme and
irreſiſtible neceſſitie to ſeparate our ſelves from them.
Whence it followeth, that in this caſe our <hi>ſeparation</hi> was
<hi>juſt;</hi> That which is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> being not to be blamed as
<hi>unjuſt.</hi>

doctrine and ſervices, do not depart from her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but accuſe us for ſo doing. For who doth not ſee,
that it is a neceſſary prudence, and not a vain ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to avoid that which men judge to be peſtilentiall and
<hi>mortall?</hi> and that on the other ſide, it is an unexecuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
careleſneſſe, to doe and exerciſe continually,
what men acknowledge to be contrary to the glory of
God, the edification of their neighbours, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their ſelves? If I may be permitted to addreſſe
my ſelf in this particular to thoſe, who are in ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an errour, I ſhall conjure them by their pietie to
God, by their charity to men, by the care which they
ſhould have continually of their own and others ſouls,
to think ſeriouſly of joyning themſelves hereafter, to
thoſe whoſe belief they hold, and quitting the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe whoſe Faith they diſapprove. And let them
not ſlatter themſelves to think, that the Church of
Rome retaineth the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> and the <hi>ſumme</hi> of
<hi>Chriſtian doctrine,</hi> ſince it is evident, That one at leaſt of
thoſe errours which they adde thereto are mortall. For
as thoſe good and wholeſome meats which a man eateth
at his refreſhment, hinder him not from dying, if by
and by he ſwallow ſome poyſon; ſemblably, true and
wholeſome doctrine doth not preſerve thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, if together with it they entertain ſome perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and damnable errour in other particulars. Evil
hath this advantage above good, that it ſpreads much
farther, and is farre more <hi>active.</hi> For neither truth nor
vertue can ſave a man, unleſſe they be pure and ſincere,
without the intermixture of any ill and dangerous ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite;
whereas errour and vice damne a man, be they
mingled with never ſo many truths and vertues. For as
a man though he be <hi>chaſte</hi> and <hi>modeſt,</hi> ſhall not inherit
the Kingdome of heaven, if he be <hi>covetous,</hi> or a <hi>ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi>
of his neighbour: ſo ſhall he not be exempted from
hell torments, for believing ſome principall truths of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119957:72"/>
the Goſpel; if it be found, that after all he hath adored
creatures, or made profeſſion of adoring them.</p>
            <p>But as for you, Sirs, who continue ſincerely in the
Church of Rome, verily believing all that ſhe teacheth
you, I ſhall beſeech you, That if you do reject our
belief, you would be pleaſed at leaſt not to condemne
our ſeparation, imputing that to us for a crime, which
inevitable neceſſitie hath forced us to doe. God knows
with what a deal of conſtraint we are come thus farre;
how troubleſome a thing it hath ſeemed to us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the duties and ſervices which we owe to them,
to whom we bear ſo much reſpect and love, our <hi>Princes,</hi>
our <hi>Fathers,</hi> our <hi>Friends,</hi> our <hi>Countreymen.</hi> But what
ſhall we doe, when we find our ſelves ſurprized with
neceſſity? Ye ſee that our conſciences torment us; that
they repreſent to us heaven and the eternity thereof, hel
and its puniſhments, and (which is more yet) the will
of God, our Soveraigne Father. This is not a toy, nor
can we pleaſe our ſelves in it. You have ſeen that our
belief doth neceſſarily bring along with it all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.
Shall we preferre yours before them? Shall
we violate the motions of our conſcience? Shall we
diſturb the peace thereof; and overthrow that which we
beleieve to be the law of our Soveraigne <hi>God,</hi> to pleaſe
you? Shall we venture willingly and knowingly, to
provoke His anger, to avoid yours? Shall we fear leſſe
to offend Him, then to diſpleaſe you? You your ſelves
(I know very well) will condemne ſuch a looſneſſe, and
in ſtead of approving it, will extremely abhorre it. For
ye know, and teach as well as we, both by word and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that we owe <hi>all</hi> to God, who looks upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of our conſciences. Be pleaſed then to bear with
us, if we preferre what we believe to be the intereſt of
His glory, before your deſires and our own; And in
other things (where your contentment will not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
His ſervice) we ſhall freely acknowledge, that we
owe you our <hi>whole utmoſt,</hi> &amp; are ready to teſtifie it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
&amp; therein to do your abſolute pleaſures, though it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119957:73"/>
be with the loſſe of what we count moſt precious on
earth; our bloud, our life it ſelf. Onely ſuffer us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
our conſciences to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or rather to <hi>Him,</hi>
whole and entire; over which no man can reign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affronting our <hi>God.</hi> And if you think that the
judgement, we make concerning theſe matters, is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
be pleaſed to take the pains candidly to ſhew us it.
We ſhall willingly examine your proofs, we ſhall bring
pliant minds, and as full of prejudice in your behalf as
you can wiſh: as perſons that have all the intereſts in
the world to perſwade us, to deſire to live in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
if it may be with the peace of our conſciences.
We honour as well as you the H. Scriptures, given and
preſerved to the Church by the Providence of God, to
be the laws and fountains of his Faith. Let us (we
pray) ſee you prove from thence the Articles, which
you preſſe ſo ſtrongly, or at leaſt the principles, whence
they may be clearly and lawfully deduced. If you ſhew
them us, and after ſuch a manifeſtation we continue
ſcrupulous; we then neither can nor will denie, but that
you will have juſt and good cauſe to eſteem us Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
But if you cannot, or do not, me thinks you ſhould
have no reaſon to refuſe what we requeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> To bear
with our ſeparation, and not hereafter to give it the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
name of ſchiſme, which agreeth onely to ſuch ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as are made by a pure and voluntary opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſſe,
grounded onely upon the peeviſhneſſe, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
envy, hatred, animoſitie, or the like paſſion of
ſuch, as depart from the Communion of a Church,
without a true and neceſſary reaſon.</p>
