            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And for that purpoſe they have prevailed, not onely to prohibit Our own Moneys to be paid to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, or to Our uſe, but, by the Name and Authoritie of Parliament, to excite Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to contribute their Aſſiſtance to them, by bringing in Moneys, Plate, or underwriting to furniſh and maintain Horſes, Horſmen, and Arms; And to that purpoſe certain Propoſitions or Orders (as they are ſtyled by them) have been Printed, whereby they have endeavoured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Power and Authoritie of Parliament (as if the two Houſes, without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, had that Power and Authoritie) to ſave harmleſſe, all thoſe that ſhall ſo contribute, from all Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Inconvenience that may befall them by occaſionthereof.</p>
            <p>And although we well hope that theſe Malignant perſons (whoſe Actions do now ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare their former Intentions) will be able to prevail with few of Our good people to contribute their Power or Aſſiſtance unto them; Yet, leſt any of Our Subjects (taking upon truſt what thoſe Men affirm) without weighing the grounds of it, or the danger to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, themſelves, and the Common-wealth, which would enſue thereupon, ſhould indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve (what theſe perſons would inſinuate, and have them to beleeve) That ſuch their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution and Aſſiſtance would tend to the preſervation of the publike Peace, and the Defence of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and both Houſes of Parliament, and that thereby they ſhould not incur any danger;</p>
            <p>We, that we might not be wanting (as much as in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s lieth) to foreſhew and to prevent the danger which may fall thereupon, Have hereby thought good to declare and publiſh unto all Our loving Subjects, That by the Laws of the Land, the power of raiſing of Forces or Arms, or leavying of war for the defence of the Kingdom, or otherwiſe, hath always belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s onely, and that by no Power of either, or both Houſes of Parliament, or otherwiſe, contrary to Our perſonall Commands, any Forces can be raiſed, or any war <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:160758:2"/>And therefore, by the Statute of the ſeventh yeer of Our famous Progenitour, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt, whereas there had been then ſome variances betwixt him and ſome great Lords of the Realm, and, upon Treaty thereupon, it was agreed, that in the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament after proviſion ſhould be made, That in all Parliaments, and all other Aſſemblies which ſhould be in the Kingdom for ever, that every man ſhould come without Force and Armour, well and peaceably: Yet at the next Parliament when they met together to take advice of this Buſineſſe (though it concerned the Parliament it ſelf) the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would not take it upon them, but anſwered, That it belonged to the King to defend Force of Armour, and all other Force againſt the Peace at all times when it pleaſed Him, and to puniſh them which ſhould do contrary, according to the Laws and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages of the Realm, and that they were bound to aid Him, as their Soveraign Lord, at all ſeaſons when need ſhould be. And accordingly in Parliament, in after times, the King alone did iſſue His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, prohibiting bearing of Arms by any perſon, in, or neer the Citie where the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was, excepting ſuch of the Kings Servants as He ſhould depute, or ſhould be deputed by His Commandment, and alſo excepting the Kings Miniſters. And by the Statute of <hi>Northampton,</hi> made in the ſecond yeer of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it is Enacted, That no man, of what condition ſoever he be (except the Kings Servants, in His preſence, and His Miniſters in executing the Kings Precepts, or of their Office, and ſuch as be in their company aſſiſting them) go, nor ride Armed by night or day in Fairs, Markets, nor in the preſence of the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or other Miniſters, nor in no part elſewhere.</p>
            <p>And this power of raiſing Forces to be ſolely in the King, is ſo known and inſeparable a right to the Crown, That when, in the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, there being a ſudden Rebellion, the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> without Warrant from the King, did raiſe Arms for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion thereof, and happily ſuppreſſed it, yet was he forced to obtain his Pardon. And whereas the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and other great Lords, in the eleventh yeer of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond (upon pretence of the good of the King and Kingdom, the King being then not of age, and led away, as they alleadged, by evil Counſellours) did raiſe Forces, and by them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered their Adverſaries. In that Parliament (ſuch as it was, for it was held and kept with Force, how good uſe ſoever hath been made of the Preſidents therein) they procured a ſpeciall Act of Pardon for their raiſing of Men, and that thoſe Aſſemblies ſhould not be drawn into example for the time to come.</p>
            <p>And as no man can leavie War, or raiſe Forces without the King, ſo much leſſe againſt the perſonall Commands of the King oppoſed thereunto: For, by the Statute of the 25. yeer of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third (which is but Declaratory of the old Law in that point) it is Treaſon to leavie war againſt the King in His Realm; within the conſtruction of which Statute, it is true (which was ſaid in the late Declaration, under the name of both Houſes of Parliament, of the 26. of May laſt) leavying War (in ſome ſenſe) againſt the Kings Authority (though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt His Perſon) is leavying war againſt the King: And therefore the raiſing of Forces, though upon pretence of removing of ſome evil Counſellors from about the Queen, hath been adjudged Treaſon, in the Caſe of the late Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and in divers other Caſes. (And we wiſh all Our Subjects to conſider, Whether, if men ſhall be raiſed contrary to Our Proclamation and againſt Our Will, it be not againſt Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.) But it is as true (and was never denied, but in that Declaration) That the raiſing of Forces againſt the Kings perſonall Command (being no Ideot, nor Infant, uncapable of underſtanding to Command) being accompanied with His preſence, is, and is moſt properly leavying of War againſt the King; For if it be a ſufficient pretence for raiſing of Men againſt the Kings perſon, that it is for the defence of the Kings Authority, and of His Kingdom (though againſt His expreſſe Command and Proclamation) the Iriſh Rebels will have colour for their horrid Rebellion; For they ſay (though it be notoriouſly falſe) It is for the defence of the Kings Authority, and of His Kingdom; And <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> and <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> and <hi>Kett</hi> the Tanner want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not publike Pretences, which were perhaps juſt cauſes of Complaints, though not of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Men.</p>
            <p>And though theſe perſons have gone about ſubtilly to diſtinguiſh betwixt Our Perſon and Our Authority, as if, Becauſe Our Authority may be where Our Perſon is not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Our Perſon may be where Our Authority is not; We require all Our good Subjects to take notice of the Law (which is in Print and full Force) <note place="margin">Cook 7. Rep. Calvins caſe.</note> That their Allegiance is due unto the naturall Perſon of their Prince, and not to His Crown or Kingdom diſtinct from His naturall Capacitie. And that by the Oath of Ligeance at the Common Law (which all perſons above the age of twelve yeers are, or ought to be ſworn unto) they are bound to
<pb facs="tcp:160758:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be true and faithfull, not to the King onely as King, but to Our Perſon as King <hi>CHARLES</hi>; and to bear <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s truth and faith of Life and Member, and earthly Honour; and that they ſhall neither know nor hear of any ill or damage intended to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s that they ſhall not defend. And that when, in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> being diſcontented with the King, cauſed a Bill to be written, wherein was contained amongſt other things, That Homage and the Oath of Allegiance was more by reaſon of the Kings Crown (that is, His Kingdom) then of His Perſon; and that ſeeing the King cannot be reformed by ſuit of Law, if the King will not redreſſe and put away that which is ill for the Common People, and hurtfull to the Crown That the thing ought to be put away by force, and that His Leiges be bound to Govern in aid of Him, and in default of Him; he was condemned for it by two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and perpetually vaniſhed the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We have made mention of theſe caſes, not ſo much to cleer Our Right, That We alone have the power of raiſing Forces, and none of Our Subjects, either in Parliament or out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Our Will, or perſonall Command (which We think no man that hath the leaſt knowledge in Our Laws, and is not led away by private Intereſts, and may ſpeak his minde freely, will deny; nor was ever queſtioned in any Parliament before this time) as to let them ſee how dangerous the effect and conſequence of raiſing of Forces, without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, may be unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and to the Common-wealth, uuder pretence of Defence of both.</p>
            <p>And though We cannot doubt of the affections of Our good Subjects, conſidering their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is involved with Ours, and how precious the peace of the Kingdom is, and ought to be unto them; and that according to the words of the Statute of the eleventh yeer of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and the eighteenth Chapter, By the duty of their Allegiance they are bounden to ſerve and aſſiſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s at all ſeaſons when need ſhall require.</p>
            <p>Yet, to the end that Our good Subjects may know what their duty is, and what We expect from them, and that all others, who, through Malice or private Intereſts, ſhall be tranſported beyond their duties, may be left without excuſe; we do therefore by this Our Proclamation charge and command all Our Subjects uopn their Allegiance, and as they tender Our Honour and Safety, and the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom, that they preſume not to raiſe or leavie any Horſes, Horſmen, or Arms, or any Forces whatſoever, by colour of any Authority whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without Our expreſſe pleaſure ſignified under Our great Seal, (other then ſuch as ſhall be raiſed, leavied and impreſted by the Order, as well of Our Self, as of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to an Act made this Seſſions, intituled, <hi>An Act for the better raiſing and leavying of Souldiers for the preſent defence of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland</hi> (by Iuſtices of Peace, and otherwiſe, in ſuch manner as is preſcribed in the ſaid Act) or Contribute, or give any Aſſiſtance in Money, Plate, finding of Horſes, horſmen, or Arms, or any other wayes, to or for any ſuch Preparation, Levie, or Forces: And that ſuch of Our good Subjects, who through Ignorance have been miſ-led to conſent or ſubſcribe to any ſuch Leavie, Contribution, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, forthwith, upon publication of this Our Proclamation, deſiſt from continuing ſuch their Contribution or Aſſiſtance, or giving any Countenance to any ſuch Leavies, at their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perils.</p>
