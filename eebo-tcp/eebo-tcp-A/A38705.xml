            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his Diſcours, which a ſenſe of God's goodneſs Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically forced him unto, and from thoſe uſeful Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to conclude a tru and comfortable Propoſition; <hi>Truly God is good unto Iſrael, even unto ſuch as are of</hi>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> II. <hi>The ſenſe and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the words.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>a Clean Heart.</hi> The words are a kind of abrupt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, whereby the Prophet by a <hi>Paralepſis</hi> (which is very uſual in Holy Scripture) ſuppreſſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts of the Fleſh and Spirit, and ſuddenly recovering himſelf from thoſe difficulties he lay under, propounds this concluſion, and affirms, that how ſorely ſoever the Calamities of this World preſs God's People, yet his Goodneſs is always preſent with them for their Comfort, Help and Aſſiſtanc. So then the general meaning and import of theſe words ſeems to be this; that it is a certain and infallible Truth, that God is not only Juſt and Faithful, but Gracious and Kind unto every tru, ſincere-hearted, upright Man; For <hi>truly God is good unto Iſrael, even unto ſuch as are of a Clean Heart.</hi> Which words contain in them theſe three Parts. (1. A general Propoſition; <hi>Truly God is good:</hi> Where we have <hi>Elohim,</hi> the Almighty God mentioned with his Activ, Relativ Goodneſs. (2.) An Object, and a Qualification; in reſpect of God an Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reſpect of as a Qualification. (1.) Then in reſpect of God an Object; and ſo it is indefinitely expreſſed by the word <hi>Iſrael, God is good unto Iſrael.</hi> (2.) A Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in reſpect of Us, and under that an Aſſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conditions under which the general Propoſition holds good all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael; ſo all are not Chriſtians, that are called Chriſtians, but it is ſuch, and ſuch only as are of a Clean Heart: And in this we have (1.) A Quality appropriate to the Church, and unto every particular member thereof, Cleanneſs; Purity, or Holineſs. (2.) With its Subject, the Heart; and there we ſhall enquire. (1.) Why that alone, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51963:4"/>
nothing els is expreſſed. (2.) Whether that alone be enough, and ſufficient. (3.) We ſhall conſider them both together in both ſenſes of the Word as a ſincere, and as an undefiled Heart. In each of which I ſhall, as I proceed, view all the ſeveral guilts oppoſed to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notion of cleanneſs, and ſee how far each one of them, or all put together remove us from any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Lord's goodneſs, which is the natural appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of each Part. (3.) Here is a pathetical Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration, <hi>Truly;</hi> which ſignifies the truth and certainty of the thing ſpoken of, recommending the belief of it to others. Theſe are the ſeveral Parts of the Text; of theſe in their Order: I have formerly Preached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Text in this place, and then ſpoke to the firſt general Head, which I will not now make any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon, leſt I ſhould be hindred in what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deliver at this time: Come we therefore unto the next general Part of my Text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An Object and a Qualification; in reſpect<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> III. <hi>The</hi> 2d. <hi>general, 1. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, an Object.</hi>
               </note> of God an Object, in reſpect of Us a Qualification.</p>
            <p>Firſt then in reſpect of God an Object, and ſo it is indefinitely expreſſed by the Word <hi>Iſrael, God is good to Iſrael;</hi> So then the Object of God's Relativ Goodneſs is Iſrael; (1.) Then the word <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſignifies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, or one that as a Prince prevails with God, and thus the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> is called, and this Name was given him by God, as a Title of Honor and Dignity, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXXII. 28. <hi>And he ſaid thy Name ſhall be called no more</hi> Jacob <hi>but</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for as a Prince haſt thou power with God, and with Man, and haſt prevailed.</hi> (2.) The word <hi>Iſrael</hi> is taken for all the Poſterity of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> to which ſignification thoſe Phraſes of the Holy Scripture in the New Teſtament which occur concerning Iſrael are to be referred, for altho they ſeem to refer to the Jews rather then to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51963:4"/>
of the Ten Tribes, yet notwithſtanding in Holy Scripture they are not improperly referred to both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon their Tranſportation from <hi>Babylon,</hi> many Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites of the Ten Tribes were commixed with the Jews, and the Twelve Tribes of Iſrael, to whom our bleſſed Saviour was ſent, are underſtood in this ſenſe by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. And likewiſe the whole People of God is made up of the Iſrael, or Poſterity of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Nation that believed in the Meſſiah then exhibited. (3.) The word is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for the adoption or aſſumption of any Nation taken in to be God's peculiar People, or for ſuch as have entred into a Stipulation, or Covenant with God, and choſen him to be their God, and He accepted them for his People; and in this ſenſe the tru Iſrael have ſeveral Titles in Holy Scripture, for they are called the deſire of Gods Soul, the Houſe of God, the Elect of God, (or the choſen Nation) the People of God's Inheritanc, the People of God (the People of the God<note place="margin">

Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael repreſents a Nation, it being at that time a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51963:5"/>
and potent one, when this Pſalm was penned. (2.) Iſrael was a viſible Church under the Law, ſhadowing forth a viſible Church under the Goſpel. (3.) Iſrael ſignifies a choſen peculiar People, and ſo it repreſents the inviſible Church of God; in all theſe ſenſes then, we may ſee that in the general, by Iſrael is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Church of Chriſt; and now I ſhall declare God's goodneſs unto Iſrael in each of theſe Notions, and make appear the truth of this Aſſertion in our Text, that <hi>Truly God is good unto Iſrael.</hi>

I will not ſo far diſtruſt your memories, as to make a large repetition of what I then ſaid, but give me leave to mention the heads of my diſcours, that I may the more methodically introduce my ſelf to what remains behind; that this truth then may the more plainly appear, I deſired your attention to theſe four ſubſequent Propoſitions. (1.) That which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the neceſſary ſubſiſtence of every: Nation is dealt forth unto them by God; General Acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnc none are excluded from, for the evil as well as the good are warmed by the kindly rays of the greater Luminary, and the influences of Heaven's ſhowers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon the unjuſt as well as the juſt. That which is<note place="margin">St. Matth. v. 45.</note> neceſſary needs not much toyl, being dealt forth by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51963:5"/>
God ſo liberally, as Man ſcarce needs do any thing more then receiv: <hi>Deus &amp; Natura non deficiunt in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariis;</hi> Every Nation may ſubſiſt by it ſelf without the greedy Invaſion of anothers Right. (2.) God dealeth forth unto all People, that which may conduce unto their Well-being, by which we may underſtand three things. (1.) Well-being may be taken for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affluenc, and external Proſperity, Plenty, and Peace. (2.) As Well-being may be taken for outward Proſperity, Plenty, and Peace; ſo likewiſe for Internal Security, Satisfaction, and Quiet, I mean for Peace of Conſcienc; and then there is the Law of Nature, and Reaſon, which Men may live by, and by ordering their Converſations according thereunto they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Happineſs, and Advantage of an excuſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienc,<note place="margin">Rom. II. 14, 15.</note> which is the only thing that converts our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comforts into Bleſſings to us. (3.) Well-being may be accepted in the moſt proper ſenſe for God's Goodneſs, and we may find that excludes not all means from any People of coming unto his Knowledg; and this ſenſe comes neareſt to that of our Text, and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and makes good the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Aſſertion: <hi>Truly God is good unto</hi> Iſrael. (3.) Another Concluſion that proves God's Relativ Goodneſs is communicated to all People, is, the great and extraordinary Acts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc, wherewith Men (as ſuch) have been viſited. (4.) The laſt Concluſion is an unqueſtionable Proof of the Divine Goodneſs. And that is this, That God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſpeoples, and deſolates any Land or Nation, but for their Iniquity, their Notorious Unthankfulneſs, and their Contemptuous Abuſe of his Mercies. From all which Concluſions it may be truly Inferred, That God's Activ, Relativ Goodneſs liberally flows down upon all People, all the Nations of the Earth (in ſome meaſure) plentifully partaking of this his Divine, Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiv

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a Nation, and a flouriſhing, and potent One, and as ſuch eminently taſted of God's Goodneſs, ſo likewiſe, it was a viſible Church under the Law ſhadowing forth a viſible Church under the Goſpel. From whence this Propoſition may be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inferred, and concluded; That every viſible Church, and Company of Chriſtians do very eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taſt of the Favour and Goodneſs of God. This may be apparent, and evident enough, if we conſider, (1.) That thoſe gracious Acts of God's Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs formerly recited, which all, and every People did communicate in as to their Being, and well-being, do all appertain unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> as the viſible Church. (2.) Moreover ſuperadd to this, the Viſible Church taſts of God's eminent Loving-kindneſs in a Bleſſed Covenant of Peace, that which God entred into with obedient <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Elect Poſterity, is every where recorded as a ſignal expreſſion of God's kindneſs. <hi>Moſes</hi> challenges any People to lay a claim to the like ſigns and tokens of God's Favor, and Goodneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> IV. 7, 8. <hi>For what Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things, that we call upon him and for; what Nation is there ſo great that hath Statutes, and Judgments, ſo Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as all this Law, which I ſet before you this day?</hi> And by this Priviledg they gained the Character of a great Nation, a Wiſe, and underſtanding People: The<note place="margin">Deut. IV. 6.</note> Royal Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and the reſt of the Inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> recite it as the Grand Sign, and Characteriſtick token of God's Love to his People: Thus Chriſt's viſible Church are within the encloſure of this Holy Sept, and all of that Company this Covenant of Peace hath a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes a great Differenc be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in the darker condition of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51963:6"/>
and the State within the Church, as being (before that merciful Reception) <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Fleſh, who are called Uncircumciſion by that which is called Circumciſion in the Fleſh made with hands, who were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the World. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, who were ſometimes afar off, but now in Chriſt<note place="margin">Eph. II. 11, 12. 13.</note> Jeſus are made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt. But now God's Loving-kindneſs will be evident to us in a great, and excellent Luſtre, as a merciful Shine upon his Church, and People, if we conſider theſe four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. (1.) The Mandates which God honors his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church withal in the Covenant, do plentifully ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify to us his Loving-kindneſs. Tho there be too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who take a View of God's Precepts with a Sullen, Partial, and Prejudiced look, as Bridles, and Checks put upon their Appetite, who receiv them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon their Necks as a hard Yoke, and upon their Backs as an heavy Burthen, yet theſe are too dull, and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reflections; For our bleſſed Lord aſcertains us the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Matth. XI. 30.</note> quite contrary, telling us, that his Yoke is eaſie, and his Burthen light, and this Truth is owned, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his Beloved Diſciple, that lay in his Maſter's Boſom, and therefore we may upon good ground ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe beſt acquainted with his Mind, St. <hi>John</hi> I mean, who affirms, That none of his Commandments are grievous, tho it be moſt tru, that whatever Precept proceeds from God carrys with it an Obligation upon<note place="margin">1 Joh. V. 3.</note> the Creature, and he (to whomſoever it comes) is in duty bound to Obedienc, yet we may remember, that ſometimes God's Precepts, and the Revelation of his Mind to us carrys with them, that Honor, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which brings peculiar Advantage, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I will not diſpute whether the Soveraign Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51963:7"/>
may not <hi>pro Imperio,</hi> in the right of his Soveraignty bind his Creature to a Duty, whence no other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſhall ariſe, but only the very Duty of Obedienc, as he might, and did engage <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son, his only Son, his Beloved Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom all the Nations of the Earth were to be Bleſſed, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other Recompenc, to look for no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, but the Reward of doing the Duty it ſelf, and that was his Obedienc; yet I conceiv God's ſetled Inſtitutions, and eſtabliſhed Appointments do not only engage to Service, but propound Advantage; and thereby allure to Obedienc. <hi>Deut.</hi> X. 12. 13. <hi>And now O</hi> Iſrael <hi>what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God; to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, to keep the Commandments of the Lord, and his Statutes, which I command thee this day for thy Good:</hi> Thus in our Civil Relations, tho our Duty engages us to Obedienc to our Prince from a Principle of Conſcienc, and out of repect to God's Law, yet we frequently look upon it as a great Honor, and high Priviledg to be employed in his immediat Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This is the apparent Differenc between the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Dictates of the Law of Nature given to all; and thoſe which are dealt forth unto the Church: Thoſe come with an Abſolute Intimation of a neceſſary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement from a Supream and Severe Legiſlator; Theſe with more Intimations of unqueſtionable Honor and Priviledg to be ſo enjoyned. Now hereupon (1.) We may take notice of the manner of Delivery; the Law of Nature, or the Moral Commands were pronounced to <hi>Iſrael</hi> with Thunders, and Lightning, attended with an aſtoniſhing Darkneſs, and the ſound of a Trumpet, ſtriking all thoſe that approached the Mount with a Terror, and a fearful Amazement, penned in an auſtere, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51963:7"/>
commanding Style, Thou ſhalt, and Thou ſhalt not, whereas God ſpeaks unto his People under the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Diſpenſation in a more facil, and familiar way, which it may be worth our while a little to animadvert upon. (1.) In a ſerious Exhortation, or a paſſionate Entreaty, we beſeech, we pray as in, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Cor. v. 20. 21. Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as tho God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead to be reconciled to God, for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Or els (2.)

When a King expreſſes that in a Deſire, which he may do in a Command; it is meritoriouſly accounted as a great Favor, and if the King of Kings ſtoops ſo low, as to declare his Mind in the ſame precarious way, it may deſervedly challeng from us the greateſt Reverenc, and oblige us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51963:8"/>
Obedienc both as an Advancement, and as a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. (2.) If we conſider the ſubſtanc of theſe Precepts, we may find that they carry Glory enough in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dienc. Loyalty frequently accounts, that ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices (tho perchance hazardous Enterprizes) do merit thanks for being employed in them; yet ſome Precepts there are which God will diſdain ſome Mens perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manc of; There is a wicked Generation to whom God ſpeaks in the Language of the <hi>Pſalmiſt: Pſal.</hi> L. 16, 17. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant in thy Mouth; ſeeing thou hateſt Inſtruction, and caſteſt my Words behind thee?</hi> As the dealing forth of Laws to <hi>Iſrael</hi> is owned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as a great, and excellent Priviledg; ſo the gracious Revelation of Chriſt's myſterious Goſpel in a greater Luſtre out-ſhines all before it; conveying a Beauty to the very feet of thoſe that are Bearers of ſuch happy News. <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains are the feet of them that bring good tidings, that preach</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. X. 15. <hi>compared with</hi> Iſa. LII. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the Goſpel of Peace, that bring glad tidings of good things, that publiſh Salvation, that ſay unto</hi> Zion <hi>thy God reigneth.</hi> Thoſe Cordial Obſervations, thoſe Loving Invitations, and thoſe Commands that reſpect nothing more then our Benefit, are all but ſo many proofs of God's Goodneſs, and our Honor, nay, even our ſevereſt Afflictions in ſo Righteous a Cauſe, but a glorious Piece of Priviledg, and Triumph. St. <hi>Paul</hi> accounts it a Bleſſed Gift from God, and ſuch as with Holy <hi>Job</hi> we ought to thank God for. <hi>Phil.</hi> I. 29. <hi>For</hi>

with the reſt of the Apoſtles glory in their ſtripes, and triumph in being counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his<note place="margin">Act. V. 41.</note> Name. (2.) Thus as the Precepts of God's Covenant, ſo the great, and excellent Promiſes of it do moſt eminently declare God's Goodneſs to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his viſible Church. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a Relianc of God's Promiſe to be their God need not fear any Enemy, and Chriſt's Church is heartned on by exceeding great, and precious Promiſes, that by thoſe they may become partakers <gap reason="foreign">

(3.) God's Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his viſible Church, is further apparent, in that they have a conditional Right to the valuable Rarities, and Excellencies of the Goſpel, all being theirs, if they perform the Condition, all the Promiſes of Chriſt are in him, Yea, and Amen to them, ratified, and verified, Chriſt being theirs, who is all in all for the good of his People. Forgiveneſs of ſins is theirs, if they ſincerely, and heartily Beleiv, and ſo likewiſe is Salvation too, if they truly, and really Repent. (4 and Laſtly.) God's Goodneſs is eminent to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his viſible Church, in his gracious Proviſion of Means ſufficient for the Performanc of the Condition of the Covenant on their Parts, which gives them a Right and Title to the Promiſes. The Spiritual Armour is impenetrable, and the Weapons of this noble Warfare not to be blunted by Oppoſition. The Devil may ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be uncaſed, and this ſtrong Man diſpoſſeſt of his Tenure, by right handling theſe Powerful Inſtruments. Here is a glorious Diſpenſation of Light to direct, and of Grace to enable; and the Covenant is not only a bare Manifeſtation of God's Laws, but alſo a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

For which we have only this Proof to add, that God hath been ſo plentiful in the expreſſions of his Bounty, that we are weary of the mention of them; and have ſo ſurfeited on Divine Goodneſs, that we nauſeate the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.

I muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go much further out of a du regard to the limits, and proportions of time allowed me; and if I ſhould now enlarge concerning our Princes Sufferings, and Deliverances; poſſibly ſome will tell me, that they know the conſiderable Paſſages of his Life as well as my ſelf (they having been tranſacted within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of moſt of your Memories:) Indeed I may truly ſay, That our Prince hath been the Darling of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and poſſibly the greateſt Inſtanc of its Protection ſince the Reign of that King, who was a Man after God's own Heart. And I am enclined to believ that when Poſterity ſhall record the Tranſactions of his Reign, they will either ſuppoſe them the Ingenious fancies of a Romanc, or believ him to have been one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51963:11"/>
whom the Providence of Heaven hath culled out of the vaſt Race of Reaſonable Beings, to be an Example of what Wonders the Almighty Potentate is able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover for thoſe that depend upon him, and to ſignifie how ſolicitous the Great Governour of the Univers is for the ſafety, and ſecurity of thoſe Kings to whom his Goſpel, and tru Worſhip are as valuable as their Scepters. Theſe kindneſſes of Heaven have been of late manifeſted in the Diſcovery of a Rebellion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by ſuch Perſons, whom no Engagements, no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, no Acts of Clemency, no Indulgencies, no Vows, no Praetexts of Reformation could diſengage from the moſt miſchievous Attempts upon His Perſon, upon His Subjects, and upon every thing that can be believed eſtimable by the ſincere Worſhippers of the Peaceable, and moſt Holy Jeſus; And therefore the Higheſt Thankfulneſs ought to be expreſſed both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of our regard unto him, and to our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves likewiſe (if that Intereſt be Dearer to us:) All our higheſt concernments are centred in Him, and next unto the kindneſs of Heaven are indebted to Him for their Settlement, and Duration; And His, and our Adverſaries ſo believed, becauſe they would miſchief us by His Ruine. O what ground therefore have we to be as Grateful unto Heaven for this Mercy, as if in our own Perſons we had been to be Executed, and to have been the Marks at which their Blunderbuſſes, &amp; Piſtols were to have been aimed, and levelled. I will now conclude this Diſcourſe, and this Time with One Interceſſion unto Heaven, in which I hope you will all joyn with me: [That all Rebellious Spirits, like <hi>Sheba,</hi> that ſhall enkindle (I hope I may ſay) the dead Aſhes of Rebellion, may have his End, and forfeit their Lives that will Adventure ſo much as to entertain Rebellious thoughts againſt the Anointed of the Lord.]</q>

VIII.</hi> An Account of what was ſaid upon <hi>Sept.</hi> 9th. being the Day of Publick and Solemn Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving when the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was again read.</note> my Text, as I have now handled it, nor unſeaſonable (becauſe our Duty.) upon this Publique, and Solemn Day of Thankſgiving, to ſay ſomewhat of the Great Deliverance of our Gracious Soveraign, and in Him of this Kingdom too (We being the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, not only as that Word repreſenteth a Nation, but alſo as it ſignifieth a Viſible Church under the Goſpel, being as pure, and defaecate a Church as to its Doctrine, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as any in the known World, and pray we God that it may long to ſucceeding Generations continue ſo to be, and that He would preſerv Her, ſo to remain againſt thoſe malicious Enemies, that have of late wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly deſigned to deface Her Beauty, and deſtroy Her Purity. All Rebels uſe Religion as a Plea for Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and none pretend more to keep up the Face, and Notion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a Viſible Church, then they. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Higheſt, and Deareſt Concernment in this World, but it ſeems a deſtructiv Method for Men to ſecure their Salvation by ſuch a Way, as God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will damn their Souls, and ſuch is the Way of Reſiſtanc, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIII. 2. <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinanc of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receiv unto Themſelvs Damnation.</hi> No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons take up Arms in Defenc of Religion, that have any ſenſe of it upon their Spirits. Religion is a meek, humble, modeſt Principle, and ſubmiſſiv unto Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It inſtructs, and prepares Men to dy, rather then to reſiſt Lawful Authority; And were there any unmixt Zeal for Religion in this Plea, can we believ the moſt Debauched wicked Perſons, ſhould be ſo much concerned for Religion; but it's clear, and evident, it is not in truth Religion ſuch Perſons are ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for, but a Toleration of all Religions. That is, That they may profeſs any, or indeed like ſome Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferents
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51963:12"/>
in <hi>France,</hi> or ſome Hobbiſts in <hi>England</hi> rather, have no ſenſe of Religion at all, which anſwers the Purpoſe of the Atheiſt that denyeth a God, as much as of our Diſſenters, &amp; Separatiſts, which is not at all for the Credit, Glory, and Reputation of that Religion, which hath any thing of Sincerity or Truth in it (even of the Truth as it is in Jeſus.) So that whatſoever the Pleas, and Excuſes of ſuch Men are, it is a proud, imperious, unpeaceable, and implacable Temper, which diſorders publique Settlements, and throws from the heads the Crowns, and caſts out of the hands the Scepters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and Governors. After this Introduction give me leav to offer ſome few Inferences for Practice, which may have a reſpect unto that Dangerous, and Damnable Plot, whoſe Diſcovery we do, and are upon this Day Solemnly, and thankfully to Commemorate, and Remember. (1.) Conſider how hazardous, and deſtructiv the Diverſities, and Differences of Opinions in Religion are unto the Truth of that Doctrine, which I have now handled from this of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and this Nation being a Viſible Church, and how diſadvantageous, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, and Perillous ſuch Opinions, and Practices, are unto the Publique Tranquillity, Safety, and Intereſt of this Kingdom. Chriſtianity is the ſtrongeſt Defenc, and ſecureſt Fulciment of Monarchy both in its Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, and Exerciſe. It enjoyns ſubmiſſion unto every Ordinanc of Man for the Lord's ſake, 1 St. <hi>Pet.</hi> II. 13. It inſtructeth us to pay the Obligations we owe to all Perſons in their ſeveral Capacities. <hi>Rom.</hi> XIII. 7. <hi>Render therefore unto all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom unto whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor unto whom Honor.</hi> It commands Obedienc to our Governors in all lawful, and honeſt Matters, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to lay down our Lives rather then to Rebel; and the Holy Inſtitutor of our excellent Religion; was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51963:12"/>
the greateſt Inſtanc of this Doctrin, and lived, as He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded His Diſciples, and Followers. Tho He was Son &amp; Heir to the King of Kings and could command more then twelv Legions of Angels unto his Aſſiſtanc, yet He looked not upon Himſelf, as the Emperor's Competitor, nor laid He any claim to the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne. His Empire was not from Below, but from Above, and therefore He would not engage His Diſciples in his Defenc, as He declares unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Preſident, when He was brought as a Criminal before his Tribunal. St. <hi>John</hi> XVIII. 36. Jeſus anſwered, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World; If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered unto the Jews, but now is my Kingdom not from hence.</hi> This is the proper, and genuin Temper of our Religion: Under the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Torments of the Heathen Governors, no Diſciple of the Meek and Holy Jeſus ever died as a Traytor: Tho their Force was conſiderable, yet after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Gracious Maſter, they ſuffered with the ſame Meekneſs, as did the Lamb of God, that came to take away the ſins of the World. (2.) Conſider how hazardous, and deſtructiv a violent, exceſſiv, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated Zeal is, tho it be for that, which is Deareſt unto us, whatſoever ſecret murmurings, or private repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings might underhand influenc ſome powerful Perſons among us, who underſtand how to abuſe the Paſſions of the Mobile; yet this is very apparent, that the firſt ſeen Opportunities or Startings of theſe late Miſeries, and Plots (which have hazarded the Safety of our Prince, and threatned the Deſtruction of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy) were founded in a warm Paſſion againſt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Intereſt, and for the Security of our Proteſtant Principles. The Popiſh Confederacy was firſt deſigned, thoſe Purpoſes, and Contrivances excited, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the Suſpitions, and Jealouſies of all inquiſitiv,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51963:13"/>
and ſober Perſons. And the Reſpect, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Men had to their Soveraign, and their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Profeſſion, raiſed their Zeal into ſo great a Fervor, and Heat, as foreboded a General Deſtruction, and became more terrible, and dreadful then the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs it deſigned to avert, and to ſecure us from. There is nothing ſo deſtructiv as Zeal, when it imperiouſly governs, and overtops the Conſultations of Reaſon, and beats down the Arguments of Religion; And upon this Account, it is too frequently known, that Perſons who enter upon deſigns with a warm Pretenc of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienc unawares fall into Seditions againſt the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and are uſually immediatly obliged beyond the Innocency of their firſt Intentions. Nay, ſo far engaged many times, that they cannot retire, or come back with any Credit, or Reputation, but muſt either overcome, or be beaten. Let us then have an eſpecial regard concerning our Zeal, that we do not err, and take that for Coeleſtial Fire, which is a Flame, that comes from below, and is no higher then the Earth, or rather beneath that, from the Bottomleſs Pit. An Holy, and Devout Zeal will engage us to a greater affection for our Religion, then for our lives. Such a Zeal will keep us within the limits of our Duty, to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and Brother upon Earth, eſpecially our Rulers, and Governors, whatever propoſal of profit ſhould tempt us to the contrary. To deſpiſe Dominions, and ſpeak evil of Dignities in St. <hi>Judes</hi> Phraſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8 of that Epiſtle, and to form deſigns, and conſpiracies againſt the Government is a Zeal like the Wiſdom, that deſcends, which is not from Above, but is earthly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, and deviliſh, for where envy, and ſtrife is, there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, conſuſion, that is, Tumult, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs. St. <hi>Jam.</hi> III. 15, 16. (3.) Let antecedent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and Examples, and the Obſervations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51963:13"/>
of former times inſtruct us to ſet a Guard upon our ſelvs, and be cautious againſt any ſeeming riſings, or tempting motions of a Rebellious Temper, tho masked with the ſpecious Vizard of Religion; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition like ſome other Crimes hath ſome ſeemingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and almoſt unſeen Springs, but when thoſe Motions are cheriſhed, they quickly grow into the Power, and ability of doing Miſchief. It is as facil a thing to ſtop thy ſelf in the Deſcent of a Praecipice, when thou art in the middle thereof, as to ſtop thy ſelf, when thou haſt made an entranc, and haſt for ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon been hurried on in the ways of wickedneſs; <hi>Omne in Proecipiti vitium ſtetit;</hi> When men give way to any uncomely, and Unhandſome Action; they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand at what place they enter; but can never tell when they ſhall come to an End; <hi>When their feet go down to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. V, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Death, they cannot ſtay themſelvs till their ſteps take hold of Hell;</hi> when men undertake any wicked Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, who can fathom the concluſion of their deſigns; and who can pierce into the depth of their Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? If we ſhould make a ſearch into the Records of former Ages, we ſhall find, that the differences that wrought the deſolating Battels, that were fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia, Coeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey, Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> did in the beginning Spring from ſlight, and not valuable Cauſes. But our own Knowledg, and ſad Remembranc hath largly, and therefore ſufficiently convinced us, how hazardous, and perillous it is to yield unto that we ſhould not, tho never ſo Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. What was the ground, and cauſe of our late dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Calamities (the moſt aſtoniſhing, and amazing Mutation, and Confuſion the World ever beheld, ſince the moſt dolorous Paſſion of the Holy, and ever Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus?) Was it not entred upon by Multitudes who never deſigned it, and effected the Overthrow of that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51963:14"/>
which both Parties pretendedly did endeavour to ſecure from? Was it not brought about by yielding to, and cheriſhing the Phanatique Freaks of the UNTHINK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING MANY? Whereby is tranſmitted to Sateſmen, and Governors of Kingdoms this Rule of Policy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; [That there is no Hazard or Peril ſo ſmall, and inconſiderable in its beginning, but Connivanc may render it terrible, and ſlighting of it make unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.] But to return from whenc we may have a little ſeemingly digreſſed; I Queſtion not but ſeveral Perſons have loſt their lives upon the account of ſeditious Plots, who in the beginning thereof did as highly deteſt, and abhor the ſuſpicions thereof; as the moſt Loyal Perſons alive. Thus I doubt not but it was in the late Horrid Conſpiracy, the Diſcovery whereof with grateful Hearts we this Day make a Solemn Commemoration. Let theſe few Inſtances I have produced make us Cautious, and wary, not to lend an Ear, or hearken unto any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies concerning our Soveraign, and His Monarchy, nor to attend with Delight, while others make malicious Reports upon the one, or the other. Such as can with Pleaſure hearken to Reproaches caſt upon the King or Monarchy, will ſuddenly believ Him not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to Govern His Subjects. (4. And laſtly) Let me deſire you to offer your devout, and hearty Gratitude, and Thanks to the Majeſty of Heaven, for his gracious Protection over our Soveraign, and implore his Mercy for a Continuanc of the ſame Defenc. And aſſuredly if ever we had ground to offer our Laud, and Thanks to the Lord of Heaven, for any Mercy, we ought for this, which is ſo compleat and terming a Bleſſing, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all our Intereſts here upon Earth. If we eſteem our excellent Way of Worſhip, our Eſtates, or the Safety of our Perſons, the Publick Tranquillity, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuanc of our Monarchy, we have cauſe to Praiſe the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51963:14"/>
Lord for this Deliveranc; Who is able without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to imagine the Confuſions we had beheld at this time, had this Conſpiracy been compleated? Who can tell by what Character they would have diſtinguiſhed their Party from their Foes? Certainly, the Clergy had ſuffered moſt, for it is ſtrongly believed by ſome, that there was not one Miniſter that wore a Black Gown, but he ſhould have been knockt on the Head, as one popiſhly affected; Praiſed be that Good God who rideth upon the Clouds, and ſmiles at, and diſappoints the Machinations, and Contrivances of ſuch Rebellious Spirits. Certainly, the Ninth <hi>September</hi> will be recorded in the Annals of Time, and ſhould be kept as an Anniverſary Gratulation, as well as the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> or the Twenty Ninth <hi>May,</hi> and may deſervedly be accounted as great a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveranc as the Former; and as valuable a Bleſſing as the Latter, it being a ſecond Reſtauration of His moſt excellent Majeſty to His own Happineſs, and Glory, as well as unto the Comfort, and Joy of His Subjects, whom God long continu, and preſerv amongſt us, unto which I hope all good Chriſtians, and Loyal Subjects will heartily, and loudly ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider what hath been ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things.</p>
            <p>Now then, unto God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, be given of every one of us, and by this whole Kingdom, all Honor, Glory, Power, Praiſe, Might, Majeſty, and Dominion (particularly for the valuable Mercy of this Day) from hencforth, and for evermore, <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
