            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
FROM THE
Forgeries and Abuses of T. Hicks,
W. Kiffin, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAving waited long for an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to vindicate my Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
from the <hi>Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Abuses</hi>
of <hi>T. Hicks and W. Kiffin,</hi> with the rest
of the Confederates of the <hi>Barbican-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
held at <hi>London</hi> the 28th of the 6th
Month, 1674. In which Meeting they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
abus'd me behind my Back, when I was
not present to answer for my self, nor could
be present, having gone out of <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Nation several Dayes before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Thing was published of their <hi>Barbican-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46396:3"/>
And seeing I was publickly injur'd
both by T. H. and them, as others of my
Friends and Brethren were, I judged it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to desire a publick Meeting with
them, that I might have an Occasion as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to clear my self, as I was publickly
abused; therefore I joyned Issue with my
Friends <hi>G. Whitehead, W. Penn</hi> and <hi>S. Crisp,</hi>
who were also publickly abused with me, in
divers Letters to desire them to give us a
publick Meeting for clearing our selves of
the <hi>Forgeries</hi> of <hi>T. H.</hi> One Meeting they
granted us at <hi>Barbican,</hi> the 9th of the 8th
Month; but so loath were they to hear us
make good our Charge against both him and
them, that the Meeting of that Day was
spent, and yet our Proof of the very first
<hi>Artiole</hi> of our Charge not taken by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Consideration: Another publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we appointed our selves, which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
seeing they still deferred to hear us
prove our Charge against <hi>T. H.</hi> but <hi>T. Hick<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
did not come to this Meeting, though he was
greatly concerned in it, and had timely
notice given him thereof, only some other
<hi>Baptists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with <hi>Jeremy Ives,</hi> as personatin<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>T. H.</hi> did appear; but neither at this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(by Reason of their most unreasonabl<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
evading our Charge) got we over the first
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46396:3"/>
Article; and since that time they seemed to
yield to another Meeting, wherein my Charge
against <hi>T. H.</hi> might be heard; but withal
told our Friends and us, that they would not
hear any other Thing until <hi>T. H.</hi> should be
heard in what he could object against the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> as being <hi>No Christians:</hi> And
though I had a great Desire to have a publick
Opportunity to clear my Innocency, yet
seeing I could not have it, but upon that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
Condition, invented by them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to evade the Pursuance of our Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>T. H.</hi> I yielded rather to want that
Opportunity, especially seeing the Meeting
they yielded unto was not a <hi>Publick Meeting</hi>
as the former, but a <hi>private Meeting</hi> of some
<hi>select Persons</hi> on each Side: And indeed,
such a <hi>private Meeting</hi> hath but little Service
in it to clear one <hi>publickly</hi> from a <hi>publick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,</hi>
which I have found in Part by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for having had a <hi>private Meeting</hi> with
<hi>T. H.</hi> before divers Witnesses on each Side,
wherein I had openly proved him to have
<hi>grosly abused me,</hi> and brought him to that
Straight, <hi>that he had nothing to answer, but
that he referred himself to the Hearers;</hi> and
some of the Hearers openly affirmed, who
were neither of the <hi>Baptists</hi> nor <hi>Quakers,</hi>
that T. H. <hi>had abused me:</hi> Yet after all this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46396:4"/>
I find <hi>T. H.</hi> and his Confederate Brothren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the former Abuse: And having now for a
long Time waited the Opportunity of a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Meeting</hi> with those <hi>Baptists,</hi> to clear my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the Abuse of <hi>T. H.</hi> and his Consede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and yet cannot obtain it; I find it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as a Weight upon me, to take an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this Nature to clear my self, not so
much for my self or my own Reputation, I
can truly say, as for the Truth<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s sake, and to
remove the stumbling-Block out of the Way
of the Simple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My first Charge against T. H. is of</hi> Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>in his</hi> Continuation of the Dialogue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>p. 49
where</hi> forgedly <hi>he brings me in saying thus,</hi>
               <q>This Christ came to seek and save, and all his
Ministers preach'd People to this, the lost in
Man, that it might be found, a lost God, a
lost Christ; this was the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi>
of their Doctrine,</q> 
               <hi>Im Rev. p. 75, 76. Upon
which he thus discanteth (after he hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
my Words both by</hi> adding <hi>and</hi> diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
Blush O Heavens, and be astonished O
Earth! was ever such a Thing as this hear<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of before, That Jesus Christ came to seek
and save a lost God, a lost Christ? Was ever
God and Christ in a lost Condition?</p>
            <p>Now Friendly and Impartial Reader, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46396:4"/>
thou lovest to be undeceived, and be but
willing to see the <hi>Abuse</hi> and <hi>Forgery</hi> of T. H.
in this Particular; do but read the Words of
my Book, as they stand entirely therein, and
without any more Pains thou wilt see <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
and <hi>Forgery, first,</hi> by adding the Word
THIS, saying, This <hi>Christ came to seek and
save;</hi> and then by alledging on me, that I
say, <hi>Jesus Christ came to seek and save a lost
God, a lost Christ,</hi> which Passage is gross
<hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Abuse;</hi> for I no where say in
my Book, <hi>That Jesus Christ came to seek and
save a lost God, a lost Christ:</hi> It's true, in
p. 76. I cite the Words of Christ, <hi>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ came to seek and save that which
was lost;</hi> but I do not say that <hi>Lost,</hi> which
Christ came to seek and save, was <hi>God,</hi> nor
indeed is it deducible from my Words by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
just or reasonable Consequence and God,
who searcheth my Heart, knoweth, I never
intended any such Thing, as that Christ came
to seek and save a lost God. I cited the
Words of Christ, <hi>and I hope there is no Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
in them,</hi> viz. <hi>Jesus Christ came to seek
and save that which was lost;</hi> but these Words
I do not apply to God and Christ, as if God
and Christ were that lost which Christ came
to seek and save; and this may appear from
my Words themselves, which run by Way of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46396:5"/>
Parallel or Comparison, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>And as Jesus
Christ came to seek and save the lost; so
all his Ministers ever preached People to
this, the lost in them, that it might be found,
that they may find a lost God, a lost Christ,
whom they had lost, and from whom they
were separated by their Sins; This was the
<hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> of their Doctrine, to
turn them to God, and to his Son Jesus
Christ, near them:</q> Now in these my
Words I draw a Parallel, wherein two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
run parallel, in both which the Word
<hi>Lost</hi> is; but it is not, nor cannot in both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
be understood of God and Christ;
but only in the last Proposition by <hi>Lost</hi> is
understood God and Christ, whom they had
lost, and from whom they (viz. <hi>Men)</hi> were
separated by their Sins: I say, in these two
parallel Propositions, by <hi>lost</hi> cannot be meant
one &amp; the same thing, no more then in <hi>Rom.</hi>
5. 18. where it is said, <hi>As by the Offence of</hi>
one <hi>Judgment is come</hi> on all <hi>to Condemnation;
so by the Righteousness of</hi> one <hi>the free Gift
is come</hi> upon <hi>all to Justification of Life:</hi> Here
the Word <hi>One</hi> in both Propositions is used;
but in the one it signifieth the <hi>first Adam,</hi> in
the other it signifieth <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>second Adam;</hi>
so by <hi>Lost</hi> in the first Proposition, I mean
Men, who were lost, or lost Sinners, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46396:5"/>
that pure Formation or Creation in Men,
which by Man's Fall came to be vailed and
slain in him, but not annihilated; and by <hi>Lost</hi>
in the second Proposition. I understand God
and Christ, whom Men had lost, and so all
the true Ministers of Christ preached Men to
God and Christ whom they had lost, that
they might find him, to wit, God and Christ,
who was near them in their own House, that
is, in their own Hearts; and so the plain and
open Sense of my Words is this, <hi>That as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> came to seek and save the <hi>lost Souls</hi>
of Men, and to raise up and recover the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God in Men again; so all the true
Ministers of Christ preached People to God
and Christ near them, whom though Men
had lost, yet were near unto them, to save
them, and to bring them again into the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him, and Fellowship with him.</p>
            <p>The second Part of T. H. his <hi>Forgery</hi> in
this Particular, is by diminishing from my
Words, and cutting off from a perfect Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
the <hi>last</hi> Part of it, which is explanatory
of the first, <hi>viz.</hi> from this perfect and intire
Sentence—<hi>That they may find a lost God, a
lost Christ, whom they had lost, and from whom
they were separated by their Sins;</hi> which
Words [<hi>whom they had lost, and from whom
they were separated by their Sins</hi>] do clear
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46396:6"/>
me, that I did not mean that God or Christ
was in a lost Condition, or that God had lost
himself, but that Men by their Sins had lost
God and Christ: And indeed, that which
gave me Occasion to use the Word <hi>Lost,</hi> was
the Parable of Christ concerning the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
having lost her Pieee of Silver in her
House, <hi>Luke 15. 8, 9. And she lighteth a
Candle, and sweepeth the House, and seeketh
diligently till she find it, and when she findeth
it, she calleth her Friends and maketh merry
with them, through Joy that the lost Piece of
Money is found:</hi> And this House (say I)
where the lost Piece of Money was lost, and
is found, is Man's Heart; it was lost by <hi>Adam's</hi>
Fall, yet it remained still in the House, and
in the House in Man's Heart its to be found;
and the Candle is lighted in this House, and
it must be swept to find it: By all which Christ
Jesus points at this Principle, his Kingdom
or Appearance by his Light in Man's Heart;
and the Scope of all these Parables is, to turn
in Man's Mind to the Kingdom, the Light of
Christ in the Heart, to find the Treasure, the
Pearl, the lost Piece of Money there, to find
it where it was lost, and is hid; for there
it is to be enjoyed and possessed; no Man pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
more of God or Christ but what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in himself: See my Book, <hi>Im. Rev.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:46396:6"/>
p. 75. Now of this twofold <hi>Abuse</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi>
I charge not only T. H. but W. K. and
his <hi>Confederate Brethren of the Barbican-Meeting,</hi>
who in their Book, called, <hi>The
Quakers Appeal Answered,</hi> fall into the
same Error with T. H. both <hi>adding</hi> and <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing:
first</hi> adding, as where they say.
This <hi>Christ came to seek and save, and all his
Ministers preached People to this, the Lost in
Man, a</hi> Lost God, <hi>a Lost Christ;</hi> where
they make the Word <hi>This</hi> relate to God and
Christ; this is an absolute <hi>Forgery;</hi> for <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in p. 75. nor p. 76. do I use the Word,
<hi>This</hi> Christ came to seek and save, far less do
I apply it to God. And <hi>secondly, diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
a lost God, a lost Christ, leaving out
the last Part of the Sentence <hi>[whom they had
lost, and from whom they were separate by their
Sins.</hi>] In a Meeting with T. H. before many
Witnesses I accused him of this <hi>Forgery,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, that if he would take this Liberty
to add to, and diminish from a Man's Words,
he <hi>might as well alledge</hi> from the Scripture,
that it saith, <hi>There is not a God,</hi> by leaving
out the Words, <hi>The Fool hath said in his
Heart:</hi> But to this T. H. answered three
Things in that <hi>private Meeting</hi> I had with
him, which he there setteth down in the Book
called, <hi>The Quakers Appeal answered;</hi> to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46396:7"/>
all which three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did particularly answer,
whereof he saith nothing, and in that hath
dealt unfairly and cowardly: But seeing
he telleth them over again, I shall now take
them into Consideration; <hi>First,</hi> saith T. H.
<hi>It's true, those Words were added, viz.</hi> Whom
they had lost; <hi>yet they were no otherwise ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to him, then as a Blind to deceive his
unwary Reader; for first, by Lost in his whole
Discourse in that Book cited is intended of God
and Christ, which he there calls,</hi> the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Kingdom or Appearance of Christ by
his Light in Man's Heart. To this I answer,
If I had used these Words but as a Blind to
<hi>deceive the unwary Reader,</hi> as he alledgeth,
that is no Excuse for him to leave them out;
he ought to have set down the perfect Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and if there had been any Deceit in
it, to have shewn it; but it is manifest that
these Words were wilfully and deliberately
clipt off by him, because they do so apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cross his naughty Design of abusing me:
But next I say, its but a sorry and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Allegance, that I use these Words on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a <hi>Blind to deceive the unwary Reader;</hi>
his Reasons are too void and empty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to prove any such Thing, as <hi>first,</hi> that by
Lost <hi>in his whole Discourse in that Book cited
is intended of God and Christ.</hi> I answer, This
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46396:7"/>
is utterly false, and a most gross Untruth;
for in <hi>several Places</hi> in my Book I speak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
of <hi>lost Man,</hi> and the Soul of Man, as
lost and saved; for Proof of which, see these
following Quotations out of my Book of
<hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> as p. 39. within two
Lines of the End <hi>I say,</hi> 
               <q>The Gospel is the
preaching the glad Tidings of <hi>Salvation</hi> unto
poor <hi>lost Man</hi> by Jesus Christ himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
in his Heart:</q> Mark here two
Things; <hi>first,</hi> that I expresly speak of lost
Man; <hi>secondly,</hi> that the <hi>Gospel</hi> is the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the</hi> Glad Tidings of <hi>Salvation</hi> unto poor
<hi>lost Man,</hi> whereas according to T. H. his
<hi>Forgery</hi> it had been, the preaching the glad
Tidings of Salvation unto lost <hi>God,</hi> which is
Blasphemous. Again, see p. 13. line 35.
where <hi>I say,</hi> 
               <q>So that as the Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
Mercy unto <hi>lost Man</hi> in the midst of
Wrath, &amp;c.</q> Mark again, here I speak of
<hi>lost Man.</hi> Again, in this same p. 13. lin.
5, 6, 7, 8. I speak expresly of the Salvation
of the Soul, and of its Delivery from the
Bondage of Corruption, line 13. Again in
this same p. 13. about the middle of the Page
I say, <q>Whereas the Mercy goeth forth in
the Judgment towards <hi>Man</hi> in the fallen
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46396:8"/>
State to recover and convert him:</q> Mark,
I do not say, according to T. H. his base <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery)</hi>
whereas the Mercy goeth forth in the
Judgment towards God in a lost Condition,
to recover and convert God; but towards
<hi>Man</hi> in the fallen State to recover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him: Also I do very plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
distinguish betwixt the Soul or Mind
of Man, and the Seed of God in the Soul:
see p. 8. lin. 9, 10, 11, 12. and p. 23. lin. 28,
29, 30. &amp;c. I need not cite more Places,
these being sufficient to show T. H. his ba<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
<hi>Forgery. Secondly,</hi> saith T. H. <hi>The Sense I
put upon the Word</hi> Lost, <hi>is no other then what
W. P. allows,</hi> 
               <q>Lost, <hi>saith he,</hi> as taken by
T. H. is meant of Man's <hi>lost</hi> Condition, and
as there used by G. K. is understood of <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Christ,</hi> whom Man had <hi>lost,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Reas. ag.
Rail.</hi> p. 61. To this I answer; This Cover
of T. H. is as narrow and weak as the former;
for W. P. saith true, that by <hi>Lost</hi> I understand
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> whom Man had <hi>lost,</hi> when I
say that they may find a <hi>lost God</hi> a <hi>lost Christ,</hi>
&amp;c. But when I say, Christ came to seek
and save that which was <hi>lost;</hi> by <hi>Lost</hi> in this
Proposition, neither I, nor W. P. say, that
by <hi>Lost,</hi> which Christ <hi>came to</hi> seek and save,
is meant God; so that by the Word <hi>Lost</hi> in
my Book, I do not mean only <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46396:8"/>
nor <hi>alwayes,</hi> but <hi>sometimes</hi> Man, and <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
that <hi>pure Creation</hi> or <hi>Formation</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
&amp; Righteousness which God placed in
Man in the Beginning, and <hi>sometimes</hi> God,
whom Men had lost; and so impudently
wicked is T. H. that he blames me for an
Expression, and yet useth the same Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself, and commendeth it as safely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>viz. If you had said, that Jesus Christ
came to seek and save Sinners who were in a</hi>
lost <hi>Condition, and to stir them up to seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God whom they had lost, you had spoken safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
And in very deed, I speak all this upon
the Matter, as is clear from the aforesaid
Quotations: But I desire the Reader to take
notice, that the whole Stress of T. H. <hi>his</hi>
Allegation against me is, that by <hi>lost</hi> in all my
Book, I intend only <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
not only from what he saith in the
<hi>Quakers Appeal answered,</hi> but what he saith
in his <hi>third Dialogue,</hi> p. 35. <hi>Its true</hi> (saith
T. H.) George Keith <hi>speaks of People find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a lost God, whom they had lost; but still
if</hi> Lost <hi>be meant only God and Christ, how
can Christ be said to seek &amp; save a</hi> lost God?
Here T. H. supposeth a gross Untruth, which
is a <hi>Forgery,</hi> to wit, <hi>That by</hi> Lost <hi>I mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God and Christ;</hi> I have shown the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46396:9"/>
above by plain Citations out of my
Book.</p>
            <p>The third Reason of T. H. for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, <hi>That the Sense in which he represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me, was according to the Opinions of others
of my Friends.</hi> To this I answer (as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
did) that now, since he could not prove
his <hi>Forged</hi> Sense from my own Words, and
he goeth about to prove it from the Words
of other Men, is not fair, nor answerable to his
Undertaking, which was to prove that G. K.
said so: And how doth he seek to prove
this? <hi>Because</hi> W. P. <hi>or</hi> J. N. <hi>said so:</hi>
But by this beggarly <hi>Evasion</hi> he may run
round in a Circle continually, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but manifest his own <hi>Impudence;</hi> for
how will he prove, that <hi>W. P. I. N.</hi> or
any real <hi>Quaker</hi> said so? he may as well say,
<hi>Because</hi> G. K. <hi>said so:</hi> But I challenge
him to produce the words of any of my
Friends that ever said, <hi>That God and Christ
was in a lost Condition, and that Christ came
to seek and save a lost God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remaineth another Citation out of
my Book of <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> made
use of by <hi>T. H.</hi> not in his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> but
in <hi>The Quakers Appeal Answered:</hi> But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he could not have faln upon a Place in all
my Book that doth more manifestly clear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46396:9"/>
me, and demonstrate <hi>T. H.</hi> to be a vile
<hi>Forger,</hi> in alledging on me, that I say, <hi>Christ
came to seek and save a Lost God, a Lost
Christ:</hi> For none of all these words cited
by him, speak any thing of Christ his seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and saving a Lost God; but, <hi>That God
sent his Son into the World, to seek and save
the Work of his own Hands, that of the pure
Creation in man, which though shut up in
Death, yet it remained, and perished not, as
to its being.</hi> Now I challenge T. H. to
show me where I, or any of my Friends
say, <hi>That the Work of God's own Hands is
God,</hi> or <hi>that the pure Creation in man is God.</hi>
It is true, according to the Scripture express
Terms and way of speaking, we say, <hi>The
Seed is Christ, and that Christ doth suffer,
and is crucified in some; and that he is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or hath a spiritual Formation in his Saints,
by which he lives and indwelleth in them; and
this spiritual Formation of him is called
Christ by way of</hi> Synecdoche, <hi>as being a
Member of him; or by way of</hi> Metonymy,
<hi>as being that Immediate Principle, in which
he dwelleth, and through which he revealeth
himself unto his Saints; who is the Eternal,
the Infinite and Vncreated Word and Light,
who is God over all, blessed forever.</hi> But that
ever I, or any have said, that <hi>this Formation
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46396:10"/>
is God himself,</hi> or <hi>Christ as he is God,</hi> I put
<hi>T. H.</hi> to show it, and if he cannot, he is a
<hi>Forger.</hi> And when we say, <hi>Christ is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
or slain in Wicked Men,</hi> let <hi>T. H.</hi>
show where we say, that <hi>Christ, as in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or as he is God, is or can be crucified or
slain in any man or men:</hi> This I am sure he
cannot produce from any words of mine;
nor do I think he can from any words of any
man upon Earth, called a <hi>Quaker;</hi> yea, <hi>T.
Hicks</hi> clears me sufficiently of this Charge,
by citing my words, where I say <hi>(Immed.
Revelat.</hi> pag. 77.) <hi>That Christ, as he is
and lives in himself, being an Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
Life, he cannot be crucified, but
in his Appearance he may be.</hi> This cleareth
me, that I hold it to be true, that Christ as
God cannot be crucified or slain in men; and
yet the Scripture speaketh in divers places
of his being crucified in them, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.
<hi>Gal. 3. 1. Heb.</hi> 6, 6. which therefore must
be understood in respect of his Appearance
or Manifestation in men, and not as God,
or as in himself; for to affirm, that <hi>Christ
as he is God, can be crucified or dye,</hi> I hold
it one of the greatest of Blasphemies.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reader, having cleared my self of
the <hi>Forgeries</hi> of <hi>T. H.</hi> as to this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
I refer it to that which is noble, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46396:10"/>
and impartial in thy Conscience, to
judge whether T. H's <hi>Blush O Heavens,
and be Astonished O Earth,</hi> be not applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to himself for his so grosly and im<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
Abusing both me and the World, by
his so base and impudent <hi>Forgery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more I shall take notice of here,
and that is <hi>T. H</hi>'s alledging, <hi>That</hi> G. K.
<hi>affirmed to him (in the hearing of many cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Witnesses) That the Book intituled,</hi>
Imm. Revelat. <hi>was written by the Immediate
Inspiration of the Spirit of God.</hi> But to
what Purpose <hi>T. H.</hi> produceth this here
(granting that I had said these words) is
evident, to wit, That he may cast an <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
upon me, it being a great Crime in his
Esteem, for any man in these dayes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the <hi>Immediate Inspiration of the
Spirit of God.</hi> But <hi>T. H.</hi> may in this be
disappointed, as in other his base Designs:
However, he doth clear himself (to give
him his due) sufficiently, as to this Matter,
to wit, That he is not guilty of the least Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to the <hi>Inspiration</hi> (or In-breathing) of
the Spirit of God, which <hi>Inspiration of t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
Almighty giveth Vnderstanding,</hi> as the
Scripture saith expresly; and he who speaks
or writes of the things of God without <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi>
he doth it without a true and right
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46396:11"/>
Understanding, as is manifest in the scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of this <hi>Forger T. H.</hi> And surely he that
writeth <hi>Lyes, Perversions, Forgeries</hi> and
<hi>Slanders</hi> against any man or men, it is easie
to determine what Spirit hath inspired him
so to do, even the <hi>Spirit</hi> of him <hi>who was a
Lyar and Murderer from the beginning.</hi> And
as to the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the blessed Spirit of
God, it is that by which my Soul was first
made alive unto God, and by which it is
preserved alive unto this day, to serve
him, and give Honour and Glory to his
Name: And by the same did I receive a true
Understanding from God of what I did
write in that Book, and had his Direction
therein, in some measure; which <hi>Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit</hi> I do not appropriate to my
self; for I know that it is given in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Measures of it, according to the good
Pleasure of God, to every true <hi>Christian;</hi>
and every true <hi>Minister of Christ</hi> hath it to
lead him and direct him what to Say, Preach
and Write for the Service of others; and
they who have it not, and believe not such
a thing, but deny it, and are Enemies to it,
I testifie for God, they are neither true <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ,</hi> nor true <hi>Christians</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a good Saying of <hi>Bernard,</hi> concerning
the Necessity of <hi>Inspiration unto Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46396:11"/>
Tepida est omnis oratio, quam non preve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
inspiratio, i. e. <hi>All Prayer is Luke-warm,
which doth not proceed from Inspiration.</hi>
And said <hi>Augustine,</hi> Tractat. Ep. <hi>John</hi> 3.
<hi>There is an inward Master, who teacheth;
Christ teacheth; his Inspiration teacheth;
where his Inspiration and his Vnction is not,
the Words outwardly make a Noise in vain.</hi>
Many other Places could I cite, both out of
Scripture and Antiquity, concerning the
<hi>Necessity</hi> of the <hi>Inspiration of God</hi> to be
with his People in all Age. But when we
speak of the <hi>Inspirations of God,</hi> that are
given to us of God in our waiting upon him,
and by which we are directed and helped
what to Speak, or Pray, or Write, we do not
hereby <hi>Equal</hi> our Selves, our Writings or
Labours unto the Apostles, and their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Writings: But a Measure of the
same Spirit we have received, which they
had, which Spirit is one; and it is not idle,
or without Operation in them who receive
it; and its Operation is, to breath (or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire)
Life, Light, Power, Vertue, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Righteousness, Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in them who attend unto the same.</p>
            <p>Thus having cleared my self of the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
Abuse of <hi>T. H.</hi> I proceed to give the
<hi>Reader</hi> a small Hint at other 2 or 3 Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46396:12"/>
which are also very abusive and gross:
One is, that because I say in my Book of
<hi>Immed. Rev.</hi> pag. 4. <q>That there is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
for these under the New Covenant-Dispensation
to have things revealed unto
them from the Lord (that are not Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of the <hi>Christian</hi>-Religion, but things
relating to our Conversation in the World,
see pag. 3.) which are not to be found
in Scripture particularly, not so much
as by Consequence:</q> 
               <hi>T<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> H.</hi> brings in these
words as a Proof, <hi>That according to the</hi>
Quakers <hi>Principle they may excuse the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Just Debt, under Pretence it is not
revealed unto them,</hi> Contin. Dial. pag. 69.
But surely had not <hi>Impude<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce</hi> come to a
wonderful Excess in <hi>T. H.</hi> he could never
have committed such a gross Abuse on
my words, which are so far from giving the
least seeming Colour for a Ground to build
his <hi>Forgery</hi> on, that in the same place I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
say, pag. 4. <q>That the Spirit of the
Lord never can nor doth command us to
do things which are intrinsecally, or in their
own Nature Evil, or contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
But refusing to pay a just Debt is
contrary to the Scriptures;</q> As also, it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
found in the Scripture, that we owe
nothing to any Man but Love; therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46396:12"/>
we should pay our Debts: This Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is clear, and therefore none but
such a wretched <hi>Forger</hi> as <hi>T. H.</hi> could have
cast such a Groundless Calumny on my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
words. And like unto this is that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mentioned by <hi>T. H.</hi> of a <hi>Woman's
casting off her relation unto her Husband, as
warranted by our Principle, and my words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited,</hi> Contin. Dialog. p. 62. But that
no such thing is to be done, is particularly
to be found in Scripture and therefore <hi>T. H.</hi>
is an abusive <hi>Forger</hi> and <hi>Perverter.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abuse of <hi>T. H.</hi> against me is, that he
doth quote me as a Proof, <hi>That the Seed of
God only in man is taught, and nothing else,</hi>
Contin. Dialog. pag. 66. Also, <hi>That God
preacheth to himself, and is obeyed only by
himself,</hi> Contin. Dialog. pag. 84. His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Proof is, that I say, <q>The Great
work of the Ministry is, to point the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
to this (that is, the <hi>Seed)</hi> in them.</q>
Now let any of the weakest Capacity iudge
if there be any thing in these words, giving
the least Colour of Proof, that either the
Seed only in man is taught, or that God
preacheth to himself: Surely, a <hi>Blush O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and be astonished O Earth,</hi> may very
deservedly be given at the Wickedness of
<hi>T. H.</hi> for his so gross <hi>Perversion:</hi> Who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46396:13"/>
but one of the most wretched Impudence
would draw such a Conclusion, <hi>The Work
of the Ministers was, to point and direct the
Hearers to the</hi> Seed <hi>in them, and to</hi> Christ
<hi>in them, and</hi> God <hi>in them; Therefore only</hi>
the Seed in them, and only God and Christ
in them <hi>is Taught?</hi> whereas the plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
doth follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>
in that pure and divine Seed in men is the
<hi>Teacher,</hi> and not the Taught; and this is
the very Aim and Design of my Book, that
<hi>God and Christ is the Immediate Teacher
of his People in their Hearts.</hi> Another
of his Abuses is, That because I say, <q>
                  <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> is both the <hi>Seeds-man,</hi> the <hi>Seed,</hi>
and also the Precious Fruit;</q> he alledgeth
on me, that I say, <hi>The Work of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in us, is Christ himself,</hi> Contin. Dialog.
pag. 57. Now when I say, Christ Jesus
is the Fruit, I speak according to plain
Scripture, which speaketh of <hi>Christ formed
in the Saints;</hi> so Christ formed in the Saints
is the precious <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>Product,</hi> which he
himself, as he is that Eternal and Divine
Word, bringeth forth in them: But the
Work of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is the <hi>Effect</hi> of
Christ thus formed, and not <hi>Christ</hi> himself,
unless we speak <hi>metonymically,</hi> as when the
Cause is sometimes called by the Name of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46396:13"/>
the Effect; as, when <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>That he,</hi>
to wit, Christ, <hi>is made unto us Wisdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
Sanctification, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> having briefly cleared
my self of <hi>T. H.</hi> his <hi>Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
unjustly put upon me, I shall conclude
with giving thee a small Hint, to let thee see,
that notwithstanding <hi>T. H</hi>'s Pretence so
much to <hi>Logick,</hi> how weak he is therein, and
that is, his Illogical and Unreasonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that because <hi>G. F.</hi> saith [A man
by the Spirit may discern where the Seed
is in Death, and where it is not in Death;
and where the Soul is living, and where it
is in Death] From this <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
<hi>That, according to</hi> G. F. <hi>there is no
Distinction betwixt the Seed and the Soul,
but the Seed is the Soul: Observe,</hi> saith T. H.
<hi>he speaks the same of the Seed he doth of the
Soul.</hi> Now let us improve this sort of
T. H's <hi>Logick</hi> and by the very same way
of Reasoning we may prove <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi>
to be an <hi>Ass</hi> or a <hi>Horse:</hi> as thus, <hi>An Ass
or a Horse is a Living Creature, but Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and</hi> T. H. <hi>is a Living Creature, but
Mortal; an</hi> Ass <hi>hath a Head, a Nose, Face
and Ears, and so hath</hi> T. Hicks; <hi>an</hi> Ass <hi>can
Eat, Drink, Sleep, and so can</hi> T. Hicks; here
I speak the same of an <hi>Ass</hi> that I do of <hi>T. H.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:46396:14"/>
and so I may do of an <hi>Horse,</hi> a <hi>Toad,</hi> a <hi>Viper,</hi>
a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Rat;</hi> the Conclusion therefore is,
according to <hi>T. H</hi>'s <hi>Logick,</hi> that <hi>T. Hicks</hi> is
an <hi>Ass,</hi> a <hi>Horse, &amp;c.</hi> But true <hi>Logick,</hi> and
indeed true Understanding, as we are men,
teacheth us, That it is not the Agreement of
some, but of all essential or necessary Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
that make Two to be one and the
same Thing. Now though some things may
be said in common, both of the <hi>Soul</hi> and the
<hi>Seed;</hi> yet other things cannot: As, the <hi>Soul</hi>
is <hi>Corruptible,</hi> can and doth sin; but the <hi>Seed
of God</hi> is <hi>Incorruptible,</hi> sinneth not, nor can
sin; therefore the one is not the other. But
that the <hi>Seed</hi> is burthened, or <hi>laden as a Cart
with Sheaves,</hi> by the Sinner, will not prove,
<hi>That the Seed can sin;</hi> for <hi>Christ Jesus bore
our Sins,</hi> and they were a Load and Burthen
upon him, who yet sinned not, nor ever
could sin.</p>
            <p>Another Instance I shall give of his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Shallowness in another of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
against G. F. as where he thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth
<hi>pag.</hi> 21. Dial. 3. <hi>But if every spiritual
Substance be Infinit in it self (as</hi> Fox <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth)
then either there are no Angels, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are no spiritual Substances; or if they be
spiritual Substances, they are no Creatures,
but Infinit in themselves; and consequently,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46396:14"/>
as many Angels as there are, so many Gods
there must be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But note, <hi>Reader,</hi> G. F. spoak but of a
<hi>spiritual Substance</hi> in the <hi>singular Number;</hi>
Now if G. F. or any other should affirm, that
<hi>Nothing is purely a Spirit</hi> or <hi>spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
properly and strictly so consider'd
simple &amp; without all Composition of Body,
but <hi>God only,</hi> what hath <hi>T. Hicks</hi> to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, why, then it will follow, that an
Angel is not a spiritual Substance? Well!
But how will he prove, that <hi>an Angel is a
spiritual Substance</hi> (I say, strictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
consider'd) that is to say, <hi>That an</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<hi>hath no sort of Body or Corporeity; but is
altogether</hi> Spirit, <hi>without all sort of Body,
however subtil or spiritual?</hi> Surely, many
Learned and Pious Men, both ancient and
modern, hold that <hi>Angels and Souls of Men
have some subtil or spiritual Body; and so
are not altogether simple, uncompounded Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but consisting of Spirit and Body.</hi> But
these Contemplations (I confess) are too
high for <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s weak and shallow Brain.</p>
