         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE here preſent to your view, the grand <hi>Canale</hi> or common-ſhore of all Phanatical principles, <hi>Geneva's Calviniſme, Munſters Revelations, Amſterdams Toleration, New-Englands Preciſeneſſe,</hi> all bound up in one volume, and abridged in this Epitome.</p>
            <p>He ha's had the luck to out-run all his companions that ſtarted with him, he ha's left Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> but juſt in ſight, which is as much as he deſires or deſerves. <hi>Roaring Marſhal</hi> he quite out-breathed, and to ſay the truth was the better Bul of the two, for he could low the full udder'd purſed Kine, the zealous women, into <hi>Guildhall</hi> mint, while <hi>Marſhal</hi> rambled up and down the large field of Rebellion, with ſtrain'd and wrench'd Divinity, not minding the fruitfulneſſe of the Parliaments Cattle, nor could make uſes and Applications from Votes of the Houſes.</p>
            <p>It were impoſſible to match him. <hi>Peter Sterry</hi> can blaſpheme, and aver it on his Knowledge, that <hi>Oliver</hi> was on the right hand <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when <hi>Peters</hi> by his Familiar was aſcertained he dwelt at the ſign of the Left handed Goat, and ſung a Dirge to <hi>Old Nick</hi> for his Patrons <hi>requiem; Saltmarſh</hi> had alſo an excellent faculty of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling and perſwading the Army, and roſe to a very great Credit and Authority among them, even to be taken for a Prophet, but when the time of <hi>Olivers</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance came, he made room, and gave place to this venerable Emiſſary the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reverend Gentleman, ha's been a great fundamental maker, a Searcher of the rubbiſh of the three ruined Kingdomes, to which his immenſe parts made him very uſeful, as did his other large geer commend him, and qualifie him for the holy Zealous ſiſters.</p>
            <p>He quarrelled with the Presbyters, firſt, becauſe they were madder then himſelf, and knew not what they would have, when his bent was to have no Government, and yet every good thing beſide; and ſecondly, becauſe they had no more plate, nor rings, nor jewels, to ſacrifice to <hi>Bell and the Dragon,</hi> the Good old cauſe, that his Prieſthood might be maintained, and the Parliament Goſpel and Miniſtry propagated.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Foxely</hi> of <hi>Sepulchres</hi> Pariſh, was his moſt boſome Friend for they two would lye and tell Stories by one and the ſame inſtinct, and the one was ſecond to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all their juggles and impoſtures, if the one Romanced of a Victory a Sunday, at 40. miles diſtance, the other would give you the particulars at a repetition that night, and ſo a lying Spirit was put into the mouth of <hi>Civicus</hi> the Scout, Dove, Poſt, all the Mercuries, the puny Chroniclers of the times, which did highly advance the credit and reputation of the Armes and ſtrength of the Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Certainly he was the braveſt Ambodexter of his time, and this blinded age, or that ever was among us dull Northern people; and among the multitude of his Tricks, I ſhall commend to the <hi>Hocuſſes</hi> of <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, for their information and edification, this <hi>Legerdemain</hi> (for it is ſuppoſed it will hardly be practicable any more in the Pulpit;) That's this, His great miſſion from the Parliament, (when he had done his utmoſt here with the <hi>Londoners)</hi> was to ſtir up all the godly and well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the ſeveral Countries, to a liberal contribution for the defence and ſupport of their cauſe; to compaſs and effect his errand, he ſee there was no better way then by provoking them (by way of emulation) with other places large and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal gifts and loanes: To which purpoſe, when he preached, which was alwayes on that Subject of matter of money, he wore a pair of Breeches without Pockets, onely the holes were cut in them, (and his Auditory being moſt women, after he had thundered at the Cavaleirs, and frighted them with the terrible characters he gave them) out at length comes a whole bunch of rings, which he had hung on his cod-peice button, and my beloved quoth he, theſe Rings the Women of ſuch a Town gave me, and after he had ſhaked them a while in one hand, then pretending he put them up, ſtanding upright in the Pulpit, he took them through his Breeches in the other, and dearly beloved Siſters quoth he, theſe the godly zealous Women of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Town gave me, to ſubdue the wicked ungodly Cavaliers: and this Country cheat brought in a great deal of griſt to his Mill. Such a thorow paced ſhaver too, that he never fell into any diſguſt with any of the uſurped powers, all the time of his late horrid Anarchy, but what was meerly pretended and out of deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Oliver</hi> had a pique at any of the ſwarm of Sects, that multiplied during his time, and were the right hand of his power; for then <hi>Hugh</hi> was to be in diſgrace; and his disfavour at that barbarous Court, <hi>was truſt enough with any of the prickeard Brethren, to admit him into their Counſels,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He went (for the Character of his Religion) under the general notion of an Independent, a Neuter betwixt <hi>Feake</hi> and <hi>Simpſon,</hi> and <hi>Philip Nye</hi> and <hi>Sterry,</hi> while the aforeſaid <hi>Feak</hi> began to bandy againſt <hi>Oliver,</hi> for then he ſcrewed himſelf into high favour with fiding with his Highneſſes Noſe, and was made Chaplain Errant or in Ordinary to him.</p>
            <p>He was one of the pretended Judges for probate of Wills, and granting admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, at the ſame time the greateſt Sollicitor at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and upon the buſineſſe of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> was employed to preach Courage into the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. A moſt indefatigable maker of Addreſſes to <hi>Snout</hi> from the Army and other well affected people, which were well repaid him in ſeveral grants to Petitions which he managed, ſo that he lickt his fingers ſweetly, and if he did any thing for the Female Sex, which were often his clients, he would be ſure to have a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>He was an abſolute Ubiquitary before his late Confinement, a fellow of a very capacious intellect, and by his Travels, and the help of a good memory, well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any thing but Honeſty and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>His Caprichio's and Whimſeys in the Pulpit where he plaid <hi>Preſto</hi> with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were certainly out of deſign to ſcandalize Learning, and make that ſacred place of the Oracle <hi>a la mode</hi> to Stage-play, He was the firſt that ever made a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon out of a Newes Book.</p>
            <p>He had alſo an extraordinary Faculty of modelling, and was very much for that manner of Government, which the Jews uſed under the Law (and He and <hi>Philip Nye</hi> were great Sticklers by Commiſſion from <hi>Cromwell</hi> for the readmiſſion of them into <hi>England,</hi> as being excellent Spunges for <hi>Nolls</hi> Neceſſities.) To which purpoſe he writ a Book called <hi>Good Work for a good Magiſtrate,</hi> ful of <hi>Chimera's</hi> and ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but the main drift is the Suppreſſion and abolition of all manner of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in p. 33. <hi>(This being done</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is very adviſeable to burn all old Records, yea even thoſe in the</hi> Tower, <hi>the Monuments of Tyranny:)</hi> no doubt this Gimcrack maker, would willingly all the late Records were burnt alſo, wherein his good name ha's had ſuch often occaſion to be mentioned and regiſtred.</p>
            <p>That ſixth of <hi>December</hi> 1648. when <hi>Pride</hi> ſecluded 40. Members of the Houſe of Commons, and carryed them into Hell at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they lay upon, the bare boards, <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> took a Liſt of them ſtanding by the Door, as they paſt into the Room, with a Sword under his Arm. And the next Lords Day, in a place in <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> (for he flew up and down like wildfire to promote the murder of the King) to vilifie the Honeſt Patriots of the Parliament, who oppoſed that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Deſign, in one of his <hi>Freakes</hi> diving into the Pulpit, he told the people he had been in <hi>Hell,</hi> and there was a number of Parliament men there, and that they might beleive it to be as true as this Goſpel, ſhewing a Table Book, bound up like a Teſtament.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to recite or remember half of his feats of Activity, had they been harmleſs ones, and not polluted with blood, they had out-done <hi>Scogan</hi> or <hi>Cottington.</hi> Such a Mercurial piece of Miſchief our Annals afford not. There is not a place of note in the Three Kingdomes, where this Preiſt Errant hath not been; as for <hi>Wales, Vavaſour Powel</hi> and he, had meaſur'd it out in two halfes for themſelves, only an Eccleſiaſtical Tribute reſerved to Major General <hi>Harriſon</hi> the Deputy to the fifth Monarch, out of thoſe Mountains of <hi>Moab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is now run to the end of his rope, he hath trampled ſo long upon the Crown while the thorns of it (of his and his Complices grafting) have prickt his feet to the quick. So deſperate a thing it is, to kick againſt the pricks. So e'n take him <hi>Derrick,</hi> and ſet up his whimſical head for a Weather-Cock upon <hi>London-Bridge.</hi>
