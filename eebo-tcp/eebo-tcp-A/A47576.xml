         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THere is not one Controvertable Point in and about
Religion that I leſs thought to have been concerned
with this way, than that contained in theſe Sermons
preſented here to thy view, until I was <hi>alarm'd</hi> on
a ſudden, and provoked (ſome few Months ago)
to undertake it; there being one Perſon eſpecially under my
charge (who for ſome time, by his unſettled and wavering
Spirit, and aſpiring Temper, I feared would be troubleſome)
who had for ſome conſiderable time, unknown to me, ſuck'd
in the Notion of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> and laboured to corrupt
many others of the younger ſort, ſome of which, with himſelf,
fell into the Practice of keeping that Day, and caſt off the
<hi>Lord's-day,</hi> as not being of Divine Appointment. Some of them
being Apprentices, declared they would and could do any Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Work for their Maſters upon the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of <hi>the Week:</hi>
And this Principle they received without acquainting me or the
Church with it, or ever coming to me to hear what I had to ſay
againſt it; inſomuch that when it was publickly known, it had
almoſt put the whole Congregation into a flame; but to prevent
which, I was deſired by divers Members to endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them by Scripture and ſolid Arguments, which I laboured
to do, but found all was in vain as to ſeveral of them.</p>
            <p>So that the Brethren ſaw it was neceſſary for me to preach
upon this Subject, which I my ſelf perceived an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to do; and praiſed be the Lord who hath bleſſed my
Undertaking herein, and anſwered my hopes, which was not ſo
much to regain thoſe hot-headed and conceited young Men, as
to eſtabliſh, confirm and ſtrengthen all others; many being much
ſtartled, and doubting which Day they ought to obſerve, which
the Ringleaders I perceived much gloried at, ſome of them
giving it out, that they hoped to bring over great part of the
Congregation to their Opinion; but theſe ſeaſonable and timely
Endeavours, through the Bleſſing of God, have, I hope, finally
prevented their Deſign, all generally (ſave them who were at
firſt corrupted) being throughly eſtabliſhed in the Obſervation
of the <hi>Lord's-day</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>old Seventh-day Sabbath:</hi>
And ſeveral that were wavering told me how fully all their Doubts
were reſolved by hearing ſome of theſe Sermons preached.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:61730:4"/>
Theſe things firſt mentioned being the occaſion of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
upon this Controverſy, I hope all will ſay my Call was
juſt; and none will or can blame me, that have no prejudice
againſt me. And now alſo at the requeſt and deſire of many
(ſome not Members with us) the Sermons are publiſhed, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
they may be of ſome uſe to the Church of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>As to the Work it ſelf, all may perceive that I have taken no
ſmall Pains according to my ſmall Ability, in ſearching not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into God's Word, but alſo into the Works and Labours of
many pious and learned Authors; and I have cited (to confirm
my own Arguments) many Paſſages out of their Writings.
(1.) Thinking their words might do more with ſome Perſons,
than any thing I my ſelf might ſay, whoſe Learning and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
far exceed mine. (2.) Becauſe few may be ever ſaw ſome
of theſe Books. I have, 'tis true, repeated ſome things two or
three times which I look upon emphatical, that they might make
the greater Impreſſion on ſuch Readers, for whoſe ſake theſe
Sermons are publiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> who are not learned; for others
need not my help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I did not (for ſome reaſons) deliver from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
great part of what is here publiſhed; and alſo ſome things
I might ſay that are here omitted, which being not in my Notes,
I could not remember.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Warren,</hi> &amp;c. in particular, with
ſeveral other <hi>Reverend</hi> Miniſters, have ſaid enough to ſatisfy
any on this Subject, whoſe Books have not ever been anſwered.
In my Citations of divers Authors, I have tranſcribed both the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> that all may know the <hi>original words,</hi> of which
our <hi>Opponents</hi> would make ſome earnings; and I can ſolemnly ſay
I have not wilfully miſt in any Quotation. And if any of theſe
<hi>Sabbatarians</hi> make Reply to me, let them rather anſwer them
(eſpecially thoſe three I have now mentioned) than me, it will
be more for their Honour: And this I will ſay, if they do think
to reply, unleſs they anſwer what theſe and other learned Men
have ſaid which I have here recited, I ſhall take it for no Anſwer
at all: Let them therefore attempt to do it effectually, or not
meddle with it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I differ from divers learned Men in one or two
things I have cited, and from Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> particularly,
<hi>i. e.</hi> about <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, and the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> keeping the
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eventh Day;</hi> yet what the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſaith on <hi>Heb. 4.</hi> doth well


<pb n="v" facs="tcp:61730:4"/>
comport with my Principle: but tho as ſoon as <hi>God finiſhed his
Work, he reſted, and that day of Reſt enſued thereon,</hi> to anſwer the
end of Creation, and the Covenant of Works; yet I can't ſee
any ground to believe it was given to any to obſerve until
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, <hi>Exod. 16.</hi> for reaſons I and others have given.
Moreover, Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> has ſhewed in his <hi>Rejoiner to Mr.</hi> Bamfield,
<hi>p. 123.</hi> that that very Day before it <hi>rained Manna</hi> could not be
a Sabbath, becauſe on that day <hi>Quails</hi> covered the Camp, and
they were not forbid to gather them, <hi>Exod. 16. 8, 13.</hi> But no
more of that here. I expect better uſage or treatment from
theſe Opponents than I met formerly with from ſome others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
another Controverſy, who left the Argument to abuſe
my Perſon; yet I may ſay (with a <hi>late</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Graſcome.</hi>
               </note> Writer on this Subject) <hi>as for the Leaders</hi>
(he ſaith Deceivers) <hi>I deſpair of doing good to
them,</hi> but ſhall be glad if I may be an Inſtrument to recover any
that are miſled, or deceived: Self-denial is a hard Leſſon. You
will find many new Arguments I think not found in former Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
I ſhall conclude with Advice to unſettled Perſons, who
are ready to receive Novelties. But firſt, take a Note or two
how you may know ſuch: they that are firmly rooted in the
Truth will not be ſoon ſhaken or removed.</p>
            <p>Erronious Perſons, 1. Are ſubject to cavil with Truth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
uttered, which by an honeſt Hearer will be well
taken.</p>
            <p>2. They are ſubject to contradict plain evident Truth with a
delight to gainſay it, becauſe they would not have it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than they believe.</p>
            <p>3. They have a vehement deſire to infect others, or to draw
many to be of their Opinion.</p>
            <p>4. A deſire of Conference under pretence of taking Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
but on purpoſe to vent their Notions more freely, and
get the good opinion of others, and occaſion of inſulting.</p>
            <p>5. Commend themſelves thro Pride, and diminiſh the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Honour of others, and care not what pious Congregations
they divide and trouble, to augment their own Company.</p>
            <p>6. Make a Profeſſion of <hi>new Light,</hi> that hardly any before
them ever attained, and that all are in darkneſs but themſelves.</p>
            <p>7. Pretend to Conſcience, and that they would imbrace the
Truth when they ſee it: yet after clear Demonſtration of Truth
they remain ſtubborn, and perſevere in their Errors.</p>
            <p>8. They matter not Church-dealings, nor any juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:61730:5"/>
Cenſure, nor regard their own moſt ſolemn Church-Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſo that they can but pleaſe their own fancy, and feed on
their <hi>new Notions</hi> the more greedily—And hardly can a Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an Error, but he will prove a Seducer of others.</p>
            <p>9. They ſhew great Zeal and concernedneſs of Mind if they
find any oppoſe their Errors, as if their All lay at ſtake.</p>
            <p>10. And if they receive one Error, they are ready to receive
more.</p>
            <p>11. They commonly ſeem uneaſy under the Word where
they are Members, and catch at any thing to blemiſh their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
and will wander abroad to hear as their fancies lead them,
as if under no Government, tho they grieve and afflict the
Church and Members to whom they belong, breaking Chriſt's
Bands, and caſting his Cords from them.</p>
            <p>To cloſe, (1.) Take heed of erronious Books, and if you
doubt do not preſently turn your Doubts into Practice. (2.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of your own private Interpretation of Scripture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with ſuch as have better Judgments than your ſelves.
(3.) Suſpect all private Opinions which differ and diſſent from
the general Doctrine, as taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and
owned in the two next Ages after them, or that diſſent from the
general Doctrine and Practice of ſuch whom you believe in this
Age have obtained the cleareſt Light: remember the way of
Truth is no By-path, but trodden by the Primitive Flock or
Goſpel-Churches. (4.) Beſure hear what can be ſaid againſt your
<hi>Notion,</hi> as well as what you hear for it. There is one thing I
ſhould have noted touching the Error of theſe <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> viz.
their Notion brings in an external force upon the Conſcience in
matters of Religion; for they muſt force their Children and
Servants not only to reſt, but to worſhip God on the ſeventh
Day tho againſt their Light, or they are guilty of Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking.
But I will add no more.</p>
            <p>O that God would put a Rebuke on, and ſtop all the Errors of
theſe evil days, and increaſe Love among his People! Let us all
cry for more of the Anointing, or for the latter Rain, and the
glorious Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that is now juſt at
the door. And, <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou doſt receive any profit by
what is here wrote, give the Glory to God, and let me have thy
Prayers, who am thy Soul's Friend and Servant in the Goſpel,</p>

                  <hi>MY Brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Author's preaching theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> I am troubled I have
ſuch a provoking occaſion to enter
upon this Controverſy, <hi>viz.</hi> What
day of the Week we under the
<hi>Goſpel Diſpenſation</hi> ought to obſerve as a day
of <hi>Reſt,</hi> and of ſolemn Worſhip to the Lord,
ſince univerſally the Church and People of God


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61730:7"/>
of all Perſuaſions are agreed about it, and have
been ever ſince the new World, or Goſpel-day
did commence, except a <hi>few Chriſtians formerly,</hi>
and <hi>a little Remnant</hi> of <hi>late times</hi> in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who have <hi>deſerted,</hi> and <hi>err'd</hi> in this <hi>caſe.</hi>
And had I not a clear Call to enter upon this
Subject, thro the inadvertence of ſome <hi>young
Men</hi> among us, I had not meddled with it;
who have not only, without adviſing with me
or the <hi>Congregation,</hi> preſum'd to keep the <hi>Jewiſh
Sabbath,</hi> but with an unaccountable and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated
Zeal</hi> have proſecuted their Notion and
Practice to the diſturbing of the Quiet and
Peace of the Congregation. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> is
it not a lamentable thing to ſee how Satan hath
prevail'd to hinder the Power of Godlineſs,
which conſiſteth not in <hi>Meats and Drinks</hi> (nor
in the Obſervation of Jewiſh Days) <hi>but in
Righteouſneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and Peace, and Joy in the Holy
Ghoſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One while he hath endeavour'd to do this by
ſuggeſting of ſtrange and <hi>uncouth</hi> Notions, and
Principles that edify not, into the minds of
Chriſtians; at another time by raiſing up need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Cavils and Objections about the mode of
the diſcharge of a Moral as well as a Goſpel-Duty,
I mean that of <hi>ſinging the Praiſes of God,</hi>
which formerly caus'd no ſmall trouble <hi>amongst
us,</hi> as well as in other <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when that <hi>Controverſy</hi> was near van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd,
ſo another is rais'd, which I hope God
will make me an Inſtrument to quell alſo, and
utterly drive away hence, he having ſet me for
the defence of the Goſpel, and of all pure Goſpel-Truths,
in this place, in oppoſition to all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,</hi>
and <hi>Judaical Rites</hi> and Obſervations,
which ſome ſeem too fond of.</p>
               <p>Yet let none miſtake me: I ſhall not <hi>cenſure</hi>


                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61730:7"/>
ſuch as keep the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> provided they
lay no <hi>ſtreſs</hi> upon it, but believe they are <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd</hi>
by the Authority of Chriſt (who <hi>is Lord
of the Sabbath)</hi> to obſerve religiouſly the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi>
or firſt day of the Week, free from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
in the Worſhip and Service of God; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
alſo they are ſuch as have the command
of their own time, and can do it without
wronging their <hi>Families,</hi> or are not by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> neceſſitated to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Precepts that all agree are Moral Duties.</p>
               <p>1. In not doing their <hi>Fathers;</hi> or <hi>Maſters</hi> Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
in not working <hi>ſix days;</hi> for tho it may
be ſaid of ſome, <hi>ſix days Work may be done,</hi>
yet it may be ſaid of others who are Servants,
<hi>ſix days they muſt work,</hi> it being their indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Duty ſo to do.</p>
               <p>2. In violating the <hi>Fifth Commandment</hi> (as
the whole Moral Law is in the hands of Chriſt)
which requires Obedience to their <hi>Natural</hi> and
<hi>Political Parents:</hi> in all things wherein they
tranſgreſs no Law of God, they ought carefully
to ſubject themſelves to them; and in not doing
it,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 1.</note> they ſin and are guilty before God: <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
obey your Parents in the Lord; for this
is right:</hi> the Lord commands it, or it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Will.<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> Again, it is ſaid, <hi>Let every
Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 1.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Put
them in mind to obey Magiſtrates,</hi> &amp;c. And
again,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of
Man for the Lord's ſake; whether it be to the
King, as ſupreme,</hi> &amp;c. Whatſoever Magiſtrates
or Parents do require agreeable to the Divine
Will, ought faithfully to be done, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to God.</p>
               <p>And as to the religious obſervation of the
<hi>firſt day</hi> of the week, I ſhall prove before I
have done, that it is agreeable to the Will of


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61730:8"/>
God; and thoſe who obſerve it not, do violate
the Rule of the Goſpel, or the <hi>new Creation,</hi>
and ſo break both the Law of God and Man:
nay, it grieves my Soul to hear what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and Scandal ſome <hi>raſh young Men</hi> who
are <hi>Apprentices,</hi> have herein brought upon their
Profeſſion; and I hear ſome who know they
are Members with us, have unjuſtly blam'd
and cenſured me and the Church upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
not hearing what Pains I have taken to
convince them of their great Evil therein: and
I do now declare my abhorrence of their
<hi>Practices</hi> and unbecoming Behaviour to their
<hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters;</hi> and let ſuch as encourage
or countenance them, ſee how they will anſwer
it in the great day.</p>
               <p>But not to retain you any longer in a way of
Introduction, I ſhall proceed to my Text.</p>
               <p>And firſt to the occaſion of the words,<note place="margin">The occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> which
were written by holy <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Miniſter
of the Gentiles, to the Churches that were then
at <hi>Galatia;</hi> not <hi>Church</hi> in the ſingular, but <hi>to
the Churches</hi> (there were more at <hi>Galatia</hi> than
one) ſo it is expreſs'd <hi>1 Cor. 16. 2.</hi> And thus
he begins his Epiſtle, <hi>i. e. To the Churches of
Galatia,</hi> chap. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>He kindly ſalutes them,</hi> ver. 3. Grace be
unto you, and Peace from God the Father, and
from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>But ſoon upon it he ſharply reproves them,
ver. 6.</hi> I marvel ye are ſo ſoon removed from him
that called you to another Goſpel, <hi>ver. 7.</hi> Which
is not another; but there are ſome that trouble you,
and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query.</hi> What was the Error they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with?</p>
               <p>1. I anſwer, They were by ſome falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
taught to mix the Law and the Goſpel


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61730:8"/>
together in Juſtification, or to mix Works
with Grace: and this is to pervert the Goſpel of
Chriſt, and obſcure the Doctrine of Free-Grace.</p>
               <p>2. They turned to <hi>Judaiſm</hi> in reſpect of the
obſervation of Circumciſion and Jewiſh days:
<hi>How turn ye again to weak and beggarly Elements,
whereunto ye deſire again to be in Bondage?</hi> chap.
4. verſ. 9. Ye having (as if he ſhould ſay) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the knowledg of the glory of God in
the face of Jeſus Chriſt, the glorious Mediator,
Soveraign Lord, and only Lawgiver of his
Church, it is ſtrange you ſhould turn again to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo eclipſe the Glory of Chriſt; this
doth not comport with your former knowledg,
and of that Revelation you have had of the
Truth <hi>as it is in Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Beggarly Elements he doth not only mean
Circumciſion, but alſo obſervation of <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Days: Ye obſerve Days,</hi> &amp;c. he doth not
mean the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament days of
Worſhip,</hi> but <hi>Jewiſh days;</hi> he could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of them if they had only obſerv'd the <hi>firſt
day</hi> of the Week, becauſe he had given charge
to theſe Churches as well as others, religiouſly
to keep it, as appears <hi>1 Cor. 16. 1, 2, 3.</hi> but
they obſerv'd the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> and other
<hi>Old Teſtament days;</hi> nay, and they laid ſuch
ſtreſs upon them, as to make the obſervation of
them neceſſary to eternal Life, as ſome do now,
by affirming the keeping of the <hi>Seventh-day,</hi> or
<hi>old Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> is a <hi>Moral Duty,</hi> being of the
ſame nature with the firſt Commandment, viz.
<hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> or any
other ſimple Moral Precept. True, ſuch at
<hi>Rome</hi> as did eſteem ſome other day beſides the
<hi>firſt Day</hi> of the Week, and lookt upon it as an
indifferent thing, were not reproved, as <hi>Rom.
14. 5.</hi> The converted <hi>Jews</hi> perhaps thought


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61730:9"/>
they might keep the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath</hi> as well as
the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with them for a
time as Children, or Babes in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But when any came to plead for it as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Duty, or as neceſſary to Salvation, how
ſharp was he with them? <hi>I am afraid of you.</hi>
From hence by the way obſerve,</p>
               <p>That Jewiſh-day and ſhadowy Ordinances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, in compariſon of New Teſtament
Ordinances, are but weak and beggerly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Explanation.</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>Days,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Terms of the Text explained.</note> I underſtand the <hi>Jewiſh weekly
Sabbath-days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By <hi>Months,</hi> is meant their <hi>New Moons</hi> or
<hi>monthly Sabbaths,</hi> which were every new Moon.</p>
               <p>3. By <hi>Times,</hi> the <hi>Feaſts</hi> of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> the
<hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and that of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. By <hi>Years,</hi> every <hi>ſeventh Year,</hi> and every
<hi>fiftieth Year,</hi> which was their great Jubilee. I
find divers learned Men thus explaining theſe
Terms;<note place="margin">Perkins <hi>on</hi> Gal. <hi>p. 285.</hi>
                  </note> and tho Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſeems to go aſtray
afterwards, yet he ſpeaks much to the ſame
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now, my Brethren, the reaſons why I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
by Days here, are meant the <hi>Jewiſh week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sabbath-days,</hi> are,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of their
Feaſts, and Holy-days, he brings in firſt of all
their Seventh-day Sabbath, <hi>Levit. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If Days, Months, Times and Years,
comprehend all Days, Months, Times, and
Years which the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved; then their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
Sabbath is comprehended here: but
Days, Months, Times, and Years, comprehend
all Days, Months, Times and Years, that the
<hi>Jews</hi> obſerved; therefore it comprehends their
Seventh Day here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61730:9"/>
If the Minor be denyed, let our Opponents,
or any Perſon ſhew where Days, Months,
Times, and Years are mentioned, and yet the
Seventh-day not comprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perhaps it may be objected by ſome who keep
the Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My Brethren, theſe Chriſtians did not deſire
to be under the obſervation of Heatheniſh, but
of Jewiſh Days.</p>
               <p>They are called the Elements of the World,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note>
therefore not Jewiſh days.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Jewiſh Rites were called the</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>for does not</hi> Paul <hi>ſay,</hi> We
when Children were in bondage under the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the World? <hi>Gal. 4. 2, 3.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Beſides, they were ſuch Rudiments as the
Jews were to obſerve till the appointed time of
the Father. Now the Father never appointed
his Children <hi>Gentile idolatrous</hi> Rudiments,
therefore they could not be Heatheniſh Days.</p>
               <p>3. What Heatheniſh Nation kept the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
or the fiftieth Year as a Sabbath? For by
Years in our Text, our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> confeſs are
meant thoſe Years; and I am ſure by all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors
'tis ſo underſtood.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The</hi> Jewiſh Sanctuary <hi>is called a</hi> Worldly
Sanctuary; <hi>ſee</hi> Heb. 9. 1. Then verily the firſt
Covenant had alſo Ordinances of Divine Service,
and a Worldly Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>5. It is evident the Apoſtle means <hi>Moſaical</hi>
Rudiments, by blaming of <hi>Peter,</hi> who would
have the <hi>Gentiles</hi> live after the manner of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> Gal. 2. 14. Moreover, he refers, as all
may ſee, to the Jewiſh Yoke, <hi>Gal. 5. 1, 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61730:10"/>
6. <hi>To put it quite out of doubt what Days
he intends, read</hi> Col. 2. 16. Let no man judg you
in Meats, or Drinks, or in reſpect of a holy
Day, or of the New Moons, or of the Sabbath
Days; which are a Shadow of things to come, but
the Body is of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I. Now were any of the Idolatrous Days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathen, ſhadows of things to come,
or of Chriſt? was he, or that Reſt he hath
brought in, the Antitype of them?</p>
               <p>II. He ſpeaks of a <hi>Holy Day,</hi> as a Term gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Seventh-Day in the Old Teſtament,
and of Sabbath-Days; and do any think he
means by neither the Seventh-Day Sabbath,
and yet ſpeaks of <hi>Sabbath-Days</hi> diſtinct from
<hi>New-Moons, Times,</hi> and <hi>Years?</hi> Certainly he
muſt intend, in one or the other, the Jewiſh
weekly Sabbath days. I find a very Learned
Man writing on this Text, ſpeaking thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
for which alſo he cites St. <hi>Hierom:</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> writ
this Epiſtle in the ſixteenth year after Chriſt;
he lays it poſitively down that the Sabbath
was now abrogated, with the other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
which were to vaniſh at Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Let no man judg you,</hi> &amp;c. the Sabbath,
ſaith he, is well match'd with Meats and
Drinks, New Moons, and Holy Days, which
were all Temporary Ordinances, and to go
off the ſtage at our Saviour's entrance.</q> And
that <hi>Paul</hi> means the Seventh-day Sabbaths, he
cites <hi>Ambroſe, Hierom, Epiphanius, Chryſoſtom,
Auguſtin,</hi> and their particular Books: that
they underſtood <hi>Paul</hi> thus in <hi>Col. 2. 16.</hi> as he
did,<note place="margin">Praefat. in Galat. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal. 10.</note> take what <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith as follows; <q>There
is no Sermon of the Apoſtles, ſaith he, either
delivered by Epiſtle, or by word of Mouth,
wherein he labours not to prove, that all the
Burdens of the Law are now laid away (that


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61730:11"/>
all thoſe things which were before in Types
and Figures, namely the <hi>Sabbath, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
the <hi>New Moons,</hi> and the three Solemn
Feſtivals) did ceaſe upon preaching the Goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the Context, and from theſe Verſes, the
weekly Sabbath no doubt is included: For,</p>
               <p>1. It is part of the Hand-writing, <hi>verſ. 14.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is a Shadow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> verſ. 17.</p>
               <p>3. They are commanded not to ſubmit to
the Cenſures of men herein, <hi>verſ. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas it is objected,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> The Apoſtle doth
not mean the Weekly Sabbath.</p>
               <p>1. It is certain that the primary (and almoſt
conſtant) uſe of the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> is to denote
that weekly Day of Reſt which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Jews to obſerve;<note place="margin">Read Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> on the Subject.</note> and whereas it is
applied to any other Days, 'tis in alluſion to
this, becauſe of the Reſt from ſervile Work
upon them; in which reſpect they were like to
the Weekly Sabbath, as appears <hi>Levit. 16. 31.</hi>
and <hi>Chap. 23, 24, 32, 39.</hi> which are all the
places where the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> is expreſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to any other days: And therefore the
primary and almoſt conſtant uſe of the word
ought not to be forſaken.</p>
               <p>2. Wherever the word <hi>Sabbaths</hi> is uſed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,
as here, without any expreſſion in the
Text to limit it, 'tis to be underſtood of the
Weekly Sabbath: The reaſon of which Rule
is obvious, becauſe otherwiſe the Scripture
would be of doubtful Interpretation, and, as
<hi>1 Cor. 14. 8.</hi> the Trumpet would give an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſound.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore, as I ſaid, wherever the word
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> is uſed, as here, with diſtinction from
Holy Days, or Feaſts, and New Moons, it muſt
mean the Weekly Sabbaths, otherwiſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
would be guilty of an unneceſſary Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61730:11"/>
it being certain there is no other Day cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Scripture, but what is included
in thoſe two words. Therefore I conclude, by
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> in this Text not only may, but muſt
be underſtood the Weekly Sabbath; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
it proves not only that Chriſtians are
not bound to obſerve the Jewiſh Sabbath, but
that they ought not ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Take here what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith on this
Text,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> on the Lord's Day, <hi>P. 167</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>How plainly and expreſly <hi>Paul</hi>
numbereth Sabbaths with Shadows that ceaſe,
ſee <hi>Col. 2. 16.</hi> to paſs by other Texts; and
what violence mens own Wits muſt uſe in
denying the Evidence of ſo plain a Text.
The Reaſon that he ſaith not <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but
<hi>Sabbaths,</hi> is againſt themſelves, the plural
Number being moſt comprehenſive, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sabbaths receiving their name from this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> is always uſed in
Scripture for a Reſt, which was partly Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial.
See what Dr. <hi>Young</hi> in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Dies Domin.</hi>ſaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>III. Moreover, can any ſerious thinking Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſuppoſe that <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Apoſtle of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> would thus write of Sabbath
Days, New Moons, Times and Years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, if the Seventh-day Sabbath had
remained as the Sabbath of the Lord, and the
Day of Goſpel-worſhip? What, ſpeak thus
without reſtriction, or intimation, and yet
not include the Seventh-day Sabbath! Had not
that Day been comprehended and meant by
Sabbath Days, ſure he had let this Church have
known it; it behoved him to be faithful to us,
who was our Apoſtle, and ſo he ſays he was,
and had <hi>declared the whole Counſel of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> yet
makes no mention of any ſuch Jewiſh Sabbath
to be our duty to obſerve, but the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61730:12"/>
that it was a Shadow, and that we are
not to be judged or condemn'd, who regard it
not any more than other Times, as <hi>New Moons,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſaith the Seventh-day</hi> Sabbatarian,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>The</hi>
Ordinances of the Law were glorious, therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> could not refer to them when he ſpeaks of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
Elements. <hi>Thus</hi> Tillam.</p>
               <p>When compared to the Ordinances of the
Goſpel,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> they may be called weak and beggerly,
as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews, ſpeaking of the Law written in
two Tables of Stone, which he calls <hi>glorious,</hi>
2 Cor. 3. 7. yet a <hi>miniſtration of Death and
Condemnation,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>For even that which was
made glorious, had no Glory in this reſpect, by
reaſon of the Glory that excelleth,</hi> verſ. 10. The
Shadow ſeems glorious till the Subſtance comes;
but what Glory appears in it then? None at
all. What is the Glory of the Moon when the
Sun appears and ſhines forth ſplendidly? So
what ſignifies the Shadow of Reſt, to the true
<hi>Antitypical Sabbath of Reſt</hi> which we have in
Chriſt? <hi>we that believe, do enter into Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Jewiſh Ordinances,
Carnal Ordinances; which terms as much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
their Glory, as to call them weak and
beggerly Elements; Heb. 9. 10. <hi>Meats and
Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</hi>
Carnal Ordinances, no doubt, include
all the Jewiſh Sabbaths, <hi>viz.</hi> Days, Months,
Times, and Years, as well as Circumciſion, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Waſhings, and Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle calls them not only carnal,
weak, and beggerly Elements, but <hi>unprofitable:
There was a diſannulling of the Commandment
going before,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs
thereof.</hi> Take here what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, tho I in
ſome things differ from him. <q>For ſeeing in


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61730:12"/>
the Lord's Reſurrection is found the end and
fulfilling of the true Reſt,<note place="margin">Inſtit. 2. c. 8. Sect. 34.</note> which the old
Sabbath ſhadowed; by that very day, which
ſet an end to thoſe Shadows, Chriſtians are
admoniſhed not to ſtick to the ſhadowing
Ceremony.</q> He it ſeems concludes, that the
Jewiſh Weekly Sabbath, as well as their Fellows,
was a Shadow of that Reſt we have in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Take alſo what another nameleſs Author
ſaith concerning the Antient Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſharply reproveth thoſe who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
yet the Jewiſh Sabbath, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<hi>Days, Months, Times,</hi> and <hi>Years, as
if he had beſtowed his labour in vain upon
them,</hi> Gal. 4. 10, 11. But more particularly
in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Chap. 2. 16, 17.
<hi>Let no man judg you in reſpect of an Holy
Day, or of the New Moons, or of the Sabbath-Days,
which were a Shadow of things to come,
but the Body is of Chriſt.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding
all this care, both of the Apoſtles in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and more eſpecially of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
this Error, it grew up ſtill, and had

Point; it ſeemed to confirm the Jews
in their Incredulity, and might occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others to make queſtion of our Saviour's
coming in the Fleſh. Hence <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtin

and Earth as our only Lord and Lawgiver.<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note>
                  <hi>Thou ſeeſt, Brother, how many thouſands of the
Jews there are which believe, and they are all zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the Law;</hi> Acts 21. 20. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with them to <hi>purify himſelf,</hi> and to <hi>ſhave
his Head,</hi> v. 24. and on the like account, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with their weakneſs, he circumciſed <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy.</hi>
I might from hence by the way note,
that had we ſuch a Paſſage that <hi>Paul</hi> kept one
<hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> as we have here of his <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
Timothy,</hi> I ſuppoſe our Brethren would
make no ſmall advantage of it, that it is our
Duty from thence to keep it; but that might
have been on the ſame account and no better
ground, than it would be for us to plead for
Circumciſion, and be circumciſed, as <hi>Tillam,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61730:14"/>
Skip</hi> and <hi>Cooly</hi> were (as I am informed) who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
themſelves the Miniſters of the Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; Upon the ſame reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Jewiſh Rites, Days, and typical or
ſhadowy Ordinances, might, and were called
by their former and antient names, as well as
for diſtinction ſake: for tho thoſe legal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
were <hi>dead,</hi> yet as our <hi>Annotators</hi>
obſerve, they were not then <hi>deadly</hi> (if look'd
upon as indifferent things) however God
was pleaſed (they being his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
to vouchſafe them a gradual and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
funeral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Propoſition.</hi> But nevertheleſs after they
had been better inſtructed into the truth of the
Goſpel, and the change or end of the Law,
they were more plainly dealt with: I mean, he
more fully and clearly informed them, and
ſhewed them the great danger if they obſerved
thoſe legal Rites, Days, and Ordinances, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he ſaw they laid ſuch ſtreſs upon
them, as to make them neceſſary to eternal Life
as a Rule of Obedience.</p>
               <p>Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>teſtify unto
you, that if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit
you nothing,</hi> Gal. 5. 1. And why if circumciſed?
becauſe it was a ſhadow, and the keeping up the
ſhadow was a virtual denying that the Subſtance
was come; and beſides, they were thereby
bound to keep the whole Law. Such was the
natural tendency of obſerving one Legal Rite,
or Precept, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it being in that
Miniſtration a Covenant of Works; and he that
kept one was obliged to keep all, and he that
broke one was guilty of all.</p>
               <p>1. And if ſo, why might not <hi>Paul</hi> have told
them the ſame thing and danger if they kept the
legal Sabbath, which led them according to the


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61730:14"/>
Tenor of it, and in the ſtricteſt obſervance to
perfect Obedience; which is implyed in thoſe
words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not think thy own thoughts,
nor ſpeak thy own words?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Or provided they made it neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a holy Life in point of Obedience, as a
<hi>pure moral Precept,</hi> even of the ſame nature
with the firſt Commandment, <hi>viz. Thou ſhalt
have no other Gods but me;</hi> or the ſecond, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. or
the <hi>third,</hi> or <hi>fifth,</hi> or any of the reſt; I ſpeak not
of what is ſimply moral in the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
but of that preciſe <hi>ſeventh day:</hi> I
ſay, may not their danger be as great, if thus
they look'd upon thoſe Jewiſh Sabbaths, as if
circumciſed, becauſe then if they kept them not,
it neceſſarily muſt follow, it would exclude
them the Kingdom of Heaven, as all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
Acts, or actual breach of pure moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
would do?</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> tells them that thoſe Sabbaths
were a Shadow or Sign, ſo far as Circumciſion
was, as I have and ſhall further make appear;
and ſo hereby unwarily they would deny that
Chriſt was come to give us Reſt, and we do
not yet ceaſe working for Life in order to enter
into Reſt, which was held forth as the Tenor
of that Miniſtration of the Moral Law by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and particularly in their Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third Propoſit.</hi> Let it be conſider'd that the
ſubſtance of the whole Moral Law, or ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
(I mean <hi>materially,</hi> not <hi>formally)</hi>
was written in the Heart of <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and as written there, it contained the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works. And ſo long as he kept that
Law perfectly, he ſtood juſtified, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in him: and alſo that he had but one poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Precept given him to try his Obedience


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61730:15"/>
(according to the Tenor of this Covenant, and
Law of his Creation) is very evident, <hi>viz.

Good and Evil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Fourth Propoſit.</hi> That tho a time of Reſt, and
a ſufficient time to worſhip God be moral, yet
the particular preciſe day or time muſt be by
Revelation, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ſome poſitive Precept or
Example made known to Mankind; it being in
God, not in Man, not in Nature, not in Grace:
And God hath reſerved to himſelf a Power to
require, or to alter both the time, place, and
modes of his Worſhip as ſeems good in his ſight,
tho the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> Commandments be
moral and of the ſame nature with the reſt.
Moreover, God if he pleaſe may make a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Precept perpetual, and alike obligatory as
ſimple moral Precepts are, tho they differ in
reſpect of their own nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth Propoſit.</hi> All natural and pure moral
Precepts do, as I conceive, oblige all Mankind,
and are unchangeable in their nature as to the
matter of them, and differ greatly from Laws
or Precepts merely poſitive. Pure or ſimple
moral Precepts are good, good in themſelves,
and therefore commanded; but Precepts mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poſitive and arbitrary are commanded of
God, and therefore good: and that Goodneſs
that is in ſimple moral Precepts I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

which I underſtand not; yet I deny
not (as I ſaid before) but that God may make
a poſitive Command perpetually obligatory.
But more to this word <hi>moral,</hi> when I come to

               </p>
               <p>Now mere poſitive Precepts cannot be known
unleſs God by his Word, or in ſome ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
way, diſcovers them to his Creatures; and
ſuch was <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the preciſe <hi>ſeventh-day
Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and divers other things
under the Law: And ſuch is the <hi>firſt day</hi> of
the week under the Goſpel as a day of Reſt,
and of the ſolemn Worſhip of God, as alſo

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth Propoſit.</hi> That the whole Moral Law is
chang'd from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt; not only
chang'd as a Covenant of Works, but as a Rule
of Life: for tho the Moral Law as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or ſubſtance of it perpetually remains as a
Rule of Righteouſneſs, yet not as given in the
hand of <hi>Moſes, Exod. 20.</hi> but as in the hand
of Chriſt, conſider'd as Mediator, who is our
<hi>ſole Lord</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> Mat. 28. 18, 19. and
that we are to receive the Law from his mouth,
who is our <hi>antitypical</hi> High-Prieſt; <hi>And behold,
a Voice from the Cloud which ſaid, This is my
beloved Son, hear him:</hi> hear him excluſively of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> The Diſciples would have had three
Tabernacles, one for <hi>Moſes,</hi> one for <hi>Elias,</hi> and
another for Chriſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> they would have <hi>Moſes</hi>
to teach them, or be under his Miniſtration:
but in this Transfiguration, wherein was a clear
Repreſentation of the Goſpel Church-ſtate (ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61730:16"/>
by the Kingdom of God) in a Figure,
they ſaw there was none to be heard as a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
but Chriſt alone; <hi>And when they lifted up
their Eyes they ſaw no Man ſave Jeſus only,</hi> ver.
8. Certainly their Eyes are not open'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who go to <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> to know what their
Duty is in reſpect of any part of Goſpel-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
or day of Worſhip: Compare this place
of Scripture with <hi>Acts 3. 22, 23. For</hi> Moſes
<hi>truly ſaid to the Fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord
your God raiſe up to you, of your Brethren, like
unto me; him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> So <hi>Heb. 1. 1, 2, 3.</hi>
And again it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 35.</note> that <hi>the Servant abideth not
in the Houſe for ever: Moſes</hi> was a Servant,
and he had his day, and he is gone; but <hi>the Son
abideth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh Propoſit.</hi> That as <hi>old things are done
away, and all things become new;</hi> ſo is the old
Seventh-day Sabbath. And it behoves us to call
the Goſpel-day of Worſhip, or that Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Chriſt in the New Teſtament, by
that Name or Names given therein to it, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>firſt day,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> and <hi>day of
Reſt,</hi> or Sabbath, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> aptly enough
calls it on <hi>Heb. 4. 11.</hi> Therefore tho the day
of Reſt under the Goſpel is not call'd a <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
yet I ſhall blame none that ſo call it, ſince Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
ſignifies <hi>Reſt:</hi> and this is our only <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eighth Propoſit.</hi> That the Moral Law or Law

<hi>whole Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. Let it be conſider'd alſo,
that that Law and Covenant was not made with,
nor given to any other People but the People
and Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only: ſo that as it had but
its time, conſider'd as a Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
or as in his hands, it did ceaſe as ſo conſider'd,
and could not oblige any to obſerve it as there
formerly deliver'd (while it was in force) but
ſuch only as were under it; tho I deny not, but
affirm the whole World were under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and oblig'd

that there is yet remaining in it an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

there is an alteration made from the

the firſt Day of the Week; whether was
this Tranſlation of the Day of the ſolemn

Thus far the Doctor, who ſays many other
things neceſſary to be conſidered about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of a Day of Worſhip, whether as


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61730:20"/>
to the Work of the Day it ought to be kept
with the like ſtrictneſs as the Jewiſh Sabbath
in all reſpects, and what Duties are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on it; as alſo as to the proper Limits
of that Day, ſome pleading it ought to be
from Evening to Evening as the Jews kept it,
or from Morning to Evening, that is from after
twelve a Clock in the Morning to twelve the
next Evening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what the Doctor notes, it appears that
the Caſe in controverſy calls for much ſtudy
and diligence; and it may be accounted an Act
of great weakneſs in any Perſons to obſerve the
Seventh Day to the diſturbance of the Church,
without enquiring of ſuch as God has enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in theſe things, and to whom the care of
their Souls are committed, to ſee what can be
ſaid againſt it. Is it wiſdom to adviſe with
thoſe only that are for it, and not with ſuch
alſo as are directly againſt it? This ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

               <p>I ſhall endeavour to clear moſt of thoſe

1. If the Law of God written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
heart in Innocency, did not oblige him to keep the
Seventh Day as a Sabbath, that Law cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
Gentile Believers to keep it.</p>
               <p>2. If a poſitive Law, or expreſs Inſtitution, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be given to <hi>Adam</hi> before, or juſt after his
Fall, doth not oblige Gentile Believers to keep it:</p>
               <p>3. If the Law written in the Hearts of the
Gentiles, or the moſt refined and enlightned among
them, doth not oblige Gentile Believers to keep it:</p>
               <p>4. If the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Law written
in the two Tables of Stone, doth not oblige Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Believers to keep it:</p>
               <p>5. If the Goſpel, by any Precept or Example,
doth not oblige them to keep the Seventh Day as
a Sabbath:</p>
               <p>6. And laſtly, <hi>If the Law written in the
Hearts of all Goſpel-Believers by the Holy Spirit,
doth oblige them to keep the Seventh Day as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
to the Lord:</hi> Then I infer it is not their
Duty to keep the Seventh-Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for I know
no other way, or means whereby Gentile Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
can pretend to know they are obliged to
keep the Seventh-Day as a Sabbath, or a Day
of Reſt and ſolemn Worſhip. But by none of
theſe ways or means, believing Gentiles are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to keep the Seventh-Day as a Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
therefore it is not the Duty of Gentile Believers
to keep it. To proceed,</p>
               <p>1. Let it be conſidered, that if the keeping
of the Seventh-Day as a Sabbath, <hi>i. e.</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Day from the Creation of the World,
were a purely natural or ſimply moral Precept,
no doubt but it was legibly written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
<hi>Heart;</hi> I mean as a Law of Creation, and ſo
part of the <hi>holy Image of God,</hi> or of the ſame
nature with all other moral Precepts that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
from the Perfections of God's holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61730:21"/>
and not from the Soveraignty of his
Will only: And if it was ſo written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Heart in Innocency, he needed no poſitive Law
to make it known to him. What, was any
thing that was purely or ſimply moral, even
that which belonged to good Manners, or to
true natural Godlineſs or Righteouſneſs, not
made known to <hi>Adam,</hi> to perfect <hi>Adam?</hi> this
certainly cannot be.</p>
               <p>That ſpiritual Worſhip which is due to God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Charnock</hi> on the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, <hi>p. 131.</hi>
                  </note>
ſaith Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> is known by the Light of
Nature: But much more, ſay I, was it clearly
manifeſted to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency. <q>But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
ſaith he, the outward means or
matter of that Worſhip which would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, was not known by the Light
of Nature: the Law for a ſpiritual Worſhip
by the Faculties of our Souls was natural, and
part of the Law of Creation; tho the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the particular Acts, whereby God
would have this Homage teſtified, was of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Inſtitution, and depended not on the
Law of Creation. Tho <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence
knew God was to be worſhipped, yet by
nature he did not know by what outward
Acts he was to pay this Reſpect, or at what
<hi>Time</hi> he was more ſolemnly to be exerciſed in
it than another: This depended on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
God, as the Soveraign Governor and
Lawgiver, ſhould preſcribe; you ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
find the poſitive Inſtitution </q> It is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that this great Man is not here concerned
to confute the Seventh-day Sabbatarians, but
about another thing; yet affirms (with many
other Learned Men) that <hi>Adam</hi> by the Law of
Creation, did not know in Innocency at what
time God was more ſolemnly to be worſhipped
than another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61730:21"/>
2. No doubt but the ſubſtance of all the ten
Precepts was wrote in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart;<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all Moral Precepts written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart.</note> yet it
appears the knowledg of the Seventh-day to be
kept as a Sabbath was not written there, tho
that which was ſimply and naturally moral of
the fourth Commandment was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I argue thus: If the preciſe Seventh-day
was written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart,<note place="margin">The Law of the <hi>7th</hi> day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath not written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart.</note> there had
been no need of an Inſtitution or poſitive Law
to make it known to him; for, what more need
had he of an outward Revelation of this, than
of the other Commandments?</p>
               <p>Take here what a Learned Man hath ſaid:
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>P.</hi> a Miniſter at <hi>Rouen</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> p. 3.</note> If the keeping of the Seventh-day were a
Moral Duty, our <hi>Father Adam,</hi> by that
Light of Nature God put in his Mind when
he created him, would have known it, as well
as he knew all other things in themſelves good
and neceſſary; but he neither had, nor ſhould
have had any knowledg thereof, if God had
not injoined it to him by a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
(as thoſe which maintain the morality
of the Sabbath do avouch.)</q> So that this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
manifeſtly, that the obſervation of the
Seventh-day depends merely on Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Brethren,</hi> Let this be conſidered well,
that if the knowledg of the Seventh-day wholly
depended on the Will of God, or on mere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and reſulted not, as all pure and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
moral Precepts do, from the holy Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of God's Nature, it follows that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Day pertains not to the Eſſence of the
Fourth Commandment, but the ſimple Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that Precept lies only in a time of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
And certainly if God by a mere poſitive
Command had not given it to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they had
no more known it their duty to keep it, than
the Pagan World did, who were wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61730:22"/>
thereof, as I ſhall prove. And be ſure if
God wrote not the Law or knowledg of the
Seventh-day Sabbath on <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart;
the Seventh-day is not of the ſame nature
with ſimply moral Precepts, which God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved
on his Heart, even the ſubſtance or
tenor of all the Ten Commandments, and
made him know them naturally, without any
inſtruction by word of mouth. But it appears
by their own Aſſertion, <hi>it was inſtituted,</hi> &amp;c.
Therefore the knowledg of the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> as
a ſpecial time of Worſhip, was not wrote in his
Heart. Our Opponents dare not deny but the
ſubſtance of the whole Moral Law was wrote
in his Heart, and they foreſee it is dangerous to
deny it: From whence it appears, that all the
other Precepts are ſimply moral, and ſo is a
time of Worſhip; but the preciſe Seventh-day,
by their own <hi>conceſſion,</hi> was inſtituted
in Man's Innocency, and ſo depends wholly
upon an expreſs poſitive Command, declared to
<hi>Adam</hi> by audible Words reſounding in his
Ears.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Tillam<hi>'s Book,</hi> p. 7.</note> It was inſtituted before the

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tho I believe no ſuch matter, nor can
any Man prove it, yet to grant it, for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſake,
then I ſay it follows, it was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart; for the being perfect, he
would naturally have known it without being
told it was his Duty to keep it. For conſider
that he was created on the <hi>Sixth Day,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
what was naturally and univerſally good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Inſtitution, and none of the reſt?</p>
               <p>

under expreſs Inſtitution on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
as well as he brought the ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
in Paradiſe under expreſs Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny it not; God did then ſee good
ſo to do, conſidering how the Nature of Man
was corrupted, and his Law written in his
Heart was blotted and blur'd by the Fall. But
let it be conſider'd, that the Law was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in two Tables of Stone, ſo much for a Rule
of Life, as for other reaſons:<note place="margin">The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God added the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Law wrote in two Tables of Stone.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. It was added and written there, to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Sin on the Conſcience; <hi>It was added</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Pual) becauſe of Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. it was
to make Sin appear <hi>exceeding ſinful,</hi> Rom. 7. 13.</p>
               <p>2. It was written there to ſhew the Creature
his ſad and woful condition, and to make known
how unable fallen Man was to fulfil the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of God.</p>
               <p>3. And as a <hi>Schoolmaſter</hi> to lead ſuch as were
under it, to Chriſt, in whom perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
only is to be found; Man being not able
to keep perfectly that holy and juſt Law.</p>
               <p>4. And to ſhew them, as I conceive, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Finger of God could write his
holy Law in the ſtony Hearts of Sinners, as
ſhall be further demonſtrated hereafter; for
that whole Miniſtration of the Law and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
I ſhall prove was a ſhadow and typical,
and ſo no ſtanding Law or Miniſtration as
there written, but as it is in the hand of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>5. That whole Law, and conſequently the
Seventh-day Sabbath, was given on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi>
as it ſuted the Judaical <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> as well
their <hi>Political</hi> as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical ſtate.</hi> There are
many Additions made to the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61730:23"/>
together with other Ends annex'd, and
Deſigns and Uſes thereto employ'd; which is
granted by ſuch as aſſert it was given to <hi>Adam</hi>
in Paradiſe<note n="*" place="margin">This gave a new ſtate to it, ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen, p. 8, 9.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it had been given to <hi>Adam</hi> in
Innocency, he not knowing without an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it was his Duty to keep it, I argue from
hence: it follows that he had the ſame need of
knowing what ſpecial Worſhip he outht to be
found exerciſed in on that day. What, a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
inſtituted, and no Sabbath-Service appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that day? But this I ſhall further handle
when I come to ſpeak of the pretended Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and expreſs Command given to <hi>Adam</hi> in
Innocency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Law of the Seventh-day
Sabbath was wrote in <hi>Adam's</hi> Heart, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of the knowledg of that day would
have been left in the Heart of his Offspring,
as there is of all other Precepts that are ſimply
moral: tho much blur'd, and almoſt quite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated
in ſome, yet there were many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
who retain'd, or recover'd much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God's Law firſt written in the Heart
of Man; yea, they were led to the knowledg
of all pure moral Precepts, <hi>i.e.</hi> that <hi>there was
but one God,</hi> and that <hi>he was to be worſhipped,</hi>
and <hi>his Name not profan'd;</hi> that <hi>they ſhould
not murder, commit Adultery, ſteal,</hi> &amp;c. nay and
alſo to the knowledg of the <hi>fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as to what was ſimply moral in it, <hi>viz.
a ſufficient time</hi> to worſhip that God; yet
they were none of them led to know that they
ought to keep the ſeventh day as a Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Moreover, if the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
had been a ſimple, or pure moral Precept,
and written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart, it would have
been written in the Hearts of all God's <hi>New-Covenant</hi>


                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61730:23"/>
Children, as he promiſed he would
write his Law there, in Goſpel-times: and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it is that all Believers in Chriſt, whether
Jews or Gentiles, have the Image of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
to them, it being ſtampt upon their
Hearts by the Spirit of God; hence it is ſaid,
<hi>who after God are created in Righteouſneſs, and
true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4. 24. nay, they are all ſaid
<hi>to be renew'd in Knowledg, after the Image of
him that created them,</hi> Col. 3. 10. But in the
ſecond Impreſſion of God's holy Law and
Image thus written on our Hearts, there is not
one line, nor lineament of any knowledg that
it is our Duty to keep the ſeventh day as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
to the Lord, which I ſhall further evince
hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Take what a learned Man ſaith: <q>If
<hi>Adam</hi> was bound to keep the Sabbath, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
by what Law? by the Law written in
his Heart? Why then he was bound to keep
a Sabbath before there was a Sabbath to keep:
for the Law was ingraven on his Heart on the
<hi>ſixth day,</hi> as a branch of that Divine Image
of God concreated with him; whereas the
Sabbath (to be ſure) could not be inſtituted
till the ſeventh day, if then.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Before I cloſe this, let me note here
what is ſaid concerning this very thing by the
<hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> and Primitive Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who it appears deny'd the knowledg of
the Seventh-day Sabbath was written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Heart.<note place="margin">Juſt. Mart. Reſpon. ad qu. <hi>p. 69.</hi> Theod. <hi>on</hi> Ezek. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> See <hi>Juſtin Martyr. Theodoret</hi> ſaith, that
theſe Commandments, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou
ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> and
others of that kind, were generally implanted
by Nature in the minds of Men; but for the
keeping of the Sabbath, it came not in by
Nature, but by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61730:24"/>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> affirms (ſaith my Author) that
neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor any Man liv'd without the
Law imprinted on the Soul of Man, as made a
living Creature; but neither he nor any other of
them ſay the ſeventh day was one of thoſe Laws.
Alſo <hi>Rivet</hi> and others, who plead for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the Sabbath, dare not, ſaith he, refer
the keeping of it to the Law written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Heart.</p>
               <p>So that I may from what has been ſaid poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
affirm, the Precept of keeping the ſeventh
day was not written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;
and therefore that believing Gentiles
are not oblig'd to keep the ſeventh day from
that Law.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo I infer, it could not be
written in the Hearts of any of the Jews or
Gentiles; for doubtleſs <hi>Adam</hi> by nature knew
that which corrupt Man never ſo perfectly
knew: and it were great Preſumption in any,
ſince Sin was ſo generally prevailing, to ſay they
knew in a natural way that which <hi>Adam</hi> knew
not. Beſides, is it not great folly for any to
ſay this, ſince the Law in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart was
the original? And ſhall a <hi>blur'd Copy</hi> be deem'd
more perfect than that, or the <hi>muddy Stream</hi>
be clearer than the <hi>Chryſtal Fountain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, ſince it appears the Law of the
Seventh-day Sabbath was not written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Heart, but that he needed an expreſs poſitive
Law to know it, or diſcover it to him, I infer,
much more need there was for poor Gentiles,
nay for Believers, to have an expreſs Law to
diſcover it to them. And ſince our Opponents
affirm that the Commandment of the preciſe
ſeventh day as a Sabbath, is of the ſame nature
and quality with the firſt Commandment, and
all other ſimply moral Precepts, <hi>i. e.</hi> not only


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61730:24"/>
a time of Worſhip, or one day in ſeven, but
the preciſe ſeventh day from the Creation; I
infer then what a woful condition are all we in,
that break, or violate in the very Letter a ſimply
moral Command, nay and <hi>teach Men ſo to do?</hi>
may, and how could our Saviour then be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin, who made Clay on that day, and did
many other Works, and commanded a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to be born, and alſo commended Acts of
Mercy (which was but a moral Duty) above
keeping of the Seventh-day Sabbath;<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſtrict Obſervation of that with Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which all know were but mere poſitive
Laws to <hi>Iſrael</hi> under that Legal Diſpenſation.
But more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But tho it was not written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Heart that he ſhould keep the ſeventh day as a
Sabbath, yet it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency
by a poſitive Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſooner ſaid than proved:<note place="margin">No poſitive Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> to keep the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> but
let me tell you, that the Law of Nature our
Opponents acknowledg was antecedent to the
Inſtitution of the Sabbath, and that all purely
moral Precepts were certainly written in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Heart. Now can the preciſe ſeventh day be
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Duty to keep before it was ſanctified to
that end? this is to ſay a thing was before it
was, and that the Law of Creation teaches that
which it was impoſſible to teach, and alſo that
Revealed Religion may be known by natural
Dictates or Principles, which is abſurd to affirm;
beſides, all confeſs that mere poſitive Precepts or
Commands in inſtituted Worſhip may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
or chang'd, as the great Lawgiver pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to <hi>anſwer</hi> what is affirm'd about
its Inſtitution in Paradiſe, as given to <hi>innocent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi>
we will come to, and well weigh the words
of this pretended poſitive Precept given to


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61730:25"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe: Gen. 2. 2. <hi>And on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day God ended his Work which he had
made; and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all
his Work which he had made.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>And God
bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it; becauſe
that in it he had reſted from all Work, which God
created and made.</hi> Theſe are the words which
contain what is call'd the Inſtitution and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Sabbath to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe.
<hi>Tillam</hi> and others make a great noiſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
inſtituted in Paradiſe, and given to <hi>Adam</hi>
to keep: but Brethren, I muſt tell you that the
Learned ſtrangely differ among themſelves, who
would have the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Sabbath thus
early; ſome of them affirming it was given to
<hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency; others ſay not till he fell.
One ſpeaks thus;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Geo. Walker</hi>'s Doctrine of the holy Sabbath, <hi>p. 10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>And for the time when God
firſt inſtituted the Sabbath, I conceiv'd it to have
been not in the ſtate of Innocency, but after Mans
Fall immediately, and yet upon the ſeventh day,
wherein God reſted.</hi> Theſe are his very words.
From hence I obſerve, he believ'd <hi>Adam</hi> did
not ſtand in his Innocency one day, and
this he endeavours to prove; and others as
well as he, Men of great Learning and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Let me cite here one more<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi>'s Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated.</note>, <q>I ſhall
propoſe (ſaith he) and endeavour to prove
a counter Poſition, namely, that it ſeems more
conſonant to Scripture (tho at the beginning)

to the keeping of any ſuch day whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

is there any trace of ſuch a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be found till the coming of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>

aſſign'd to them the ſeventh day of the week,<note place="margin">P. 20.</note>
as a particular point of Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereof he preſcrib'd unto them all the
particular Rites.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now my Brethren, I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
               <p>1. What is ſaid by thoſe who affirm it was
given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, whoſe Arguments
ſeem to me of no weight at all.</p>
               <p>2. I ſhall take notice what is ſaid by thoſe
learned Men who deny it was given to <hi>Adam</hi>
in Innocency, and affirm it was not given as
a Command till <hi>Iſrael</hi> came into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.
To begin with thoſe who affirm God
gave it to <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall in Paradiſe, or
in his ſtate of Innocency.</p>
               <p>1. They ground it upon what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in
<hi>Gen. 2.</hi> becauſe it is there mention'd as the <hi>day
on which God reſted from all his Works.</hi>

Opinions about its Commencement; comes to
tell us,<note place="margin">P. 55.</note> 
                  <q>That the Opinion of the Inſtitution of
the Sabbath from the beginning of the World,
is founded principally on a double Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
<hi>Firſt,</hi> From the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> Gen. 2.
1, 2, 3. becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>God bleſſed the
ſeventh day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 62.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſanctified it;</hi> not, ſaith he,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61730:26"/>
that God kept it holy himſelf, nor that he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
it, and made it inherently holy, which
the nature of the day is not capable of; nor
that he celebrated that which in it ſelf was
holy; but that he ſet it apart to ſacred uſe.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> The Teſtimony to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſaith he, taken out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is in <hi>Heb. 4. 3, 4. For we which believe
do enter into Reſt, as he ſaid, As I have ſworn
in my Wrath, if they ſhall enter into my Reſt,
altho the Works were finiſhed from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World. For he ſpeaketh in a certain
place on this wiſe, And God did reſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Day from all his Works.</hi> Now, ſaith
the Doctor, the Works, and the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, did not at all belong to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's
Diſcourſe, but only as they denoted
the beginning of the Seventh-day Sabbath;
for it is the ſeveral Reſts of God alone that
he is enquiring after.</q> But to paſs by what the
Doctor ſaith;</p>
               <p>1. Let this be conſidered, that in this place
only of all <hi>Paul'</hi>s Writings mention is made of the
Seventh-day; but not one word here intimating
that 'twas our duty to obſerve that Day under
the Goſpel; which had it been the Chriſtian
Sabbath, no doubt he would have given ſome
hint of at this turn.</p>
               <p>2. By the manner of his Words and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
comparing theſe two Verſes together,
it ſeems the Sabbath did not commence from
the beginning of the world; for tho God reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Seventh-day, and might then ſet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
yet he might give no Command to keep
it till after-times, when Sabbath-day Service or
Worſhip was appointed: This I rather think
from theſe words, <hi>Altho the Works were finiſhed
from the Foundation of the World;</hi> yet the Day,


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61730:26"/>
as Man's Duty, was not given till long after;
for, as our <hi>Annotators</hi> obſerve, <hi>Paul</hi> alludes to
<hi>Exod. 31. 17. For he ſpeaks in a certain place on
his wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

for this Circumſtance we have not expreſly in

                  <q>1. By way of Purpoſe and <hi>Deſtination</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. By way of <hi>actual uſe</hi> and <hi>imployment,</hi>
as when the <hi>Levites</hi> were admitted to the
actual Service of the Tabernacle. God's
reſting from his Works,<note place="margin">He calls it Sabbath.</note> and ſanctifying the
ſeventh day, were coetaneous in the firſt ſenſe,
<hi>i. e.</hi> by way of Purpoſe and Intention, which
<hi>Moſes</hi> relates; but not in the latter, by way
of actual Execution. As ſoon as he had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Work, he ordained the ſeventh day,
the day of his own Reſt, to be that on which
his Church ſhould reſt, and follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;

owns God did ſanctify the day then by way
of Deſtination—That as God then actually
reſted, ſo he actually ſanctified the day; but
that therefore he then commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to
obſerve it, doth not follow: for that God
did then <hi>ſanctify,</hi> that is, deſtinate that day

thing; and to command <hi>Adam</hi> to obſerve it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>MY Brethren, there are three ſorts of
Perſons I have little hopes of doing
good to in preaching on this Subject.</p>
               <p>1. Such as thro ſelf-conceit are ſo fond of
their own Apprehenſions, that they reſolve not
to regard the ſtrongeſt Arguments againſt what
they believe: thus it is with ſome who have
ſucked in dangerous Errors; who if a Book
be preſented to them, preſently cry, away with
it, we will not read it: they are not like him
that ſaid, <hi>What I know not, teach thou me;</hi> nor
like the <hi>great Appollos,</hi> who was ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
further Light by a <hi>poor Man</hi> and his
Wife, much inferior to him both as to Parts,
Knowledg, and Learning, <hi>Acts 18.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> are ſuch as thro the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Capacities are not able to take in
the ſtrength of an Argument; and therefore,
let never ſo much be ſaid, do intimate it is all
little or nothing to them.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>third ſort</hi> are ſuch as ſeem indifferent
whether they keep the ſeventh, or the firſt day,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61730:37"/>
or perhaps any at all, as a ſpecial day to the
Lord: theſe not ſeeing the danger of obſerving
the old Jewiſh Sabbath, nor of their indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
about keeping any day at all, trouble not
themſelves at all about this matter. But to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aſs this, and proceed.</p>
               <p>I have proved, 1. <hi>That the Command for, or
knowledg of keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath was
not written in</hi> Adam<hi>'s Heart. 2. That there was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> poſitive Command given to him, to obſerve that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay above any other, either before or immediately
after his Fall.</hi> A time to worſhip God was
wrote in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart no doubt; and indeed
all his time, while in Innocency, he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
led to give up to his <hi>bleſſed Creator.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">All <hi>Adam</hi>'s time in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in adoring his bleſſed Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</note> What
had he to do, but to <hi>adore,</hi> and <hi>contemplate</hi> the
<hi>Perfections</hi> of his <hi>bountiful Creator?</hi> and could
he have done it better on one day than another?
The beſt and higheſt Acts of Worſhip he was
capable of performing would have been his
work and delight for ever, had he abode in
that ſtate: for Perfection admits of no greater
Number, Meaſure, Degrees, or Additions.</p>
               <p>Now I may infer from hence: If the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God to obſerve the ſeventh day was
not wrote in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart, then it is not
written in the Hearts of any of his Offspring
by Nature: For as I have ſaid, the <hi>muddy
Stream</hi> cannot be clearer than the <hi>Chryſtal
Fountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Brethren who keep the ſeventh day,
and ſome others affirm, <hi>that the Patriarchs from</hi>
Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes <hi>did keep that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I deny, and if I put them to
prove it,<note place="margin">The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs did not keep the ſeventh day Sab.</note> they can never do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I grant that from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> the
holy and pious <hi>Patriarchs</hi> not only diſcharged
all Duties of natural Religion, but all Duties


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61730:38"/>
given by expreſs Command to them; yet we
read not that God commanded them to keep
the ſeventh day, or reminded them of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Precept given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to
them. And no doubt they obſerved a ſufficient
time for the Worſhip of God, it may be a part
of every day, or more than one in ſeven: for
they not only improved their natural Light
and Knowledg, but had a ſpecial Revelation of
the Will of God to them; yet we find not the
leaſt intimation that any of them kept the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abel</hi> we read ſacrificed; and this of offering
Sacrifices could not be known by the Light of
Nature; God therefore commanded him ſo to
do, or revealed it ſome way or another in a
ſupernatural way to him, becauſe <hi>him and his
Offering God had reſpect unto:</hi> beſides, he did it
in <hi>Faith,</hi> and Faith muſt have a Rule to act by;
but we do not read he offer'd Sacrifices on the
<hi>ſeventh day,</hi> or kept that day as a <hi>Sabbath:</hi> had
he kept one Sabbath-day, tho no mention is
made of any Command he had ſo to do, we
ſhould no more doubt of it, but conclude he
had ſuch a Command, as we believe he had for
his offering Sacrifices; but if he or any other
of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had kept the ſeventh day as a
Sabbath, would it from thence follow it was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Precept, and obligatory on us, any more than
their offering Sacrifices obliges us ſo to do?</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Men who began to call upon the
Name of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 4. 26. or to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the Name of the Lord, as one reads
it,<note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> Annot. on the place.</note> but not a word of ſuch a Sabbath obſerv'd
by them. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> reads it thus, <hi>Then began
Men profanely to call upon the Name of the Lord:</hi>
and one of the <hi>Rabins</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rabbi Maimon.</note> ſaith, in thoſe days
Idolatry took its firſt beginning; ſo that from


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61730:38"/>
hence there can no Proof be taken that they kept
the ſeventh-day as a Sabbath. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked
with God <hi>three hundred years,</hi> and certainly if
he had kept the Sabbath we ſhould have had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome account of it; but as we read of no ſuch
matter, ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as I find him cited
by approved Authors, declares <hi>Enoch</hi> was one
if thoſe that was not circumciſed, neither kept
the Sabbath.<note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 30. Ad Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos.</note> And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> mentioning <hi>Enoch,</hi>
with my Author, ſpeaks thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Enoch <hi>that
righteous Man, being neither circumciſed, nor a
Sabbath-keeper, was by the Lord tranſlated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as it cannot be proved that the ſeventh
day was obſerved before the Flood, ſo we have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o reaſon to believe it was kept by <hi>Noah,</hi> in
thoſe days the Flood overflow'd the World:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and therefore a true Worſhipper of
God; but we read not of his keeping the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
Sabbath.</p>
               <p>I know ſome would catch at that Expreſſion,
<hi>Gen. 8. 10, 12.</hi> that <hi>Noah ſtay'd ſeven days
before he ſent out the Dove;</hi> as if this might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>id for a reaſon why <hi>Noah</hi> ſtay'd ſeven days,

                  <q>
                     <hi>Noah,</hi> ſaith he,
deſired to know whether the Waters were
decreaſed. Now the Waters being regulated
by the Moon, <hi>Noah</hi> was moſt eſpecially to
regard her Motions: for as ſhe is either in
Oppoſition or Conjunction with the Sun in
her increaſe or wane, there is proportionably
an increaſe or falling of the Waters. <hi>Noah</hi>
then conſidering the Moon in her ſeveral
quarters, which commonly we know are at
ſeven days diſtance, ſent forth his Dove to


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61730:39"/>
bring him tydings: for the Text tells us, that
he ſent out the Raven and the Dove four
times; and the fourth time, the Moon being
in the laſt quarter, when both by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of Nature the Waters uſually are,
and by the Will of God were then much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
the Dove which was ſent out, had
found good footing on the Earth.</q> There is
greater reaſon to believe this than to ſuppoſe
it refer'd to the Sabbath.<note n="*" place="margin">De E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat. Temp. <hi>l. 5.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Scaliger,</hi> ſaith my
Author, one while thought the day on which,
<hi>Noah</hi> left the Ark and offered Sacrifices, to be
the ſeventh day; but in the next Edition he
fixed that day to be the fourth day of the week.
Now after the Flood we find God gave to <hi>Noah</hi>
and his Sons ſome expreſs Laws and Commands,
<hi>i. e.</hi> not to <hi>eat Blood,</hi> and forbidding <hi>Murder,</hi> &amp;c.
Now this is the time doubtleſs to hear of a
Sabbath, and of the charge about it, if God
had given it either to <hi>Adam</hi> before or after
the Fall; but not one word is mention'd, for
'tis not ſaid, <hi>Remember the ſeventh day,</hi> &amp;c. or
ye ſhall obſerve my Sabbath.<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> Now from <hi>Shem,

even the whole World; and to me it
ſeems not probable, had the Sabbath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſhould not at this time
have given them a charge about it, there being
then ſo few poſitive Laws inſtituted; here is
Blood forbid to the whole World, and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>

Command to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he took (we find)
as much notice of their obſerving his Sabbaths
as of any other Duty injoined on them, and
this to their great Commendation. Therefore
had the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> been oblig'd to keep it, no
doubt they had as faithfully diſcharged their
Duty therein, as any of God's Servants did in
after times; and God beſure would have left
ſomething on Record to their Commendation.</p>
               <p>

might be given to <hi>Adam</hi> after his <hi>Fall;</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Fall it could not be a Law to him, for
the reaſons I have urged: but if they could
produce ſuch an Example, yet ſay ſome learned
Men, it doth no more prove that preciſe day is
a moral Precept, or that it from hence follows,
that it is our Duty in Goſpel-times to obſerve
it, than it proves 'tis our Duty to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which we read (before the Ceremonial

               <p>But ſince there is not one Inſtance to be given

that all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did keep it.</p>

given to them in <hi>Mara, Exod. 15.</hi> and others
of them to <hi>Exod. 16.</hi> yet the ſaid <hi>Reverend

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. The firſt and chief place I find he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is that in</hi> Gen. 18. 19. For I know him,
that he will command his Children and his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
after him, and they ſhall keep the ways of
the Lord, and do Juſtice and Judgment.</p>
               <p>Anſw. That <hi>Abraham</hi> had this Charge and
Commandment given to him is granted: but what
little reaſon there is from hence to conclude he
kept the Sabbath, or gave charge to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſo to do, I will leave to all Mens Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
God gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> Commands, we
find that evident enough; and ſome of them not
very eaſy to Fleſh and Blood, as that of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his only Son. Moreover, none doubt of
the faithfulneſs of the <hi>Patriarch Abraham;</hi> but
if the Sabbath was not then inſtituted, nor any
Command given to him to keep it, there could
not be any ſuch Command meant or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in that Charge given to him. The
truth is, my Brethren, learned Men, who are
Men alſo of great natural Parts, can put a fair
gloſs on any thing, and make that ſeem to be
a Truth that there is not the leaſt ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> did all he did in Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had Divine Authority for all he did in

               <p>Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi>'s main Argument to prove that
the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> obſerved the Seventh-day Sabbath,


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61730:42"/>
is this,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> on the Chriſtian Sab. <hi>p. 57.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>viz. The Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day
and ſanctified it,</hi> therefore ſaith he the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>
did obſerve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, God bleſſed the ſeventh
day and ſanctified it, but did not give any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to <hi>Adam</hi> to keep it; therefore the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
from thence could not know, or ſee they
had any ground to obſerve it.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſaith in the ſame place, <hi>i. e.</hi> 
                  <q>And
the truth is, until the coming of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> we read not of
any Church of God any where but in ſingle
Families; neither do we read of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>
before the Flood, or a long time after,
that they kept any day conſecrated to God's
Service.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But we ſay with him, that it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow that they kept no day at all in God's
Service. They owned the True God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
him, and knew that there muſt be a
time, a ſufficient time to diſcharge that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or Worſhip to him; and tho perhaps
they obſerv'd one day in ſeven, yet, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
they did not know what preciſe day they
ought to obſerve above any other, until God
by ſome expreſs poſitive Command made it
known, which was not till he conſtituted the
whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into a Typical Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and gave them an inſtituted Worſhip, and
commanded their Legal and Typical Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Beſides, how could the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> know what
Duties proper for Sabbath-obſervation they
ſhould perform, except it had by ſome poſitive
Law or Precept been diſcover'd to them, of
which we read not? When God gave to <hi>Iſrael</hi>
a Sabbath, he told them how they ſhould keep
it, as well as the Reaſons, End and Cauſes
wherefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61730:43"/>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> I might alſo add here what ſome
learned Men ſeem to affirm, <hi>i. e.</hi> that 'tis doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
whether the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had the diſtinction
of Days into Weeks, but rather reckon'd by
Months and Years; ſo that the preciſe ſeventh
day from the Creation cannot be certainly
known: and 'tis thought that the Jews ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
their ſeventh day from the falling of
<hi>Manna ſix days,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Jews reckon'd their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day Sabbath from the falling of <hi>Manna.</hi>
                  </note> but none on the ſeventh. No
doubt but it is impoſſible for any to know that
that was the preciſe ſeventh day from the
Creation.</p>
               <p>But it may not be amiſs to anſwer our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
as to what they ſay about the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not mentioning any Sabbath from <hi>Adam</hi>
to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any Precept or Remembrance of
it, and yet things of leſs moment are punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recited.</p>
               <p>1. This they ſay, that we read not of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
perform'd during all the time of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s
being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was near four hundred
years, till <hi>Zippora</hi> circumciſed her Son.</p>
               <p>2. Alſo ſay they, we read not of the Sabbath
in the Books of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is no parallel caſe; for after the
poſitive Command given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep it,
there needed no ſuch conſtant relation of it; for
no doubt but after that time it was continually
obſerv'd.</p>
               <p>Let me cloſe this with what I find recited

               <p>I might alſo add ſeveral of the Jewiſh <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>
aſſerting the ſame thing. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>I infer from hence, that that Text <hi>Gen. 2.</hi>
doth not contain in it any preſent Inſtitution of
the Sabbath, but ſignifies God's Deſtination or
Purpoſe to give it as a Law to his People <hi>Iſrael</hi>
in after times, and was not given to <hi>Adam</hi> in
Innocence for him to ſanctify it. God might
ſanctify that preciſe day to his own Reſt after
<hi>Adam</hi> fell, with reſpect had to Chriſt, in whom
he took up his perfect Reſt; and afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the ſeventh day as a ſign thereof. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it is one thing for God to ſanctify or ſet
apart a thing for this or that uſe, and another
thing to command that thing, or immediately
to put it into being. Our Lord Jeſus was long


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61730:44"/>
ſanctified or ſet apart to be our Redeemer,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 36.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was ſent into the World actually to
redeem us. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
or ſet apart to his Work and Office, long
before he was actually call'd to the execution
thereof.</p>
               <p>So that if theſe words, <hi>Gen. 2.</hi> concerning
<hi>God's bleſſing and ſanctifying of the ſeventh day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sam. Graſcom,</hi> p. 18.</note>
are to be extended, ſaith one, to relate to any
thing further than to that particular ſeventh
day following the Creation, it doth not refer
to any immediate Inſtitution of the Sabbath,
but is a hiſtorical Narration telling us what was
done, and not when it was done. If therefore
we can find out a certain time when the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was indeed inſtituted, there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to conclude this Text refers to that time, as
giving us the reaſon why God in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Seventh-day Sabbath made choice of
that day.</p>
               <p>And to ſum up what I have ſaid, take theſe
Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. We may infer,<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Patriarchs keeping the Sabbath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

the ſeventh day, they had the knowledg of it
by the Light of Nature, or by a poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
but they had not the knowledg of it
by the Light of Nature, nor by any poſitive
Command, therefore they obſerv'd it not.</p>
               <p>2. If they kept it by virtue of an expreſs
Command and Inſtitution, they had no doubt
ſome Directions about the due obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and inſtituted Sabbath-days Worſhip: but
they had no Directions about it, nor inſtituted
Sabbath-days Worſhip; therefore they did not
obſerve it.</p>
               <p>3. Certainly if the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were obliged
to obſerve the ſeventh day as a Sabbath, God
would either have commended them, or ſome


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61730:44"/>
of them for keeping it, or elſe reprehended
others for not keeping it: but God neither
commended any of them for the keeping it, nor
reprehended any others for profaning, and not

               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Let me add one Argument more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> prove that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did not obſerve
the <hi>ſeventh day as a Sabbath,</hi> viz. If the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
and all Mankind from the beginning of
the World were or had been obliged to keep
the Seventh-day Sabbath, certainly there had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>een ſome account given of the Penalty or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
due to Sabbath-breakers: but we
read of no Penalty or Puniſhment to be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

they were not oblig'd to the obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
How can it be thought that the Law of
the Seventh-day Sabbath ſhould be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and yet God ſhould hide the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to the breach thereof from the World

                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> My laſt Argument is this; The

God's People from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> were not
brought into ſuch an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Political</hi>

they were not injoyn'd to obſerve the Seventh-day
Sabbath: that is, they had no inſtituted,

               </p>
               <p>Now then that which I call a pure of <hi>ſimple

commanded, whether written in the Heart
of innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> or in God's Word or Law;

               <p>Now having let you know what is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

that the Law of the preciſe Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is not a Law of this nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> a pure
moral Precept univerſally and perpetually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory
on all Men: tho I deny not but there
is that in the fourth Commandment which is
moral in the ſenſe I have given, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. A time,<note place="margin">Three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> a ſufficient time to be ſet apart

moral in the <hi>fourth Commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is ſomething more contained in it,
which God by a poſitive Command requir'd
from the Soveraignty of his Will, as that
which he ſees juſt and reaſonable; namely,
that one day in ſeven be ſet apart as a day of
Reſt, and for his Service, and that this ſhould
be perpetual to the end of the World. I know

Divines call this <hi>poſitively moral;</hi> and tho I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

I think as they mean thereby.</p>
               <p>3. God did alſo command the whole Houſe

               <p>And now that the preciſe ſeventh Day was a

               <p>But before I proceed, I might give you the
Obſervations of divers Expoſitors on the order
and manner of the Expreſſions in the <hi>fourth
Commandment:</hi> As firſt, the eſſential part, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Sabbath-day to keep it holy;</hi> not the
ſeventh day. True, in the next words God
declar'd that the ſeventh Day ſhould be the
Jews Sabbath, whom he took into a Legal and
Typical Covenant, and Church-ſtate, to be his
own People: <hi>The ſeventh Day is the Sabbath of
the Lord thy God;</hi> not <hi>thy</hi> God in Chriſt upon
the terms of the new Covenant; no, no, but
thy God in a <hi>legal,</hi> and <hi>external</hi> Covenant.
And ſo their Sabbath was given to them upon
the terms of the Law of Creation, or the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works, which is a <hi>legal, relative,</hi>
and external Covenant God enter'd into with
the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or Nation of the
Jews, even them and all their natural Seed as
ſuch.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, upon this foot of account was
the Seventh-day Sabbath founded; not in Chriſt,
or on a new Covenant bottom; nor given to


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61730:50"/>
New-Covenant Children as ſuch; but it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
bottom'd upon the Covenant of Works, and
only given to that People whom <hi>God brought
out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, and redeem'd from
Egyptian Bondage. And when he enters into
that Covenant with them, he poſitively ſays
therefore he gave them his Sabbaths,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 1.</note> which was

                  </note> the Day, ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> was not
capable of any inherent Holineſs. <q>God then
ſanctified, ſays he, this Day, not that he kept
it holy himſelf, which in no ſenſe the Divine
Nature is capable of; nor that he purified it

of the Day is not capable of, nor that he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
that which in it ſelf was holy [mark

So that from hence it follows, if the Morality

from God himſelf in ſome ſupernatural way:
the Righteouſneſs of God requires this,

is damnable. (1.) Now were there ſuch
a Law written in Mens Hearts, I mean to keep
the ſeventh Day, ſome one Man or another
would that way have known it. But no Man
hath ever ſo known it, therefore no ſuch Law
is written in any Man's Heart; and if not one
Man that way ever knew it, then not all Men
univerſally beſure. (2.) And as the Law of
the Seventh-day Sabbath is not revealed to all
the World by the Lord this way, ſo he never
gave any Commiſſion to <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor to any of
his Prophets to promulgate it, or reveal it to all
Mankind; therefore I argue, it wants the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Law which upon urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

               </p>
               <p>But Precepts ſimply moral, in reſpect of the

I know what is ſaid about the Iſraelites

I hope not of a higher concern than the
diſcharge of a ſimple moral Precept. And can
one ſimple moral Precept have more Sanctity

nay, break a Command of the <hi>firſt Table,</hi> to keep

hard caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Law or Precept which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled

ſimple moral Precept: but ſuch is the Law or
Precept of the Seventh-day Sabbath; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis not a ſimple moral Precept.</p>
               <p>That our Saviour himſelf doth equal it to,
or compare it with Sacrifices, ſee <hi>Mat. 12. 3,
4, 5, 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Our Lord juſtifies his Diſciples in pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath-day, and
compares their ſo doing to <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>eating the
Shew-bread,</hi> verſ. 3. which was unlawful by a
mere poſitive Law.</p>
               <p>2. He ſhews them how the Prieſts in the
Temple prophaned the Sabbath, and were
blameleſs, <hi>verſ. 5.</hi> Some think they ſlew Beaſts
on that Day; however our Lord ſaith, they
prophaned the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, ſays he, <hi>If ye had known what that
meaneth, I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,
ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs,</hi> verſ. 7.
What can he intend leſs than this; <hi>viz.</hi> If ye
had known the difference between a pure moral
Precept and ſuch a Precept as is nothing more
than a Sign, a Shadow, like thoſe of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or a mere poſitive Law that <hi>I am Lord of,</hi>
and can take away, and give another at my
pleaſure, you would not have condemn'd the
guiltleſs. For tho all God's mere poſitive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
have great Sanctity in them, and ought
carefully to be kept; yet when a ſimple moral
Duty comes in competition with ſuch as are but
poſitive or ceremonial, the leſſer muſt give place
to the greater; as we commonly ſay, Of two
evils chooſe the leaſt.</p>
               <p>But if the preciſe Seventh-day Sabbath was
a pure moral Precept, equal with, and of the
ſame nature of that Precept of <hi>ſhewing Mercy,</hi>
there had been no ground for our Lord thus
to have anſwered the Jews: for if it had been

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61730:54"/>
ſo, no doubt he would have ſaid, I muſt indeed
blame my Diſciples, becauſe they have broke
one of God's righteous Precepts, whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Quality is above that of <hi>David</hi>'s
eating of <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> But he
who was the great Expounder of the Law,
knew beſt the vaſt difference between a moral
Precept, and ſuch as their Sabbath and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
were.</p>
               <p>Our late Annotators on this place, expreſs
themſelves to this purpoſe: <hi>The meaning is,
that God preferreth Mercy before Sacrifices;
where two Laws in reſpect of ſome Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſeem to claſh one with another, ſo as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obey both, our Obedience is due to the more
excellent Law. Now, ſaith our Saviour, the Law
of Mercy is the more excellent Law; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it before Sacrifice; which had you conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you would never have accuſed my Diſciples,
who in this point are guiltleſs.</hi> Why a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Law? Is it not becauſe the one is a moral Law
proceeding from God's Nature, and the other
but merely poſitive and Typical, and ſo <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi>
And why do the Annotators apply that to
Sacrifices? Our Lord remotely refers to that,
but directly and immediatly to the <hi>Seventh-day
Sabbath,</hi> and mentions Sacrifices to ſhow that
the preciſe Seventh-day Sabbath was no moral
Law, but of the ſame nature with the Law of
Sacrifices, and that of the <hi>Shew-bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, our Saviour's bringing in (on this
occaſion) thoſe words, <hi>for the Son of Man is
Lord even of the Sabbath,</hi> clearly ſhews that
he as Mediator had power to change, diſpoſe
of, or take away the Law of the Seventh-day
Sabbath: for what a Perſon is Lord of, he
may do what he will with. So that it may be
lawful for any man to do any work on that


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61730:54"/>
Day, when it ceas'd and was aboliſhed, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it now is, with all other Shadows and
legal Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>But none ſure will ſay, Chriſt as the Son of
Man, or as <hi>Mediator,</hi> is Lord of any pure
moral Precept; ſo that he can give liberty to
men to <hi>worſhip other Gods,</hi> or <hi>to make graven
Images and bow down to them,</hi> or <hi>take God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Name in vain,</hi> or <hi>commit Murder, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
or <hi>ſteal,</hi> &amp;c. No, no, it would be Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
with a witneſs to ſay this; ſuch is the
vaſt difference between Laws that reſult from
the nature of God, and mere poſitives, ſhadowy
and Ceremonial Precepts, which were given
for a time as an Act of God's Prerogative and
good Pleaſure, and when the Antitype is come,
were to ceaſe for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But what ſay ſome? <hi>If Chriſt brake the
Seventh-day Sabbath, he ſinned:</hi> thus a raſh

was that Evangelical Spiritual Reſt in and by
Chriſt, which all entered into that believed in
him at that time: for having given reſt to all that
came to him, he had thereby in part fulfilled
that figurative and typical Law; and by his

ſhewing ſuch ſtrange indifference about his
obſervance thereof, and his carriage towards
it at every turn, did clearly intimate that that
<hi>Typical Sabbath</hi> was departing, or in a dying
condition, tho not quite dead, till he himſelf
ſuffered and dyed on the croſs; and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
gradually, and decently buried, it hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as one obſerves, an honourable Funeral,
when further light was given to God's People
about it. But no more at this time.</p>

               <p>THE laſt Day I gave four Reaſons to
prove that the ſimple moral part of
the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> lies not in the
obſervation of the preciſe <hi>Seventh-day</hi> Sabbath.
I have ſix more to add.</p>
               <p>Fifthly.<note place="margin">The 7th day Sabb. not given forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh by Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> 
                  <hi>That the preciſe Seventh-day Sabbath
cannot be that part of the fourth Commandment
which is purely moral,</hi> I argue thus: Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is a ſimple moral Precept, univerſally and
perpetually obligatory, is by our Saviour or his
Apoſtles confirmed or given forth anew in the
New Teſtament; but the Seventh-day Sabbath
is not ſo confirm'd or given forth, therefore is
not a ſimple moral Precept.</p>
               <p>To prove the Major, or firſt Propoſition, let
it be conſidered, that the moral Law is transfer'd
from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, or taken out of
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s hands as a Lawgiver, and put into the
hands of Chriſt conſidered as Mediator: and
this was ſignified by thoſe words,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note>

the Prieſts under the Law were a Type of
Chriſt, ſignifying that when Chriſt came, who
is God's Meſſenger, all ſhould receive the Law
from his Mouth, who was to be the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of it: and accordingly we find he
opened the nature of the moral Law in <hi>Mat.

thereof; and how men may be ſaid to break
the Commands againſt <hi>Adultery, Murder,</hi> &amp;c.
by the luſts and malice in their hearts, tho they
never actually commit either of thoſe Sins.
Nay, I know not one ſimple moral Precept,
which our Lord or his Apoſtles did not confirm
or give forth anew, who no ways extenuated
the guilt of the breach of it, but with far
greater ſeverity aggravated every tranſgreſſion
thereof.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note>

               <p>Now neither our Lord nor his Apoſtles ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to confirm or give forth anew the old <hi>Jewiſh
Seventh-day Sabbath;</hi> but contrarywiſe, as I
have ſhew'd, he ſeemed to excuſe his Diſciples

allow'd others to do that which was deem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> If our Adverſaries can prove that
every ſimple moral Precept of the Decalogue
was not confirm'd by Chriſt or his Apoſtles,
let them do it.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I know they ſay, that neither Chriſt nor

forbids all Idols, and all Idols are forbid

manner defined and condemned in the Goſpel,
than by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> We read that a

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Where all Uncleanneſs, and Luſts
of Concupiſcence and Fornication are forbid,
there a Man is forbid to marry his own Siſter.</p>
               <p>2. Is not this ſort of <hi>Inceſt</hi> forbidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<hi>1 Cor. 5. 1.</hi> where the inceſtuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is condemned for marrying his Father's
Wife? If it be unlawful for a Man to marry
his Brother's Wife, or his Father's Wife, it is
unlawful to marry his own Siſter, becauſe nearer
of kin.</p>
               <p>3. All manner of <hi>Inceſt</hi> is forbid to believing
Gentiles in <hi>Acts 15. 29.</hi> this was one of thoſe
things contain'd in the Law that is given forth
anew to believing Gentiles. The Holy Ghoſt
inſpir'd the Apoſtles to write to the Gentiles to
<hi>abſtain from Blood, Meats offered to Idols, things
ſtrangled, and from Fornication:</hi> now Inceſt is
by <hi>Paul</hi> call'd Fornication, <hi>1 Cor. 5. 1. I hear
there is Fornication amongſt you,</hi> &amp;c. <q>Tho in
ſtrict ſpeaking (ſay our late <hi>Annotators)</hi> by
Fornication we mean Uncleanneſs of ſingle
Perſons, yet by this word often in Scripture


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61730:58"/>
is underſtood all <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Uncleanneſs.</q> Nor
is it probable that the Holy Ghoſt refers to the
Uncleanneſs of ſingle Perſons in <hi>Acts 15.</hi> but
to ſomewhat more doubtful: and therefore I
conceive all ſorts of Inceſt in this place are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>4. If any ſhould ſay, How can they know
it was unlawful for a Man to marry his own
Siſter?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: 'Tis not only known (as I have
ſhew'd) by the New Teſtament, and forbid
there, but alſo by the very Light of Nature:
for ſuch <hi>Fornication,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 1.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul, is not ſo much
as once nam'd among the Gentiles;</hi> that is, among
the more civiliz'd Heathens, who had no other
Law than the Light of Nature, which teaches
Men to abhor ſuch a Marriage. For doth the
Light of Nature teach a Man that it is <hi>a ſhame
to wear long Hair,</hi> and not teach him it is <hi>a
ſhame to marry his own Siſter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Moreover, tho I ſaid the whole Moral
Law is transfer'd from <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Lawgiver,
to Chriſt as Mediator; yet the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Law as written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well

ſeventh Day, becauſe that day was a <hi>ſign</hi>
or <hi>ſhadow</hi> of ſomething to come. I did at firſt
prove, in opening my Text, that the weekly
Jewiſh Sabbath is comprehended in thoſe days
the falſe Brethren taught the <hi>Galatians</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 10.</note> and gave many Arguments to evince,
that tho there is one day in ſeven by a poſitive

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61730:58"/>
ſeventh</hi> day from the Creation, and under the
Covenant of Works, was a <hi>ſhadow</hi> of things to
come.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall add here ſomething out of an
approved Author, further to confirm this:
<q>That Sabbath,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Warren</hi> on the Sab. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> p. 106, 107, &amp;c.</note> ſaith he, and the particular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day which the Jews obſerved, was
certainly of a <hi>ſhadowy</hi> nature; being inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
at firſt with reference to Chriſt, as all
other Shadows were, having a Type after
fix'd to it. And of this we may ſafely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
that forementioned Text, <hi>Col. 2. 16.
Let no man judg you in Meats or in Drinks, or
in reſpect of an holy day, or New Moons or
Sabbaths, which were ſhadows of things to come:
but the Body is of Chriſt.</hi> The only queſtion
is, whether their weekly Sabbath was here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Some are jealous leſt in preſſing it
ſo far, it ſhould prove prejudicial to our
weekly Chriſtian Sabbath; but this is a mere
cauſleſs Jealouſy. For let us ponder the ſcope
and deſign of the place, and it will appear
that the Apoſtles deſign is not to <hi>level</hi>
Chriſtian Days and Duties, but ſuch as the
Jews obſerv'd, and would have introduced
with Circumciſion. 'Tis apparent that in all
thoſe three places, <hi>Rom. 14. 5, 6. Gal. 4. 10,
11. Col. 2. 16.</hi> he crys down the Ordinances
of the Law or Old Teſtament, not the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of the Goſpel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Look what the Jewiſh falſe Teachers cry'd
up, St. <hi>Paul</hi> cried down. So as to argue from
hence againſt all <hi>difference</hi> of days under the
Goſpel, is evidently to ſtretch the Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Scope; but to urge it againſt all
Jewiſh holy days (their weekly Sabbath and
all) is not to force it. For,</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>1. The Apoſtle ſeems to ſpeak diſtinctly and


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61730:59"/>
diſtributively, enumerating the ſeveral ſorts of
days in obſervation among the Jews, <hi>Holy-days,
New-Moons, Sabbaths:</hi> and the gradation from
<hi>yearly Holy-days</hi> to <hi>monthly New-Moons,</hi> and
from them to <hi>weekly Sabbaths,</hi> is viſible enough
to ſuch as are not blinded with Prejudice.</q>

Sabbath.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 12. 15. Mark 1. 21. cap. 2. 24. cap. 3. 2. Luk. 4. 31. cap. 13. 10. Act. 13. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> times the ſame
word as is here ſet down in the plural number,
is uſed for the old weekly Sabbath, and not ſo
much as once for any yearly Sabbath: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all reaſon that preciſe weekly Sabbath
muſt be here (I will not ſay included only,
but) principally intended.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Even in the Old Teſtament, wherever <hi>New
Moons</hi> and Sabbaths are coupled together
(unleſs the Phraſe be figurative, as in <hi>Iſa.
66. 23.)</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> weekly Sabbath is denoted
by it, as appears by thoſe Scriptures cited in
the <hi>Margin</hi>

another name, <hi>ſcil. [Feaſts]</hi> to which anſwers
the word <hi>Holy-days</hi> in this place, <hi>Col. 2. 16.</hi>
For indeed the word in the Original ſignifies
a Feaſt or Feſtival-day. Thus let Scripture
expound Scripture, and Truth will be Truth
in ſpite of <hi>Error:</hi> take the whole Sentence
together, <hi>Holy-days, New-Moons, Sabbaths,</hi>
and (if it be an Old Teſtament Phraſe) it
always implies the old Seventh-day Sabbath;
or take the word <hi>[Sabbaths]</hi> ſingly by it ſelf,
and (if it be a New Teſtament Term, as 'tis

like it is) it ever ſignifies the ſame <hi>ſeventh</hi>
day; unleſs when put for <hi>week,</hi> which here
it cannot be. The Concluſion then is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
that the Jews Seventh-day Sabbath

               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> alſo repeats what ſome learned Men
ſay upon this place,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Let no Man judg you in

                  <q>From
hence they affirm (ſaith he) it will follow, that
there is nothing moral in the obſervation of
the Sabbath, ſeeing it was a mere Type and
Shadow, as were other Moſaical Inſtitutions;
and alſo that it is abſolutely aboliſhed and
taken away by Chriſt.</q> And if they mean no
more but that preciſe ſeventh Day, they were
certainly right: Nay Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> himſelf, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
determines the matter ſo as to make that
preciſe day refer to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Oeconomy.</p>
               <p>But indeed I ſee ſome learned Men have wrote
very darkly, becauſe they ſtrive to preſerve a
Sabbath in the Goſpel-day, or a day of Reſt,
and of ſolemn Worſhip; and that tho not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
yet poſitively moral, from the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
and if by <hi>moral poſitive</hi> they mean one
day in ſeven, which God from his Soveraign
Pleaſure will have perpetually obſerved as a
day of Reſt and ſolemn Worſhip, I am of
their mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſince the Jewiſh ſeventh Day was
a Sign and a Shadow, what was it a Sign and
Shadow of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Before I give a direct Anſwer to this,
let me premiſe one thing, which in a ſpecial
manner we ought to regard, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Law
of the Seventh-day Sabbath was bottom'd upon


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61730:60"/>
the Covenant of Works in that Miniſtration of
it given to the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as ſuting
with their Eccleſiaſtical, Political, and Typical
Church-ſtate. And this Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> has fully
proved,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on the Sab. <hi>p. 221.</hi>
                  </note> ſpeaking of that Covenant: <q>Now, ſaith
he, this is not abſolutely and merely a Law,
but as it contain'd a Covenant between
God and Man. A Law it might have been,
and not a Covenant, which doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow upon either its inſtructive or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
Power. Yet it was originally given
in the Counſel of God to that end, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Promiſes and Threatnings,
whence it had the nature of a Covenant. By
virtue of this Law, as a Covenant, was the
obſervation of a Sabbath preſcribed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
as a token and pledg of God's Reſt
in that Covenant in the performance of the
Works whereon it was inſtituted, and <hi>of
Man</hi>'s Intereſt in it—Again, he ſaith;
Seeing therefore that the Moral Law, as a
Covenant between God and Man, requir'd
this ſacred Reſt—we muſt inquire what
place, as ſuch, it had in the <hi>Moſaical Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
whereon the true Reaſon and Notion of
the Sabbath doth depend: for the Sabbath
being originally annexed to the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man<note n="*" place="margin">The Dr. takes it for granted, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the Sabbath was given, to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </note>, the Renovation of
the Covenant doth neceſſarily require a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Renovation of the Sabbath; and the
change of the Covenant as to the nature of
it, in like manner doth introduce a change
of the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>1. From hence note, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith,
the Law given <hi>Exod. 20.</hi> was a renewal of the
Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>2. That the Seventh-day Sabbath was given as
a Token or Pledg of that Covenant, and Reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61730:60"/>
3. That the Seventh-day Sabbath of Reſt
was not a Type of our Eternal Reſt in Heaven,
but a Type or Shadow of that true Spiritual
Reſt we enter into under the New Covenant
when we believe in Chriſt; and ſo this Reſt
is the Antitype of the Jewiſh Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.
My Brethren, this is that Reſt of God
which he referr'd to, and in which he takes up
his delight and complacence.</p>
               <p>Moreover, God ſhewed his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> by
their Sabbath, how impoſſible it was for them,
by the Covenant of Works, to enter into this
Reſt, where they ſhould utterly ceaſe from
ſin: it was a ſign between God and them, that
they ſhould perform the whole Obedience due
under the Covenant of Works, ſignified by that
Obligation, that <hi>in ſix days they ſhould labour
and do all they had to do,</hi> and then reſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting
that the whole Law muſt be kept, or no
reſt: <hi>the man that doth them ſhall live by them,</hi>
or have Life, Reſt, and Peace on that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This, I ſay, did ſignify Man's working
for Life before he could enter into Reſt; for if
they could do all they had to do, or God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them, or anſwer all the Demands of
the Law, then they ſhould have Reſt, Peace,
and Juſtification thereby.</p>
               <p>Here you have the Six-days Labour, and the
Seventh-day's Sabbath, it being an <hi>Epitome</hi> of
the Covenant of Works: For their Sabbath, as
<hi>Calvin</hi> ſhews, in the tenor of it, put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the higheſt Acts of Obedience, even to live
and ſin not, or ceaſe from all Iniquity in
Words, Thoughts, and Actions.</p>
               <p>Now if this did not tend to Bondage, and
ſo was a Law againſt them, and contrary to
them, nothing could; but now in Chriſt, who
hath kept the Law perfectly for us, or has done


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61730:61"/>
all we were to do, and ſuffer, we come to have
true ſpiritual Reſt and Peace. And,</p>
               <p>Our Lord, no doubt, alludes to this, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
11. 28, 29. Come to me all ye that labour and
are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
mind thoſe two words, <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
laden.</hi> On the Jewiſh Sabbath no ſervile
labour was to be done, nor any burdens to be
born, ſignifying that Believers in Chriſt ceaſe
from labouring for Life, and muſt not bear any
burden of Sin, either in reſpect of the guilt or
fear of the puniſhment; Chriſt having done all,
and born the burden of all our ſins in his own
Body on the Tree; ſo that we muſt <hi>caſt our
Burden on the Lord, and he will ſuſtain us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we begin our Sabbath after all our
Works are done, and Burdens born by our
dear Lord, and bleſſed Surety, on the <hi>firſt Day</hi>
of the Week, as he has directed us; and from
hence we work not for Life and Reſt, but
from Life, Reſt and Peace.</p>
               <p>Therefore to anſwer that Queſtion, what
was the Jewiſh Sabbath a ſign of? you have in
part heard, but ſhall yet more fully hear.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>I affirm that it was a Sign of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works in that Miniſtration given
to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>written and engraven in Tables
of Stone. How often is that Sabbath called a
Sign between God and them;</hi> Exod. 31. 13.
Verily my Sabbaths ye ſhall keep; it is a Sign
between me and you throughout your Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Again,</hi> verſ. 17. 'Tis a Sign between me
and the Children of <hi>Iſrael. Ezek. 20. 12.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
alſo I gave them my Sabbath to be a Sign
between me and them, that they might know that
I am the Lord that ſanctifieth them.</p>
               <p>But ſtill it is enquired, what was it a Sign
of? Some ſay that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in bondage in


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61730:61"/>
                  <hi>Egypt;</hi> others, that God created the World
in ſix days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, but remotely, if at all, it
was a Sign of either of them; for they are laid
down as the Reaſons why God gave <hi>Iſrael</hi>
their Sabbath, and not as a Sign of thoſe things.
But let it now be well conſidered, that God
never ſince the Fall entered into a Covenant
with any People, but he gave a Sign or Token
of it.</p>
               <p>1. When he entered into a Covenant with
<hi>Noah</hi> (and all the World in him) that he
would no more <hi>deſtroy the World by Water,</hi> he
gave a Sign, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Rainbow:</hi> this was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of external Favour, without any Reſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>2. When God entered into Covenant with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and with all his <hi>fleſhly Seed as ſuch,</hi>
he gave them <hi>a Sign</hi> of that Covenant, namely
<hi>Circumciſion:</hi> this is that which we call the
Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity;</hi> tho we deny not but
God entered into a Spiritual or Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with all his true <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
Seed alſo, which contained only a free
promiſe of Grace in Chriſt: but that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with his natural Seed as ſuch, is called
<hi>the Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> becauſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
was the <hi>Sign</hi> thereof. Moreover, they
that can't ſee a <hi>twofold</hi> Covenant was made
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> are ſtrangely blinded.</p>
               <p>3. And that there was <hi>a renewal</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works with the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> contained in the <hi>20th</hi>
Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> is moſt evident, tho not
given for Life, but for other Reaſons which I
have mentioned: and this Covenant contained
<hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> with the promiſe of Life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the condition of univerſal Obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61730:62"/>
And to this all the People conſented,
and joined in with God by mutual Reſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>And all the People anſwered with one
voice, and ſaid, All that the Lord hath ſaid,
we will do.</hi> And now I ſay, their Seventh-day
Sabbath was given as a <hi>ſign</hi> of this Miniſtration
of the old Covenant of Works: and hence alſo
as Circumciſion, the <hi>ſign</hi> of that <hi>Legal Typical
Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his fleſhly
Seed as ſuch, is God's Covenant; ſo the <hi>Seventh-day
Sabbath</hi> is call'd alſo God's Covenant:
<hi>Wherefore the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall keep the
Sabbath to obſerve it throughout their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for a perpetual Covenant;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 16.</note> and this becauſe
it was a Sign or a Pledg to them of that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
they lay under to keep the whole Law.
I might here add, that <hi>the Lord's-Supper</hi> is a
ſign of the Goſpel-Covenant; and it is alſo
call'd the New Teſtament, or Covenant in
Chriſt's Blood.</p>
               <p>And thus as Circumciſion bound all to keep
the whole Law that conformed to it, (that
being a ſign of that part of the <hi>legal Covenant</hi>
to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed throughout
their Generations) ſo the Seventh-day Sabbath
is a <hi>ſign</hi> of the ſame legal Covenant in that
Miniſtration with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 20.
and obliged all that obſerve it, to keep the
whole Law alſo. And that this is not my
Judgment alone, take what Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> has ſaid
on this account.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereas the Covenant which Man origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
was taken into,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>

                        </gap>19.</note> was a Covenant of
Works, wherein Reſt with God depended
abſolutely on his doing all the Works he had
to do by way of <hi>Legal Obedience,</hi> he was
during the Diſpenſation of that Covenant
tied up preciſely to the obſervation of the


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61730:62"/>
                     <hi>ſeventh Day,</hi> or that which follow'd the whole
work of Creation. And the ſeventh Day as
ſuch is a Token of the Reſt promiſed in
the Covenant of Works, and no other. And
thoſe who would advance that day again into
a neceſſary obſervation, do conſequentially
introduce the whole <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and
are become Debtors to the whole Law. For
the Works of God which precede the <hi>ſeventh
Day</hi> preciſely, were thoſe whereby Man was
<hi>initiated</hi> into, and inſtructed in the Covenant
of Works; and the Day it ſelf was a <hi>Token</hi>
and <hi>Pledg</hi> of the Righteouſneſs thereof, or a
<hi>moral</hi> and <hi>natural ſign</hi> of it, and of God's
Reſt therein, and of Man's with God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
And it is no Service to the Church of
God, nor hath any tendency to the Honour
of Chriſt in the Goſpel, to endeavour a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of us to the Covenant of Works.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is now become of Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi>'s Flouriſh,
who inſults over ſuch as call the Seventh-day
Sabbath a ſign?</p>
               <p>The Sabbath is indeed <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> a ſign of
good things formerly produced,<note place="margin">Tillam <hi>on the Sabb.</hi> p. 18.</note> as the Creation,
or elſe of good things at preſent enjoy'd, as God's
ſanctifying Grace; but never was ſet up for a ſign
of good things to come, like the Ceremonial Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.
I might here retort the vaunting Language
of the Preacher of <hi>Peter</hi>'s (of cutting off <hi>Goliah</hi>'s
Head with his own Sword) for if the Morality
of the Sabbath ceaſe, by being a ſign to the Jews
in their Generations, upon the ſame account muſt
the whole Law ceaſe to be moral, ſince God's
Spirit hath ſet it alſo for a ſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Tho the Marks of true Grace are
call'd Signs, yet there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and the Signs of Covenants.
<hi>Miracles</hi> alſo are call'd <hi>Signs;</hi> and God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61730:63"/>
are ſet as Signs and Wonders: but what of
this?</p>
               <p>2. He miſtakes greatly when he affirms, that
God ſaith the Sabbath was a ſign of his <hi>ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with his <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Grace.</hi> Did God ſo ſanctify them, or
were they ſpiritually ſanctified? No, no, it
ſignified that God took the whole Nation of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> into an <hi>external, federal,</hi> and <hi>legal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to himſelf, or ſet them apart as ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
from all People in the World, to be his
own People; and in that Covenant-relation he
was married to them, as he ſays elſewhere.</p>
               <p>3. To <hi>ſanctify,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What is meant by God's ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
                  </note> often in the Old Teſtament
only refers to God's ſetting apart a Thing, a
Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for himſelf, or to ſome holy legal
Uſe or Service. Thus the ſeventh Day was
<hi>ſanctified,</hi> and the Prieſts, and Veſſels of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſanctified. And their Sabbath
was a ſign that they became God's People, in
that legal and typical Covenant, or upon the
terms of the Covenant of Works; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
that all the Lord commanded them they
would do,<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 2, 3.</note> which confirms what we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Let none ſuppoſe that God took the whole
Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>into a ſpecial Relation with
himſelf, according to the tenor of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or Covenant of Grace; or that that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
Exod. 20. <hi>was the Covenant of Grace.
Let them read what the Prophet</hi> Jeremiah
<hi>ſaith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 31, 32, 33.</note> Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord,
that I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and with the Houſe of <hi>Judah:</hi> Not
according to the Covenant that I made with their
Fathers in the day I took them by the hand to
bring them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which my
Covenant they broke, altho I was a Husband to


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61730:63"/>
them, ſaith the Lord. But this ſhall be my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that I will make.—After thoſe days,
ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and write it in their Hearts; and
I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</p>
               <p>1. Had the former Covenant been the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, no doubt but they had abode in
that Covenant to this day and for ever: but they
are cut off, and now are in no actual Covenant
relation with God at all. Sure the Covenant
of Grace cannot be utterly broken.</p>
               <p>2. Moreover then they ſhould not have need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to look for the Law in two <hi>Tables of Stone,</hi>
becauſe that whole Moral Law ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be written in the New Teſtament, the Book
of the New Covenant, but in their Hearts alſo.</p>
               <p>3. Now when a Covenant is aboliſhed (as
the old Covenant is) will any dare to plead for
the <hi>ſign</hi> of it, which obliges them to keep the
whole Law? No, plain it is, the <hi>ſign,</hi> i. e. the
old Sabbath, is gone with the Covenant it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If the old Sabbath was a ſign of that
of which you ſay, what was it a Type or Shadow
of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was a Type or Shadow of our
bleſſed Reſt in Chriſt:<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>For we which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
do enter into Reſt.</hi> This is the Antitype
of the ſeventh-day Reſt, when no Labor is to
be done, nor any burden of Sin to be born by
Believers; this is that Reſt God is pleaſed with:
and here we alſo reſt from all Labour or Works
of our own, as God did from his at firſt.
<hi>Macarius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Hom. 39. in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</note> that Sabbath given to <hi>Moſes</hi>
was a Type and Shadow only of that real Reſt
given by God to the Soul.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, what comfort is here to you
that enter into this Reſt? What Joy may hence
ſpring in your Hearts, who are delivered from

               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> I might prove <hi>that the Morality of
the fourth Commandment conſiſts not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Seventh-day Sabbath,</hi> even from that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum</hi>
that is fix'd in the beginning of the
Command, <hi>viz. Remember the Sabbath-day to
keep it holy.</hi> Now tho one day in ſeven be by
a poſitive Law made perpetually obligatory in
the <hi>fourth Command,</hi> yet that is not, as ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
a ſimple moral Precept, much leſs not
the preciſe ſeventh Day; and this becauſe it is
brought in with <hi>Remember,</hi> denoting clearly
the difference between this Command as to any
particular day, and that which is purely moral
in this Command: for that which is connatural
to us, or an inherent Law of Nature, is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
in our Hearts, that inlightned Perſons
eſpecially are not very ſubject to forget it.
But a mere poſitive Precept, which is not ſo
written in our Hearts by Nature, we are too
ready to forget; therefore God (as I conceive)
to this Precept added this, <hi>Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day
to keep it holy.</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
ye have no Gods but me; or <hi>remember</hi> you
do not take the Name of the Lord in vain; or,
<hi>remember</hi> you do not diſobey your Father and
Mother; or that you do not ſteal, commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no ſuch charge is given
there; why ſo? becauſe theſe Precepts being
ſimply moral, are written in our Hearts. The
word <hi>remember</hi> (as one notes) hath not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
any reference either to the Works of
God, or to the finiſhing his Works, but to
God's deſtination of the Day to be in time to


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61730:64"/>
come the Churches Sabbath.—Not remember
how your Fathers kept it, or God inſtituted it
from the beginning; but it is a new Ordinance,
and of another nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> the chief of all
Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">'Tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for all Men to keep the preciſe 7th day throout the World.</note> To prove that the preciſe <hi>ſeventh
Day</hi> is not a ſimple moral Precept, I argue
thus: That which all Men throughout the
World are not able preciſely to obſerve or
keep, or which is morally impoſſible for them
ſo to do, can be no ſimple moral Precept: but
all Men throughout the World are not able to
obſerve the ſeventh preciſe Day from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it being morally impoſſible ſo to do;
therefore it is no ſimple moral Precept.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſo much inſiſt on that part, that
it is impoſſible for any Man, much leſs for the
whole World, to know which is the preciſe
ſeventh Day from the Creation, as what ſome
learned Men have ſhewn, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
impoſſible to keep ſuch a preciſe ſeventh
Day.</p>
               <p>1. This muſt be premiſed, that the <hi>Saturday
Sabbatarians</hi> affirm, that the preciſe ſeventh Day
is to be kept (ſaying in this the Morality of
the fourth Command lies) which conſiſts of 24
hours, and hath a Morning or Sun-riſing, and
an Evening or Sun-ſetting, throughout the
whole year; and it was that preciſe day of the

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But in many Regions of the World, and

For the Subject of that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of God's Reſt, ſaith he, which is the ſeventh

did they: And as <hi>Sunday</hi> with Chriſtians

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This, ſaith our Author, is to play
with the ambiguity of the words. 'Tis one

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Chriſt can't be ſaid to refer to this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had not then abrogated the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have ſhewed that ſpiritual Reſt
(ſignified by the ſeventh-day's Reſt) was given
to all them that believed in Chriſt; ſo that
the Antitype being come, the Type was a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, and was in a dying ſtate at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time; tho all typical Ordinances were not
utterly aboliſhed till his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis as if our Lord ſhould have ſaid, you
magnify the Sabbath as if that was one of the
greateſt Commandments, and the main end of
Man's Creation; but you muſt know the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was made for Man, and not Man for the
Sabbath, as were all legal Rites and Ceremonies.
And if it be thus, I that am the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> am
by my Office <hi>Lord of the Sabbath;</hi> and I can
and will abrogate it, and appoint another day
in its room.</p>
               <p>Certainly Man was made to diſcharge all
pure moral Precepts, they being originally
ſtampt on his Heart; as Chriſt, who was made
under the Law, was ordain'd to keep the Law
for us, and not the Law made for him. Man
was made in the Image of God, and under a holy
Law, and Covenant of perfect Obedience, to
ſerve his Creator; and by the obſervation of
that holy Law written in his Heart, as the
Law of his very Creation, he bore the Image
of God in the World,<note place="margin">Mark 2. 27.</note> ſerving him in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and Holineſs to the Glory of his Name,


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61730:67"/>
and for this he was made; yet Man was not
made for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but the <hi>Sabbath</hi> for him,
<hi>i. e.</hi> for his good, in reſpect to his Body and
Soul: (1.) As to his outward Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) As a
help to diſcharge all Duties of inſtituted Worſhip
the better for the good of his Soul: (3.) And
chiefly to point out or ſhadow forth to him the
true Reſt by Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo that typical
Sabbath was to remain no longer than till that
true Reſt was come and finally eſtabliſhed, for
then it could be of no further uſe to Man, for
which end it was chiefly appointed for him.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>I know ſome object from theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Woman was made for Man alſo,
but muſt every man have a Wife therefore? God
ne'r deſign'd that for ſuch to whom he hath
given the Gift to live without marrying. So
neither were all Men to have this Sabbath;
no, none but they to whom it was given: tho
it was made for Man, yet not for every Man
in the World, but only for the whole Houſe
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the proſelyted Stranger within
their Gate, as I ſhall ſhew in the next place.</p>

lays claim to a ſeventh day, or one day
in ſeven, <hi>perpetually</hi> to be obſerved as a day of
Reſt and ſolemn Worſhip. And tho the laſt of
ſeven was that preciſe Day injoyn'd under the
old Covenant upon the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet
that Sabbath was not to continue longer than
till the Antitype came; and it being a ſign and
ſhadow, it is, as I have proved, done away.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 301.</note> ſpeaking of the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
ſaith, <q>That Day was not directly nor
abſolutely required in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially,
only by way of appropriation
to the <hi>Moſaical Oeconomy,</hi> whereunto it was
then annexed. The Command is to obſerve
the <hi>Sabbath-day; God bleſſed the Sabbath-day.</hi>
And the mention of the <hi>ſeventh Day</hi> in the
<hi>body of the Command</hi> fixes the number of the
Days in whoſe Revolution a Sabbatical Reſt
returns, but determines not an <hi>everlaſting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
in them, ſeeing the <hi>order</hi> relating to the
<hi>old Creation</hi> is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Law,
Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip of the new.</hi> And if the
<hi>ſeventh Day,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
are the ſame, the ſenſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the inforcing part of it is, <hi>but the
ſeventh Day is the ſeventh Day of the Lord
thy God,</hi> which is none at all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So, as he and all learned Men generally ſay,
'tis not the preciſe ſeventh Day, but one day in
ſeven, which is perpetually obligatory in the
<hi>fourth Commandment.</hi> Mind the words again,
wherein the ſubſtance, or the eſſential part of
this Command is expreſſed: <hi>Six days ſhalt thou
labour, but a ſeventh is a Sabbath;</hi> 'tis not in the
original [the ſeventh] but <hi>ſeventh,</hi> denoting
not a monthly or yearly, but a weekly Sabbath:


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61730:68"/>
the Phraſe is <hi>excluſive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> p. 48.</note> as one obſerves, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus much, <hi>i. e.</hi> Thou art not bound to
keep the ſixth day, or one in <hi>ſix,</hi> or the tenth,
or one in <hi>ten,</hi> but the ſeventh, that is, one in
ſeven, or one in a week. The term <hi>ſeventh</hi> is
oppoſed to all other numbers, either ninth, or
twentieth, as alſo to the ſix working days,
which clearly intend ſuch a number, as ſix in
ſeven; ſo the ſeventh, as one in ſeven.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe I give or lend a poor Man ſeven
Pounds, on condition that he improves one
Pound for me: now by the ſeventh is intended
one in ſeven; ſo doth God here intend one day
in ſeven for a holy Reſt to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Tho I deny not the laſt of ſeven, or one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſix working days was given to the People of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet it was a <hi>ſign</hi> they ſhould keep the
whole Law, and was a <hi>ſhadow</hi> of that ſpiritual
and antitypical Reſt we have in Chriſt; and ſo
was upon a ſpecial occaſion impoſed on them,
with the greateſt ſtrictneſs and ſevereſt Penalty.</p>
               <p>But let it be conſidered, that which is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the fourth Command, as perpetually
obliging us, is, that we obſerve one day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as a day of Reſt to the Lord. Let me give
you one parallel caſe more, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law of
<hi>Tithes.</hi> Now God required the tenth of their
Increaſe: but will any Man ſay, God intended
any one preciſe <hi>tenth?</hi> No, begin where you
will, the <hi>tenth Sheaf</hi> or <hi>Lamb is the Lord's.</hi>
So here, God will have one day in ſeven; but
the reaſon why he fixed on the <hi>laſt of the ſeven</hi>
under the old Covenant, I have ſhewed; and
ſhall further ſhew why he chuſeth the <hi>firſt</hi> of
ſeven in the new Covenant, neither being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the eſſential and firſt part of the
<hi>fourth Command.</hi> Had God choſe now one in
ſix, or one in nine, he had altered, as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61730:68"/>
the ſubſtance of this Command.</p>

and that the old ſeventh Day is aboliſhed: but I
ſhall obſerve what Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Thus
I grant the time of Worſhip, a Sabbath it ſelf,
being an inſeparable Adjunct of ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
is perpetual: but the old Day, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
from the Creation, was made mutable
—and we have a Sabbath ſtill, a literal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
but the old Sabbaths and old Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
being Twins, tho both honourable and
ſerviceable in their Generations, as they liv'd
together and dy'd together, let both together
in God's Name be buried in the Grave of
Chriſt, ſo as never to riſe up again: but let
our Goſpel-worſhip and Goſpel-Sabbath take
life from our Saviour's Reſurrection, which
brought with it a new Creation, a new World,
making all things new.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to wave this a little, 'tis well obſerv'd by

the Jews obſerved ſuch a ſeventh Day

But that is more than he or I know, or
any Man living. They had I grant a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of ſeven days, but from what <hi>Epocha</hi>

ought to be obſerved; as,</p>
               <p>1. In what Revolution of time God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

one in <hi>ten,</hi> or one in <hi>twenty,</hi> but one in ſeven,
one day in every week.</p>
               <p>2. I obſerve the inforcement of Obedience to
the Command from God's reſting the ſeventh
day: Here I acknowledg the laſt of ſeven is
mentioned, but not as any branch of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
moral ſubſtance of the Command,
nor the obſervation of it directly, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially,
being inſtituted before, as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged

the laſt of ſeven here mentioned, had firſt of
all the honour to be the day of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing,
and accordingly was obſerved till the
time came that another day, the firſt of ſeven,
was to ſucceed in the rome of it. Note,</p>
               <p>1. As was ſaid before, neither in giving forth,

               <p>1. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labor,</hi> unleſs God other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
appoint; and he did appoint in the old
Adminiſtration other days to be kept holy,
which tho not always, yet ſome times fell out
on ſome or other of the ſix working days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Further, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labor,</hi> no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the ſolemn Worſhip of God out of
thoſe ſix days; for it would be no Sin to hear
a Sermon, or ſet ſome hour apart for Prayer
any of theſe ſix days, as it is for a Man to
work upon that day of ſeven which God ſets
apart for himſelf.</p>
               <p>3. And yet further, which is moſt of all to
be taken notice of; <hi>ſix days,</hi> &amp;c. reſt one, not
injoyning the laſt of ſeven (which was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before) but only ſix parts of the time ſhall
be for your ſelves, the ſeventh ſhall be mine:
So <hi>Gen. 47. 14.</hi> you ſhall have <hi>four</hi> parts, ſaith
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> ſhall be <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s; let all be
divided into <hi>five</hi> parts, <hi>four</hi> ſhall be for your
ſelves, the <hi>fifth</hi> ſhall be for the King; not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them which <hi>fifth,</hi> but only one of <hi>five.</hi>
Thus <hi>Lev. 23. 27.</hi> let all be divided into <hi>ten,</hi>
you ſhall have <hi>nine,</hi> the <hi>tenth</hi> ſhall be the Lord's;
not appointing them which <hi>tenth,</hi> but only one
of ten—So here I find not one word for the
laſt of ſeven.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I perceive nothing at all in God's
Example for it, nothing there but one day in
ſeven: but when the laſt day of ſeven is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that refers to the Covenant of
Works, their labouring firſt, doing all they


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61730:71"/>
had to do, and ſo to reſt, which was a ſign
(as I have proved) of the Covenant of Works,
and a Pledg of their Obligation in their Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
with God, according to the Tenour of
that conditional Covenant: hence their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was called a <hi>perpetual Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31.</note> and with
that Covenant it is gone for ever.</p>
               <p>Yet one day in ſeven, as a day of Reſt and
ſolemn Worſhip, is ſtill to be the Lord's by
virtue of the <hi>fourth Command:</hi> and tho God's
Example of reſting is mentioned, yet it muſt be
acknowledg'd to relate to ſome ſpecial end and
purpoſe, which may not only refer to Man's
good, but to God's ceaſing from the Work of
Creation for ever; which being the firſt and
greateſt Work then done, the day of his finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Work was to be obſerv'd upon that
reaſon.</p>
               <p>But when Chriſt God-man came, and alſo
had finiſhed the Work of Redemption, <hi>and
ceaſed from his Work,</hi> as <hi>God did from his;</hi> there
is the ſame moral reaſon why the Day in which
he reſted from redeeming, <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>firſt day</hi> of
ſeven, ſhould be our day of Reſt, becauſe this
is a far greater Work than that of Creation, as
ſhall be made plain and clear hereafter. For
we in Goſpel-days (as foretold) ſhall not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the old Heavens and the old Earth any
more,</hi> the <hi>new</hi> carrying away the Glory of
that; <hi>i.e.</hi> remember them no more by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of that old ſeventh day. To this
purpoſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſay God's Example under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works in working <hi>ſix days,</hi> and then
reſting, is no ways obligatory on us, tho it was
on <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the ſame old Covenant. But we
muſt ground and bottom our Obſervation of
one Day in ſeven upon Chriſt's ceaſing and


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61730:71"/>
reſting from his Works, and his Inſtitution of
a new Day upon the tenor or nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, to reſt firſt, and then work
ſix days, not for Reſt, or to reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but from
that Reſt Chriſt enter'd into on the firſt day
of the week, when our Reſt and Juſtification
was compleated, which we enter actually into
when we firſt believe.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon (ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field)</hi>
why herein I diſſent from you,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſt.</hi> p. 40.</note> 'tis this,
<hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh Day and ſanctified it,</hi>
but not as it was the laſt day of the ſeven, but
as it was the day of his Reſt, declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Creation-work to be perfected. Neither was
his reſting, ſo far as I can ſee, the ground of
his bleſſing and ſanctifying it, but as conſider'd
in conjunction with the reaſon of his Reſt, <hi>i.e.</hi>
his finiſhing his Creation; and alſo with the
Reſult and Conſequence of his Reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his
magnifying and honouring that day, <hi>for the
time being,</hi> above all other days, for the greateſt
work in being. For,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God's reſting</hi> cannot refer to any thing
but his ceaſing from creating-work; becauſe
otherwiſe he ceaſeth not working<note n="*" place="margin">My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ſaith our Lord,</hi> worketh hitherto, and I work.</note>; and his
Example of reſting, as ſome learned Men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
is not alledged here to lay an obligation on
our Conſcience, that that ſame Day we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
for ever.</p>
               <p>2. It ſeems to relate to what God himſelf
did, rather than any way propounded as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to prove that for which 'tis urged. Take
a parallel caſe, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 23.</hi> where we have
the Inſtitution of the Lord's-Supper repeated
out of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and Chriſt's Example is
related as to the time when, which was not only
in the Night, but that particular Night in which
he was betray'd. Now this is not recorded as


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61730:72"/>
a binding Rule on us for our Imitation. That
is hiſtorically related, and ſo may this of God's
Example in the fourth Commandment. There
is one thing more worth noting.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and many other learned
Men cannot ſee how it can be ſaid that <hi>God
ſanctified the ſeventh day,</hi> Gen. 2. but that it
muſt refer to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence, as his duty
to keep it, and not that God then only by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination,
Decree and Purpoſe, ſet it apart for
his Church and People to obſerve in after-times
—Now grant it was, as I have laſt hinted,
pray do not they ſay as much as this comes to
in reſpect of the Goſpel-Sabbath? Do not they
ſay, that in the <hi>fourth Command</hi> (both in the
<hi>firſt part,</hi> and <hi>cloſe</hi> of that Precept) God only
ſet apart or ſanctified one day in ſeven, and ſo
conclude the original Sanctification of the <hi>firſt
day</hi> of the week is comprehended in the <hi>fourth
Commandment?</hi> (which I will not deny) but
was not this near 2000 years before he deſign'd
his People ſhould obſerve it, or that it was the
abſolute Duty of any ſo to do?</p>
               <p>And as there was an interval from <hi>Adam</hi> to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> of ſuch a ſtate of God's People and
things, as render'd them not capable to obſerve
the Seventh-day <hi>Sabbath</hi> according to the Law
of it; ſo there was an interval of ſuch a ſtate
of the Church and things under the <hi>legal
Covenant,</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as render'd
them not capable to obſerve the <hi>Lord's-day</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the deſign and purport of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
tho that Day was by God's Deſtination ſet
apart long before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Whatſoever is a ſimple moral
Precept, or one of the ten Commandments, as
materially ſo, the Holy Ghoſt doth convince all
Believers of now under the Goſpel (as I have


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61730:72"/>
ſhew'd before) and alſo he reproves them for
the neglect or breach of all ſuch Precepts: but
the Holy Ghoſt doth not convince Believers 'tis
their Duty to obſerve the Seventh-day Sabbath,
for reprove them for the neglect or breach of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, tho they work and bear Burdens on that as
well as on any other day of the week; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis no moral Precept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> That which is a pure moral Precept
is written in the Hearts of all true Believers by
the Holy Ghoſt. God promiſed in Goſpel-times
he would not <hi>write his Law in Tables of Stone,
put in the fleſhly Tables of our Hearts:</hi> now the
Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath is not written
in the Hearts of Believers by the Spirit,
therefore 'tis no moral Precept. <hi>Tillam</hi> ſaith,
the moral Law is written in the Hearts of
all Believers, and ſo ſaith Mr. <hi>Soarsby,</hi> and
they ſay right; yea even the whole moral
Law, we <hi>being created again in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
in the Image of God: but no Law of the
Seventh-day Sabbath is written in our Hearts;
<hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, we may hereby learn to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between thoſe parts contain'd in ſome
of the ten Commandments that are ſimply
moral, and oblige us as the Law is in Chriſt's
hand, and what was judicial. For, 1. The
Preface to the whole Ten was Judicial. 2. The
ſecond Command obliged the Jews to obſerve
the whole Ceremonial Law; and that part
of God's <hi>viſiting the Sins of the Fathers on the
Children unto the third and fourth Generation,</hi>
belonged to the Covenant of Works, and not
to us. 3. That in the <hi>fourth Command</hi> alſo of
the <hi>ſeventh preciſe day</hi> belonged to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, and ſo to them only. 4. The


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61730:73"/>
Promiſe annexed to the <hi>fifth</hi> only belonged
to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that inherited the Land of
<hi>Canaan.</hi> 5. In the <hi>tenth Commandment, Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
or Intereſt of Mony, Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
to the Jews from their poor Brethren; but
that was only a Judicial Law, and is no Law
to us. Thus we may ſee that the moral Law
is only a Law to us as in the hand of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THat it is not the Duty of believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to keep the old Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
I have proved by many Reaſons:
The fourth was, it is not their Duty by virtue
of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> given to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
in <hi>Exod. 20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the preciſe Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is not the moral part of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;
this I have proved by <hi>Twelve</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
I ſhall now proceed and give you
the next Reaſon why it is not the Duty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Gentiles to keep the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
from hence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to none but the Jews, as written <hi>Exod. 20.</hi>
                  </note> It cannot be their Duty to keep that
Day from thence, becauſe the Law of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue</hi>
(and particularly the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
mentioned therein) was given to no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Nation, but the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only,
and the proſelyted Stranger.</p>
               <p>1. I ſhall prove this directly from expreſs
Texts out of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61730:74"/>
2. From direct and expreſs Texts out of the
New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>3. I ſhall anſwer ſome of the chiefeſt Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
brought by the Seventh-day Sabbatarians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
what I ſhall ſay.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed let me premiſe two
things.</p>
               <p>1. That all the World were under the Law
of the firſt Covenant as made with the <hi>firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">All the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of Works in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> the common Head of all Mankind; and
that the ſubſtance of that natural and ſimple
moral Law is written in the Hearts of all his
Off-ſpring, tho much darken'd by the Fall and
actual Sin, eſpecially in ſome.</p>
               <p>2. That whatſoever is naturally or ſimply
Moral, contained in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> is given
forth by Jeſus Chriſt anew in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I have proved; and as ſo conſider'd,
the ſum or ſubſtance of thoſe Ten words are
obligatory on all Mankind. Now,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the Proofs out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
               <p>1. The very <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Decalogue</hi> declares
to whom all the Commandments contained
therein was given,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe very People <hi>God
brought out of the Land of</hi> Egypt; that People
<hi>which he ſanctified or ſet apart for himſelf</hi> above
all People on the Earth; as alſo by the promiſe
annexed to the <hi>fifth Commandment,</hi> viz. <hi>That
thy days may be long in the Land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee.</hi> This ſhews the Laws of
the <hi>Decalogue</hi> were only given to the People
of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis ſaid,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>What Nation is there ſo great,
that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous,
as this Law which is ſet before you this Day?</hi>
Now if this Law was given to all People in
the World, or to any one Nation or People


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61730:74"/>
beſides <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then the whole World (or that
particular People as well as the <hi>Iſraelites)</hi> had
Laws and Statutes as great and righteous as <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
had, tho they might not have them in ſo
clear a Revelation or manner as they had.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It is expreſly ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 19, 20.</note> He ſhewed his Word to
<hi>Jacob,</hi> his Statutes and his Judgments unto <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi>
He hath not dealt ſo with any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for his Judgments they have not known
them. Praiſe ye the Lord.</p>
               <p>How vain as well as ſinful is it to go about
to contradict God's Word? Here it is laid
down Affirmatively and Negatively, <hi>It was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and not to any other Nation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <q>It was given to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

this manner: But I ſhall prove that no Nation
or People but that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who were under
that Law) ſhall be judged by it.</p>
               <p>4. How often doth God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Servants,<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 17.</note> declare that the Sabbath
was given to <hi>Iſrael?</hi> It is <hi>a Sign between me and
the Children of</hi> Iſrael,<note place="margin">Neh. 9. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
ſpeaking of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith, <hi>God made known to
them his holy Sabbath:</hi> To them; and the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>
ſays, <hi>not to any other Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take two or three Arguments further to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
this.</p>
               <p>1. The Law of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> was given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to a People in covenant with God:<note place="margin">The Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> given only to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the whole Houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> were taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that <hi>legal typical Covenant</hi> which <hi>peculiarly</hi>
referr'd to that People; therefore God gave
them that Law, and the Sabbath, as a Sign
that God ſanctified and ſet them apart to be a


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61730:75"/>
peculiar People to himſelf; and as a Sign alſo
of that Obligation they were laid under to keep
it, as I have proved. But God entered into
no ſuch Covenant with any other People or
Nation under Heaven; therefore the Law of
the <hi>Decalogue</hi> could not concern any beſides the
Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only.</p>
               <p>Were the Heathen Gentiles, or Believing
Gentiles, under that miniſtration of the Legal
Covenant given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael?</hi> No, until
Chriſt came, no other People were in covenant
with God at all.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe 'tis expreſly ſaid, that the Sabbath,
<hi>Exod. 20.</hi> was given to the Jews and Proſelyte
Stranger; <hi>To thee and thy Man-ſervant, and
Maid-ſervant, and Stranger that is within thy
Gate:</hi> Not any <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or Strangers without
the Pale of the Jewiſh Church, but only them
who were within their Gate. So that God
doth implicitly declare he injoyns none elſe to
obſerve it.</p>
               <p>3. The Law of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> could not be
given to all or any other People, becauſe God
did not give any Command to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Servants, to promulge, declare, or
make known that Law, or the Sabbath, to any
other People in the World but the Jews only.</p>
               <p>No Law can bind without Promulgation: the
Goſpel is of a large extent, as appears by the
Commiſſion,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Go into all the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Go
teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. Thus our Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Promulgation of the Goſpel, but not
a word of any ſuch Commiſſion for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> given <hi>Exod.
20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was never made or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Lawgiver to any other People but <hi>Iſrael</hi>
only:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> no Law-giver but to the Jews.</note> He was a Ruler over none but the Jews,


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61730:75"/>
and the <hi>Decalogue</hi> was but part of the Jewiſh
Law as written in Tables of Stone. Others
may ſay, Who made thee <hi>a Ruler</hi> over us, or
<hi>a Legiſlator,</hi> or deputed Officer from God to
us?</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and conſequently the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
could not be given to any other People,
becauſe it referr'd to a People in a Church-ſtate,
having many other <hi>Laws, Statutes,</hi> and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
annexed unto it; the puniſhment for
the breach of each Precept thereof being <hi>death:</hi>
he that broke the Sabbath muſt die.</p>
               <p>Now certainly if that Law had been given
to other Nations or People, God would have
put them alſo into ſuch a Church-ſtate as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
were, and have given them <hi>like</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
Judgments, and Officers to execute thoſe
Judgments: but this he did not do.</p>
               <p>5. Beſides (as one obſerves) there were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
belonging to the Sabbath, that were
eſſential to the right keeping of it, which were
not enjoined on the Gentiles, except <hi>Proſelytes.</hi>
That Law given to all People, muſt have the
ſame Services, Rites and Ceremonies eſſentially
annexed to it, given to them alſo; but thoſe
Services, Rites, and Ceremonies, were given
to none but the Jews. Otherwiſe, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
there would be two ſorts of Worſhip
acceptable to God; and then it would follow
alſo that God was more ſevere to <hi>Iſrael</hi> than to
others, by impoſing more hard and coſtly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
on them than on the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>6. Take here what Mr. <hi>Bunyan</hi> hath ſaid:
<q>Good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> threatned the Gentiles that
were <hi>Merchants</hi> for lying then about the
Walls of the City, for that by that means
they were a Temptation to the Jews to
break their Sabbath;</q> yet he ſtill charges the


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61730:76"/>
                  <q>breach thereof upon his own People, <hi>Nehem.
13. 16, 17,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Can it be imagined, had the Gentiles been
concerned by a Divine Law to keep this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
that ſo holy and good a Man as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
would let them eſcape without a rebuke
for ſo notorious a Tranſgreſſion?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover, in the Prophet</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>ch. 20.
10, 11, 12. 'tis ſaid,</hi> I gave my Sabbaths to be a
Sign between me and them, that they might know
that I am the Lord that ſanctified them.</p>
               <p>Before I cloſe with this, take what two or
three learned Writers have declared in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of what I ſay.<note place="margin">Heyl. <hi>on the Sabb.</hi> p. 65, 66.</note> 
                  <q>A Law which in it
ſelf was general and univerſal, equally pertains
to Jews and Gentiles; the latter, which knew
not the Law, doing by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> has told us:
but this Law publiſhed on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and
as delivered by the <hi>hand of</hi> Moſes, <hi>obliged
thoſe of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>only.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Take what another ſaith:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As neither the Judicial,<note place="margin">Zanchius <hi>de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempt.</hi> l. 1. c. 11. Tom. 1.</note> nor Ceremonial,
ſo nor the Moral Law contained in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,</hi>
doth concern us Chriſtians, as given
by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jews, but only ſo far forth
as it is conſonant to the Law of Nature, which
bind all alike, and was afterwards ratified by
Chriſt our King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon he aſſerts this, was to prove the
Gentiles were never obliged to obſerve their
Sabbath. Let me add what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath
wrote:<note place="margin">Baxter <hi>on the Sabb.</hi> p. 74.</note> He ſaith, <q>That the Fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Moſes</hi> bindeth us not to the Seventh-day
Sabbath, becauſe that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bound any but the Jews, and thoſe Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
that made themſelves Inhabitants of their
Land, or voluntarily ſubjected themſelves to</q>


                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61730:76"/>
                  <q>their Policy. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was Ruler of none
but the Jews, nor a <hi>Legiſlator</hi> or deputed
Officer from God to any other Nation. The
<hi>Decalogue</hi> was but part of the Jewiſh Law,
if you conſider it not as written in Nature,
but in Tables of Stone; and the Jewiſh Law
was given as a Law to no other People but to
them. It was a national Law, as they were a
peculiar People and holy Nation; ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s days it bound no other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World; therefore it needed no
abrogation to the Gentiles, but a declaration
that it did not bind them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>7. To cloſe with what we find in the Old
Teſtament about this: 'Tis worthy our noting,
that God told the Iſraelites that thoſe <hi>Seven
Nations of</hi> Canaan, whom they ſhould drive
out,<note place="margin">This is a full Anſw. to Mr. <hi>Soarsby,</hi> who has filled many Pages of his Book to prove the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> Law was given to all the World.</note> were defiled with all thoſe Sins and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
that he commanded them to abſtain
from; <hi>i. e.</hi> they had violated all natural or
ſimple moral Precepts. But God never charged
them with the Sin of breaking the Jews Sabbath:
So that from thence I infer the <hi>Decalogue</hi> was
not given to them, and ſo not the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall prove out of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
that the Law of <hi>Moſes, i. e.</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,</hi>
was given to none but the Jews or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. See <hi>Rom. 9. To whom pertaineth the giving
forth of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeaking of the Iſraelites:
<hi>to whom,</hi> that is by way of contradiſtinction to
any other People; or to them and none elſe.</p>
               <p>2. Upon this very account <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews that
the Jews had the advantage of all other Peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple;
<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>What advantage then hath the Jew?</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Much every way, chiefly becauſe to them were
committed the Oracles of God.</hi> Now <hi>Stephen</hi>
ſhews by the Oracles of God are meant the


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61730:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ten words,<note place="margin">Act. 7. 33.</note> who told the Jews, <hi>Their Fathers
received on Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>the lively Oracles, to
deliver them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to us,</hi> i. e. us Jews.</p>
               <p>Now I argue thus: If the Gentiles had the
ſame lively <hi>Oracles,</hi> or <hi>Oracles</hi> of God given to
them, then in this the Jews had not the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
above the Gentiles. He doth not ſpeak of
the Advantage the Jews had as to the cleareſt
Revelation of thoſe Oracles to them, above
the Gentiles, but of the giving of them to the
Jews and not to the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>3. Again, two or three times <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly
affirms that the Gentiles had not the Law, and
were without the Law: <hi>For when the Gentiles
which have not the Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 2. 14.</hi> What is
more plainly expreſſed? The Gentiles, he ſaith,
had not the Law, that is, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
tho they had the Law written in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So elſewhere he ſays,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 21, 22.</note> Vnto the Jew I became
a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them
that are under the Law, as under the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to them that are without the Law, as without the
Law; being not without Law to God, but under
the Law to Chriſt; that I might gain them that
are without the Law. <hi>Three times he here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the Gentiles are without the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> He means the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, they were without that Law
as well as the <hi>Decalogue</hi> Law: but he cannot
here refer to the Ceremonial Law, becauſe it
is ſuch a Law as the Gentiles were under to
Chriſt, or as it is in the hand of Chriſt; which
muſt intend the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, for no Gentile Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
or Unbeliever was under the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Law to Chriſt, becauſe utterly aboliſhed,
but ſo is not the Moral Law: in which ſenſe
we are without the Law to God, but under the
Law to, or as it is in the hand of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61730:77"/>
4. Take this Argument:<note place="margin">The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Law.</note> That Law which
the Gentiles ſhall not be judged by, they were
never under; but the Gentiles ſhall not be
judged by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> therefore they
were never under that Law.</p>
               <p>For proof of the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, ſee what
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>For as many as have ſinned without
Law, ſhall be judged without Law; and as many
as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the
Law.</hi> By the firſt he means the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and
by the latter the <hi>Jews.</hi> And from hence the
Apoſtle proceeds to evince, that as the Gentiles
ſhew'd the Works of the Law written in their
Hearts, they ſhould be judged by that Law,
but not as that Law was formerly written by
<hi>Moſes</hi> in two Tables of Stone, <hi>ver. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition; can any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that if the Gentiles had been under <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s
Law, yet they ſhould not be judged by it?
Sure none can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If the Gentiles were not under the Law,
Chriſt came not to redeem them; for he came
to redeem none but ſuch as were under the Law,
<hi>Gal. 4. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The old World was under the Law
and Covenant of Works, and the Curſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in the <hi>firſt Adam:</hi> it was his <hi>firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi>
that brought all the World under the
Curſe of the Law, or breach of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and not the Law as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
tho that Law, 'tis true, pronounceth that Curſe
afreſh on thoſe that continued not in all things
contain'd therein.</p>
               <p>For by one Man's Offence Death reigned by

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By one Man Sin entered into the World,
and Death by Sin—Therefore as by the Offence
of one Judgment came upon all Men to Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<hi>&amp;c. Thus we were all under the Law


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61730:78"/>
of the</hi> firſt Covenant, <hi>and as the Law is written
in our Hearts; but we were not all under that
Miniſtration of the Law given by</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If all the World became guilty by the
breach of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, then all the World was
under it: but this <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>Rom. 3. 19.</hi> Now
we know whatſoever things the Law ſaith, it ſaith
to them who are under the Law, that every mouth
may be ſtopped, and all the World may become
guilty before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> in the precedent Chapter, and
what goes before in this, had proved that the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> were under Sin, and were all guilty
before God for violating the Law written in
their Hearts: See <hi>Chap. 2. 12.</hi> and 3. 10.</p>
               <p>Well what of this? the Gentiles then were
caſt and found guilty that way; yet they were
not all, but part of the whole World.</p>
               <p>And from hence he in this <hi>19th</hi> Verſe comes
again to ſpeak of the Jews who were under
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and ſaith, <hi>What the Law</hi> (that
is <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law) <hi>ſaith, it ſaith to them who are
under it</hi> (meaning the Jews) and what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this is he ſhews, <hi>i. e. that every mouth
might be ſtopped;</hi> not the mouths of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
only, but the mouths of the Jews alſo, <hi>that
ſo all the World,</hi> that is both Jews and Gentiles,
might become guilty before God. I hope all
are and will be convinc'd that this is directly
the meaning of <hi>Paul,</hi> if they conſider the ſcope
and coherence of the Text.</p>
               <p>And thus I have clearly proved that the Law
of the Decalogue, or <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, was not
given to any but the Jews and proſelyte Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and therefore from that it cannot be the
Duty of believing Gentiles to keep the Seventh-day
Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But it is again objected,</hi> That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61730:78"/>
                  <hi>James</hi> injoineth the Royal Law upon believing
Gentiles; and the Royal Law is the Law of the
Decalogue, therefore all were under the Law of the
Decalogue, which forbids Adultery, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> It is a hard caſe that Men,<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 8, 10, 11, 12. <hi>about ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Royal Law, opened.</hi>
                  </note> to prove
their fond Notions, ſhould put ſuch an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
on a Text of Scripture, as is directly
contrary to other plain Texts: for unleſs they
can prove we miſtake thoſe Scriptures newly
mentioned, which ſay that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law was
only given to the Jews, and not to the Gentiles,
beſure they urge this to no purpoſe, but miſtake
the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, as others do about
what he ſays concerning <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We never deny'd, but readily grant that
all believing Gentiles are oblig'd to keep the
whole moral Law, or all ſimple moral Precepts,
as they are in the hand of our Lord, that one
Lawgiver, of which this Apoſtle ſpeaks: but I
have proved that the preciſe Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is not a ſimple moral Precept, nor any
part of the Morality of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore not intended here. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it followeth, that Man may fulfil the Royal
Law according to the Scripture, and yet not
obſerve the Seventh-day Sabbath.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> James <hi>clears the matter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi>
So ſpeak and ſo do, as they that ſhall be
judged by the Law of Liberty, <hi>ver. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He can refer in theſe words to no Law but
that of Chriſt, or rather Chriſt's Goſpel; or to
the Law as in his hands, who hath fulfilled the
whole Law for us by his own perfect Obedience:
and hence we are delivered from the Law as
in the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe as ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it was not a Law of Liberty, but a
Law of Bondage, or that which gender'd to
Bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61730:79"/>
And he ſhews it is a Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to us only, as Chriſt is our Lawgiver, whoſe
Law is a Law of Liberty: but as <hi>he that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one point, was guilty of the breach of the
whole Law;</hi> there he clearly alludes to the Law
as in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hand, and as a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>We are not to <hi>do,</hi> nor <hi>ſpeak,</hi> nor <hi>live,</hi> as the
Law in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hands directs, or as he was a
Lawgiver; for then we ſhould be under perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Bondage: and nothing is more plain, than
that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, as to the ſtrict obſervance of
its Precepts, brought the Jews into Bondage;
'tis call'd a Yoke of Bondage, <hi>Gal. 5. 1, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſo ſpeak, and ſo do, as they who ſhall be
judged by the Law of Liberty,</hi> that is, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
for not by the Law as in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hand,
but by the Goſpel we ſhall be judged at the
<hi>laſt</hi> day, who live only under that Miniſtration.</p>
               <p>And from hence let ſuch as keep the Seventh-day
Sabbath, take heed leſt they are brought
into Bondage, by obliging themſelves to obſerve
the whole Law; ſince I have prov'd it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
as a ſign or pledg of the Covenant of
Works, binding them to univerſal and perfect
Obedience, who were on their Sabbath-day not
to <hi>think their own Thoughts, nor ſpeak their own
Words, but to make the Law of God their delight
ſo as not to ſin;</hi> which none ever did, or could
do, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, who thus kept the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
even as long as he liv'd for us on the
Earth, that we might enter into his Reſt, or
into the Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pical Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third Argument to prove it is
not the Duty of Gentile Believers to keep the
Seventh-day Sabbath from the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
in the Decalogue, is, Becauſe that
Law, as there written and given, is taken out
of the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Lawgiver, as well as


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61730:79"/>
it was a Covenant of Works, and put into the
hand of Chriſt as Mediator.</p>
               <p>My Brethren,<note place="margin">The moral Law taken out of the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Lawgiver, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hand of Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> could our Adverſaries prove
that the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was given to all
the World, and ſo to believing Gentiles (which
I have ſhewn it was not) yet this would not
in the leaſt do their buſineſs: for the believing
Jews are now no longer under the Law, no not
as the moral Law was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Rule
of Life, any more than they are not under it as
a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>1. Indeed my Work is partly done in this
reſpect already, by what I have ſaid in opening
the plain ſenſe of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> in that
place juſt now mentioned.</p>
               <p>2. This appears, becauſe we have but one
Lawgiver,<note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 22.</note> namely Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>The Lord is
Judg, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is
our King, he will ſave us;</hi> that is, <hi>Jehovah</hi> our
Righteouſneſs, who came to ſave us.</p>
               <p>There is one Lawgiver,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 12.</note> who is able to ſave and
to deſtroy. <hi>Now is not this our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> He doth not ſay we have but one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But 'tis imply'd. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>there is
one God, and one Mediator:</hi> Doth not this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that there is but one God, and but one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator?</p>
               <p>Who are you now that will introduce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lawgiver, a <hi>Co-partner,</hi> or a <hi>Co-rival</hi> with
Chriſt, to partake of part of his Honour?</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe our Lord declares that all Power
is given to him in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Mat. 28.
18, 19.</hi> all Power conſider'd as Mediator: for
as he is God, it was not given to him, but was
his own eſſentially. But this is a Power <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi>
to him, <hi>i. e.</hi> all Power as ſole Lord and
Lawgiver to his Church, who only is the Head


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61730:80"/>
thereof: therefore we muſt look to him for
Laws, and how to be <hi>governed.</hi> He governed
by a <hi>Subſtitute</hi> before, but now being come
himſelf, the <hi>Subſtitute</hi> is utterly deveſted of his
Power.</p>
               <p>4. The Moral Law as a Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

that is gone:<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 16.</note> wherefore <hi>the Children of Iſrael
ſhall keep the Sabbath throughout their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for a perpetual Covenant.</hi> It belonged to

hence, upon the bringing in the <hi>new Creation,</hi> and
making all things new, this Sabbath cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
the old Jewiſh, Legal, Typical Church-Worſhip,

               <p>Can any think that the old Sabbath ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
which was the ſign of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
This is ſtrange; if it doth remain, be
ſure the Penalty annexed for the breach of it
remains alſo: but the Penalty can't remain,
therefore the Sabbath is gone. Take away the
Penalty of a Law, and what is become of that
Law? is it not abrogated? Now the Penalty
being corporal Death, the Sabbath is gone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Goſpel-Church has no ſuch Policy or

on Sabbath-breaking.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> being in Priſon with Mr. <hi>Tho.
Grantham,</hi> he profeſſed much Love to him.
Ah, ſaid <hi>Grantham,</hi> thou wouldſt kill me.
Who I, ſaid he, what kill my Brother? or to
that effect. Saith the other, Had you the
Power of the Civil Magiſtracy in your hand,
and ſhould I break your Sabbath, what would
you do with me? Said he, I confeſs Juſtice
muſt take place. It is well they have not that
Power in their hands.</p>
               <p>9. Becauſe Chriſt as <hi>a Teſtator</hi> hath made
another Will, which is <hi>his laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>


                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:61730:81"/>
and this makes all Precepts void that
were given in the Old Teſtament, and are not
given forth or repeated in the new.</p>
               <p>All know that no <hi>Legacy</hi> bequeathed in a
former Will, that is left out in a laſt Will, is
recoverable. Upon this account it is you have
argued that the Law for <hi>Tithes</hi> is not in force
now, nor Infant <hi>Churchmemberſhip,</hi> nor an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<hi>Canaan</hi> flowing with Milk and Honey;
or have Miniſters Sons a right to ſucceed in
the Miniſtry, and many other things, becauſe
they are not Legacies left in Chriſt's laſt Will
and Teſtament, tho they were in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So the old Sabbath, being left out in
Chriſt's laſt Teſtament, is no Legacy left to us.</p>
               <p>10. That the <hi>Decalogue-Law</hi> is transferred
from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, appears by the manner
of the writing of the one and the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> had it to give as it was written in two
Tables of Stone by the Finger of God: Chriſt
hath wrote it not in Stone, but in the fleſhly
Tables of our Hearts by the Holy Spirit;
which was ſignified by God's writing of it with

               <p>3. <hi>More particularly, there are ſome Texts
which expreſs the ceſſation of the</hi> Decalogue <hi>as
it was</hi> Moſes'<hi>s Law,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 7, 11. Not in
Tables of Stone, but in the fleſhly Tables of the
Heart—But if the miniſtration of Death writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and engraven in Stone was glorious, ſo that
the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtedfaſtly behold
the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the glory of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which was to be done away (or is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.)</p>
               <p>They that ſay the Glory, and not the Law,
is here ſaid to be done away, ſpeak againſt
the plain ſcope of the Text: For the Glory of
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s Face, and the glorious manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
ceaſed in a few days, which is not
the Ceſſation here intended.</p>
               <p>But as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſpeaketh [that Glory,
and that Law ſo gloriouſly delivered, is done
away] and this the <hi>11th</hi> Verſe fully expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth:
<hi>For if that which is done away was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
(or by Glory) <hi>much more that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth

as it is not only the Glory, but the glorious
Law, Goſpel, or Teſtament which is ſaid to
remain; ſo it is not only the Glory, but the
Law which is ſaid to be done away: And this
is the Law which was written in Stone. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but partial Violence can evade the force
of this Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So</hi> Heb. 7. 11, 12. <hi>[under it]</hi> (the Levitical
Prieſthood) the People received the Law—
And the Prieſthood being changed, there is made
of neceſſity a change alſo of the Law. <hi>Ver. 18.</hi>
For there is verily a diſannulling of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
going before, for the weakneſs and the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs
thereof: For the Law made nothing
perfect, but the bringing a better hope did. And
ſo much was Jeſus made a Surety of a better Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.
<hi>In all this it is plain, that it is the

                  <hi>Heb. 9. 18, 19.</hi> Neither was the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes; for by the word [Moral] they
mean [Natural], and ſo take Moral not in the
large ſenſe, as ſignifying a Law <hi>de moribus,</hi> as
all Laws are whatſoever; but in a narrower
ſenſe, as ſignifying that which by nature is of
univerſal and perpetual Obligation. So that
they mean, not that it is perpetual as it is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s
Law, and written in Stone <hi>formally,</hi> but as
it is that which is natural: And they mean, that
<hi>materially</hi> the Decalogue containeth the ſame
Law which is the Law of Nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is materially in force ſtill.</p>
               <p>But they except ſtill certain Points and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
in it, as the prefatory Reaſon, <hi>I am
the Lord your God that brought you out of the
Land of</hi> Egypt, and eſpecially this of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How far then are we bound to keep

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) As it is the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>(2.) As it is own'd by Chriſt, and made
part of his Law: And therefore no more of it
bindeth directly, than we can prove to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Law of Nature, or the Law of Chriſt.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The whole Moral Law Chriſt hath
fulfilled in our Nature, for us, and in our ſtead,
in his Life: And by his Death, he hath anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typically
fulfilled all the Prophecies concerning
himſelf in reference to ſuch things; and hath
aboliſhed the Ceremonial Law alſo; for till
then not a tittle of that could paſs away.</p>
               <p>Is a fulfilling the Law a deſtroying it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
all ſimple moral Precepts of the Law
(as in Chriſt's hand) ſtand firm for ever;
therefore he came not to deſtroy the Law: yet
is he the <hi>end of it for Righteouſneſs to every one
that believeth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> tho as a Rule of Life in his
hands, it obligeth them perpetually.</p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Ch. 5. 20.</note> Brethren, 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 7. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Offence might abound,</hi> &amp;c. and
<hi>the Commandment came,</hi> &amp;c. Now this entering
of the Law, and coming of the Commandment,<note place="margin">The uſe of the Law at in Chriſt's hand.</note>
chiefly refers to the Law as it is in Chriſt's
hand, ſet home with Power by the Spirit upon
the Conſcience. The <hi>bare entrance of the Law
on Mount</hi> Sinai, as in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hand, was with
<hi>Thundering and Lightning,</hi> but without <hi>Rain,</hi>
I mean without Contrition or Brokenneſs of
heart. Men may read <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> and hear it
preach'd every day; nay write it on the Walls
of their Houſes, and carry it in their Boſoms;
but yet it may have no operations on their
Hearts: no, 'tis the Miniſtration of the Law
in Chriſt's hand by his Spirit, that wounds the
Conſcience, pierces and melts the hard Heart,
that God's Law may be written there. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Law in Chriſt's hand anſwers
the chief deſign of God in giving it forth, and
renders the Minſtration of it by <hi>Moſes</hi> of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no uſe: for as in his hand, it is done
away; but the Law by the Spirit greatens Sin,
or makes Sin abound, and Grace ſuperabound.


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61730:84"/>
Sin thus by the Law becomes <hi>exceeding ſinful;</hi>
and it doth not only wound, but ſlay the Soul:
<hi>Sin taking occaſion by the Commandment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me, and by it ſlew me: Wherefore the
Law is holy,</hi> &amp;c. O bleſſed be God for the Law
as it is in Chriſt's hand! Thus <hi>Sin reviv'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
I dy'd,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> I dy'd as to any hope of
Juſtification, or eternal Life by the Law. The
Jews who had the Law only as in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
hand, were puff'd up or fill'd with Pride: they
(as <hi>Paul</hi> before Converſion, or the coming of
the Commandment in and by the Spirit, as in
Chriſt's hand) were <hi>alive;</hi> ſo he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>alive,</hi> in a juſtified ſtate; but when the
Commandment came, it was then quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with him.</p>
               <p>So that Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law,
but to fulfil it, and alſo to make it of great
uſe to all that receive the Spirit of Chriſt:
which <hi>Spirit</hi> is a <hi>Spirit of burning,</hi> before it is
a <hi>Spirit of Conſolation;</hi> or a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>we do not make void the Law through
Faith, but eſtabliſh it.</hi> God in Chriſt hath
magnified the Law, and made it honourable,
and that three ways.</p>
               <p>1. In ſending his own Son in our Nature to
keep it perfectly, and to die for our breach
thereof; Chriſt was made under the Law to
this very end. O how doth it magnify the
Law, to ſee <hi>Godman</hi> thus conform to it, and
die to bear the Penalty thereof for us?</p>
               <p>2. He magnifieth the Law in putting it into
the hands of his own Son, as Mediator, to give
it forth. Doth not the Dignity and Glory of
the Lawgiver add to the Glory of the Law
given? Is not Chriſt a more glorious Perſon


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61730:84"/>
than <hi>Moſes?</hi> See <hi>Heb. 1. 8, 9, 10.</hi> &amp; 2. 2, 3.—
<hi>This Man was accounted worthy of more Glory
than</hi> Moſes, <hi>Heb. 3. 3.</hi> But alas! ſome would
have <hi>Moſes</hi> partake of ſome part of Chriſt's
Glory; he muſt be their Lawgiver.</p>
               <p>3. By making of it, as in Chriſt's hand, of
far greater uſe to Believers, as I have ſhewed,
than ever it was in the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo
to anſwer God's Deſign in it.</p>
               <p>Let me only add, that all <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, even
the Decalogue, was political, as one obſerves.
God's Law was for the particular political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Jewiſh Nation, as a typical
Church and political Body; and therefore
when their Kingdom or Policy ceaſed, the Law
as <hi>Political,</hi> and their <hi>figurative Sabbath</hi> could
not continue any longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus I cloſe with the fourth general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi>
viz. It is not the Duty of believing
Gentiles to keep the Seventh-day Sabbath from
the Law of the Decalogue given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
Exod. 20.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">No Precept to keep the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not their Duty to keep it</hi> by any
Precept given by Chriſt, or Precedent we have
in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>1. That which is urged concerning Chriſt's
not <hi>coming to deſtroy the Law,</hi> &amp;c. we have
anſwer'd; as alſo that of <hi>Paul,</hi> we <hi>do not make
void the Law through Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Text alſo we have anſwer'd, and
turn'd the Sword againſt our Adverſaries,
which ſays,</hi> the Son of Man is Lord even of the
Sabbath, and the Sabbath was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> made for

               <p>3. And alſo their great Proof in that of
<hi>James, if ye fulfil the Royal Law,</hi> Jam. 2. 8, 10.
This I have given a full Anſwer to in this
Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61730:85"/>
4. <hi>I proceed to another pretended Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
viz. Pray that your flight be not in the
Winter, nor on the Sabbath-day, <hi>Mat. 24. 20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Text ſome learned Men have
not, I am ſatisfied, given the right ſenſe of.
But let us premiſe three things:</p>
               <p>1. That Chriſt gave the old Names to Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Ordinances very often, and ſo did his
Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>2. That our Lord well knew how ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
zealous the unbelieving Jews were and
would remain for their Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now pray mind the ſcope of this Text:
Chriſt ſhews how ſudden their flight would be,
when</hi> Jeruſalem was to be deſtroyed, <hi>ver. 16, 17.
and</hi> v. 19. <hi>he ſaith,</hi> Wo to them that are with
Child, and them that give ſuck in thoſe days. But
pray that your flight be not in the Winter, nor on the
Sabbath-day: for then ſhall be great Tribulation.</p>
               <p>3. It is evident there is the ſame reaſon they
ſhould pray that their flight be not in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as not on the Jewiſh Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p>Why, not in the <hi>Winter?</hi> becauſe of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of the Ways; they might be deep and
unpaſſable then, whereby their Eſcape might
be hinder'd.</p>
               <p>Why not on the <hi>Sabbath-day?</hi> becauſe, ſay
ſome, their Conſciences would not admit them
to fly then further than a Sabbath-day's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
It is ſtrange to me that our Lord ſhould
tell them a little before, that it was lawful to
ſave the Life of a <hi>ſorry Animal,</hi> a Brute, on the
Sabbath-day, and bid a Man take up his Bed or
bear a Burden on the Sabbath; and now hint
that it was not lawful, or that they would ſo
think, to ſave their Lives by flying on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day:
believe this who will. Was it not
lawful to pull an <hi>Ox,</hi> or <hi>Sheep</hi> out of <hi>a Pit</hi> on the


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61730:85"/>
Sabbath-day; or for Men to carry their Goods
out of their Houſes on the Sabbath-day, if a
Fire ſhould then happen? I do not think they
were ever ſo ſuperſtitiouſly blind.</p>
               <p>Nay, to preſerve human Life our Lord ſhew'd
was much more lawful on that day than the
Life of Beaſts.</p>
               <p>But, ſay ſome, it would be grievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
to them to fly on that day in
which they uſed to find ſo much delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our Lord gives a direct contrary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>i.e. for then will be great Tribulation:</hi> the
unbelieving Jews, ſhould they fly on their
Sabbath, would ſeverely handle them, may be
knock them on the head; on this account our
Lord bids them ſo to pray: therefore this could
not be the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he knew his own Diſciples before
that time came, would be convinced that the
Jewiſh Sabbath was ceaſed with other Legal
Rites.</p>
               <p>Therefore this I take to be the direct mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our bleſſed Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe on the
Jewiſh Sabbath-day, the unbelieving Jews, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom you will remain (or many of you)
when the Deſtruction of the City comes, may
be ſo ſtrict and ſuperſtitious as to keep <hi>watch</hi>
and <hi>ward</hi> at every <hi>Gate</hi> and <hi>Way,</hi> that you will
not be able to eſcape, at leaſt not above one
of their Sabbath-day's Journey; therefore pray
your flight be not on that day. This is all I
can ſee in this Text.</p>
               <p>Both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> were fain to fly on
the Sabbath-day.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Beſides, ſome learned Men
from this Paſſage argue for the Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
as 'tis not unknown to our Opponents, as
Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> and many more; and that our Lord

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61730:86"/>
would obſerve after his Death: but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Men themſelves (I mean the
Diſciples) before our Lord ſuffer'd, were ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that they knew not their Lord ſhould
die; and ſome a great while after did not know
that they ſhould preach to the Gentiles: and is
it any wonder that theſe good <hi>Women</hi> ſhould
not know ſo ſoon that the Sabbath was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated?
Some after that were zealous for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is that an Argument that
Circumciſion is our Duty? Beſides, no new day
for ſolemn Worſhip was then appointed, nor
till after our Lord roſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Paul,</hi> as his manner was, and other
Apoſtles, obſerved the Jews Sabbath-day; they
preached in the Temple and Synagogue of the Jews
on the Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They never taught the Jews nor
Gentiles to obſerve the Seventh-day Sabbath.</p>
               <p>2. No one Church, as we read of, ever met
to celebrate any Goſpel-Ordinance on the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p>3. There is not one word of any Saint that
ever kept it.</p>
               <p>4. All that is on Record is, that the Apoſtles
preached to the Jews on that day. Why ſo?
becauſe they could not preach to them but when
aſſembled together; and having a Commiſſion
<hi>firſt</hi> to preach the Goſpel to them, they went
into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and into their <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and
preach'd to them on that day; and ſo did <hi>Paul</hi>
at <hi>Mars-hill</hi> to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 17. 22. &amp; 16. 13.</note> as well as to
the Jews on their Sabbath.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Paul, as his manner was, went
in unto them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and three Sabbath-days reaſoned</hi>


                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:61730:86"/>
                  <hi>with them out of the Scriptures:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17. 2.</note> Not, ſaith
one, to ſolemnize the Sabbath after the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
manner (from the obſervation whereof
the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Young,</hi> p. 10, 11.</note> becauſe of the Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them by Chriſt, were far enough)
eſpecially when <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reprove the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and <hi>Galations,</hi> becauſe
ſome among them ſtood for the Sabbath, and
other <hi>Feaſts</hi> of the Jews; but becauſe they then
had a fit occaſion of communing with the Jews
met together, that after the readings of the
Law were over, they might preach the Goſpel
with more fruit in ſuch a concourſe of People,
which upon other days they could not ſo eaſily
obtain; and for no other end, as from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Teſtimony is evident.</p>
               <p>Which things let the Reader ſeriouſly weigh:
for at any time, or in what place ſoever they
could, they preached the Goſpel to the Jews;
therefore on the Sabbaths, as well in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues
as elſewhere: the Apoſtles were not
wanting in the Office of preaching; for this
cauſe they tarried certain days among
the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> becauſe no fit occaſion for
preaching the Goſpel offered—which the
Apoſtles every where greedily ſought after:
<hi>they preached Chriſt on the Sabbath days out of
the City,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>by a River ſide, to Women which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
to publick Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> haſtened to keep the Feaſt of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt</hi>
at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20. 16.</note> only that he might have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Jews (who liv'd diſperſed in divers places
of the World) there together, and ſo preach
the Goſpel to them.—<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Hom. 43. in Act.</note> 
                  <hi>What
means</hi> Paul<hi>'s haſtning to this Feaſt? it was not
for the Feaſts, but for the Multitudes—he
made haſte to preach the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:61730:87"/>
Now had any Text ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> muſt needs
haſt to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to keep the Sabbath among
the Jews, what Improvement would the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarians
have made of it? yet that no more
would prove the Sabbath ought to be kept than
the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> See what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.
16. 8. But I will tarry at</hi> Epheſus <hi>will Pentecoſt;
for a great door and effectual is opened to me.</hi>
This ſhews what his reaſon was to keep that
Feaſt, and alſo in preaching on their Sabbaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But he calls it the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So he calls that Feaſt <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and
Circumciſion by its own Name; muſt we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
keep <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and be circumciſed? It
was only for diſtinction-ſake, the old Names of
Jewiſh Rites being ſtill kept up by the Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the Gentiles alſo deſired the ſame
Word might be preach'd to them the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:
<note place="margin">Act. 13. 42.</note> ſure if the Apoſtles had kept the firſt day,
they would rather have deſir'd that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould
preach to them the next firſt day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> was but newly come into thoſe
parts, and there was no Goſpel-Church there;
nor can any think that thoſe poor unbelieving
Gentiles ſhould have heard of any other day
obſerv'd than the Jewiſh Sabbath, for they
liv'd among the Jews; and if it is ſaid, <hi>the
whole City the next Sabbath came together:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 44.</note> and
no doubt but 'twas in the Synagogue of the
Jews in which they met, ſome of the Gentiles
being Proſelytes to the Jewiſh Religion. So
that it is evident this is nothing to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for here is no more ground from hence
for us to keep the Jewiſh Sabbath, than to meet
in <hi>Jewiſh Synagogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, Dr. <hi>Young</hi> has one Paſſage worth

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No Law of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day Sabbath written in the Hearts of God's New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> If it be not the Duty of <hi>believing
Gentiles</hi> to keep the Seventh-day Sabbath from
the Law written by the Spirit of the living
God in the Hearts of all his New-Covenant
Children, it is not their Duty to keep it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by no other Law I have proved it is
their Duty; and now I ſhall prove that it is
not their Duty to keep it by virtue of this
Law.</p>
               <p>1. If it was their Duty by this Law to keep
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t, the holy Spirit beſure had left it written in
the New Teſtament: for whatſoever Law is
written in our Hearts, it is but the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
(in reſpect to all ſimple moral Precepts)
with what is written in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Conſider that God expreſly ſays in the
new Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> I will put my Law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and write it in their Hearts.—
<hi>Saith</hi> Paul,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3.</note> Written not with Ink, but with the
Spirit of the living God; not in Tables of Stone,
but in the fleſhly Tables of the Heart.</p>
               <p>This ſhews we are not to go to the Tables
of Stone, to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for the Law of God,
now the Antitype of that is come. God's Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
has wrote his Law in better Tables; tho
naturally our Hearts were like Stone, yet his
Spirit can and hath written his Law there.
What is God's Law but a Tranſcript, or a
gracious Impreſſion of his holy Nature, or his
Divine Image ſtampt on our Souls?</p>
               <p>Now then read this bleſſed Book, <hi>ye New-Covenant
Saints;</hi> look within ye holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
ones, and ſee if you can find the knowledg
of the ſeventh Day, or that you have this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
written in your Hearts and inward parts.
Were you ever by this Law led to know (or
reproved for not obſerving) the Seventh-day


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61730:91"/>
Sabbath? Let me cloſe this with an Anſwer

and they will tell you that your anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
Sabbath was ſo far from being in their
Hearts, that they have wrote againſt it with
their Pens. Turn over the Works of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Fathers—Add to theſe the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
pious and zealous Miniſters and Martyrs
of Chriſt, who have liv'd, and dy'd within the
compaſs of theſe ſixteen hundred years; and
moſt, if not all of them will tell you that they

how many faithful Witneſſes of late
years has the Lord raiſed up to bear Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
againſt it? of whom, I ſuppoſe, the greateſt
part are yet alive, tho ſome are fallen aſleep.
In a word, how many precious, and gracious,
and pious Chriſtians are yet upon the Earth,
Men and Women redeem'd from the Earth,
and crucified to the World (of whom the
World is not worthy) who look upon your
Sabbath as a <hi>Cypher,</hi> can freely labor, and travel


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61730:91"/>
upon it, buy and ſell upon it, and this after
accurate Inquiry about it? and to this day
their Conſciences never reproach them, their
Hearts never ſmote them for it. What will
you ſay? Are all theſe Hypocrites, unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unſanctified ones? this were to condemn
the Generation of God's Children, and <hi>cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi>
your ſelf, with your few miſled Aſſociates,

would hope you dare not do, tho I know<note n="*" place="margin">

dare as much as another.</p>
               <p>Well, the Adverſary is brought to this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma;</hi>
either God has no People in the World
but ſuch as are of his Perſwaſion, or his moral
and immutable Laws are not written in their
Hearts; or the Saturday Sabbath is none of
thoſe Laws. Thus this Author.</p>
               <p>If the Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath be
written in the Hearts of Believers, ſome one
Man or another can produce ſome one Believer
that was by the Law written in his Heart
convinc'd of it, without reading <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law,
or any Book or Books compiled by Men about
the Sabbath. But no Man can produce any
ſuch Believer that will or can ſay this; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not written in the Hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears that it is not the Duty of
<hi>Gentile Believers</hi> to keep the <hi>ſeventh Day</hi> from
the Law of God <hi>written in the Hearts of God's
new Covenant Children,</hi> which was the <hi>ſixth</hi>
and laſt part of the <hi>general Argument</hi> firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing in ſpeaking to the Seventh-day
Sabbath I promiſed to do,<note place="margin">The dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Principles.</note> was <hi>to ſhew
you, that as ſome hold and maintain it, it is a
dangerous Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61730:92"/>
1. Is not that dangerous which cauſed <hi>Paul</hi>
to fear he had beſtowed on the Perſons he ſpeaks
of, Labor in vain? Was it not becauſe they
obſerv'd Jewiſh Days, laying ſtreſs on thoſe
things?</p>
               <p>2. Is not that a dangerous Error that leads
Men to ratify or ſign the Covenant of Works,
which binds them to keep the whole Law?
This I have proved is the natural tendency of
this Practice;<note place="margin">Owen <hi>on the Sabb.</hi> p. 149.</note> and the ſame thing Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi>
you have heard, poſitively affirms alſo.</p>
               <p>3. Is not that dangerous that magnifies the
<hi>firſt Creation</hi> Work above Redemption,<note place="margin">It magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work above Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> or
the new Creation Work, when God began to
create the new Heavens and new Earth, which
refers to the Goſpel or new Creation? What
ſaith the Lord, <hi>the old Heavens and old Earth
ſhall be remembered no more;</hi> that is, in a day
kept to that end: for otherwiſe ſure the great
Works of the <hi>firſt Creation</hi> ought not to be
forgot; but the <hi>new Creation</hi> excelling the old,
the <hi>new Day</hi> muſt be kept in remembrance
thereof, and not the old day.</p>
               <p>4. Is not that a dangerous Error that tends,<note place="margin">It eclipſes the Glory of Chriſt.</note>
as the neceſſary Conſequence of it, to eclipſe
the Glory of Chriſt, as <hi>the only Lord, Head
and Lawgiver to his Church,</hi> and that gives part
of this Honour to <hi>Moſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Is not that dangerous that tends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle,
and bring into Bondage, and under
legal Terror, <hi>poor weak Chriſtians,</hi> as ſome who
have kept the Seventh-day Sabbath have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
till God open'd their Eyes, they fearing
they broke the Sabbath in ſome way or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
for indeed no Man can perfectly keep it,
any more than he can keep the whole Law, as
has been hinted. <hi>I was always in a trembling
ſtate</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>ſo long as I kept it,</hi> &amp;c. or to that
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61730:92"/>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> it is not to be thought what Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
it brought the <hi>zealous Jews</hi> under, they
not knowing when they had anſwered the ſtrict
obſervance of that day; and if they brake it,
they <hi>muſt die without Mercy,</hi> as the <hi>poor Man</hi>
that <hi>gathered Sticks on that day:</hi> they were not
<hi>to ſpeak their own words,</hi> &amp;c. How ſhould they
know when they did this?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>On</hi> Mat. 12. 2. p. 361.</note> Nay live, and ſin
not: They would not, Mr. <hi>Trap</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſpit,
nor eaſe themſelves on that day,</hi> which is hard
to believe: tho ſome were <hi>ſuperſtitiouſly</hi> zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
'tis true; yet others who were piouſly
zealous, by means of the ſtrictneſs of the
Precept, continually were in <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>bondage:</hi>
And ſad it is for any to be entangled again
thereby.</p>
               <p>6. Is not that a dangerous thing,<note place="margin">Jewiſh Sabbath genders to Bondage.</note> that by the
neceſſary conſequence of it leads men to obſerve
other <hi>Legal Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as not to <hi>eat
Swines-fleſh,</hi> nor <hi>wear a Garment of Linen and
Woolen,</hi> nor mar the <hi>corner of their Beards?</hi>
Nay, ſome of the chief of them formerly
were led to Circumciſion, and to worſe than
that alſo. I ſaw a Book publiſhed many years
ago by two of them, in which they called
themſelves the <hi>Miniſters of the Circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That theſe things are the neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of their Notion about their Sabbath,
appears, becauſe they go to <hi>Moſes</hi> for it as the
Law was in his hand, and believe many other
things that were meer <hi>Judicial Laws</hi> to be in
force now: They are for <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law, with the
Statutes and Judgments,</hi> and have declared that
that <hi>Law</hi> is in force to <hi>ſtone to death ſuch as
break the Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no marvel: for if that Sabbath be in
force, the Puniſhment is in force alſo. Nay,


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61730:93"/>
they believe (I hear) that a rebellious Son
ought to be put to death.</p>
               <p>7. Is not that Error dangerous,<note place="margin">It renders all that keep it not, guilty of horrid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality.</note> and of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Nature, the neceſſary Conſequence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
renders all that keep not that preciſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
as the Sabbath (nor can be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
'tis their Duty to obſerve it) to be guilty of
Immorality, <hi>i. e.</hi> in breaking a moral Precept
in the very Letter of it, nay one of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the firſt Table? For it muſt be thus,
if the morality of the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> lies
in the obſervation of the preciſe Seventh-day
Sabbath; and it muſt be as great an Evil to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it, as 'tis to have <hi>another God,</hi> or to <hi>bow
down to a graven Image,</hi> or to <hi>ſwear</hi> or <hi>profane
the holy Name</hi> of God, or <hi>commit actual Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Murder,</hi> &amp;c. and thus their Doctrin ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
all true Chriſtians to be guilty of a moſt
<hi>groſs Immorality,</hi> who do not obſerve the preciſe
Seventh-day.</p>
               <p>Nay, the like Conſequences attend their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who through ignorance and an over-heated
Zeal, have alſo aſſerted the ſame Morality to
conſiſt in the obſervance of the <hi>firſt Day of
the Week;</hi> as is evident by what ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in their Pariſh-Churches did formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm:
One in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> ſaid, That <hi>to do any
ſervile Work on the Lord's Day, is as great a Sin
as to kill a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another in a Sermon in</hi> Norfolk,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>White</hi> on the Sab.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaid,</hi> To
make a Feaſt or Wedding-dinner on the Lord's
Day, is as great a Sin, as for a Father to take
a Knife and cut his own Child's Throat.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> alſo, I am told, did lately
ſay, (having a Child to put out an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice)
he knew not any that kept the Sabbath
whoſe Trade he liked; and to place him with
one that <hi>would cauſe him to work on that Day,</hi>


                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:61730:93"/>
                  <hi>was as bad as Adultery or Theft,</hi> or to that
effect.</p>
               <p>Another lately told us, that we in not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sabbath, or fourth Command, broke all
the reſt; or words to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>8. And from hence alſo, which is the plain
and neceſſary Conſequence of their Principle,
either ſuch muſt periſh who live and die in a
palpable violation of this pretended ſimple mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Precept without any ſorrow or repentance;
or elſe that Men may be ſaved, who live and
die under the guilt of immoral Evil in the
groſſeſt ſenſe.</p>
               <p>For tho it is granted that a true Chriſtian
may be guilty in ſome ſenſe of an Immoral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and who is not? yet if a moral Precept be
broke in the Letter of it, or in the groſſeſt ſenſe,
as he that commits <hi>actual Adultery</hi> or <hi>Murder;</hi>
can ſuch be ſaved, living and dying in thoſe
Sins, without any true ſight of the Evil of them,
or Repentance for them? nay, that do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
live in the literal breach of this moral
Precept (as they call it) but teach men ſo to
do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they do it ignorantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ignorance of any Human Law, tho
the breach of it be death, will not excuſe any
Man, becauſe the Law is publiſhed, or they
may know it. So ignorance cannot excuſe a
man that breaks any Precept of the Moral Law
of God.</p>
               <p>9. This Notion and Principle of theirs ſeems
not only to admit of ſuch Conſequences natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to attend it; but they indeed expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very directly on this occaſion, even to
ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven all that
keep not the Seventh-day Sabbath, or at leaſt
ſuch who teach men to break it.</p>
               <p>

'tis not <hi>do,</hi> but <hi>believe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Is not this Man ignorant of the way to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life; did our Lord come to <hi>ratify</hi> the


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61730:94"/>
                  <hi>Decalogue</hi> for us, to keep and fulfil in our own
Perſons, thereby to be juſtified and ſaved?
Here is not one word of the Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt. No, no, but that Righteouſneſs that
muſt exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes,
is our own inherent Righteouſneſs only. True,
we ſay a ſincere inherent Righteouſneſs we
muſt have for a meetneſs for Eternal Life;
but that is not our title to it, or the way to
it, but the Righteouſneſs and Merits of Chriſt
alone.</p>
               <p>Doth he not eſtabliſh the Covenant of Works
and Juſtification by the Law? What Popiſh
Doctrin is worſe?</p>
               <p>Alſo in a <hi>printed Paper</hi> given one Lord's Day
at the Door<note n="*" place="margin">Of our Meeting-houſe. Pag. 1, 2.</note> by ſome <hi>Sabbatarian,</hi> you have
theſe words; <hi>Chriſt died to procure Grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
men to fulfil this Law,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. (not
that 'tis fulfilled <hi>in us,</hi> that is in our head, <hi>i. e.</hi>
by Chriſt in our Nature for us) but in us,
that is, by us. <hi>O woful</hi> ſtuff!</p>
               <p>Beſides, doth Chriſt help us to fulfil the
whole Law perfectly? If ſo, 'tis by the Law
thus fulfilled that we are juſtified; and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
'tis not by the <hi>Obedience of one Man that we
are made Righteous.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> Do not theſe men,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> like the
Jews, go about to eſtabliſh their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?
Moreover, their Doctrin renders all
that keep not, or <hi>violate their</hi> Sabbath, to be
<hi>guilty of the breach of the whole Law,</hi> which
they affirm this is one Point of <hi>(i. e.</hi> a ſimple
moral Precept) and not the leaſt Command
neither I fear with theſe men.</p>
               <p>Now, my Brethren, how are theſe young
Men and others blinded, who out of miſtaken
Zeal ſtrive to bring in a <hi>Jewiſh Rite,</hi> or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the old Legal Sabbath; in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which Error they diſperſe ſuch pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61730:95"/>
Books and <hi>Pamphlets</hi> as tend directly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
the Covenant of Works, to the utter
deſtroying the Doctrin of the Goſpel, and the
free Grace of God in our Juſtification by the
Obedience of Chriſt alone, and to the palpable
hazard and perdition of their own and other
Peoples Souls. Theſe Perſons ſeek to ſacrifice
all that is truly valuable, to the blind obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Day that obliges them to keep the
whole Law.</p>
               <p>10. That the natural Conſequence of their
Principle and Practice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P. 405, 406.</hi> Their Principle tends to harden the Jews.</note> as Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>
ſhews, <q>tends to the great ſcandal of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, and to the hardening of the
Jews in their Infidelity, is apparent to all:
For the Introduction of any part of the old
<hi>Moſaical Syſtem</hi> of Ordinances, is a tacit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of Chriſt's being come in the Fleſh, at
leaſt of his being King and Law-giver to his
Church. And to lay the Foundation of all
religious ſolemn Worſhip in the obſervation
of a <hi>Day,</hi> as the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> preciſely had no
relation to any natural or moral Precept, nor
was inſtituted or approved by Jeſus Chriſt,
cannot but be unpleaſing to them who deſire
to have their Conſciences immediately influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
by his Authority in all their approaches
unto God. But Chriſt herein is ſuppoſed to
have built the whole Fabrick of his Worſhip
on the Foundation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to have
grafted all his Inſtitutions into a Stock that was
not of his own planting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>11. Moreover, it is evident that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of their Opinion concerning the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
obſervation of the Seventh-day Sabbath, as
the Doctor ſaith,<note place="margin">It tends to Schiſm.</note> tends to the increaſing and
perpetuating of <hi>Schiſms</hi> and Differences among
Chriſtians. <q>And thoſe are the worſt, ſaith


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61730:95"/>
he, and moſt pernicious, which occaſion or
draw after them any thing whereby men are
hindred from joining together in the ſame
publick ſolemn Worſhip, whereby they yield
unto God that reverence of his Glory—
But now upon a ſuppoſition of an adherence
by any unto the <hi>Seventh-day Sabbath,</hi> all
Communion among Profeſſors in ſolemn Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances
is rendered impoſſible: For if
thoſe of that Perſwaſion do expect that others
will be brought unto a relinquiſhment of an
<hi>Evangelical obſervance of the Lord's Day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
they will find themſelves miſtaken. The
evidence which they have of its appointment,
and the experience they have had of God's
preſence in its religious obſervation, will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their practice in this matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Seventh-day Sabbath men on the other hand,
ſuppoſing themſelves obliged to meet for <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi>
Worſhip on the Seventh-day (which the
other account unwarrantable for them to do
on the pretence of any binding Law to that
purpoſe) and eſteeming it unlawful (ſaith he)
to aſſemble religiouſly with others on the
Firſt-day, on the <hi>plea</hi> of <hi>Evangelical</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,
do abſolutely cut off themſelves from
all poſſibility of Communion in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Goſpel-Ordinances with any other
Churches of Chriſt. And whereas moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
breaches as to Communion are in their
nature capable of healing, without a <hi>renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi>
of thoſe Principles in the minds of
men, which ſeem to give countenance to
them; the diſtance is here made abſolutely
irreparable, while the Opinion maintained is
owned by any. I will preſs this, ſaith he,
no further, but only by affirming that Perſons
<hi>truly fearing</hi> the Lord, ought to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61730:96"/>
and jealous over their own Underſtanding,
before they embrace an Opinion and Practice
which will ſhut them from all viſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the generality of the Saints of
God in the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which let me add, How can they have
Communion with us, if they conſider and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Conſequences of their Principle? Are
not we guilty of abſolute Immorality, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
literal breach of one <hi>Precept</hi> of the <hi>firſt Table?</hi>
Can they, or we have Communion with ſuch as
<hi>bow down to a graven Image, or profane the holy
Name of God,</hi> or are guilty of <hi>Murder,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
               <p>And thus you may ſee what the natural and
genuine Conſequences of this Principle are, and
that it not only tends to lay the Generation of
the Righteous under the guilt of the breach of
a moral Precept, and renders them guilty in
their ſenſe of the breach of the whole Law, but
hath other bad Conſequents attending it alſo.</p>
               <p>And this may tend to convince all (that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of what I ſay) that the Morality of the
fourth Commandment doth not conſiſt in that
preciſe Seventh-day Sabbath, and diſcovers how
blind theſe Men are.</p>
               <p>Brethren, tho I believe many who keep this
Day, and affirm it is a moral Precept, are very
pious and good Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Some of them are for free Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and do not affirm
what I ſay, nor may be ſee it not to be ſo, or will
not ſay thus: What then? yet I will appeal
to all thinking impartial Perſons, whether I do
not infer the direct natural Conſequence of their
Principle.</p>
               <p>Moreover, let me ask here this Queſtion, how
it can ſtand conſiſtent with a good Conſcience
for a Miniſter to forbear preaching in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
ſome part of Morality, or a moral
Precept. I grant that Love, Wiſdom, Charity,


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61730:96"/>
Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may prevent ſome Men from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome Duties of <hi>mere poſitive right,</hi> for a
ſhort time at leaſt, that are diſputable, and
not Eſſentials of Salvation. But what are ſuch
things to <hi>a ſimple moral Precept,</hi> both <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi>
and <hi>formally</hi> one of the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
as they affirm their Sabbath is?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Miniſter preaches to a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he knows are generally guilty of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
a Graven Image,</hi> or <hi>of profane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>of Adultery,</hi> or of <hi>killing their innocent
Neighbours;</hi> would not he preach againſt theſe
horrid Evils, for fear he ſhould offend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation?
or if he forbear ſo to do, would he
not be ſhamefully guilty of great Sin, and of
their Blood alſo? <hi>Happy is the Man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
not himſelf in the thing he allows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know what ſome have ſaid about <hi>Polygamy:</hi>
if they anſwer me, let them uſe that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I am prepared to reply.</p>
               <p>But let none think I ſpeak thus to expoſe any
of them out of Prejudice; for I can appeal to
Almighty God I have none againſt any of their
Perſons: But it is to expoſe their Principle and
Practice, in love to their Souls, and to the
Souls of other Perſons.</p>
               <p>But before I conclude with this old Sabbath,
I muſt add one dangerous Conſequence more of
their Principle.</p>
               <p>12. Is not that a dangerous Error that
reflects, nay caſts Contempt upon the Holy
Ghoſt, in reſpect of his Work and Office,
which is to convince Believers of all Sin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of all immoral Evils, under his moſt clear
and glorious Miniſtration, ſince our Saviour's
Aſcenſion into Heaven?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:61730:97"/>
Now I ask our Opponents, Whether the holy
Spirit doth convince all Believers that they ought
to keep the old Seventh-day Sabbath, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them for Immorality in the non-obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
thereof?</p>
               <p>Sirs, as theſe things aggravate their Evil in
what they affirm, ſo it clearly tends to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the pretended Morality of that preciſe
Seventh-day Sabbath: for the holy Spirit never
convinces Believers of any ſuch Duty, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
them <hi>for working on that day,</hi> or for
<hi>bearing of Burdens</hi> on it, any more than on any
other day in the week, to their dying day.
But it lets them ſilently fall aſleep, without the
leaſt ſenſe of any ſuch pretended immoral
Evil.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the generality of Believers after their
utmoſt inquiry, ſearch, and ſeeking to God
in all ſincerity, cannot be convinc'd it is their
Duty to keep this Day.</p>
               <p>Would the Holy Ghoſt thus leave the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of the Godly under Sin, and ſuch
Ignorance (think you) were this a moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
And as to ſuch as do obſerve it, I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Spirit of God never taught them ſo to
do. But they in this are left to themſelves,
and <hi>have a Zeal,</hi> but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
which God in time I hope by his Spirit
will convince them of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If it be thus, what think you of them
that obſerve this Sabbath?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to ſuch gracious Chriſtians who
obſerve it out of Conſcience, and becauſe 'tis
put into the fourth Commandment, do think
it may be their Duty ſo to do, but attempt
not to affirm it is a <hi>moral Duty;</hi> nor dare
they neglect to obſerve the <hi>firſt Day,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61730:97"/>
they are in a Capacity (being not
Servants) to obſerve both Days, and make no
noiſe nor diſturbance about it, but keep it to
themſelves: I think it may be (as to them) a
harmleſs Error.</p>
               <p>And as to others, I muſt leave them to the
Lord, and judg them not, tho I judg and muſt
condemn their Principle. And let them take
heed how they judg us in reſpect of the non-obſervation
of a Jewiſh Rite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of Jewiſh
Sabbath-days.</p>

Churches; either in reſpect of any one preciſe

Worſhip to be perform'd. I ſpeak not now of
the mode of Worſhip, but any eſſential part
thereof.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the Miniſter and
great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did teach the

by aſſembling together to diſcharge the Duties

               <p>Nor can it be once ſuppoſed, ſince he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to take the Churches off from the
obſervance of the Jewiſh Sabbath (as I have

diſcover to them what day of the week Chriſt
had commanded his People to obſerve in the
time of the Goſpel: they knowing eſpecially
that one day in ſeven the Lord declared <hi>in the
fourth Commandment</hi> he would have perpetually
ſequeſtred to his Service, as alſo the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or equitableneſs thereof.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> as I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to anſwer all the pretended Arguments
brought to prove that we ought to obſerve the
old <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> the ſimple Morality of the
<hi>fourth Commandment,</hi> they ſay, conſiſting in
the obſervation of that preciſe day: So I ſhall
now, God aſſiſting, attempt to prove that we


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61730:100"/>
are obliged to obſerve the <hi>firſt day of the week</hi>
as a day of Reſt, and ſolemn Worſhip to
God; while I eſteem ſuch as are for no ſpecial
or particular day to be obſerved by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
both in private Families and in Church
Aſſemblies, to be ſtrangely left of God, and to
be no friends to our ſacred Religion, but ſuch
as open a door to great Licentiouſneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If therefore any ſhould ſay, that</hi> there is no
one preciſe day in ſeven of Divine Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, but that the Church
may appoint what day ſhe pleaſeth: <hi>I reply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. What force or authority can ſuch a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Precept have upon any Man's Conſcience,<note place="margin">To appoint a weekly day of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> the obſervance of <hi>one day in every week</hi> free
from all worldly Buſineſs, if God requires it
not?</p>
               <p>2. Then alſo it would follow, that God doth
admit vile Man to ſhare, or partake of equal
Honour with himſelf; <hi>i. e.</hi> that tho he will
appoint the Ordinances of his own Worſhip,
and have all that Glory to himſelf, yet Man
ſhall have the honour to appoint the <hi>preciſe,
conſtant time</hi> of his Worſhip, which is next in
point of honour to the other.</p>
               <p>3. And by granting Men that Honour and
Dignity, it may let in by parity of reaſon, a
Power to <hi>alter,</hi> and <hi>change,</hi> if not <hi>add</hi> new
Laws and Ordinances of Worſhip alſo.</p>
               <p>4. Beſides, it will alſo follow, that the Church
on the <hi>firſt day of the week</hi> doth not meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by Divine Appointment, if all days are
alike, but only by human Authority.</p>
               <p>5. Moreover, perhaps one part of the Church
may be for one <hi>day in four;</hi> and another leſs
zealous may be for <hi>one day in a fortnight;</hi> nay,
one <hi>day in a month</hi> ſome may ſay is ſufficient.


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61730:100"/>
So that it would put all things into confuſion;
for how can a human Law, or the bare Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Church, without the Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, awe the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Moreover, perhaps ſome would be for no
day at all; and what then would become of
the publick and private Worſhip of God?</p>
               <p>That <hi>Notion</hi> therefore, that every day is
alike, is moſt hateful to God no doubt: for as
ſoon as he eſtabliſhed a viſible Church, giving a
<hi>ſtinted, ſtated Worſhip, Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi>
he appointed himſelf the preciſe time of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
under the Law; and the <hi>equitableneſs,</hi> as
well as the Divine Authority of <hi>one day in ſeven,</hi>
is, as I have proved, perpetually obligatory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all his People. For the further clearing of
this, pray conſider that,</p>
               <p>1. Chriſt is Lord of the Sabbath, and of that
Day God would have obſerv'd under the Goſpel:
and tho he hath diſpenſed with the obſervance
of the ſeventh Day, or aboliſhed that, yet as
Lord and Lawgiver he hath inſtituted a weekly
day of Reſt for his People, and for his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Worſhip in Goſpel-times. And none
have this Power but himſelf alone: For ſhall
the <hi>Servant</hi> appoint what <hi>preciſe time</hi> his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'s
buſineſs ſhall be done, or ſet the times
when his Maſter's <hi>Family</hi> ſhall have their diſtinct
Meals, or be fed? No certainly.</p>
               <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> p. 127.</note> as Reverend Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> obſerves,
if any pretend that Chriſt hath delegated this
Power of his to his Church, it ſtands upon them
to make it good.</p>
               <p>What times God himſelf took to work in,
or to reſt after Creation, the ſame proportion
of time (as Dr. <hi>Lake</hi> hints) did he aſſign to
Men, and made his Pattern a perpetual Law.
So then of our time God reſerves a ſeventh part
for his Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:61730:101"/>
The reſerving (ſaith he) a <hi>ſeventh</hi> part I
hold to be God's Ordinance, who is not varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in his choice, but as everlaſting as the
World.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſhould the hallowing of the Seventh-day
from the Creation have been, had it not
been for Sin; for what could have altered it
but a new Creation?</p>
               <p>2. But Man having ſinned, and ſo aboliſhed
the firſt Creation <hi>de jure,</hi> tho not <hi>de facto,</hi>
God was pleaſed to make by Chriſt an inſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
[or renewal] of the World (he means,
as I conceive, God ſo aboliſhed the <hi>old Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
that no preciſe Day remains to be obſerved
in the remembrance of it) and by Chriſt in
redemption hath made a new Heaven and a
new Earth; and <hi>old things being paſſed away;
all things are become new:</hi> Yea, every man in
Chriſt is a new Creature (or of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
And as God when he ended his Work of
the firſt Creation, made a Day of Reſt, and
ſanctified it: So Chriſt when he ended the
Work of Redemption, made a Day of Reſt,
and ſanctified it; not altering the proportion
of Time which is perpetual, but taking the firſt
of ſeven for his portion, becauſe it ſutes with
his <hi>new Creation,</hi> and with his entring into it
thro him; that old being a Legal Rite, and
ſuting with the Covenant of Works, which is
aboliſhed with the Covenant it ſelf; but the
new, the firſt of ſeven, remains for ever.</p>
               <p>3. For the further clearing of this matter,
conſider, that under the firſt Creation God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
one Day in ſeven for himſelf:<note place="margin">The equity of Precepts may abide.</note> But the
preciſe Seventh-day being a <hi>Judicial</hi> Law, is
gone; yet the equity or equitableneſs of one
Day in ſeven as due to God, to be improved to
his Glory for ever, remains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:61730:101"/>
4. God then gave poor Servants and Cattel,<note place="margin">Servants and Cattel ſtill have one day in 7. to reſt in.</note>
one Day of Reſt in ſeven; the laſt Day of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is gone, but the equity or <hi>equitableneſs</hi> of
one Day in ſeven for a day of Reſt for Servants
and Cattel, remains for ever.</p>
               <p>5. God required his People to give his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
under the Law the Tenth of all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe:
the Law of Tithes is gone, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
or equitableneſs that his Miniſters under
the Goſpel ſhould have as ſufficient a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
remains for ever.</p>
               <p>6. Under the Law God required his People
to meet together in his material Temple; the
Temple is gone, but the equity or equitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of aſſembling together in ſome place or
another for Publick Worſhip, remains for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>7. Under the Law God's People in their
Prayers offered Incenſe: Incenſe was typical,
and is gone; but the equitableneſs of our Duty
in making our Prayers to God, and confeſſing
our Sins, remains for ever.</p>
               <p>8. They under the Law had Inſtruments of
Muſick when they ſang God's Praiſes: Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Muſick were typical, and only ſerved
the Jewiſh Worſhip; but the equitableneſs of
the Duty to ſing God's Praiſes with Grace in
our Hearts, remains for ever.</p>
               <p>9. Alſo note, that the <hi>ſecond Commandment</hi>
(as given by <hi>Moſes)</hi> injoined the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to obſerve the whole <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> and
all other Precepts of the <hi>Moſaical Oeconomy.</hi>
But as the Moral Law is in the hands of Chriſt,
the <hi>ſecond Command</hi> doth not injoyn on us the
obſervance of thoſe Precepts, becauſe aboliſhed;
but it injoyns on us the obſervance of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded
us. Alſo that Clauſe in the <hi>ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>


                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:61730:102"/>
viz. <hi>Viſiting the Iniquities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
on the Children to the third and fourth
Generation;</hi> doubtleſs belonged to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works, and was a temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
Doth God do thus under the New
Covenant? Moreover, the Promiſe annexed to
the <hi>fifth Commandment,</hi> ſhews that the Law,
as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> only appertained to the
People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as alſo the Preface to them
all, <hi>Exod. 20. 2.</hi> doth the like.</p>
               <p>10. So the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> (as in the
hand of <hi>Moſes)</hi> injoyned the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
the obſervance of the <hi>Seventh-day:</hi> But as the
Law is in the hand of Chriſt, it doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
us to obſerve that day, but being a Shadow
is aboliſhed. But it doth injoyn us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the <hi>firſt day of the Week,</hi> which Chriſt
(as the <hi>Lord of the Sabbath)</hi> hath inſtituted
under the Goſpel in its room, tho not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
with that legal <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> and <hi>penalty</hi> as
the old Sabbath, which was a ſign of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works, and gendred to bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But where is there a Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the firſt Day of the Week; and by whom
was it required?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the cry of our Adverſaries:
and I anſwer, that I doubt not but our Lord
and Saviour at this time did inſtitute it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
gave command to his Diſciples to obſerve it.
I know ſome others have cryed, <hi>Where is lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands either upon Elders, or baptized
Believers as ſuch commanded?</hi> and ſo of divers
other things: as if every Precept of the Goſpel
muſt be laid down in expreſs words of command
becauſe ſome of them are.</p>
               <p>1. But to proceed; Let it be well conſidered,
that as I have proved from the <hi>fourth Command,</hi>
that a Time, a ſufficient Time for <hi>Reſt,</hi> and in


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61730:102"/>
the <hi>ſolemn Worſhip of God,</hi> is a ſimple Moral
Duty:</p>
               <p>2. And that God alſo hath there, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
poſitive Law, laid claim to <hi>one Day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
as perpetually obligatory on his People.
And as I have alſo proved, that the <hi>laſt Day of
ſeven</hi> was only given to the Jews, or People
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that it is utterly aboliſhed, it
being a ſign of the Covenant of Works:</p>
               <p>3. So I ſhall now prove that our Lord has
appointed the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the Week for us to
obſerve under the Goſpel. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider, Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God,
as Mediator, is the only Head, Sovereign Lord,
and Lawgiver to his Church; and therefore it
may ſeem ſtrange, that the ſpecial Day or Time
of Goſpel-worſhip in his own Kingdom-ſtate,
ſhould not be given forth by himſelf. But
that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have that Honour aſcribed
to him, and that we ſhould commemorate the
glorious Work of the New Creation, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
on the old Day, which was partly
appointed for remembrance of the Work of
the firſt Creation,<note place="margin">Iſa. 65. 17.</note> is very ſtrange: for the
Prophet tells us, that upon the <hi>creating of the
new Heaven and the new Earth, the former
ſhall be no more remembred;</hi> that is, (as I
conceive) not in ſuch a way of remembrance,
<hi>i. e.</hi> by the obſervation of that former Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in part on that very account. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
God's glorious Works of the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall otherwiſe be never forgot, and 'tis
evident the Text refers to the Goſpel day. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
Paul</hi> applys to the New Teſtament
Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Now in my Text our bleſſed Lord
gives forth his Commiſſion: <hi>Go and teach all
Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. and then theſe


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61730:103"/>
words are added, <hi>teaching them to obſerve all
things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> What
many of thoſe Commands were, we know not.
It is alſo ſaid, <hi>Acts 1. 2, 3.</hi> that he was with
his Diſciples forty days and forty nights, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>given Commandment to his Apoſtles whom he
had choſen.</hi> Yet neither in this place are thoſe
Commandments expreſſed, only he bid them
not to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they received
the promiſed Spirit, and <hi>were indowed with
Power from on high.</hi> Now no doubt but dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe 40 days, he fully ſettled all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to his Spiritual Kingdom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
them in all matters they ſhould both
do and teach. And can any rationally judg,
that he did not then command them which day
in <hi>ſeven</hi> he would have obſerved as a Day of
Reſt and ſolemn Worſhip?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the purſuit of what I aim at,
conſider, that from the day of his aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven, till the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> there
were but <hi>ten days,</hi> during which we do not
read they had any ſpecial general Aſſembly for
Religious Worſhip, tho on the two firſt days
ſome were together, and on both thoſe days he
appeared to them. And remarkable it is, that
there were two Jewiſh Sabbath-days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Aſcenſion and the day of their firſt
general ſolemn meeting. Now had not the old
Sabbath been gone, certainly they had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
on both thoſe days: but no doubt our
Lord had told them on what day they ſhould
firſt meet together, in expectation of the Gift
and Promiſe of the Father; which day he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ratify as the only Day of Goſpel-worſhip,
by a marvellous effuſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
To me nothing deſerves more to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
than this, <hi>viz.</hi> on what day of the Week


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61730:103"/>
the <hi>firſt general Goſpel-Aſſembly</hi> was held, after
our Lord's Reſurrection, and juſt upon (or
ſoon after) his Aſcenſion: for no doubt that
was the day which Chriſt did ſettle in his
Goſpel-Church. And that they were bid to be
altogether on this day, and to wait till it was
come, ſeems plainly implyed in the very words
of the Text, <hi>Acts 2. 1. And when the day of
Pentecoſt was fully come;</hi> fully come, doth not
that denote they waited for it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Well, and what then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, <hi>they were all with one accord in
one place.</hi> Certainly this Aſſembly of the
Church on this day was by divine appointment;
and our Lord might order their firſt aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
together then (I mean on this firſt day of
the Week) becauſe <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> fell out then,
and becauſe he knew that great multitudes
would be together then to celebrate that Feaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore, as S.</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>notes,</hi> God
ſent down the Holy Ghoſt at that time of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,
becauſe thoſe men that did conſent to our
Saviour's death, might publickly receive rebuke
for that bloody Act; and ſo bear record to the
power of our Saviour's Goſpel before the World.</p>
               <p>This day, I ſay, was the <hi>firſt day of the
Week;</hi> and then the mighty effuſion of the
Holy Ghoſt came upon the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
no leſs than <hi>three thouſand Souls</hi> were <hi>converted
on this Day.</hi> Theſe were two of the moſt
wonderful things that ever were done by our
Lord. And thus our Lord firſt ratified and
confirmed the preciſe Day, which no doubt he
had command his Diſciples to meet upon, as
the Day of Goſpel-Worſhip, before he in any
marvellous manner confirmed any Ordinance
pertaining to Goſpel-worſhip after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
The Jewiſh Sabbath, I muſt tell


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61730:104"/>
you, never was after ſo glorious a manner
confirmed. And remarkable it is, that God <hi>firſt</hi>
gave the Sabbath to the Jews, <hi>Exod. 16.</hi> before
he gave any written Laws of Worſhip; they
had their Sabbath a month before they came
to <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> where the Law was given.
So Chriſt firſt confirmed the Goſpel-day of
Worſhip, before he confirmed any Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Worſhip after his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But we deny that Pentecoſt was the firſt
day of the Week, becauſe the Jewiſh Rabbins ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that by Sabbath, <hi>Lev. 23. 11.</hi> is not meant the
weekly Sabbath, but the 1ſt day of unleavened Bread,
wherein they are followed by ſome Chriſtians alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall prove that <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was the
firſt day of the Week;</p>
               <p>1. By the Word of God.</p>
               <p>2. By Univerſal Tradition.</p>
               <p>3. By the Teſtimony of moſt approved
Writers: and then what will become of your
fabulous <hi>Rabbinical</hi> traditional Jews, or of ſuch
Chriſtians who too fondly admire their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which contradict the Holy Scripture?</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">The day of Pentecoſt the firſt day of the Week.</note> I ſay, the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was not, as
<hi>Tillam</hi> and others pretend, the <hi>ſeventh-day</hi> of the
Week, or the Jewiſh Sabbath, but the <hi>firſt-day,</hi>
or the <hi>Lord's Day.</hi> But let me premiſe,</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> is the ſame which is called
the <hi>Feaſt of Harveſt,</hi> Exod. 23. 16. and the
<hi>Feaſt of Weeks,</hi> Deut. 16. 10. this all agree in.</p>
               <p>2. That it is called by a Greek name <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt</hi>
(or the fiftieth day) becauſe always to
be obſerved on the <hi>fiftieth</hi> day from the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>wave ſheaf,</hi> as we read <hi>Lev. 23. 15, 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Now that this day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was
not upon the Jewiſh Sabbath, but on the day
after it, is expreſly aſſerted in the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Text, <hi>Lev. 23. 11. And he ſhall wave


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61730:104"/>
the Sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n the morrow after the Sabbath the Prieſt ſhall
wave it.</hi> And in <hi>ver. 15, 16.</hi> they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to count from thence ſeven Sabbaths,
and on the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath
to keep the <hi>fiftieth day</hi> or <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Wave-offering was the morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the weekly Sabbath.</note> Obſerve,
the <hi>Sheaf</hi> was to be waved the day after <hi>the
Sabbath;</hi> this is ſpoken in contradiſtinction to
the Feaſts ſpoken of in the <hi>2d</hi> Verſe, which are
elſewhere called <hi>Sabbaths:</hi> but here is an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi>
laid on the word <hi>[the Sabbath] i. e.</hi> the
Sabbath ſpoken of <hi>ver. 3.</hi> And that it is not
meant of any of thoſe fore-mentioned Feaſts,
appears in that there are not any particular
Feaſts mentioned, but there is a Command to
obſerve them, and the word is in the plural
number there. Therefore no particular Feaſts,
as the firſt day of unleavened Bread, but the
Seventh-day Sabbath is directly here meant.
For wherever there is mention of <hi>the Sabbath</hi>
without a reſtriction to any other Feaſts, it is
to be underſtood of the Seventh-day Sabbath,
as <hi>Exod. 16. 15. To morrow is the Reſt of the
holy Sabbath:</hi> the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> limits it to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
Sabbath, and that becauſe there is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o other Feaſt particularly ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tradition has handed it down to us
that the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was the firſt day of
the week; and it is the day call'd <hi>Whit-ſunday.</hi>
Now if Tradition has failed here, it fails alſo
as to their ſeventh day: for how do we know
this is the firſt day, or yeſterday was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
but by Tradition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here I might mention many learned
Writers; yea all generally do affirm that <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt</hi>

It was called the Feaſt of</hi> Pentecoſt, <hi>or the</hi>

Feaſt was the morrow after the Sabbath,</hi> i. e.

                  <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was the firſt day
of the week. <q>When the Lord Chriſt intended
conſpicuouſly to build his Church upon his

he did it on this day, which was then among

               </p>
               <p>From hence was the Account taken of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Sabbaths, or fifty Days; and upon the
morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath (which was
our Lord's Day) was that famous Feaſt of
Weeks, that day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> Acts 2. 1.</p>
               <p>Upon which day the Apoſtles having them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
received the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
three thouſand Souls with the Word of

Here was the Feaſt of Loaves in the <hi>Antitype,</hi>
that feaſted ſome thouſands of Souls.</p>
               <p>And from that time forward do the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
note, that the Lord's Day was obſerved in

Sabbath. Thus Dr. <hi>Vſher,</hi> that Library of

               <p>Object. <hi>If it be objected,</hi> That in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
he ſtates Chriſt ſuffering at the Feaſt of

which takes the morrow after the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,

               <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> That cannot be: for he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
before that the Sabbath there intended
is the weekly Sabbath; and the morrow after

uſes to conſecrate to God, not only the firſt
of their Fruits, and firſt born, but the firſt
Fruits of their Days and Years alſo. Thus
the illuſtrious number of Seven has carried
the honour of <hi>Pentecoſt:</hi> for Seven being
compoſed upon it ſelf, makes fifty wanting
but one day, which we have taken from this
future Age, being both the eighth and the
firſt Day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Argument is clearly this, that the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Pentecoſt was fain to be beholden to the
Chriſtians <hi>eighth</hi> day, or firſt day of the
Week, to make up the compleat number of
fifty days.</p>
               <p>And the like he ſays a little before concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Jubilee</hi> every fiftieth year: for ſeven
times ſeven makes but forty nine; to perfect
the number, they borrowed the firſt day of
the Week, and ſo conſecrated to God the firſt
of their Days as well as of their Land.</p>
               <p>So that this computation of the fifty days to
Pentecoſt, from the morrow of the Sabbath,
wants no Authority to back it, either divine or
humane.</p>
               <p>But the Word of God is our beſt Warrant;
and we may be ſatisfied that Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> was no
Child at Argument, nor one that would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

<hi>Vſher</hi>'s diſcovery of this Truth by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

great ſatisfaction, and acknowledges that

Opinion of the Hebrew Doctors, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are excellent Guides when they keep
the <hi>beaten Road</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things made void the Commandments of
God by their Traditions. Let this Miſtake lie
at their door; for certainly a miſtake it is, and
that the morrow after the Sabbath could
not be the Paſſover, is clear, becauſe,</p>
               <p>2. It muſt be ſuch a Morrow after the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
as never falls upon the weekly Sabbath:
the reaſon is plain, becauſe it is the beginning
of Harveſt, when they put in their Sickle to
the Corn, or their Harveſt, <hi>Levit. 23. 10.</hi>
Which the are expreſly forbidden to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their weekly Sabbath, <hi>Exod. 34. 21, 22. Six
days thou ſhalt labour, but on the ſeventh thou
ſhalt reſt, both in earing Time and Harveſt.</hi>
And ſee how this is coupled with the Feaſt of
firſt Fruits in the very ſame place, <hi>Thou ſhalt
obſerve the Feaſt of Weeks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. Obſerve it, if the morrow after the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<hi>Levit. 23.</hi> had been the Morrow after
the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> this would often have fallen on the
weekly Sabbath: for the Paſſover being fixed
upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Niſan,</hi> whenever this <hi>15th</hi> of
<hi>Niſan</hi> fell upon the <hi>Friday,</hi> the morrow after
it muſt be <hi>Saturday,</hi> and ſo they muſt begin to
<hi>reap</hi> their <hi>Harveſt</hi> on the <hi>weekly Sabbath</hi> againſt
the expreſs Command of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> foreſaw this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and had no other way to ſalve it, but
by affirming that this reaping did drive away
the Sabbath, and that it was lawful on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day.
A moſt impious Opinion! for it croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the very Letter of God's <hi>Law, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>4. The morrow after the Sabbath, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61730:109"/>
of their Account, muſt be ſuch a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
as concludes it, <hi>Levit. 23. 15, 16.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it could not be the morrow after the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-Sabbath,
or any <hi>Feſtival;</hi> for there was
no ſuch Sabbath at the end of any Account
whatſoever.</p>
               <p>5. The Paſſover-Sabbath was fixed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
day of the Month, namely, the <hi>15th</hi> of
the firſt Month;<note place="margin">Numb. 28. 17.</note> and thus all their other Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals
had their fixed days.</p>
               <p>But this Feaſt of Pentecoſt is no where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
in all the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> to any certain
day of the Month: Nor indeed could it be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
God ſhould make a Ceremonial Law to
croſs the Law of Nature; or rather limit the
courſe of Divine Providence, to <hi>ripen</hi> their Corn
juſt againſt ſuch a day of the Month: which, as
Dr. <hi>Vſher</hi> obſerves, is a very great preſumption
that the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was a moveable Feaſt,
but immoveable as to the day of the Week; ſo
varying, that it might always fall upon the day
immediately following the ordinary Sabbath.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the beſt Key to unlock the
<hi>Type:</hi> And this is clear in the New Teſtament;
for that Chriſt was <hi>our firſt Fruits</hi> in reference
to his Reſurrection,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 20.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us; and
that he roſe from the dead on the morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the weekly Sabbath, all the <hi>four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
do inform us. And <hi>Tho. Tillam</hi> has granted,
that theſe things muſt be punctually fulfilled by
Chriſt, as well in the Time<note n="*" place="margin">Truth or Antitype.</note> as in the Type.</p>
               <p>From his own Grant therefore I conclude,
that the Day of firſt Fruits was the firſt day of
the Week, and therefore was the Day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,
to the everlaſting honour of that Lord's
Day, and the Glory of God the Holy Ghoſt,
who ſanctified it by his Preſence and Power,
ſending down a new ſupply of Tongues from


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61730:109"/>
Heaven (as if all the Tongues upon Earth
were not ſufficient) to ſound forth the Praiſes
of this Redeemer, and ſpread the Goſpel all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the World on the firſt day of the Week,
as an earneſt whereof there was a glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
made on this Day.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel was now publiſhed to ſome of all
Nations, there being a great concourſe even of
every Nation under Heaven met at <hi>Jeruſalem,
Acts 2. 5.</hi> and at this Meeting three thouſand
Souls were converted and baptized, <hi>ver. 41.</hi> A
double Baptiſm was indeed diſpenſed this Day;
the Apoſtles were now baptized with Fire, and
three thouſand Converts with Water; which
was ſuch a Solemnity, as the Church of God
never ſaw the like to that day, nor ſince.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſary <hi>Tillam</hi> Confeſſes,<note place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> that <hi>this
was the moſt glorious Sabbath that ever the
Church enjoyed;</hi> only he perſwaded himſelf and
others it was the <hi>Saturday-Sabbath:</hi> but herein
he befools himſelf, and deceives others.</p>
               <p>5. 'Tis ſtrange indeed any ſhould once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Feaſt of Pentecoſt could ever fall on
the Seventh-day Sabbath; becauſe as the Wave-Offering
was to be offered the morrow after
the Sabbath, ſo from that very day incluſively
they were to count ſeven Sabbaths, and then
the morrow after the laſt of the ſeven was the
<hi>fifth</hi> day, <hi>i. e.</hi> Pentecoſt. I need not ſay any
more to this.</p>
               <p>To conclude, after all attempts to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the Glory of the Spirit's Miſſion reſts on
the <hi>firſt day of the Week:</hi> This day the Church
of Chriſt was viſited from on high, the Promiſe
of the Father was ſent, the bleſſed Spirit came;
the Diſciples were aſſembled, <hi>Peter</hi> preached,
and three thouſand were converted and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
and all this is written: Why the Church


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61730:110"/>
aſſembled? (as Mr. <hi>Sprint</hi> argues) Why on
this Day? Why the Holy Ghoſt? Why
preaching, why converſion, and adminiſtration
of the Sacraments? Why the Promiſe of Chriſt
accompliſhed all on this Day? but ſtill to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the <hi>Will</hi> of Chriſt in appointing, bleſſing,
and ſanctifying of this Day to his Church, and
making it a day of publick ſolemn Worſhip, as
a Day in all its Prerogatives above all other
Days: A Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection, by
which we are juſtified, in which he ceaſed
from his Work, as God did from his on the
Seventh, and ſo hath the ſame reaſon for a Day
of Reſt: the Day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <argument>
                  <p>The Inſtitution and Foundation of the firſt
Day, proved from Heb. 4. 8, 9, &amp;c.
That it is the Day which the Lord hath
made for Divine Worſhip. That the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Primitive Churches aſſembling
together upon that Day, is a full proof of
the ſame.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MY Brethren, I have endeavoured to
prove, that the firſt Day of the Week
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath appointed
to be the ſpecial Day of <hi>Reſt,</hi> and for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God under the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By virtue of his Command, who was
with his Diſciples <hi>forty days giving them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
&amp;c. before his Aſcenſion, which are
not expreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was the <hi>firſt day
of the Week,</hi> when this Day was confirmed by
the miraculous effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt. But
to proceed:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> My next Argument ſhall be taken
from Chriſt's Reſting, or ceaſing from his
Works upon that day, as God did from his.</p>
               <p>And this indeed I take to be the Foundation
of the obſervance of the firſt Day; and that
which I mentioned laſt is a clear confirmation
thereof.</p>
               <p>In order to do this, conſider, that each Day
to be obſerved, either under the Law or Goſpel,
muſt be comprehended in the <hi>fourth Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>


                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:61730:111"/>
and that the change of the old Day takes not
away the perpetual Obligation of one day in
ſeven, nor the reaſon of that poſitive perpetual
Law.</p>
               <p>Now there are but two great and general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in which God is ſaid to reſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That after the <hi>firſt Creation</hi> was finiſhed,
God reſted from all his Work, namely, from
Creation-work, ſo as he never will create any
material thing again to the end of the World.
As to his creating the Soul, that is not the creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any new <hi>Species</hi> of Beings.</p>
               <p>2. The Reſt of God-man, after he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the Work of Redemption, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Creation, which is never to be repeated.
Now there is a moral Reaſon which is deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the fourth Commandment, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God reſts, there is a Foundation of a day
of Reſt for Man, comporting with the nature
and tendency of each Covenant to which that
Reſt doth refer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Thou ſhalt do no manner of Work,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for
in ſix days,</hi> &amp;c.] The word <hi>for</hi> implys a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reaſon, which makes it applicable to any
Reſt of God, therefore to God's Reſt from
the Work of Redemption, I mean that of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
which is alſo deducible from <hi>Heb. 4</hi>
Chriſt reſted from his Work, as God did from
his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore there remaineth a Reſt for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God:</hi>

                  <hi>for he that is entered into his Reſt,
hath alſo ceaſed from his Works, as God did
from his.</hi> Here is the Inſtitution of the Lord's
Day: For tho this Reſt hath a particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Goſpel-day of Reſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> of that
Grace, Reſt, and Peace Chriſt procured for
us, by <hi>his doing all that we had to do,</hi> and of
that <hi>burden of Puniſhment he bore, which we had


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61730:111"/>
to undergo for our Sins;</hi> yet not excluſive of a
particular Sabbath or day of Reſt; but it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
intended here as the Foundation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of it, becauſe that Reſt in the former
Verſes, which has a more particular reſpect to
the Reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> is ſpoken of not excluding
God's reſting the <hi>Seventh-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in purſuit of this I ſhall here cite ſome
material Paſſages out of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
who has fully confirmed what I here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
               <p>How the Creation of all things was finiſhed,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on the Sab. <hi>p. 256.</hi>
                  </note>
and the Reſt of God and Man that enſued
thereon, hath been (ſaith he) declared. It hath
alſo in part, and ſufficiently as to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
been evidenced, how the great Ends of
the Creation of all, in the Glory of God, and
the Bleſſedneſs of Man in him, with the Pledg

as it were defeated and diſappointed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

was founded in the Law of Creation, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it uſeleſs unto thoſe Ends—</p>
               <p>Hence it could no more bring Man to reſt

of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with the eſpecial application of its

his Spirit and Graces (as the Father continueth
to do in his Works of Providence) after the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
of his Works of the old Creation, tho
theſe Works belong thereunto; yet he ceaſeth
abſolutely from that kind of Work, whereby
he laid the Foundation of the new Creation:
henceforth he dyeth no more, and on this day
was he refreſhed in the view of his Works, for
he ſaw it was exceeding good.</p>
               <p>Now as God's Reſt,<note place="margin">This the Doctor. ſhews the Apoſtle chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</note> and his being refreſhed
in his Work on the ſeventh day of old, was a
ſufficient <hi>Indication</hi> of the <hi>preciſe day of Reſt,</hi>
which he would have obſerved under the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of that original Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
ſo the Reſt of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
and of his being refreſhed in and from his Work
on the firſt day, is a ſufficient <hi>Indication</hi> of the
preciſe day of Reſt to be obſerv'd under the
Diſpenſation of the new-Covenant, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>And the Church of Chriſt could not paſs one
Week under the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Pag. 267.</note> or in a Goſpel-ſtate
of Worſhip, without this Indication.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Judaical</hi> Sabbath, as ſure as it was ſo,
and as ſure as it was annexed to the <hi>Moſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>l</hi>
Adminiſtration of the Covenant, was ſo far abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd,


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61730:113"/>
as not to oblige really the Diſciples of
Chriſt in Conſcience to the Obſervation of it,
whatſoever any of them might for a ſeaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
And if a <hi>new day</hi> was not now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
there was no day or ſeaſon appointed
for an obſervance of an <hi>holy Reſt</hi> unto the Lord,
nor any pledg given us of our entering into the
Reſt of Chriſt.—</p>
               <p>Accordingly this <hi>Indication</hi> of the Goſpel-day
of Reſt,<note place="margin">§ 10.</note> and Worſhip, was imbraced by
the Apoſtles, who were to be as the <hi>chief Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Stones</hi> in the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian
Church.</hi> For immediately they aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on that day, and were confirmed in their
Obedience by the Grace of our Lord in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them thereon, <hi>Joh. 20. 19, 26.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it appears on this day only he appeared
to them, when they were aſſembled together,
altho <hi>occaſionally:</hi> he ſhewed himſelf to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
of them at other ſeaſons.—Moreover,
from this time forward <hi>this day</hi> was never
without its ſolemn Aſſemblies, as ſhall further
be cleared afterwards. Thus the <hi>Doctor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He then proceeds further to prove more
fully from this of <hi>Heb. 4.</hi> the Foundation and
Inſtitution of the Lord's-day; in which he has
certainly not only out-done all Expoſitors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, but hath made it very plain that the
firſt day is here by the Apoſtle declared to be
eſtabliſhed by Chriſt's <hi>Reſt,</hi> and our reſting in
him; and to be the day of Reſt and ſolemn
Worſhip under the Goſpel, as God's reſting
from his Work was the Foundation of the old
Sabbath.</p>
               <p>He cites <hi>Heb. 4. 3</hi>—11. moreover, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
the many <hi>Reſts</hi> mentioned,<note place="margin">Pag. 269, 230, 231, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and proves the
<hi>Reſt</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to intend the <hi>Reſt
of Chriſt</hi> and his People in the Goſpel-Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61730:114"/>
and not the eternal Reſt above, but that
Reſt which all that <hi>believe do enter into,</hi> after
Chriſt had done all our Work, and <hi>ceaſed,</hi> or
<hi>finiſhed his Work</hi> for ever, as God finiſhed his;
and as a pledg of his Reſt, hath left us a day
of Reſt: <hi>There remaineth therefore</hi> a <hi>Sabbatiſm
for the People of God.</hi> Here is both the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and Inſtitution of the <hi>firſt day</hi> as a day
of Reſt, or a Goſpel Sabbath; and the manner
of our entering into it, as well as the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the old day.</p>
               <p>The Foundation,<note place="margin">Pag. 279.</note> ſaith he, of the whole is
laid down, <hi>ver. 10. For he that is entered into
his Reſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ 20.</note> 
                  <hi>has ceaſed from his Works, as God did
from his:</hi> i. e. that as God ceaſed working,
reſted, and took ſatisfaction and <hi>complacency</hi> in
his Work, never working any more in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and ſo a Reſt followed on that day;
ſo Chriſt ceaſed and reſted from the Work
of Redemption on the <hi>firſt day,</hi> and a Reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for us on that day, he taking Reſt and
Complacency in his Work.</p>
               <p>There is the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the one and the other;
and theſe (ſaith he) alſo have their mutual
proportion. Now God reſted from his own
Work of Creation,</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>ceaſing from creating,</hi> only continuing
all things by his Power in their order and
propagation to his Glory.</p>
               <p>2. By his Reſpect to them, and Refreſhment
in them, as thoſe which expreſſed his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
and ſet forth his Praiſe, and ſo ſatisfied
his glorious Deſign.</p>
               <p>1. So Chriſt alſo muſt ceaſe working, <hi>i. e.</hi> he
muſt die no more, ſuffer no more, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Work of his Grace and Power in the
preſervation of the <hi>new Creation,</hi> and the orderly
increaſe and propagation of it by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:61730:114"/>
2. He takes delight and ſatisfaction in the
Works he hath wrought; <hi>for he ſees of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
of his Soul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 284.</note> 
                  <hi>and is ſatisfied.</hi>—In brief, all
that he did and ſuffered in and from his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to his Reſurrection, as <hi>Mediator</hi> of the
Covenant, with all the Fruits, and Effects, and
Conſequences of what he ſo did, whereby the
<hi>Church</hi> was built, and the <hi>new Creation</hi> finiſhed,
belongs to his Works.</p>
               <p>His Reſt that enſued on theſe Works, hath
two parts: (1.) A ceſſation from his Works,
which was eminent, and anſwered God's Reſt
from his Works. (2.) Satisfaction in his
Works, and the glorious Product of them, as
thoſe which had an Impreſſion on them of his
Love and Grace, <hi>Pſal. 16. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now leſt any ſhould ſuppoſe that Chriſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ceaſed from his Works,<note place="margin">Chriſt ceaſed from his Work on the day of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. <hi>P. 284. Sect. 23.</hi>
                  </note> when he died, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſaid <hi>'tis finiſhed,</hi> &amp;c. which certainly
refers to all thoſe things that were Types or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of him to that time; for the Work of
<hi>Redemption</hi> could not be finiſhed till <hi>he roſe from
the dead:</hi> Take what the Doctor further ſaith
to this. It remains, ſaith he, only that we
enquire into Chriſt's entrance into his Reſt,
both how and when he did ſo, even as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into his on the <hi>Seventh-day.</hi> For this
(ſaith he) muſt limit and determine a Day of
Reſt to the Goſpel-Church. Now this was not
his lying down in the Grave. His Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there reſted for a while: But that was no
part of his <hi>mediatory Reſt,</hi> as he was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Builder of the Church. For,</p>
               <p>1. It was part of his Humiliation: Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his death, but his abode and continuance in
the ſtate of death was ſo, and a principal part
of it: For after the whole human Nature was
united to the Perſon of the Son of God, to


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61730:115"/>
have it brought into a ſtate of <hi>diſſolution,</hi> or to
have the Body and Soul ſeparated from each
other, was a great Humiliation. And every,
thing of this nature belonged to his Work, and
not to his Reſt.</p>
               <p>2. This ſeparation of Body and Soul under
the Power of Death was <hi>penal,</hi> a part of the
Sentence of the Law which he underwent.
And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> declares, that the Pains of
Death were not looſed but by his Reſurrection,
<hi>Acts 2. 24.</hi> This therefore could not be his
Reſt, or any part of it.</p>
               <p>3. Nor did he <hi>firſt</hi> enter into his Reſt, at
his <hi>Aſcenſion:</hi> then he indeed took poſſeſſion of
his Glory—But to enter into his <hi>Reſt</hi> is one
thing, and to take poſſeſſion of Glory another.
—And it is placed by the Apoſtle as the
Conſequent of his <hi>being juſtified in the Spirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But this his entring into Reſt was in and by
his Reſurrection from the dead:—For,</p>
               <p>1. Then and there he was freed from the
Sentence, Power, and Stroke of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcharged of all the Debts of our Sins,
which he had undertaken to make ſatisfaction
for, <hi>Acts 2. 24.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Then and therein were all Types, all
Predictions and Prophecies fulfilled, which
concerned the Work of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>3. Then and therein his Work was done,
which anſwered to God's Creating-work.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Then and therein he</hi> was declared the Son
of God with Power.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus did the Author of the</hi> new Creation,<note place="margin">P. 286. Sect. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the</hi>
Son of God, <hi>the</hi> builder of the Church, <hi>having
finiſhed his Work,</hi> enter into his Reſt: <hi>And this
was on the</hi> morning of the firſt day of the Week.</p>
               <p>And hereby he did limit and determine the
Day for our <hi>Sabbatical Reſt</hi> under the New


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61730:115"/>
Teſtament: for now was the old Covenant
utterly aboliſhed; and therefore the <hi>Day</hi> which
was the Pledg of God's and Man's Reſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
was to be taken away, and accordingly was,
as we have proved.—</p>
               <p>And this is that which the Apoſtle affirms as
the ſubſtance of all he hath evinced,<note place="margin">P. 287. Sect. 25.</note> namely,
that there is a <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> for the People of
God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the word is framed by our
Apoſtle from an Hebrew Original, with a <hi>Greek</hi>
Termination; and he uſeth it as that which is
comprehenſive of his whole ſenſe, which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
word would be, for he would ſhew there
is a <hi>Sabbatical Reſt</hi> founded in the Reſt of God,
[God-man] remaining for the Church; and
therefore makes uſe of the ſame word whereby
God expreſſed his own Reſt, when he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> for a day of Reſt thereon.</p>
               <p>Again he further proves, that the Apoſtle
aſſerts an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Sabbath, or day of Reſt,
to be conſtantly obſerved in and for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God under the Goſpel. Thus far and
to this effect ſpeaks Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis, my Brethren, the Apoſtle's buſineſs in
this <hi>Chapter,</hi> as the Doctor has proved, to ſhew
an Inſtitution of the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the Week, and
this upon the great Work of Redemption, and
Chriſt's reſting from his Works, as God did
from his; as alſo the manner of his entering
into his <hi>Reſt,</hi> which was not till all our Work
was done by our Surety, and our Burden was
born by him for us; for till then we could not
enter into his Reſt.</p>
               <p>And being in his Reſt, he has appointed
this Day as a Pledg thereof, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with God, give him the firſt Day, and ſo

                  <hi>firſt</hi> in every day of the Week. Brethren, we
have Reſt before we work, or labour for it,
and ſo work from Reſt, Life and Peace, and
not work for Life, or to enter into Reſt that
way, as they were to do under the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Remarkable is that paſſage of <hi>Paul, As
many as walk according to this Rule</hi> (that is, the
Rule of the new Creature, or new Creation)
<hi>Peace be on them.</hi> And as in matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſo in reſpect to the new Day of Worſhip,
the Apoſtle pronounceth <hi>Peace</hi> to ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed how the firſt Day
was confirmed by the miraculous effuſion of the
Spirit, and alſo the Foundation and Inſtitution
of this Day, as here laid down by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The firſt Day made by the Lord for a Day of Reſt, Joy and Gladneſs in God's Worſhip.</note> 
                  <hi>My fourth</hi> Argument <hi>to prove the
Inſtitution of the firſt Day of the Week, ſhall
be taken from</hi> Pſal. 118. 22, 23, 24. The Stone
that the Builders refuſed, is become the head
Stone of the Corner. This is the Lord's doing,
and it is marvellous in our ſight. This is the Day
the Lord hath made, we will be glad and rejoice
in it.</p>
               <p>1. Pray obſerve that our Lord became the
Head-ſtone of the Corner on the day of his
happy Reſurrection; on this day the Goſpel-Church
took its beginning: On this day he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into his Reſt, and was inveſted with
actual Victory over all his Enemies, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with Soveraign Power and Authority as
King and Law-giver.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Well, and what ſaith the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
This is the Day the Lord hath made.</p>
               <p>1. He ſpeaks, as all Expoſitors note, of the
particular day of Chriſt's Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>2. And that <hi>this is the Day which the Lord
hath made:</hi> How made? God created that,


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61730:117"/>
and every day of the Week at firſt. But this
Day is conſtituted or made for ſome ſpecial
end and uſe, above any other day in the Week:
Nothing lies more plain in the Text than this.</p>
               <p>3. The Lord hath made it, <hi>i. e.</hi> inſtituted
or appointed it to theſe great Ends; not the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> not the Church, not Man, but the
Lord himſelf hath made it.</p>
               <p>4. And then the Goſpel-Church, and all
Goſpel-Believers ſignified by this word [we]
reſolve upon this Great Authority to obſerve it;
<hi>we will rejoice and be glad in it.</hi> Here it is
foretold that God hath ſingularly <hi>made, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi>
or <hi>inſtituted</hi> this Day for us, to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and to worſhip him with joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of heart; and accordingly we have proved
it was confirmed.</p>
               <p>I challenge any man to ſhew us a Reaſon why
any day beſides this can be here intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The Prophet alludes to the general Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-day,
or elſe only to that very preciſe day on
which Chriſt roſe; not that that day ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
be kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny not but that the general
Goſpel-days of Grace came in with this day:
but in the days of the Goſpel this Text alſo
ſhews God hath made or appointed a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Day to be obſerved with rejoycing and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heart, not the <hi>ſeventh</hi> but the <hi>firſt</hi> Day.
For it is evident this day was the day when
our Lord was made or became the Head-ſtone
of the Corner, <hi>viz.</hi> the day of his glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
Where is the general Day of the
Goſpel called a Day made? Is not this as much
as that at the beginning the Lord <hi>bleſſed and
ſanctified the ſeventh day?</hi> 'Tis not there ſaid
he ſanctified it for men ſucceſſively to keep.
Now (1.) Here is expreſſed a particular Day;


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61730:118"/>
and what day 'tis, the Verſes going before ſhew.
(2.) 'Tis a day made or inſtituted for ſingular
uſe. (3.) It is a day made by the Lord to
that end. (4.) For us to worſhip God in, or
to rejoice in before him with gladneſs of our
Heart. <hi>God meeteth him that rejoiceth, and that
remembers him in his ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. God hath made or inſtituted this Day for
ſingular, nay for the higheſt and chiefeſt End
and Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>2. And what day have we cauſe to rejoice
in, keep and obſerve like this day? For has not
Redemption-work the preference of Creation-work?
The Glory of Creation-work was mar'd
by Sin; but Redemption-work, Redemption-Grace,
reſtores the Image of God to us again,
and puts us into a far better condition than we
were in at firſt.</p>
               <p>In Redemption-work the glory of all God's
Attributes ſhines forth, ſo they did not in the
firſt Creation.</p>
               <p>The day of Chriſt's Reſurrection is the day of
our deliverance from Sin, the Law, Wrath, Death,
Devils, and all Enemies for ever. This is the Day
the Lord has made more honorable and glorious,
and more to be remembred than God's creating
the Heavens and the Earth. Are there any dare
ſay that the firſt Creation ought more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
than the <hi>ſecond</hi> or the <hi>new</hi> Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Or doth the Covenant of Works excel the
Covenant of Grace, or the Law the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>Did God's finiſhing his Work call for a day
of remembrance, and doth not Chriſt's finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Work call for the ſame? Certainly it
doth; and therefore <hi>this is the day the Lord
hath made, and we will rejoice and be glad in it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>new Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Seventh-day</hi> Sabbath was <hi>made</hi> for
Man under the legal and typical Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
ſo the <hi>firſt-day</hi> was made for Man, the
<hi>new Man,</hi> or for all the <hi>true Iſrael of God,</hi>
under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or for the <hi>Goſpel-Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God made the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> an <hi>honourable
day,</hi> anſwering his deſign in the firſt Creation;
and Chriſt has made this day a more <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
day, anſwering his <hi>deſign</hi> in <hi>Redemption,</hi> or
<hi>new Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. God made the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> a day of <hi>Reſt,</hi>
becauſe in it he ceaſed for ever from <hi>firſt-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
Works, and took <hi>complacency</hi> in his Works.
So the Lord Chriſt hath made the <hi>firſt</hi> day a
day of <hi>Reſt,</hi> becauſe in it he ceaſed for ever
from the Works of <hi>Redemption,</hi> never to die or
offer any more Sacrifice for Sin, and took <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi>
in his Work. <hi>This is</hi> therefore <hi>the
day the Lord hath made; and we will rejoice and
be glad in it.</hi> How made? ſaith one, not by
Creation, for ſo it was made before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:61730:119"/>
5. And as the ſeventh Day was inſtituted
and confirmed before the Law was given to
<hi>Iſrael, Exod. 16.</hi> ſo the firſt Day was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Act. 2.</hi> by the mighty effuſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
before any other Goſpel-Precept was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
after the Reſurrection of our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is called,<note place="margin">Dies Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicus, <hi>p. 71.</hi>
                     </note> ſaith Dr. <hi>Young, Dominicum,</hi>
becauſe, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> notes,—<hi>the Lord made it:</hi>
this, ſaith he, perhaps will be of no great
weight with ſome, ſince the Lord made all
days; but he ſeems to have made this day
after a ſpecial manner, namely, by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
from the dead (the Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which Benefit exceeded the Memory
of the old Creation)—or elſe becauſe it
was deſtinated for worſhipping the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it was propheſied what Day Chriſt
would ordain for his Service under the Goſpel,
and which Believers ſhould obſerve with Joy in
his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal. 118.</hi> compar'd with <hi>Acts 4.</hi> muſt needs,
ſaith Mr. <hi>Warren,</hi> be meant the day of Chriſt's
Reſurrection; and doth not the Spirit ſpeak
expreſly, <hi>this is the day the Lord hath made?</hi>
it is a day of the Lord's making; and will <hi>he</hi>
[that is <hi>Tillam]</hi> make nothing of that? what
elſe can be made of it, but a Prediction of a
Divine Inſtitution, which is equivalent to a
Precept; eſpecially when 'tis expounded by an
Apoſtolical Practice, as this hath been? what
can a day (made long before in reſpect of
Creation) be ſtiled the day which the Lord
hath made then in reſpect to a Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
an Inſtitution then it is, and that on the
occaſion of Chriſt's Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> My next Argument to prove that the


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61730:119"/>
Lord hath appointed the firſt day of the Week
as a day of Reſt and ſolemn Worſhip, ſhall
be taken from thoſe clear Examples we have in
the New Teſtament of the Diſciples, and
Churches of Chriſt meeting together in God's
Worſhip upon this day.</p>
               <p>1. Let this be conſidered, That that day
which the Saints and Churches in the Apoſtles
time obſerv'd, muſt be the <hi>preciſe</hi> day in every
week, which ought to be kept till our Lord
comes again. And,</p>
               <p>2. That an Apoſtolical Precedent or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is equivalent, or of like Authority with an
Apoſtolical Precept: ſo that had we no more
than this, it would be a ſufficient warrant for
the obſervation of this day.</p>
               <p>Now as the obſervation of the <hi>firſt day,</hi> as I
have proved, hath its <hi>Riſe, Foundation</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>
from the Reſurrection of our Lord
from the dead; ſo we find on that very day
the <hi>Apoſtles were aſſembled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>tho</hi> Thomas <hi>was not
there;</hi> and our Lord on that day appear'd unto
them: firſt in the <hi>morning</hi> of that day, to
<hi>Mary Magdalen, Mark 16. 9.</hi> and <hi>after that</hi>
(perhaps about Noon) <hi>he appeared in another
form to two of them as they walked in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</hi>
And in the Evening of the ſame day he
appeared to many of the Diſciples together.
<hi>Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt day
of the week, when the doors were ſhut where the
Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 19.</note>
                  <hi>came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt of them, and
ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you.</hi> Obſerve
how the Holy Ghoſt records it, the <hi>ſame day;</hi>
again, <hi>the firſt day of the week</hi> is twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that we no doubt ſhould take notice
how he approved of their aſſembling on that
day, and of his honouring this preciſe day by


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61730:120"/>
his appearing three times to one or another of
them upon it.</p>
               <p>And then after eight days, again his Diſciples
were together, and <hi>Thomas</hi> with them: then
came Jeſus, the doors being ſhut, and ſtood in the
midſt, and ſaid, Peace be unto you, <hi>Joh. 20. 26.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve, that here was one <hi>ſeventh</hi> day or
<hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> between the time of their firſt
aſſembling and his appearing to them, and the
<hi>ſecond aſſembling</hi> and his appearing. And I ſhall
prove anon, by an expreſs Text, that he did
not appear on any other day of the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
theſe two <hi>firſt days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>'Tis objected,</hi> It was not the next firſt
day, but after eight days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Tho this makes nothing for their
ſeventh day, yet would they have it to be on
the ſecond day of the week, rather than on the
firſt, having no mind to honour that Day Chriſt
hath honoured.</p>
               <p>2. But this pretended Objection is a meer
Figment or idle Dream. Their ſecond meeting,
ſaith Dr. <hi>Young,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag. 5. Cyril,</hi> l. 12. in <hi>Joh.</hi> p. 10, 26.</note> was the eighth day from the
firſt incluſive. <hi>Cyril</hi> affirms it was the <hi>eighth</hi> or
Lord's-day, the firſt and laſt being included.</p>
               <p>What tho it be ſaid after eight days? is it
not alſo ſaid that Chriſt <hi>after three days ſhould
riſe again?</hi> Mark 8. 31. yet our Lord roſe from
the dead <hi>on the third</hi> day of his Burial, not
after the third day.</p>
               <p>So alſo 'tis ſaid, <hi>Luke 2. 21. When eight days
were accompliſhed for the circumciſing of the Child,
i. e.</hi> on the <hi>eighth</hi> preciſe day; it was not on
the ninth, for the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of the
eighth day current, and not finiſhed. So here,
after eight days, or on the <hi>eighth</hi> day, is all
one.</p>
               <p>It might alſo be on the evening of the eighth


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61730:120"/>
day. But ſee what Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> ſaith to this,
who gives many Inſtances to the ſame purpoſe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſtian Sabb.</hi> p. 20, 21, 22.</note>
What we call (ſaith he) a <hi>third day Ague,</hi>
the <hi>Latins</hi> call a <hi>Quartan;</hi> and what we call
<hi>every other day,</hi> they call a <hi>tertian.</hi> Joh. 2. 19.
<hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will
raiſe it up again;</hi> that is, on the <hi>third</hi> day.
They tell <hi>Pilate, This Deceiver ſaid, After
three days I will riſe again</hi> (meaning thereby
the third day after incluſively) and therefore
they pray that the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> may be made ſure
till the third day, not longer.</p>
               <p>After eight days,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jewiſh Sabb.</hi> p. 170.</note> ſaith Mr. <hi>Warren,</hi> were
come, that is, on the <hi>eighth</hi> day, which reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Reſurrection-day incluſively, was juſt
that day <hi>ſevennight,</hi> or the next firſt day of
the week.</p>
               <p>Moreover, let it be conſidered, that this was
(as I hinted before) the ſecond ſolemn Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
of our bleſſed Saviour after he roſe from
the dead. For read <hi>Joh. 21. 14.</hi> when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
the next time to them, 'tis ſaid, <hi>This is
now the third time that Jeſus ſhewed himſelf to
his. Diſciples after he was riſen from the dead:</hi>
tho this was not on the firſt day (I mean the
<hi>third time</hi> he appeared to them) for they were
then a fiſhing. Yet note, that they neither
met together, nor did he ever appear to them
(as we read) on the ſeventh Day: no, he
was far from honouring the old Sabbath now
aboliſhed, after any ſuch manner.</p>
               <p>Nor do we read of any ſolemn aſſembling,
and of his Apparition to them but on the firſt
day only.</p>
               <p>And ought not this duly to be conſidered?
Has the Holy Ghoſt left this on record for no
purpoſe? Therefore note, that here are <hi>two
Precedents</hi> or <hi>Examples</hi> for our Imitation, to


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61730:121"/>
meet or aſſemble together on the firſt day of
the week.</p>
               <p>Were there but one ſuch Precedent that they
aſſembled together, and of our Lord's owning
them in it by his moſt gracious Preſence, and
by breathing on them, upon the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi>
(as I have ſaid) we ſhould not further contend
with our Brethren in this matter.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>third time</hi> of their general
aſſembling together, or all with one accord in
one place, was I have proved on the firſt day
of the week alſo, namely on the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Tho they did meet together on the firſt
day of the week, yet it was for fear of the Jews,
and ſo no Rule for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Evident it is that the Apoſtles and
Primitive Chriſtians did celebrate the firſt day;
and this was either by Divine Appointment, or
for ſome other Reaſons peculiar to themſelves.
If by Divine Appointment, then it is a Rule
and Warrant for us; but if for ſome Reaſons
peculiar to themſelves, then ſome can aſſign
thoſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The principal Reaſon alledged is, you hear,
for fear of being perſecuted, and therefore they
could not meet on the ſeventh day, and this
made them obſerve the firſt.</p>
               <p>2. Perſecution muſt not hinder us in our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God; what, diſown God, or his
Day of Worſhip, deſert his holy Sabbath? No,
had the Seventh-day Sabbath remained, they
could not have done thus without great Sin, tho
it coſt them their Lives.</p>
               <p>3. And can it be once imagin'd, had they by
ſlaviſh fear neglected to keep that Sabbath, and
changed the only time of meeting together to
another day, that our bleſſed Lord would have


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61730:121"/>
owned them in ſo doing, or vouchſafed his
moſt gracious Preſence to them? no certainly,
he would (had he appeared to them) rather
ſeverely have rebuked them for their great Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and not have ſaid, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Beſides, it would have been a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
method to avoid Perſecution not to meet
on the Jewiſh Sabbath, becauſe they knew how
ſuperſtitious the Jews were, and that they
would not attempt any ſuch thing on their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,
I mean to perſecute, impriſon, or
any way moleſt them, had they met on that
day. And,</p>
               <p>5. Of all days of the week they might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expect to be diſturbed, perſecuted, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
had they met together on the firſt
day, eſpecially on that very firſt-day our Lord
roſe from the dead; becauſe the Guard of
Soldiers were commanded to be together till
that day, and beſure would not ſoon, or juſt
on the morning of the third day be diſcharged.
Beſides, their not finding the <hi>dead Body</hi> might
inrage the Soldiers againſt the Diſciples, ſhould
they have been together on that day.</p>
               <p>6. We will grant the <hi>privacy</hi> of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſhutting the doors might be indeed
for fear of the Jews: but yet meet they would,
and did; and certainly they were led ſo to
do by the Holy Ghoſt, in that Chriſt appeared
in the midſt of them on both thoſe days, when
they were ſo aſſembled.</p>
               <p>Before I cloſe with this, I cannot omit what
a Reverend Author hath ſaid about the day of
our Lord's Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>It was, ſaith he, a remarkable day in many
reſpects.</p>
               <p>1. It was the eighth <hi>day</hi> in a continued
reckoning of days, which was a number of


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61730:122"/>
greater Perfection than ſeven in ſome reſpects,
witneſs Circumciſion—The <hi>Antients</hi> inſiſt
much that this Circumciſion on the eighth day
was a Type of that eighth day on which our
Lord roſe again from the dead. Thus <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">The <hi>firſt day of the week</hi> a day of great Renown many ways.</note> the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week is a day
of greateſt Renown, being <hi>firſt</hi> in order <hi>of
Creation,</hi> and the <hi>firſt in dignity</hi> by our Lord's
Reſurrection; the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> and the
<hi>firſt of days,</hi> and the only day in which our
Lord became the <hi>firſt fruits of them that ſlept,</hi>
and the <hi>firſt-born from the dead,</hi> that in all
<hi>things he might have the preheminence:</hi> And,
ſay I, the firſt day of the <hi>new World</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi>
of the <hi>Meſſia,</hi> or Goſpel-Diſpenſation.—Again,
we have,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> p. 169.</note> ſaith he, another conſpicuous Mark to
note this day by, above all other days in the
week.</p>
               <p>1. That theſe glorious Apparitions of our
now glorious Redeemer were no common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
but choice and ſpecial Evidences of his
owning Providence, both as to Perſons and
Times—for as he appeared not to all ſorts of
Perſons, but to ſome ſelect choſen Witneſſes,
who were either eminently devoted to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or deſign'd to teach others—ſo neither
did he appear to thoſe Perſons every day, but
principally and moſt uſually upon the day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by the Prophets to his Worſhip and
Service, and now conſecrated by his bleſſed
Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>2. Altho it be ſaid that he was ſeen of his
Apoſtles forty days between his Reſurrection
and Aſcenſion, yet was he not ſeen every day
during thoſe forty—that is, by the ſpace of
forty days at times, for ſome times he diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.</p>
               <p>3. However it may be ſuppoſed that our


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61730:122"/>
Saviour did appear on other days (as once
upon a working day) yet no other day of the
Week has he honoured to be denominated as
the day of his appearing, but the <hi>firſt day of
the Week</hi> only.</p>
               <p>Not on the <hi>ſecond, third, fourth,</hi> much leſs
the laſt of the Week, the <hi>ſeventh day:</hi> But
the firſt is expreſly and <hi>emphatically</hi> noted by
name, the <hi>ſame day,</hi> the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the Week
Jeſus came and ſtood <hi>in the midſt of them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. 'Tis evident that our Lord appeared often
on this day, gracing it with his Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
In the morning to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and
the reſt of the Holy Women; in the evening
of the ſame day to the eleven Diſciples, when
gathered together in the nature of a Church-Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>After <hi>eight days,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> p. 175.</note> or after day-light of the
<hi>eighth day</hi> was paſt, he appeared again. Chriſt
appeared in the morning of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-day,
as well as at the evening; very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as well as very late; to teach us that that
whole day is his: 'Tis <hi>that day which the Lord
hath made;</hi> not a piece of the day. Thus
(ſaith he) I remember Dr. <hi>Hakewell</hi> long ago
ſtopt the mouth of this <hi>Objector</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Tillam.</note>, Joh. 20. 19.
<hi>The ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of
the Week.</hi> He calls it the firſt day of the
Week, tho the evening; to put the matter out
of doubt, that this evening was part of the firſt
day of the Week—Thus the Holy Ghoſt
provides againſt future Errors.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> p. 178.</note>
               </p>
               <p>By Chriſt's ſecond appearance that day <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-night</hi>
they might be better inſtructed, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
their aſſembling on that day, <hi>Act. 2. 1.</hi> and
<hi>Acts 2o.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this, why our Lord ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61730:123"/>
the Jews Sabbath, and afford his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preſence in Chriſtian Aſſemblies on the
Firſt-day of the Week, thus often, and thus
eminently, but to eſtabliſh this day for Sacred
Aſſemblies, and to teach us on what day eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
we may expect his Preſence and Bleſſing,
I confeſs I am to ſeek.</p>
               <p>4. We may take notice of the gracious Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Actions, and Tranſactions of Chriſt at
his ſeveral appearings, tending partly to prove
his Reſurrection, the Ground of our Hope,
and the Hinge of the Day. To this purpoſe,
how did he condeſcend to his poor doubting
ſtaggering Diſciples, manifeſting himſelf on
this day to all their Senſes—diſtinguiſhing it
from all other days by Sabbath-exerciſes?</p>
               <p>1. By his Heavenly Inſtructions opening the
Scriptures,<note place="margin">Luke 24. 46.</note> and preaching Peace to his Diſciples,
and to us as well as them;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Having ſlain the
Enmity by his Croſs, he came and preached Peace.</hi>
On this day he came with his <hi>Olive-branch</hi> in his
mouth, ſaying, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. By giving forth Commiſſions to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Proving the Firſt-day of the Week to be the

to prove the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> of the Week to
be the day which Chriſt hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Becauſe the Churches and Diſciples
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt met together upon
this day to break Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Acts 20. 7. <hi>And
upon the Firſt-day of the Week, when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
came together to break Bread.</hi> This was the
day, it appears, on which they met together,
not only for preaching, hearing, praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but alſo to celebrate the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>1. Obſerve, 'tis ſaid in the Context, that
<hi>Paul</hi> ſtayed at <hi>Troas ſeven days.</hi> And by the
way note, that he was there upon one of the
Jews Sabbath-days, but then the Church met
not together; and it is evident alſo that <hi>Paul</hi>
waited till the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> came, that he might
not only preach to them when they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
aſſembled together, but alſo celebrate the
Lord's Supper before he departed.</p>
               <p>Now that this was the Firſt-day of the

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely (ſaith the Doctor) he is not

it was <hi>one day of the week,</hi> we need not be told

                  </gap> doth any where ſignify

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The Latin word <hi>pridie</hi> is a <hi>derivative</hi> (or

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it is objected that it was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional

               <p>2. 'Tis ſaid, they <hi>came together to break

               <p>4. We know the celebration of the Lord's-Supper
is call'd <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> Acts 2.
nor is there reaſon to conceive it was any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>That it was no feſtival Day, <hi>not the firſt day</hi>
of <hi>unleavened Bread,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> has proved.
But there is reaſon,<note place="margin">Hughes <hi>on the Sab.</hi> p. 160, 162.</note> ſaith he, to believe this was
ſacramental Bread; for the Church came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to break this Bread (ſo they were never
ſaid to do in breaking any other kind of Bread)
and <hi>Paul</hi> brake that which was properly Bread
among them; but for breaking of Bread to the

came together on the firſt day, which ſhews it
was their uſual Practice ſo to do.</p>
               <p>2. They might break Bread firſt, and did no
doubt; and then <hi>Paul</hi> might renew his Speech,

of words in a <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Relation are not

               <p>3. <hi>They did break Bread;</hi> and if it was after

                  </gap> other Text before mentioned,
that the firſt day of the week the Goſpel-Churches
did obſerve as the ſpecial day of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Worſhip; and that it was the firſt day of
the week, the generality of the Antients both
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> it is evident, do agree.</p>
               <p>Moreover, here are many things worthy of
our Conſideration.</p>
               <p>(1.) That this meeting was for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
as preaching, breaking of Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) That the Holy Ghoſt on purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
the preciſe day; <hi>Paul</hi> having waited at
<hi>Troas</hi> the ſix former days, till this day, the firſt
day of the week, came: tho no doubt they
might have ſome other private occaſional meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
on other days before, for <hi>Paul</hi> beſure was
not idle.</p>
               <p>(3.) That their coming generally then toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was not <hi>new,</hi> nor <hi>occaſional,</hi> but their
<hi>common practice,</hi> or <hi>uſual day of aſſembling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
to preach and adminiſter the <hi>Lord's-Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(4.) It is clear, that by a ſpecial applying
of theſe Exerciſes to that Day, and by men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
that Day to this end, it was their moſt
ſolemn Day in ſeaſon to meet upon, and that
the old Sabbath was not, but was aboliſhed
with the Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>(5.) Nor is it likely that <hi>Paul</hi> would have
ſtay'd there, who was ready to depart, had not
that day been the day of ſolemn Worſhip,
when perhaps many in the adjacent places came


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61730:129"/>
together. Nor would they have ſlipt over the
ſeventh Day, without any notice taken of that;
for it neceſſarily ſhews they had no regard to
the old Sabbath: which the Diſciples would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
never have done, if there had been ſo great
a Sanction for that day as for the <hi>firſt</hi> day of
the week.</p>
               <p>(6.) As Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> notes,<note place="margin">On the Sab. <hi>p. 390.</hi>
                  </note> the Diſciples came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
without an extraordinary warning, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſent to, or call'd together in anſwer to their
Duty; which they were accuſtomed ſo to do.
Such, ſaith he, is the account that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>
gives of the Practice of all Churches in the next
Age, <hi>i. e. on the day called Sunday there is an
Aſſembly of all Chriſtians, whether living in the
City or Country;</hi> and becauſe of their conſtant
breaking of Bread on that day, it was called
<hi>Dies Panis. Auguſt. Epiſt. 118.</hi> And <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
proved that he brake not a Chalice at ſuch
a time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrat.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 22.</note> becauſe it was not the firſt day of the
week when it was uſed.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever reads this Paſſage without
prejudice, will grant, that it is a marvellous,
adrupt and uncouth Expreſſion, if it do not
ſignify that it was the common obſervance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Diſciples of Chriſt, which could
have no other Foundation, but that only laid
down before, of the Authority of the Lord
Chriſt requiring it of them.</p>
               <p>And, ſaith he, I doubt not but <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd
his farewel Sermon (after all the ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church was perform'd) which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till midnight. And all the Objections I
have met with againſt this Inſtance, amounts to
no more than this, <hi>i. e. that the Scripture ſays
that the Diſciples met together to break Bread,
yet indeed they did not ſo.</hi> And this, by what
the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays, vaniſhes into Smoak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:61730:129"/>
1. From the whole I may argue: If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Primitive Chriſtians did obſerve the
firſt day of the week as their prime and chief
time for ſolemn Worſhip in ſeaſon, and paſſed
over the old ſeventh Day; then is the firſt day
of the week, and not the ſeventh, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Day Chriſt has appointed to be obſerv'd in
his ſolemn Worſhip under the Goſpel. But
this was the prime and chief time for ſolemn
Worſhip in ſeaſon, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And if thoſe meetings on the <hi>firſt day</hi>
were not ſuch as uſed to be formerly on the
<hi>ſeventh</hi> day, I deſire to know a reaſon, 1. Why
their Meetings on the <hi>firſt day</hi> ſhould be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
recorded, rather than their Meetings
on the ſeventh. 2. And why alſo the one is
ſo oft mentioned, <hi>i. e.</hi> their Meetings on the
<hi>firſt day,</hi> and no mention at all that they met
on the <hi>ſeventh day</hi> in the New Teſtament, from
the Reſurrection of Chriſt, as a Church-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to worſhip God, or diſcharge any part of
Religious Duties; nor of their meeting on the
<hi>ſecond, third, fourth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it ſeems as if they came not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
till the evening of this day, tho it was the
firſt day of the week; and ſo it proves not that
this whole day ought to be kept in ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For this there is not the leaſt ſhadow
of Proof. What tho <hi>Paul</hi> continued his Speech
till midnight; might not ſome other Miniſters
ſpend the former part of the day in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Exhortation, or in Prayer? Or, might not
<hi>Paul</hi> (as ſome of us do) preach twice himſelf
on that day, and they refreſh themſelves about
the middle of the day? I find one Author ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Durham</hi> on the Ten Command. <hi>p. 264.</hi>
                  </note> Paul <hi>ſpending this whole day in that
Service, and continuing his Sermon till midnight


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61730:130"/>
(yet accounting it ſtill one day) in ſolemn meeting,
doth confirm this Day to be more than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, or than other days of the week, as being
ſpecially dedicated to theſe Services and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
and totally ſpent in them.</hi> It is ſaid, that
<hi>they came together</hi> on the <hi>firſt day of the week;</hi>
and no doubt but it was in the morning of that
day, for ſo we find they did on the ſame day
of the week, <hi>Acts 2. 1, 2.</hi> for when <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to preach, it was but the <hi>third hour,</hi> which
is our <hi>nine of the Clock</hi> in the morning.</p>

                  </note> My ſixth Argument to prove that
the firſt day of the week ought to be obſerved
as a day of Reſt and ſolemn Worſhip under
the Goſpel, ſhall be taken from that Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given to this day, <hi>Rev. 1. 10.</hi> where it is

adds no ſmall honour to this illuſtrious
Day: as it was the firſt day of Time men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the beginning of the firſt Book of the
Bible; ſo it is the laſt day of Fame noted in
the beginning of the laſt Book of the Bible, to

<q>

                     <l>Whoſe lofty Name from Lord of Lords is drawn:</l>
                     <l>A bleſſed Day, that firſt was grac'd to ſee</l>
                     <l>Chriſt's riſing, and the World's Nativity.</l>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:61730:130"/>
I ſhall endeavour to prove that after Chriſt's
Reſurrection and Aſcenſion there was a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Day belonging to the Lord above any other
day of the week; and that this Day was not
the old Jewiſh Sabbath-day, but the firſt day
of the week.</p>
               <p>1. That there was a peculiar Day, or one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Day of the week obſerved to the Lord, in
which the Churches aſſembled together for the
Worſhip of God, none will deny: God lays
claim to one day in ſeven as his Day.</p>
               <p>2. And now that this was not the <hi>ſeventh
day</hi> of the week appears, becauſe we no where
read that any one Goſpel-Church ever aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together on that day from the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt. Now if that had been the Day
the Lord Chriſt had appointed as <hi>Mediator</hi> and
<hi>Lawgiver,</hi> beſure we ſhould have had it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in ſome place, as the very day in which
the Churches, or at leaſt ſome one Church did
meet together: but this we do not find, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that is not, cannot be the day.</p>
               <p>3. We read of their meeting together no
leſs than four or five times, from our Lord's
Reſurrection and after his Aſcenſion, on the
firſt day of the week, <hi>Joh. 20. 19.</hi> and <hi>ver. 26.
Acts 2. 1, 2. ch. 20. 7.</hi> to which I might add
<hi>1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. No doubt the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> when he ſays
<hi>on the Lord's-day,</hi> refers to a certain particular
Day well known to all the Churches to whom
he was to write, nay known to all Believers
and Saints of that time.</p>
               <p>5. And evident it is, that the Jewiſh Sabbath-day
is no where, either in the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 58. 3.</note> called the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> tho it is called
the <hi>Lord's Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God. Lord</hi> in the Old Teſtament (as


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61730:131"/>
one obſerves) is the uſual name of God <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Walls,</hi> p. 46.</note> without particularizing this or that of

Perſon, more than to the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>third.</hi> And
tho the ſecond Perſon, or Chriſt conſidered as
God, made the World, and gave the Ten
Commandments, as well as he gave forth all
the Ceremonial Law, the three Perſons being
the ſame one God; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> is contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,

our Lord Chriſt, as <hi>1 Cor. 8. 6. But to us there

the fourth Commandment, that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Sabbath of the Lord thy God</hi> (ſpeaking

not of one Perſon contradiſtinguiſhed to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Work of Creation is commonly aſcribed
to God the Father, and ſo the old Seventh-day
Sabbath is properly the Father's Day, not
Chriſt's, tho all the three Perſons created the
World.</p>
               <p>6. This day is called the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> in a

reſpect of God the Creator, not of Chriſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
and therefore may be meant the Seventh-day
Sabbath: Beſides, the World was made by


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61730:131"/>
Chriſt, and he gave the Law on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I further tell them, this Name or Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
[Chriſt] refers to our Lord as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or as he is <hi>God and Man:</hi> But the <hi>ſecond
Perſon</hi> was not God and Man when the World
was made, or when the Law was given on
<hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> Tho the ſecond Perſon, or Chriſt
as God, created the World, and with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Holy Ghoſt is that one God that gave
the Law; yet Chriſt the <hi>Anointed,</hi> or as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
God in our Nature, actually exiſted
not till the fulneſs of time was come.</p>
               <p>(2.) And why may not they call the <hi>Lord's
Supper,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Table</hi> ſo, with reſpect to
God the Creator, or Chriſt as Creator?</p>
               <p>(3.) Conſider that in the New Teſtament Chriſt
as Mediator is actually exalted to be Lord of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; of all Perſons, Men and Angels, and of
all things: <hi>For to this end Chriſt both died, and
roſe again and revived, that he might be Lord
both of the dead and living,</hi> Rom. 14. 9.</p>
               <p>(4.) So that as the term <hi>Lord</hi> is peculiarly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is the day here called <hi>his Day.</hi> And as
the Supper is called <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> becauſe
he inſtituted it, and it wholly refers to Chriſt;
ſo the firſt day is called <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> becauſe
the Lord Chriſt inſtituted or appointed it as
the ſpecial Day of his Worſhip, and as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to his glorious Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If the Scriptures be the Rule to judg
whether that day be not the Lord's Day, which
(and which only as diſtinguiſhed from other days

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Chriſt is Lord of all days no doubt,
becauſe he is Lord of all things; but the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
Sabbath</hi> is no where appropriated to

Chriſt as Mediator, nor ever called the <hi>Lord's
Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) When 'tis ſaid in the New Teſtament,
that <hi>the Son of Man is Lord</hi> alſo, or <hi>even of the
Sabbath-day;</hi> he ſhews that it was in his power
to diſpoſe of it, for he gives this as a reaſon for
his doing that which the Phariſees counted Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking,
and by which he oftentimes
offended them. And ſo it is far from being a
reaſon of his eſtabliſhing it to abide a Sabbath
in his Kingdom-ſtate. And, as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
it ſeems plainly to mean, that that being
a poſitive Law belonging to <hi>Moſes,</hi> our Lord
had power to change it, or diſpenſe with it, as
well as other Poſitive and Moſaical Laws. As
it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath made him Head over all things

Lord over all Days, but all are not ſeparated to
his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>As it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt given him Power over

the other was the Father's Day; there being a
day remaining to him, and to us thro him,
from the ſame foot of account in the times of
the Goſpel, as we have proved.</p>
               <p>9. That 'tis this day which is called the <hi>Lord's

after his Reſurrection, and becauſe after his
Aſcenſion he crown'd it with that miraculous
effuſion of the Holy Spirit, to put a Glory upon
it, and to confirm it as that day appointed for
his People to wait upon him in.</p>

the Day of the laſt Judgment: I ſaw the dead,

the day of our Lord's Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>(2.) There is a great difference between
theſe two Phraſes, <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> and <hi>the

And, as one obſerves, it is void of all judgment
to take it for the Day of Judgment: for in the
readieſt conſtruction of the words, St. <hi>John</hi>
ſpoke of a Day that was in being before he had
the Viſion, and a Day well-known to the
Churches at that time. But was the Day of

(4.) What influence had <hi>John</hi> upon him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
this Name?</p>
               <p>He gives excellent Anſwers to all theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys:
I ſhall cite but a part of them.</p>
               <p>(1.) No indefinite or undetermined time is
meant by this day, as ſome would have it; but
'tis a diſtinct and determined day, owned by
the Lord: the word is plain, the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi>
noting one ſingle day.</p>
               <p>(2.) Neither can it refer to the Seventh-day:
'tis as irrational to ſay this <hi>Lord's Day</hi> is the
<hi>old</hi> Sabbath, as to affirm the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>
means the <hi>Paſſover.</hi>—This <hi>Lord's Day</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
after his coming in the Fleſh, but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
long before. As he was revealed
newly in the Goſpel, to be <hi>the one Lord Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>Mediator;</hi> ſo a <hi>new day</hi> of his was
revealed alſo, which the Church never knew
before, <hi>viz.</hi> his Reſurrection, which was noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
known to be the Lord's Day.</p>
               <p>(3.) He proves it can't be attributed to the
day of his Nativity.</p>
               <p>(4.) That this Title, the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> was not
impoſed upon any extraordinary time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the great Revelation given out to <hi>John</hi>
therein.</p>
               <p>(1.) He was in the Spirit on the Lord's
Day, before he received thoſe Revelations,
therefore they could not be the ground of this
Appellation—To pretend to <hi>Prolepſis</hi> here, is
a miſerable ſhift.</p>
               <p>(2.) He writes to the <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
and informs them of the Time known to them
when he had theſe Revelations, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>weekly
Lord's Day</hi>—It is the Day which he himſelf
made to declare himſelf to be the Son of God,
the <hi>chief Corner-ſtone,</hi> the Foundation of the
Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:61730:135"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He anſwers the ſecond Queſtion,
viz. <hi>That this Title imports a new Day of Reſt
to be his,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 140.</note> for four Reaſons: One is this; The
word uſed here denoting the Lord's Day, is
but once to be found in the New Teſtament,
where we read of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and all
grant it ſignifieth an Ordinance where-ever the
word is uſed; and therefore ſo here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Lord Jeſus himſelf put
his Name upon this Day.</p>
               <p>(1.) The giving or beſtowing of God's Name
on any time, thing, or perſon, is reciprocal
with himſelf; therefore none but the <hi>Lord</hi> could
put his Name upon this day: Who hath the
diſpoſing of the Lord's Name but himſelf?—
Will you ſay the Apoſtles, or the Church
might do it? What, without the Lord's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
or Command? They would not, they
durſt not; God never intruſted any of them to
beſtow his Glory, or call his Name upon any
thing, but only declaratively from himſelf.</p>
               <p>(2.) All Power in Heaven and Earth was
given to the Lord Chriſt, to ſettle his Church,
and to appoint Ordinances, and to change
Times according to the Father's Pleaſure:
therefore he only authoritatively could change
the Sabbath, and put his Name upon this
Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To the fourth Query he ſaith, The
Influence of Power which the <hi>beloved John</hi> had
in naming this Day, is only miniſteral or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;
the Lord Jeſus giveth it, and he wrote
it. This is the higheſt of their claim, who are
Miniſters, by whom Souls are brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Goſpel: And no more was he but a
faithful Meſſenger to declare that to be the
<hi>Lord's Day,</hi> upon which the Lord himſelf had
fixed his Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:61730:136"/>
And thus enough hath been ſaid to prove
that this day, called the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> was the <hi>firſt
day</hi> of the week: but to put it further out of
doubt, in the laſt place,</p>
               <p>12. The Antient Fathers, whoſe Credit and
Authority I ſee no cauſe to doubt, have poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared that it was the firſt day of the
week that <hi>John</hi> called the Lord's-day.</p>

Chriſt our Life roſe again. It is manifeſt
therefore, ſaith he, that within eight or ten
years after <hi>John</hi>'s writing, the Lord's-day
did not ſignify the Jewiſh Sabbath, but the
firſt day of the week, on which our Saviour
roſe again.</q>—Why ſhould any longer doubt

               <argument>
                  <p>Proving there is one day of the week in ſeaſon
to preach the Word, and that it is the firſt
Day. That Collections by Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

That God hath inflicted dreadful Judgments

when the Lord's-day begins, and how it
ought to be obſerved.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>

                  </note> Another Argument for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the firſt Day, ſhall be taken from
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Charge to <hi>Timothy: Preach the
Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>2 Tim. 4. 2.</hi> From whence I note, there is one
day above all others in the week, <hi>as the day in
ſeaſon</hi> when the Word is to be preached.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In ſeaſon,</hi> implies a fit time for doing a
Work; and ſo here a particular day Chriſt
hath appointed for his Worſhip, Prayer, <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and Adminiſtration of all other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>

2. But if there was not one <hi>preciſe day</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Chriſt to the end, and all days
were alike under the Goſpel; then on all days
the Word would either be <hi>in ſeaſon,</hi> or <hi>out of
ſeaſon:</hi> but ſince there is a time in ſeaſon, and
times out of ſeaſon, I argue, there is one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Day appointed for thoſe great things to be
done upon.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>to every thing there is a ſeaſon,
and a time to every Purpoſe under Heaven;</hi> i. e.
a certain ſet time appointed by God to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
with the greateſt diligence to the end
for which it is ordained. And hath God ſet a
time to every thing, and for every Purpoſe and
Work; and yet ſet no particular time for his
Worſhip? This cannot be, for we have proved
one day <hi>in ſeven</hi> he claims from the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi>
and in Goſpel-times it muſt be the firſt
Day of the week, (1.) Becauſe the old Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is gone. (2.) Becauſe on this day Chriſt
<hi>reſted from all his Works, as God did from his.</hi>
(3.) Becauſe this Day he owned and confirmed
by the miraculous effuſion of his Spirit. (4.)
Becauſe on this Day his Diſciples met together,
and he approved it by his gracious appearance,
and preaching Peace to them. (5.) Becauſe 'tis
called the <hi>Lord's-day.</hi> (6.) Becauſe no Church
met in a ſpecial manner on any other day, in
the New Teſtament. So that this Day is the
day in <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> or there is none at all; but that
can't be, becauſe there is a ſpecial ſeaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to every thing and purpoſe under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>4. This Day is the day in <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> becauſe it
ſutes with the ſtate of Goſpel-Believers; we
firſt entering into Reſt through Jeſus Chriſt,
who has done for us all we had to do, and born
all thoſe Burdens we were to bear in order to


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61730:139"/>
our entering into Reſt: therefore it can't ſute
with us to keep the old Sabbath, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
the Creature <hi>to do and live, i.e.</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
to do all that God commanded, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
even to the whole Law, if ever they would
have Reſt and Peace. So that the Jews Day
ſhewed they were to work for Life according
to the tenor of the <hi>firſt Covenant;</hi> but our
<hi>Day</hi> ſhews we work from Life, and we have
Reſt, Life, and Peace firſt, or are juſtified, and
ſo obey; and this from better, more Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles. So that in Compariſon of this
day, this ſpecial ſeaſon, all other days of the
week are out of ſeaſon for Goſpel-work and
Service.</p>
               <p>Eightly <hi>The firſt day of the week is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Chriſt under the Goſpel to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Collections for the poor Saints to be made upon the firſt day of the week.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe all the Goſpel-Churches were
required this day to make Collections for the
poor Saints;</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. As I have given
order to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> even ſo do ye:
upon the firſt Day of the week let every one lay
by him as God hath proſpered him, that there be
no Gatherings when I come.</p>
               <p>1. Obſerve what was the Practice of one
Church as a Church, was the Practice of every
Church. Beſides, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the ſame
thing he had given Orders about in the Churches
of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and ſo no doubt in all Churches.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> in cauſing the Churches to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in this matter, received this Authority
from Chriſt, as he intimates plainly enough in
<hi>1 Cor. 14. 37. If any Man think himſelf to be
a Prophet, or ſpiritual, let him acknowledg that
the things I wrote unto you are the Commandments
of the Lord.</hi> And elſewhere he ſhews that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſame Authority he durſt not make the
Gentiles obedient either by word or deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:61730:139"/>
3. Here is a Duty injoyn'd then by Chriſt's
Authority on all the Churches, and not by
<hi>Paul</hi> any other ways than miniſterially; which
is upon every firſt Day to make Collections for
the poor Saints: they muſt depoſite their Alms
all on the ſame day, which could not be done
unleſs the Churches did aſſemble upon that
day; and beſure it was injoyned on that
day, becauſe they then did meet together for
ſolemn Worſhip, and becauſe ſuch Acts of
Mercy ſuted Sabbath-Duties, and were well-pleaſing
to God.</p>
               <p>4. Beſides, no Man can aſſingn a reaſon why
the Churches ſhould be required on every <hi>firſt
Day</hi> to <hi>make</hi> Collections for the Poor, if it
were not the uſual Day in which they aſſembled
themſelves together.</p>
               <p>

               <p>A wiſe <hi>Objection,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Wallis;</hi> as tho all
this could not be done before (ſo far as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
and they on <hi>Sunday</hi> put ſo much into the

               <p>2. According to this childiſh Objection, they
were but bid, as it were, to take ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as they purpoſed to give out of one <hi>Pocket</hi>
on that day, and put it by it ſelf into another.
But I will appeal to them whether this would
have prevented any gatherings when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
came to them; and no doubt <hi>Paul</hi> here put
them in mind of ſome extraordinary Occaſion,
that they might have more Money collected
and put together againſt he came than uſually
on that Day they might collect: yet it is clear
it was all the Churches practice, by the direction
of the Holy Ghoſt, on every Firſt-day when
the Churches met together for ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to gather Money for their poor Brethren
and Siſters.</p>
               <p>3. <q>The conſtant day of the Churches ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

Paul</hi> here takes it for granted, and directs
them to the obſervance of a ſpecial Duty on
that day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:61730:140"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here is no mention made of any
meeting that was, or was to be at this Seaſon, or
the leaſt preſcription binding the Conſcience to the
weekly obſervation of the Firſt-day, for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
by divine Appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As the Doctor ſaith, this and other
Churches were before fixed on the conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of the Firſt-day of the Week for the
ſolemn Worſhip of God; and his directing
them upon this Day to make Collections for
the Poor, even <hi>every Firſt-day,</hi> &amp;c. doth fully
ſhew that it was the preciſe Day of Church-Aſſemblies,
and that among all the Churches.
'Tis enough that on this day the Churches
met, not to preach only and make gatherings
for the Poor,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 7.</note> but to adminiſter the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi>
and we read of none that met as a Church
to do any of theſe things on the <hi>Seventh-day.</hi>
Beſides, it is called the <hi>Lord's Day;</hi> our Lord
Chriſt allows us all the other days to work in,
but this is his Day, wholly to be ſequeſtered to
his Service, and therefore of divine Inſtitution:
Had it been ſaid, <hi>on every Seventh-day let every
one lay by him,</hi> &amp;c. our Opponents would have
urg'd it as a great proof for their Sabbath.</p>

                        <hi>Owen,</hi> p. 391, 392.</note> ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> that
here is no mention of any Church-Aſſembly,
but only that every one on that day ſhould
lay by him what he would give, which every
one might do at home, or where they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is exceeding weak, and unſutable to the
mind of the Apoſtle. For to what end ſhould
they be limited to a day, and that the <hi>firſt
of the Week,</hi> for doing of that which might
as well, and to as good purpoſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
be performed at any other time, or on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other day of the Week whatever? Beſides,
it was ſuch a laying aſide, ſuch a treaſuring of


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61730:141"/>
it in a common Stock, as that there ſhould be
no need of any Collection when the Apoſtle
came.</q>—</p>
               <p>And now if this Practice and Example of
the Primitive Churches be no Rule to us, or
bind us not, certainly nothing they did or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
as Churches, can oblige us: Nay, if ſo,
worſe will follow alſo for if their Example in
obſerving the Firſt-day be no warrant for us,
nor it is not our duty from any thing that has
been ſaid, to obſerve the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> it will
follow that we in Goſpel-times are not obliged
to keep any ſpecial weekly day at all; ſeeing
we are by no Precept nor Precedent obliged to
keep the Jewiſh Sabbath. So that theſe men
from hence appear the chiefeſt Enemies to any
Goſpel-Sabbath, <hi>or day of Reſt</hi> and <hi>ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
in the World.</p>
               <p>Note alſo,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Wallis.</note> that this day was not obſerved, or
to be obſerved once only, but as a thing in courſe,
and ſo preſumed by the Apoſtle when he gave
particular Directions concerning a Collection
for the poor Saints to be made weekly on that
day: And in like manner in the Churches of
<hi>Galatia,</hi> with like direction to them. And we
have reaſon to believe, that it was obſerved in
all other Churches alſo: for <hi>Paul</hi> in another
caſe ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>as he ordained in all Churches of the
Saints:</hi> they all walked by one and the ſame
Rule, and obſerved beſure one and the ſame
day, and diſcharged the ſame Duties upon that
day.</p>
               <p>The Firſt-day of the Week therefore being
that on which Chriſt roſe from the Dead, and
upon which the Churches met together in <hi>one
place</hi> to break Bread,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 1, 2. &amp; 20. 7.</note> and which is called the
<hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and on which they were injoined
to make Collections for the poor Saints, beſure


<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61730:141"/>
is that day which our Lord commanded them
to obſerve, while he was with them forty days,
<hi>giving Commandments to his Apoſtles about things
pertaining unto the Kingdom of God,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Affairs of the Chriſtian Church. And
no doubt the obſervance of the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> was
one thing he commanded, becauſe on that day
they afterwards met together, and were moſt
eminently owned in ſo doing, <hi>Acts 2. 1, 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what ſignifies their Objection, <hi>There is
no expreſs Command to obſerve this Day?</hi> As
if it muſt be expreſſed, as one obſerves, <hi>be it
enacted.</hi> My Brethren, an approved practice
in God's Worſhip, frequently <hi>repeated,</hi> atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Miracles, incouraged by Chriſt's own
Example, with that of the Apoſtles and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Churches, and continued ever ſince, is
evidence ſufficient that it is the Will of God
that this Day ought to be obſerved: and ſuch
as cannot ſee it, muſt remain blind.</p>
               <p>As to ſuch as ſtill queſtion whether this was
the Firſt-day of the Week, let me note one
thing more. <hi>Beza</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">One or two Learned Men men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this.</note> had an antient Manuſcript
where it is called the <hi>Lord's Day: Let every
one on the Lord's Day lay by him,</hi> &amp;c. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
was ſaid to that before; it was the <hi>Firſt-day</hi>
of the Week, and therefore the <hi>Lord's day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this day had not been more holy, or
more fit for this Work of Love than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">Shepherd <hi>on the Sab.</hi> p. 219.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> durſt not have limited them to this
Day, nor have honoured this Day above any
other, yea above the Jewiſh Seventh-day.
Moreover, ſaith Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> the Apoſtle
doth not in this place immediately appoint and
inſtitute the Sabbath, but ſuppoſeth it to be ſo
already (as Mr. <hi>Primroſe</hi> is forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg)
and we know Dutys of Mercy and
Charity, as well as of neceſſary Piety, are


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61730:142"/>
Sabbath-dutys: for which end this Day was
more fit for thoſe Collections than any other
day, being then generally together, and their
Hearts warmed under the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There muſt, ſaith another<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>, be ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
thing in this Day, making it fit, yea more
fit for ſuch a purpoſe as doing Works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
on it, rather than on any other: And the
Apoſtle commanding this in all the Churches,
doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe a Reaſon why he
doth it, as drawn from ſome fitneſs of this Day
above another.</p>
               <p>Now if we will, ſaith he, enquire, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can be given but that the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was expired, and the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> inſtituted
in its place, for otherwiſe any day was alike;
yea, the 7th day being the laſt of the Week,
and whereon men uſually reckon their week's
ſucceſs, it would ſeem more reaſonable that at
the cloſe of the Week they ſhould lay up by
them as God had bleſſed them, than reſerve it
to the beginning of another Week. The fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
then flows from this, that the Firſt-day
being the day of their ſolemn communion with
God and one another, and of their partaking
moſt <hi>liberally</hi> of Spiritual Bleſſings from him,
therefore they ſhould be moſt warm'd in their
Affections, and moſt liberal in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to ſuch as wanted, eſpecially conſidering
the Jews were to partake of this their Charity,
whoſe Debtors the Gentiles were, according to
that in <hi>Rom. 15. 26, 27.</hi>

               <p>I remember you tell us, <hi>Enqu. p. 117, 118.</hi>
and you mind me of it, <hi>p. 40, 75.</hi> that I ſay
nothing to it (being it ſeems a thing on which
you lay great weight) <hi>i. e.</hi> that in the Records
of Parliament, and the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
Saturday is called <hi>Sabbati,</hi> or <hi>Dies Sabbati.</hi>
True (as ſuppoſing by Tradition this day of
our week to be what the Jews called the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
in their week) but do you not know alſo
in the ſame Records <hi>Sunday</hi> is called <hi>Dies Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicus,</hi>
the <hi>Lord's-day?</hi> And if thoſe prove
Saturday to be the Jewiſh Sabbath, why ſhould
not theſe as well prove <hi>Sunday</hi> to be the <hi>Lord's-day?</hi>
All the difference is, as to that you were
quick-ſighted, but blind as to this. You may
obſerve alſo that the one is <hi>Sabbati,</hi> or <hi>Dies
Sabbati</hi> (in the Genitive caſe, in the ſame form
with <hi>Dies Saturni,</hi> and as the other days are)
but the Lord's-day is <hi>Die Dominico</hi> in the Abla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
meaning (I ſuppoſe) that Saturday is the
day which had been the Jewiſh Sabbath, but
this the day which is the <hi>Lord's-day.</hi> Which
different Conſtruction ſeems plainly to intend
in our Law a different import of the words:
by <hi>Dies Saturni,</hi> or <hi>Dies Lunae,</hi> we do not mean
a Day inſtituted by <hi>Saturn</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> as by
<hi>Dies Dominica</hi> we do mean the Day inſtituted
by our Lord; like as by <hi>Coena Dominica</hi> we
mean the Supper inſtituted by our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So
that theſe Records do you no Service at all, but

               <p>I ſhall here, before I cloſe, add a few Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſtical
Arguments for our Opponents to
anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 1.</hi> If the holy Spirit doth write the
whole Moral Law of God in the Hearts of all


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61730:144"/>
true Believers, but doth not write the Law of
the Seventh-day Sabbath in their Hearts; then
the Seventh-day Sabbath is no Moral Precept:
but the former is true, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 2.</hi> The holy Spirit doth convince all
Goſpel-Believers of all immoral Evils, or of
every ſimple moral Precept; the holy Spirit
doth not convince all Goſpel-Believers it is an
Evil not to obſerve the ſeventh Day as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
nor that this is a moral Precept: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
'Tis not an immoral Evil to work upon that
day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 3.</hi> The holy Spirit guides all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
into all Truths that reſult from the holy
Nature of God, or that are good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
commanded; the holy Spirit doth not
guide all true Believers to obſerve the ſeventh
Day as a Sabbath: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is no ſuch Truth; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 4.</hi> If the New Teſtament be a perfect
Rule of Faith and Practice, and there is no
Precept nor Precedent for the obſervance of the
Seventh-day Sabbath; the Seventh-day Sabbath
ought not by us to be obſerved: but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true; <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis not our duty to obſerve
that Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 5.</hi> If <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> after him, have
made known or declared the whole Counſel and
Will of God, or whatſoever we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
obſerve and practiſe; but have not made
known or declar'd it is our duty to obſerve the
ſeventh Day, then 'tis not our duty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it: but the former is true, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 6.</hi> If the Law of the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> belonged wholly, or
was annexed to the Judgments of the <hi>Moſaical
Oeconomy,</hi> and the Judgments of the <hi>Moſaical
Oeconomy</hi> belong not to the Goſpel-Church;


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61730:145"/>
then the Law of the Sabbath, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
belongs not to us, but this is ſo, becauſe Death
was the Penalty of the breach thereof; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> What if we grant that all the ten
Commandments belonged, or were annexed to the
Moſaical Oeconomy; are all the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
abrogated therefore, or not in force to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſhewed that the whole Moral
Law is given forth by Chriſt conſidered as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator;
and that we are not obliged to obſerve
them as given by <hi>Moſes:</hi> and the preciſe ſeventh
Day being no ſimple Moral Precept, but merely
Judaical, pertaining to the Covenant of Works,
our Lord hath not nor could confirm that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the Goſpel: ſo that it appears the Sabbath
only belonged to the <hi>Moſaical Oeconomy,</hi> and
will you affirm that of all the Ten.</p>

Commandments had the Penalty of Death annexed
to them to be inflicted by the Magiſtrate: which,
<hi>ſaith he,</hi> is an evident diſtinction between Moral

the other nine have, it convincingly proves the
Morality of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> This ſhews that none of the <hi>ten
Commandments,</hi> as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> are in force
to Believers, or oblige the Goſpel-Church, but
only belong'd to the Jewiſh Policy as formally
deliver'd, <hi>Exod. 20.</hi> and tho the Moral Law
given by Chriſt as Mediator, doth oblige us,
yet the preciſe ſeventh Day being no Moral
Precept, but only Judaical, is gone, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given forth anew in the Goſpel, nor could
be given with its old Sanction, <hi>viz.</hi> the Penalty
of Death to be inflicted on ſuch that break it,
becauſe the Goſpel-Church is no Political Body
or Civil State, they can't inflict Death on ſuch


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61730:145"/>
as tranſgreſs this, or other Precepts.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, nor ought ſuch to die <hi>that profane
the holy Name of God,</hi> or <hi>diſobey their Parents,</hi>
or <hi>commit Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. by any Law given by
Chriſt in the Goſpel<note n="*" place="margin">And do not ſuch as affirm o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſtrangely Judaize?</note>, thoſe Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

yet were not to be put to death, Chriſt
<hi>came not to take away Mens Lives, but to ſave
them</hi> both from temporal and eternal Death.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover, it is a grand miſtake to ſay,
that the Penalty of Death diſtinguiſheth Moral
Laws from Ceremonial: for he that in the days
of Atonement did not afflict his Soul,<note place="margin">Levit. 23. 29.</note> muſt die,
or be cut off; <hi>and whoſoever toucheth the Mount,
ſhall be ſurely put to death.<note place="margin">Exo. 19. 13.</note> And he that was

divers other Sins<note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 30. 33, 38. Lev. 7. 20, 21, 25, 27. &amp; 17. 4, 9.</note> that were not Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.
Pray read <hi>Heb. 10. 28. Paul</hi> ſhews that
in this reſpect <hi>we are not come to Mount</hi> Sinai,
<hi>but to Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>Heb. 12. 18.</hi> and ſad it is to
ſee any ſo left, as to endeavour to carry the
People back again to that <hi>fiery Law,</hi> which was
ſo terrible, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>ver. 21.</hi>
But it is no marvel they do thus, when they that
intimate the Law and Covenant, <hi>Exod. 20.</hi> was
the Covenant of Grace. If I have an Anſwer
(God ſparing my Life) you ſhall ſee what ſome
of their chief Writers have ſaid as to this, and
ſome other things, that may ſeem more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſteful
to all pious Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 7.</hi> If the firſt Day was obſerved as a
day of Worſhip by the Apoſtolical Church,
and no other day of the week; then the firſt
Day is that day of Worſhip which we ſhould
obſerve: but the firſt Day was ſo obſerved, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <hi>Arg. 9.</hi> If all Sabbaths given to the Jews,

'tis Chriſt hath nowhere taught or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

               <p>1. God hath built all things upon Jeſus
Chriſt, and ſo this Day of Reſt; wherefore it
ſtands as faſt as its Foundation.</p>
               <p>2. God the Father declared, <hi>Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> (that is,
from the dead) and this was on the Firſt-day
of the Week.</p>

therefore this day remains as a day of Reſt to
us.</p>
               <p>5. This Day our Redemption was finiſhed,
and Chriſt received our diſcharge from Sin and
Wrath for ever.</p>
               <p>6. On this Day the <hi>Typical Sabbath</hi> was
ceaſed, and all Shadows of the Law vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>7. In him whom the old Sabbath ſhadowed
forth, muſt we ſeek our Reſt, and a day of
Reſt; we in him being freed from all legal
Labour, ſervile Fear, and from the burden of
all Sin and Miſery.</p>
               <p>8. On this Day the Diſciples met, and Chriſt
preached Peace to them; and on this day mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Souls have been converted.</p>
               <p>9. On this Day <hi>John</hi> ſaw Jeſus Chriſt walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the midſt of the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. This Day was confirmed by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
effuſion of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>11. On this Day the Goſpel-Churches met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to break Bread, and to diſcharge all parts
of Goſpel-Worſhip.</p>
               <p>12. This is the Day when preaching the

               <p>13. On this day Collections were made for
the Poor in all the Churches of the Saints.</p>

14. This is the <hi>Lord's Day;</hi> all other days

his own Day; he lays claim to this only, O

               <p>15. This Day all the Godly have obſerved in

               <p>16. For profaning this Day, God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
many ſore and fearful Judgments.</p>
               <p>And thus I ſhall cloſe what I ſhall ſay at

only that particular <hi>extraordinary Sabbath</hi>
which was thus inſtituted, namely the <hi>day of

                  <p>
                     <q>However ſuppoſe it to belong alſo to the
weekly Sabbath; it is evidently an addition
to the Command particularly ſuted unto the
<hi>Moſaical Pedagogy,</hi> that the Day might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Sacrifice of the <hi>proceeding Evening</hi>


                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:61730:147"/>
in the Service of it, from an Obedience
whereunto we are freed by the Goſpel. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I ſubſcribe to this Opinion; and
that becauſe in the Deſcription and Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the original Seven Days, it is ſaid of
each of the Six, that it was conſtituted of <hi>an
Evening and a Morning;</hi> but of the <hi>Day of
Reſt</hi> there is no ſuch deſcription, it is only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Seventh-day,</hi> without any aſſignation
of the preceding Evening unto it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2. A Day of Reſt, according to Rules of
natural Equity, ought to be proportioned to a
day of Work or Labour, which God hath
granted unto us for our own uſe. Now this
is to be reckoned from Morning to Evening,
<hi>Pſal. 104. 20, 21, 22, 23. Thou makeſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and it is night,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Man goeth forth to
his labour until the evening.</hi> The day of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is from the removal of darkneſs, and the
night by the light of the Sun, until the return
of them again; which allowing for the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the day in the ſeveral ſeaſons of the
year, ſeems to be the juſt meaſure of our Day
of Reſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>3. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
gave beginning and being to this
eſpecial Day of holy Reſt under the Goſpel,
roſe not until the Morning of the Firſt-day
of the Week, when the beamings of the
light of the Sun began to expel the darkneſs
of the Night; or when it dawned towards
Day, as is variouſly expreſſed by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts:
This with me determines this whole
matter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>4. Meer ceſſation from Labour in the
Night, ſeems to have no place in the ſpiritual
Reſt of the Goſpel to be expreſſed on this
Day, nor to be by any thing diſtinguiſhed


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61730:148"/>
from the Night of any other day in the
Week.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>5. Suppoſing Chriſtians under the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the direction given by <hi>Moſes</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
it may intangel them in the anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſcrupulous Intrigues which the Jews are
ſubject unto about the beginning of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf, about which their great Maſters
are at variance: which things belong not to
the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Goſpel. Upon the whole
matter I am inclinable to judg, and do ſo,
that the obſervation of the Day is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate
to the uſe of our natural ſtrength on
any other day, from morning to night; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is hereby loſt that is needful to the due
ſanctification of it: For what is by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
as a part of its Sanctification, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
and required as a due preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. From what the learned and pious Doctor
ſaith, I infer, that theſe Sabbatarians do not
only Judaize in reſpect of the Seventh-day it
ſelf, but alſo as to the time when they begin
their pretended Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>2. And as to what he ſays about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Lord's Day, I ſee no juſt cauſe to
diſſent from him, provided none from thence
take liberty to end the Day too ſoon. And I
think it would be a reproach to any Perſon to
begin to work before midnight of the Lord's
Day, or to ſuffer their Servants to work after
twelve a Clock on the Seventh-day at night;
nay, it might be better if they left off ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that ſo they may not be hindered in God's
Service on his Day: for the natural Day with
us begins at midnight, and ends at midnight;
and tho 'tis the Lord's Day, not the Night,
we are to obſerve in his ſolemn Worſhip, yet


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61730:148"/>
muſt we have time for preparation, and after
the Day is gone, for Meditation, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And let none miſtake the Doctor, he hints
plainly enough, that by way of preparation
we ought to begin ſooner, and then certainly
to continue our meditation after the day is paſt,
till it is fit to go to our natural Reſt: and the
contrary is a ſcandal and reproach to Religion
and true Piety.</p>

                  <head>How the Lord's Day ſhould be kept.</head>
                  <p>Certainly ſince the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> or the <hi>Firſt-day
of the Week,</hi> is the Day of holy <hi>Reſt and

to know and conſider well how we ſhould keep
it, or obſerve it to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>1. Evident it is that ſome are carried away
by deluſion, who believe all days are alike, and
ſo every day ſhould be kept as a Sabbath; which
is nothing leſs than the deſign of the Devil, who
if he can perſwade men that there is no ſuch
thing as a <hi>Sacred Reſt,</hi> or <hi>any one day</hi> required
by Authority from Chriſt, will ſoon bring them
to obſerve no day at all; and ſo all Goſpel-worſhip,
Religion, Piety, and the ſpecial Day
of Worſhip will ſoon fall together.</p>
                  <p>2. Nay, and I am ſatisfied, that one grand
cauſe of the lamentable decay of true Zeal
and Piety, and of the grievous witherings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us in theſe days, is that ſad careleſneſs
and looſeneſs about a due and religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the <hi>Lord's Day:</hi> For when more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
was made of the Dutys of this Day,
how did Religion and ſtrict Godlineſs flouriſh
in this Nation, and in the Churches of Chriſt
and godly Families? Nor will it be better till
a Reformation be attained in this caſe.</p>

3. Yet,<note place="margin">On the Sab. <hi>P. 317.</hi>
                     </note> as Reverend <hi>Owen</hi> obſerves, ſeveral
<q>Inſtances there are of the Miſcarriages of men

and may be now, think they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to keep the Lord's Day after the manner
the Jews kept the old Sabbath.</q> To which
I might add, ſome are too Phariſaical in
this matter. There hath been (ſaith the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor)
<q>ſome <hi>exceſs</hi> in directions of many given
about the due ſanctification of the <hi>Lord's
Day,</hi> which indeed he calls <hi>ſevere directions</hi>
about Dutys,</q> and manner of performance;
on which ſome others have taken occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to ſeek Relief, and have rejected the whole
Command. So that it appears in this, as in
many other caſes, men are ready to run into
extreams on the one hand or the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Directions,<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> ſaith he, have been given, and
not a few, for the obſervation of a <hi>Day of
holy Reſt,</hi> which either for the matter of
them, or the manner preſcribed, have no
ſufficient warrant or foundation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas ſome have made no diſtinction
between the Sabbath as <hi>Moral</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">That is, <hi>one day in ſeven,</hi> as he calls it, a <hi>moral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note>, and as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical,</hi>
unleſs it be merely in the change of

the whole practice required on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the <hi>Lord's Day.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, as I ſhall ſhew you, they have aſſerted
the ſimple morality of the <hi>fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to conſiſt in the obſervance of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Firſt-day of the Week,</hi> or the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi>
as the <hi>Saturday Sabbatarians</hi> do on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth;
which is no ſmall Error on both ſides,
and is attended, as I have proved, with great
Abſurdities, and dangerous Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:61730:149"/>
Therefore if any ask how ſhould we obſerve
the <hi>Lord's Day;</hi> for we are fully ſatisfied, ſay
they, that is <hi>the Day the Lord hath made</hi> as
the Day of Reſt and ſolemn Worſhip under the
Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>Firſt Negatively,</hi> not after that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
ſevere, or ſtrict manner, as was the Jewiſh
Sabbath under the Law. I am perſwaded ſome
good Men in the laſt Century have by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated
Zeal, ſtumbled many godly Chriſtians,
by preſſing the Lord's Day obſervance juſt after
the manner of the <hi>old Jewiſh Sabbath;</hi> as if one
preciſe Day of Worſhip was a pure moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
But if the morality of the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
conſiſted not in the obſervation of the
preciſe Seventh-day, as I have ſhewed, beſure
it doth not in the obſervance of the Firſt-day,
tho it be our Duty, by mere poſitive Right,
to keep it wholly to the Lord. And ſhould we
preſs the obſervance of the Lord's Day with
that ſeverity and ſtrictneſs the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was to be obſerved, we ſhould bring our
People into equal bondage with the Jews of
old.</p>
                  <p>But let us avoid all Extreams on either hand;
for as I hinted, ſome Learned Men formerly
<note n="*" place="margin">And there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this ſort alſo in our days.</note> opened a door to <hi>looſneſs</hi> and <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi>
on the one hand, by not allowing the <hi>Firſt-day's
obſervance</hi> to be of Divine Inſtitution, and
ſo allowed of Sports and carnal Delights on
the Lord's Days: I might mention Mr. <hi>Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Heylin, Pocklington,</hi> &amp;c. So others 'tis
evident have exceeded as much on the other
hand; but 'tis beſt to keep in a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt
both.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the <hi>Negative,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I do not believe it is unlawful <hi>to kindle a
Fire</hi> on the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> becauſe 'tis not forbid


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61730:150"/>
in the Goſpel, as it was under the Law on the
old Sabbath-day.</p>
                  <p>2. I do not believe 'tis unlawful to travel
further than a Jewiſh Sabbath-days Journey;
whether to to hear a Sermon, or to viſit a ſick
Perſon, or the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We have no bounds under the Goſpel,<note place="margin">On the Sab. <hi>p. 353.</hi>

it be for <hi>Sabbath Ends.</hi> In brief, all
Pains or Labour that our Station and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

we cannot enjoy the ſolemn Ends and Uſes of
this ſacred Day of Reſt, are no way <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi>
with the due obſervation of it. It may
be the lot of one Man to take ſo much pains,
and to travel ſo far for and in the due Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lord's-day, as if another ſhould
do the like without his Occaſions and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
it would be a profanation of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. I do not believe it unlawful to dreſs a
Dinner or Supper on the Lord's-day. <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments
helpful to Nature ſo far as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
it, that it may have a ſupply of Spirits
to go on chearfully in the Duties of holy
Worſhip (ſaith the <hi>Doctor)</hi> are lawful and
uſeful: to macerate the Body with Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences
on this day, is required of none; and
to turn it into a Faſt, or to faſt upon this
day, is generally condemn'd by the <hi>Antients.</hi>
Wherefore to forbear proviſion of neceſſary
Food for Families on this day, is <hi>Moſaical;</hi>
and the enforcement of the particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
about not kindling a Fire on this day,
baking and preparing the Food of it the day
before, cannot be inſiſted on without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>introduction
of the <hi>ſeventh Day</hi> preciſely,
to whoſe obſervation they were annexed, and


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61730:150"/>
thereby of the Spirit of the old Covenant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>1. Provided always theſe Refreſhments be
ſeaſonable for the time of them, and not
when publick Duties require our attendance
on them.</q> And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2. Accompanied with ſingular regard to
the Rules of Temperance; As (1.) That
there be no appearance of Evil. (2.) That
Nature be not charged with any kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
ſo far as to be hindered rather than
aſſiſted in the Duties of the Day. (3.)
That they are accompanied with Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Sobriety, and Purity of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>—</p>
                  <p>To which let me add, certainly Maſters of
Families ought to take heed they do not put
their Servants upon greater Labour on that
day<note n="*" place="margin">Nor their Beaſts nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince God allows them this one day of the Week for Reſt.</note> than needs muſt, ſo as to hinder them

                  </p>
                  <p>Such unaccountable Zeal hath done no ſmall
miſchief to the Cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Two things I obſerve from what the <hi>Doctor</hi>
notes:</p>
                  <p>1. That theſe Men thought we are under the

as the <hi>Jews</hi> were on their <hi>ſeventh Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That they thought the Morality of the
<hi>fourth Commandment</hi> conſiſted in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> or the <hi>firſt Day of the
week,</hi> and ſo is a pure Moral Precept; both
which I utterly deny, and the contrary I have
proved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the Affirmative I do ſay, that
the firſt Day, tho it be of <hi>mere poſitive Right,</hi>
ought to be obſerved wholly to the Lord:
<hi>He that obſerves a day, let him obſerve it to the
Lord;</hi> and day, much more the Lord's-day.</p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>To the Lord,</hi> not to our ſelves, <hi>i.e.</hi> for
our external Profit, or Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>To the Lord,</hi> that is, the whole day;
not a part of it, but the whole day from
Morning to Evening.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>That we begin the Day early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
firſt in private, and then in Family Devotion.</hi>
1. In reading ſome part of God's Word; and,
2. In Prayer, laying aſide all worldly buſineſs
but what is of abſolute neceſſity, and as much
as in us lies, all worldly Diſcourſe, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or worldly Thoughts; that the Lord on his


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61730:152"/>
Day may have our Hearts as well as our Ears,
Tongues and Feet: and then to attend the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip, and that early; on the <hi>firſt
Day</hi> of the <hi>week</hi> to ſeek Jeſus, as <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>
did.</p>
                  <p>Certainly it is a horrid ſhame in any to take
more liberty for Sleep, or otherwiſe to gratify
the Fleſh on this day than they do on other
days of the week, when imploy'd in doing
their own Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Do Men require the whole Day, and with
the greateſt care and diligence, to do their
Work? And doth not the holy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
our utmoſt care and diligence in his
Work and Service?<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed is the Deceiver
which hath in his Flock a Male, and voweth and
ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> &amp;c.
Again it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Jer. 48. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed be he that doth the
Work of the Lord negligently or deceitfully;</hi>
that is, with a cold and careleſs Spirit.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, God is a great King, and a
jealous God for his Name, and ſacred Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
<note place="margin">Levit. 10. 3.</note> and he <hi>will be ſanctified by all that draw
near to him.</hi> And we muſt, I ſay, ſhew greater
Care and Zeal in our ſerving him on his Day,
if poſſible, than in doing Work for Man.
(1.) He requires it of us:<note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatſoever thy hand
findeth to do, do it with thy might.</hi> (2.) He
more deſerves it from our hands: Should a
Servant come to his day's Work at ten a Clock,
certainly his Maſter would ſoon turn him off.
O take heed leſt God ſeverely rebuke you for
your ſloth and careleſneſs in not attending early
on his publick Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>IV. In the Evening to cloſe the <hi>Lord's-day</hi>
in reading, inſtructing our Families, and in
repeating what we have heard, or in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereon, and in Prayer, and ſinging of


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61730:153"/>
Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs. Thus
the Primitive Chriſtians kept the <hi>Lord's Day</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Read Dr. <hi>Young</hi> on the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> of the next Age to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note>.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>Preparation for the Publick Worſhip</hi> is very
neceſſary; therefore beſure you always come
into the Church from your Cloſets, bearing
your Miniſters upon your Hearts, that ſo the
Word of God may run and be glorified, and
your own Souls ſecretly fed and edified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And let no ſmall matters hinder you,
neither the length of the way, nor weather;
ſay with your ſelf, Sure I would not make theſe
a plea or excuſe, were I to receive ſome
great earthly Profit.</p>
                  <p>VI. As to the Publick Worſhip, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in reading God's Word, Preaching, Prayer,
and ſinging of Pſalms, with a free and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
contribution for the poor Saints on every
Firſt-day of the Week; and if our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
do not need ſuch a weekly Collection,
yet it ought to be made for others who may
need our help: In which Contribution every
one, ſave Receivers, ought to be Givers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Ability, tho it be but two
Mites; and often on this day alſo the Lord's
Supper is to be celebrated. Theſe were the
practices of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> as Dr.
<hi>Young</hi> abundantly hath ſhewed out of the
Writings of the firſt <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> as <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Juſtin Martyr,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>VII. Meditation is a great Duty on the
Lord's Day,<note place="margin">On the Sab. p. 345.</note> as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſhews; and this,
(1.) In reſpect of God himſelf, whoſe Glory
we muſt make our end in all we do. We ought
to meditate on the <hi>Majeſty, Greatneſs, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciency</hi>
and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God, in our Approaches
to him in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> his Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and ſo on all the days of our lives.</p>
                  <p>(2.) We ought to meditate on Jeſus Chriſt


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61730:153"/>
in a peculiar manner, as the ſpecial Author of
that Ordinance in which we approach to him,
and come together to celebrate. Conſider <hi>his
Reſt:</hi> God takes up his Reſt in Chriſt, his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and Complacency in him, and in the
Way and Covenant of Reſt, for us thro him;
therefore this is a ſutable Subject of Meditation
on this day.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Let us meditate upon the Glory and
Excellency of Chriſt's Perſon, and of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Love.</p>
                  <p>(4.) The Day it ſelf, and its ſacred Services,
are to be meditated upon, and thoſe Privileges
we are partakers of. On this Day our Reſt was
perfected; for then Chriſt roſe again for our
Juſtification, and ſpoke Peace to his Diſciples;
and ſo he doth to us. On this day we were
<hi>juſtified</hi> in Chriſt, accepted in Chriſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
in Chriſt, as in our Head and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
on that very Firſt-day he roſe from
the Dead. Therefore let Faith on this <hi>day</hi>
be exerciſed, and let us labour for thankful
Hearts, and rejoice with ſinging on this <hi>day</hi>
which <hi>the Lord hath made</hi> to this end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caution.</hi> Let all take heed that none profane
the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> nor any way caſt contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; which may be done many ways.</p>
                  <p>1. By doing ſervile Work on this <hi>day</hi> out of
a covetous mind;<note place="margin">How ſome profane the Lords Day.</note> and ſo inſtead of doing the
Lord's Work on his <hi>day,</hi> they do their own.</p>
                  <p>2. By walking in the Fields for their own
carnal pleaſure and recreation. O this is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Evil.</p>
                  <p>3. In gaming, and playing, or ſporting on
the Lord's Day.</p>
                  <p>4. In taking upon them needleſs Journeys to
viſit their Friends, becauſe they cannot, they
pretend, ſpare any other day to do it, for fear


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61730:154"/>
of outward loſs to themſelves and Families;
Chriſt ſhall ſuffer the loſs of his Honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
rather than they will loſe any part of one
of their own days.</p>
                  <p>5. Some will not ſpare time on working days
for themſelves or Servants to take a Potion of
Phyſick to remove Diſtempers of the Body, but
refer it to the <hi>Lord's Day;</hi> which certainly is
a horrid Evil: And can they think God will
bleſs that Phyſick?</p>
                  <p>Is it not Sacrilege to rob God of his Day
(for any external advantage) which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
and ſet apart for his own Worſhip? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <q>He that converts any time of the Lord's Day,<note place="margin">Watſon<hi>'s Body of Divinity,</hi> p. 335.</note>
ſaith one, to worldly Buſineſs, is a worſe
Thief than he that robs on the High-way:
for ſuch a Thief does but rob Man, but this
Thief robs God,</q> he robs him of his Day.</p>
                  <p>6. Such as ſpend part of it in caſting up
their Debts, or ſetting their Shop-books right.</p>
                  <p>7. Such as take liberty to lie long abed on
the Lord's Day, and prefer their carnal Eaſe
above the Honour of Chriſt and his ſacred
Worſhip, to the reproach of his Church, and
grief of his Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>8. Such as ſpend more time on the Morning
of the Lord's Day, to dreſs and trim their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
than they take in Prayer, Reading, and
Meditation, to prepare their Souls for God's
holy Worſhip: Theſe ſhould be taken notice of
and reproved; perhaps all the Morning is ſpent
thus, and not two Minutes either in Prayer,
Reading, or Meditation.</p>
                  <p>9. Such as neglect coming into the publick
Worſhip of God on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> till per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
near half the Dutys of Worſhip are over:
by this God is provoked, and ſhame attends


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61730:154"/>
our Aſſemblies, and our Sacred Religion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to reproach. How far do the Papiſts for
Zeal in their falſe Religion out-do many who
would be thought the moſt refined Proteſtants?
How early are they at their Devotion on this
<hi>day,</hi> as well as on other days of the Week?</p>
                  <p>Let us reform in this caſe for the Lord's ſake,
or elſe throw off our Profeſſion: God's Soul
loaths <hi>lukewarmneſs;</hi> let us either be hot or
quite cold, leſt God ſpew us out of his Mouth.</p>
                  <p>10. In worldly and needleſs Diſcourſes: how
much time on the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> is this way idly
waſted, and the <hi>day</hi> this way profaned, as well
as in many other ways, which I ſhall now omit
to mention.</p>
                  <p>To cloſe all, Let us make due preparation for
the Worſhip of God on <hi>his Day,</hi> and rejoice at
the approach thereof, wherein we have a Prize
for our Souls put into our hands, and may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
God's Preſence if not wanting to our ſelves.
This is <hi>the Queen of Days</hi> (as <hi>Ignatius</hi> called
it) which God hath crowned with Bleſſings;
on which <hi>day</hi> the Spirit moſt gloriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
and the dew of the ſame Spirit ſtill
falls upon our Souls, and we may write, This
was the <hi>day</hi> of our new Birth, and in which
Chriſt often carried our Souls into his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe,
and alſo feaſted us with the fat
things thereof. This know aſſuredly, as you
grow cold in reſpect of the <hi>day</hi> of Worſhip,
you do certainly grow cold as to the Worſhip
it ſelf: and in this lies one of the great Evils
of our preſent Day.</p>
                  <p>What Zeal did attend Chriſtians in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in former times! and how religiouſly did
they obſerve the <hi>Lord's Day!</hi> Let us call to
mind our <hi>eſpouſal Love,</hi> and <hi>do our firſt Works,</hi>
leſt Chriſt remove our Candleſticks out of
their places.</p>
