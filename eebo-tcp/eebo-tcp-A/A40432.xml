            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Words contain in them God's gracious Promiſe to King <hi>David,</hi> of his ſpecial and more than ordinary Preſence with, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Government he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to; And certainly, never had

            <p n="1">I. The firſt thing to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, The Perſon to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, <hi>King David,</hi> whom the Text conſiders under a two-fold Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:</p>
            <p>As a Religious King, <hi>David my ſervant;</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60535:5"/>
               <hi>As a Rightful King,</hi> With my holy oyl have Ianointed him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a Religious King, <hi>David my ſervant; Saul</hi> by his Diſobedience had ſhewed himſelf unworthy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and God's Favour; <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 23.</note>
               <hi>He rejected the word of the Lord,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>and thereupon God rejected him from being King,</hi> and reſolv'd to tranſlate the Crown to another Family: And amongſt all the Tribes and Families in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he pitch'd upon <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> as the moſt fit, and beſt qualified Perſon for it: <hi>I have found David my ſervant;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom God gave this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>That he was a man after his own heart, and that he had done that which was Right in his eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> A Good King is one; who is no leſs the Image of the Love and Goodneſs, than of the Power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God; who no leſs repreſents the Affection and Tenderneſs of our Heavenly Father, than the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Univerſal Monarch; whoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60535:5"/>
Care it is, That Religion flouriſhes, and the True Worſhip of God be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; That Juſtice be impartially adminiſtred; That Vice be ſubdued, and Virtue encouraged; That the One be ſham'd by his Example, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by his Laws; And that the Other Reigns and Triumphs under the Influence of both: One, who invades no Man's Property;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12 3.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſe Ox or Aſs have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppreſſed?</hi> So <hi>Samuel,</hi> when Supreme Magiſtrate of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> juſtified his Integrity: Who uſes not his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ruine his People, to undermine the True Religion, or to enſlave their Perſons; but to defend Both, and to preſerve them in their Rights and Liberties: Who is truly <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of his Countrey; having no diſtinct Intereſt from his People's, and making Their Welfare His higheſt Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60535:6"/>
2. As a Rightful King; <hi>With my holy oyl have I anointed him.</hi> No Man can call in queſtion <hi>David</hi>'s Title to the Crown, unleſs he will diſpute God's Right to diſpoſe of Crowns as he pleaſes; for <hi>David</hi> was immediately Choſen by God, and Anointed by his Prophet. But this was peculiar to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> no other Princes can produce ſuch a Patent for their Crowns.</p>
            <p>That which comes the neareſt, is, When God by a ſignal and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence, for ſome Great and Noble Ends, to Save a Nation, or to Defend his Truth, or to abate the Pride and Inſults of His and His Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Enemies, <hi>pulls down Kings,</hi> and <hi>ſets up Kings.</hi> But this is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of arguing; Succeſs does not always give a Title where it gives a Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60535:6"/>
The ordinary Means of conveying a Right to Govern, are, Either <hi>Conquest in a juſt Cauſe, The Election of the People,</hi> or <hi>Hereditary Succeſſion:</hi> Ours is own'd to be an Hereditary Crown, <hi>viz.</hi> Always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the next Heir, unleſs it ſo happen, that he be naturally or morally uncapable, and that the Publick Good and Safety will be evidently endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in his hands. Here it leaps over, not out of the Royal Line, but to the next, againſt whom there is no ſuch Objection. The great End of Government is the Publick Good and Safety; This for the moſt part is bound up in the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Community; and as all the Powers and Prerogatives inveſted by Law in the Prince, or Head of this Polity, are the better to enable him to execute thoſe Laws, and maintain the Common Safety; ſo all the Oaths that are taken to him by the Subjects, are alſo in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, and Subſerviency to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60535:7"/>
Common Safety, to which they were antecedently oblig'd, and he as well <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Tract of the Unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the New Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>as they ſworn to preſerve. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords and Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as is evident all along in the Courſe of our Hiſtory, have always lookt upon that Prince, who went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by an Arbitrary Power, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to their Laws and Rights, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave and Oppreſs them, as one that had laid down the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kingſhip or Monarchy; and have made no Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on ſuch a juſt Occaſion, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Allegiance from him, and to place another of the ſame Royal Line on the Throne of Majeſty. So, that would Men lay aſide their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and their Paſſions, their Piques and Revenges, their Peeviſh and Awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their Selfiſh and Narrow Spirits, they would ſoon perceive, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Laws and Religion, wherein conſiſts the Publick Good of this Realm, (nay, which yet adds to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60535:7"/>
it, the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt all the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereon the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Men's Souls do ſo much depend) have in a manner forced the Royal Diadem where it is: And this Conſideration alone (had it not been ſeconded with a juſt Cauſe, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Power in a Sovereign Prince) ſeems to me, to give an Undoubted Title.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Here's the Promiſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the following Verſes, from the 25th to the 30th, God promiſes <hi>David</hi> greatly to enlarge his Empire, to exalt him to the higheſt pitch of Human Power and Glory; to continue the Crown for ever in his Family, from which it ſhould never be taken, as it had been from <hi>Saul</hi>'s: But theſe may be thought peculiar to <hi>David,</hi> who was a Type of Chriſt as well as King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>laſt,</hi> which did not receive

            <p>What he promiſes him in the Text, is, His powerful Preſence with him, to protect him in all Dangers, to direct and aſſiſt him in all his juſt Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; to ſtrengthen him againſt all the Enemies, both Domeſtick and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, of his Crown and Kingdom; and this every Righteous and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince may ordinarily take Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in, and apply to themſelves.

Power into their Hands; for as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets receive of the Spirit, ſo do Kings of the Power of God. Now, thoſe who are employ'd by God to act for, and under him in the World, have reaſon to expect proportionable Aſſiſtance and Protection from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As they are entruſted by God with the Management of Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and ſo the welfare of the whole Community depending in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon their prudent Conduct and Safety. <hi>We have ten parts in the King,</hi> ſaid the Ten Tribes; <hi>Thou art worth Ten thouſand of us.</hi> And again, <hi>Thou ſhalt not any more go out to Battel with us, leſt thou quench the Light of</hi> Iſrael, ſaid the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to King <hi>David.</hi> What the Sun is to the World, that is a Wiſe and Gracious Prince to a Nation, its Happineſs, and its Glory. Now, we may be ſure, that that Providence, which, as the Scripture tells us, extends its Care over the leaſt and moſt deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60535:9"/>
things, over the Birds of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Field, will much more concern it ſelf for things of a more worthy Nature, for Men, for Communities of Men, for Princes, the Life and Soul of Communities. God is more concern'd in Many, than in ſingle Perſons; and ſince a Kingdom is the general Concernment of a King, a King muſt be the ſpecial Concernment of God. Kings by the Ancients were call'd <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That I may put many things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and haſten: Good Kings may expect God's ſpecial Preſence with them.</p>
            <p>In regard of the difficulty of their Office and Duty, being oft times to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60535:9"/>
about the Fate of Kingdoms, to judge in Matters of a dubious and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Nature, and to engage in Enterpriſes of the greateſt Hazard.</p>
            <p>In regard of the many Temptations, the Height of their Place and Power ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them unto; The uncontrollableneſs of their Power, the abundance of their Wealth, the multitude of their Cares and Buſineſs, the Crouds of Sycophants and Flatterers that always follow the Courts of Princes, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous Snares to their Virtue; The Devil knows how much it would be for the advantage of his Kingdom in the World, to have the Governors of it on his ſide, that they cannot ſin alone, but they muſt be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by Troops, and therefore he's always watching occaſions, and craving permiſſion from God to ſeduce and pervert them.</p>
            <p>In regard of the many Dangers they are expos'd to; Princes have not only many Potent Enemies from abroad, but for the moſt part many envious ill-willers and diſcontented Male-contents at home,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60535:10"/>
that are always beating how to ſupplant or overthrow them.</p>
            <p>In regard, laſtly, of ſome momentous and important Work and Buſineſs a Prince may be call'd to by God; Be it, for example, to put a ſtop to the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Idolatry, or to give a check to the mercileſs Rage of Tyrants and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors; This is the Cauſe of God, and he muſt be wanting to himſelf, ſhould he be wanting to thoſe whom he hath raiſed up for the defence of it.</p>
            <p>The Worthies of the <hi>Old Teſtament, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and <hi>Jeptha,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and many others, were bright examples of this; with whom God was peculiarly preſent, and ſometimes after a miraculous manner. The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us what Heroical Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they perform'd by faith in God.</p>
            <p>I muſt not ſtay to lead you far back in other Hiſtory, yet I cannot forbear men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the many wonderful Deliverances
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60535:10"/>
and Succeſſes wherewith it pleaſed God to crown the <hi>Great Conſtantine,</hi> and our own Renown'd and never to be forgotten Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom God raiſed up, <hi>the one,</hi> for the Deliverance of his Church Univerſal from Heathen Rage; <hi>the other,</hi> for the Deliverance of this Church from <hi>Popiſh Fury:</hi> But I muſt paſs over theſe and innumerable others, that I may come to them which I am concern'd particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remember.</p>
            <p>What an admirable Providence was it, that diſcover'd the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi> the black Conſpiracy of this Day, by the Lines of a dead Letter ſent to the Lord <hi>Monteagle!</hi> What could it be but a Beam from Heaven that darted into the King's Mind a meaning quite contrary to the natural ſenſe of the Words and all <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> conſtruction! The expreſſion was, <hi>The Danger is paſt as ſoon as you have burnt the Letter,</hi> which King <hi>James</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>as quickly,</hi> making it ſignifie, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs and quickneſs of the Blow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>

And no leſs viſible was the Sword of the Lord, than the Sword of <hi>Gideon,</hi> in our late happy Happy and Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution; when we conſider with what an invincible Spirit of Wiſdom and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage His <hi>Majeſty</hi> undertook the Cauſe of our Country; what general Deſires and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were on the ſudden kindled in Mens Hearts towards Him, their Laws, and their Religion; What a burning Zeal and Vigour, what an univerſal Harmony of Affections, what a perfect agreement of Councils and Endeavours inflamed the Breaſts of all Men; What a ſtrange Folly and Infatuation blinded the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of our Enemies; What guilty Fears and Cowardiſe ſeiz'd their Spirits; How all was brought about by a dry Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without the expence of the Blood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Friends or Enemies; We muſt conclude, <hi>That God was with him of a truth, and that it was he that made it to proſper.</hi>

III. It remains now only, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what are the proper Uſes and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Doctrine. I ſhall name at preſent but theſe four. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a ſincere regard and eſteem ought we to have for thoſe, for whom God is pleaſed to have ſo great and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular a concern? The Scripture is very ſtrict in injoyning Honour and Reverence to them, we are commanded <hi>to fear the King, to obey him, to pay tribute to him;</hi> all juſt and legal Power and Authority is not to be reſiſted; <hi>this is the Ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnation.</hi> Wiſe and gracious Princes are ſo great Bleſſings to their Kingdoms, that in the Heathen World their Subjects not only paid them the higheſt Honours during their lives, but worſhipt them too after their deaths. They could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that thoſe who either by the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uſeful Arts, or the inſtitution of an excellent Government, or by many noble Exploits and Deliverances had in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60535:12"/>
a high degree obliged their Countries, died like other Men, they reckon'd they became Divine, and were tranſlated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gods, and ſo chang'd their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance into Adoration. I mention this not for imitation, but as an infinite ſhame and reproach to too many Chriſtians, who cannot find in their Hearts to make any other returns to their Princes for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Benefits and mighty Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, they at the peril of their Lives and Blood have purchas'd for them, than Curſes and opprobrious Language, than meditating Ruine and Deſtruction againſt them. What can we deſire more, that is not by the bleſſing of God upon their Undertaking reſtor'd and confirm'd to us? Our Laws have recover'd their juſt Vigour and Authority, our Rights and Properties are ſecur'd, our Holy Religion ſafe, our Lives, and our Souls too, if we are not wanting to our ſelves, out of danger. We feel indeed at preſent ſome Burdens and Taxes, but are they any other than what are abſolutely neceſſary for our preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, voluntarily impos'd upon us by our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60535:12"/>
Repreſentatives in Parliament, And what are tollerable and eaſie when compar'd with the Slavery and Oppreſſion we are freed from, and the far greater Miſeries we had juſt reaſon to fear were coming upon us? We have nothing to complain of, unleſs it be that the Government is too mild and merciful to them who ſo little deſerve it. Certainly they who ſo mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and repine under this Golden Scepter, conſider not what it would be to feel the Iron Rod of <hi>French</hi> Cruelty and Popiſh Revenge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God's ſpecial Preſence with and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of good Kings, ſhews how vain and fooliſh a thing it is, as well as ſinful, to conſpire againſt them. Never was there yet a Government or Governour that could give Content and Satisfaction to all its Subjects; ſo long as there are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell that delight in the Miſeries and Confuſions of Men, and ſo long as there is Pride, and Ambition, and Malice, and Revenge, and Covetouſneſs lodg'd in the Breaſts of Men, muſt Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60535:13"/>
to meet with thoſe who envying their Power and Greatneſs, will be always contriving how to ſnatch it from them, or make them uneaſie under it; ſome there are that affect a Change for Change ſake, and therefore deſire to be rid of their preſent Maſters, onely that they might have new ones: Others are for troubling the Waters, hoping thereby for an opportunity to heal their lame Fortunes in them; Others are againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Government is againſt them; It's an Enemy to ſome Mens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, and they had as live part with their Lives as their Vices and their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; Its an Enemy to ſome Mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Honours, they have loſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they had, or they want ſomething they cannot get, they have no ſhare in the Adminiſtration, no Place of Truſt, no Poſt of Advantage in it, and ſome Men can be true to nothing but their own Intereſts, and becauſe a Government does not ſerve their turn, they are for another that will; Its an Enemy to that which ſome Men call their Religion, I mean
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60535:13"/>
their Superſtitious and Idolatrous way of Worſhip, and that State muſt not think to ſtand long, if the Devil and the Jeſuit can help it, that does not fall down to their <hi>Dagon:</hi> But in vain are all the Attempts of Malice and Treaſon againſt thoſe, who are compaſs'd about with God's Favour as with a Shield. Good Princes are the peculiar Charge and Favourites of God; He in an eſpecial manner intereſts himſelf in their Safety; and unleſs their Enemies are of God's Privy Couucil, and can know before-hand that he'll ſuffer it, they can no more be ſecure of Succeſs in their Conſpiracies, than they can be of being too hard for the Almighty. Give me leave therefore in this caſe to apply the beginning of the 2<hi>d Pſalm,</hi> that was literally ſpoken of <hi>David,</hi> as well as figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively of Chriſt; Why do the Papiſts <hi>rage,</hi> and the diſaffected <hi>People imagine a vain thing? He that ſits in Heaven ſhall laugh them to ſcorn; the Lord ſhall have them in Deriſion; yet have I ſet my King upon my Holy Hill of</hi> Sion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60535:14"/>
3. God's ſpecial Preſence with and Protection of good Kings, calls upon us to pray for the continuance of it to thoſe whom in his good Providence he hath ſet over us; the Mercies God promiſes, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſhould be fetch'd down by Prayer. Now Kings being the main Inſtruments of Providence, whereby God conveyeth his Favours and diſpenſeth his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to a People, as we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be happy and proſperous, but by their means; ſo we cannot expect that they ſhould be a means of it, unleſs by fervent and devout Prayer, we engage the continual powerful Preſence of God with them: Not to invoke the Bleſſing of God upon Governours, is to diſown God's Government of the World whoſe Miniſters they are: And how can that People expect to be bleſſed by God, who diſown his Government? There are none but muſt be ſenſible how much the welfare of this Kingdom is bound up in the Preſervation of this Government. In all likelihood our Religion, our Laws,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60535:14"/>
and our Liberties will ſtand and fall with our Princes; we are therefore high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd, if not for theirs, for our own Sakes, to lift up our Hearts and our Voices to Heaven for them. I hope we have not yet forgot the Day of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, what paſſionate Prayers we then ſent up to Heaven to take pity on us: And God was pleaſed to hear the Prayers of his People, He rais'd us up a Deliverer, and has thereby encourag'd us ſtill to pray, <hi>Strengthen, O Lord, that which thou haſt wrought for us: Clothe all his Enemies with Shame, but upon himſelf let his Crown flouriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. God's ſpecial Preſence with and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of righteous and religious Princes, calls upon us to bleſs God for the two great Deliverances of this Day. An eminent Jeſuit, <hi>Campian</hi> by name, long ſince declared in Print, that <note place="margin">Camp. Epiſt. 10. ad Conc. Reg. Angl. p. 22.</note>
               <hi>their Society had made a Holy League and ſolemn Oath, that as long as there were any of them alive, they would deſtroy heretical Princes by all means poſſible; and as for the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60535:15"/>
               <hi>Nation they would procure and for ever pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue its Ruine, and the utter Deſtruction of its Religion.</hi> And to do them right, hitherto they have made good their Oath; how unwearied and reſtleſs have their Malice and Rage been againſt us?</p>
            <p>The Royal Family of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> to begin <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi>'s Speech at <hi>Gar.</hi> Tryal.</note>no higher, are indebted to them for many ſignal Kindneſſes: What ſtrong Endeavours were made to keep King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt from the Crown? <hi>Garnet</hi> a Jeſuit brought two Breves from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> to exclude him, commanding all Catholicks, both Clergy and Laity, not to ſuffer him, or any other that was not a Catholick, to ſucceed to the Crown. <hi>Parſons</hi> another Jeſuit, under the Name of <hi>Doleman,</hi> wrote againſt his Title, and ſet up another, that of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> againſt his; after a moſt rude and inſolent manner, blackning his Name, and loading his Actions with the moſt ſpiteful Calumnies; But when after all their Attempts, they could not hinder him from coming in, they reſolv'd by dreadful blow of Gunpowder to rid
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60535:15"/>

Proteſtants were ſlain in one Night. But bleſſed be God who hath hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the malicious Purpoſes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Enemies of our Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that brought to light that Work of Hell and Darkneſs, and hath preſerved us in the Enjoyment of the Benefits of that great Deliverance to this Day.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, they carried on the ſame Deſign; They began with a Plot to murder the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and to take away the King's Life, happily diſcovered by means of <hi>Andreas ab Habernfield.</hi> What ſalvage and inhumane Cruelties they committed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I tremble to mention, wherein a 100000 Proteſtants were barbarouſly murdered in <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Pet. du Moulin.</hi> Vind. of Prot.

How dextrouſly did they manage the contending Parties, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging now one and then the other, till they had almoſt beat out one anothers Brains? And then at laſt by plotting to take away the Life of that Prince, (who was now thought, it ſeems, to ſtand in their way) and to give a Toleration to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Party, how advantagiouſly did they prepare the way for a total Extirpation, as they call'd it, of the <hi>Northern Hereſy,</hi> which they doubted not to effect under the Reign of a more reſolute Prince, that ſhould more heartily and vigorouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe their Cauſe?
