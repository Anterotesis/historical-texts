            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IS an actiue fellow, begot by the Statute for a yeere, and then his name extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, though he be sharer in anothers, the next yeere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Hee is the feare and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of all debtors, as also the free entertainer of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour, who daily sollicites him with coyne, to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious in his Catching, which hee discreetly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with protestation of performance, whilest a fee on the contrary forceth him to
<pb facs="tcp:9918:70"/>
neglect, knowing that thogh delaies proue dangerous, yet all makes for his aduantage in the end. He is the birth, life, and death of the law. The birth is the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; the life the execution, and the death the stopping the breath of the execution; by giuing notice to those that neuer requite him with nothing. Hee is one subiect to much danger, and ought to haue both wit and valour, the one to defend his purse, the other his carkasse, lest the Exchequer cut the one, and the Countrey Rebel the other. He vnderstands more than the high Sheriffe his
<pb facs="tcp:9918:71"/>
Master, and may well, for he buyes his wit of him (which is euer the best) and sells it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at a treble valew, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a great gainer, if his <hi>Quietus est</hi> doth not too much gripe him. He is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly respected more for feare than loue, and as little esteemed when hee is out of his office, which will be next Michaelmas Terme, and then you may trade with him for ten groats (an Attournyes see) his Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall profession.</p>

            <p>IS one deepely read in the mysteries of the Celler, diuing into the secrets of Hogsheads, and is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant in the mingling of his Ware. Hee is of such celerity, that hee ascends the Staires in a moment, and descends them as sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, especially when hee is throwne downe. He is one that trusts all commers (for he onely cryes score it) but hee trusts them no further than he sees them, and when
<pb facs="tcp:9918:72"/>
their braines and bellies are full, hee lookes they should empty their purses. Hee is subiect to many ill words, which he as patiently beares, as they are like to doe his blowes, if they want the Reckoning. Hee should bee very wise by the continuall sight of so many seuerall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and would be so, but for the sumigation of the Celler, which eleuates his wits, and makes them fly so high, that they sometimes catch a fall. He is alwayes a good fellow, and loues a Gentleman, for that hee is sometimes one himselfe. He drinks the best drinke which
<pb facs="tcp:9918:72"/>
breeds the best blood, the cause hee commonly loues a Wench, for hee is a man of great trading. I cannot tell whether his Master serues him, or he his Master, but I am sure they cannot wel liue asunder. Hee is now casting about for some Merchants Credite, to set vp for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that his wife may keepe the Barre, to attract Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and he leaue his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney worke, and become as free to her, as shee may bee to others.</p>

            <p>IS a man who steeres all his course in a right line, and weighes all his actions in an equall ballance; a very good Mathematician, for hee is alwayes within his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, but neuer runs circle so long as to make himselfe giddy. Hee cuts out euery thing into a geometricall proportion to his Rule and est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>; nor doth his Sense too much ouer-rule his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Hee drinkes onely for thirst, and eats only for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb facs="tcp:9918:73"/>
knowing superfluity to be the heyre of prodigality, and liberality the daughter of good husbandry, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium betwixt two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes.

               </gap> a Waster. His children neuer liue to haue cause to curse him, nor his feruants to accuse him for their want of wages. He seriously viewes the folly of Profusenesse, and is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorry to see the fall of any. He is not so niggardly as to grutch himselfe or his friend a good meale, but tasts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (though temperately) of that God hath lent him, and
<pb facs="tcp:9918:74"/>
thinkes himselfe no loser by lending a little to the needy. His moderate diet giues him longer dayes, and his care in his calling frees him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (the bait of his greatest enemy) for in doing nothing men learne to doe ill. He loues not stolne waters, (though ne're so sweet) but is satisfied with the breasts of his owne bedfellow. Hee educates his children in a Religious way, knowing that Grace cannot want goods. And thus hee passeth his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage with a peacefull Conscience, and leaues the world with all good mens applause, so that his Name
<pb facs="tcp:9918:74"/>
dyes not with his nature. His tything in his life time was so true and consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Parson prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his Funeral praise, and perhaps giues him gratis his buriall in the Chancell.</p>

His actions are solid, not phantastike, and he is very wary of promising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nything that he either thinks or knowes hee cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; for hee still casts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond chance, knowing a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, and seeing a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility before hee passeth his protestation. Hee is one that keeps his mind within him, the reason why he thinks and speakes both together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any iarre betweene his tongue and his heart. His word is as good as his bond, and his conscience the best debtor. His loue (if possible) is without lust or iealousie, fixed on vertue, where it
<pb facs="tcp:9918:75"/>
stands firme as a rock. Truth hath bound vp his Temp les and discretion hath so knic the knot, that hee seldome makes his choyce so bad as to refuse it, his word so large as to reuoke it, or his time so short as to peece it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes at its period. Hee must needs bee very patient too, else his constancy could not continue, for impatiency breaks the fence of hope and stability, and lets in despaire and leuity, a couple of wilde Cattel that may spoyle a wel growne field. The wife that possesseth him is happy, for there is sure hold of his word. Shee findes him at his
<pb facs="tcp:9918:76"/>
appointed howre, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barres her of many fears, and she ne're eats her meat cold, by staying for his comming. Hee hath wealth enough, if he hath but this one Vertue, for all men beleeue him, and dare trust him.

He is the scoffe of his neighbors, and the bait that causeth many to nibble in iest, that hee might vex in good earnest. He commonly dreames of his wife though neuer so broad awake, and would keepe her in a Chest but for feare of picking the locke, which sets the greater edge to her appetite, and the greater madnesse to his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleafe. His braines are in perpetuall agitation, and in his phantasie (being a kind of frenzy) sees so many loose

He is one no way fit for any place, either in Church or Common-weale, for he that cannot guide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, is most vnfit to gouerne others.
