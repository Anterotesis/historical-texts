            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

be fulfilled I declare to you this day. Therefore dear and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Brethren and Sisters, from the highest growth, to the lowest stature in Jesus, let not any consult with flesh and blood, but all in the perfect light and life of Jesus, lift up your heads, that your souls may be inlivened with his quickening vertue, in that eternal hunger which nothing can satisfie, but the Lord of glory in this day of separation, between the precious and the vile, between the true birth and the false birth, as it was in the dayes of old, when they confessed unto him, and followed him beyond the Seas; but when the Lord said, <hi>Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in you;</hi> All that were the false birth, that stood as the high-way ground, stony and thorny ground hearers, foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, that had no oyle in their lamps, they said, <hi>this is an hard sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and who can bear it?</hi> and they went back and left the Lord of Life, and followed no further. Then the Lord said to the children born of the true birth, <hi>will you go away also?</hi> They answered, nay, <hi>thou hast the words of eternal life, and whither shall we go?</hi> Oh dear child, canst thou leave the father that begot thee? or canst thou feed of any thing, but the bread he hath prepared for thee? Though thou maist be beset, and compassed about as Bees with the enemies of thy souls peace, that would hinder thee from walking with thy God, yet can they keep thee from him nay assuredly, thou hangest upon him, as a child upon a father. Though thou be as a little babe, thou abhors all things that would hinder thee from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord: Thou saith of thy riches of this world, thou shalt be no snare to me, and to the tender Wife, weep not for me, give me up, for I must forsake thee when the Lord requires me, neither regards the cries and tears of the mournful children, thou comfortest them in what thou maist, but thou freely leaves them for the glory of thy God; and thus is it with Wife concerning tender Husband, and children concerning their dear Parents, in this day of rending one from another. Assuredly I cannot but commiserate your condition, and sympathize with you, being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the earnings of bowels, whilst I have been drinking this cup for many years. And now, Oh ye Babes, born of the royal birth, you are the chosen jewels, let no care be upon your hearts for any thing in this world, for you seeking Gods Kingdom, and the righteousness thereof, you shall have all satisfaction in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
