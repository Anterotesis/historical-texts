            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Word of Advice to the City of LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON, and to the whole Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the Armies intentions and actions by him who is a lover of Righteouſneſſe and Peace, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a member of the Army; very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conſiderable.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>H the Citie of London, and the Kingdome of England! What mercies haſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, or rather, what mercy have you not both abused: How may thy freinds and true lovers ſtand weeping over thee, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh the great metropolitaine Citie, the Kingdome of England, hadſt thou known the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eies, I ſay, hadſt thou known, thou hadſt not neceſſitated an Armie, (which generally hath uſed to be furtheſt from Righteouſneſſe, Juſtice and equitie) to doe that for thee which thou thy ſelf ſhouldeſt have looked after: oh thou great Citie, thy ſinnes are many, thy provocations great, thy temptations increaſing within thee, to oppoſe thine own good, thine own peace.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall tell thee, that the Armies intentions, art and their actions will be for thine and the Kingdomes good, peace, welfare, be you but paſſive, ſeeing that through your neglect, if not contrary activeneſſe, you have compelled them to be active; they intend not your trouble, impoveriſhing, or ruine: but firſt, that Juſtice may be impartially adminiſtred without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, without which they judge there can be no eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment either of righteouſneſſe or true and laſting peace, that which your ſelves long after, and be yee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, its not the plunder of your City, nor the decay or decreaſe of your trade that is intended: but rather that you might be ſettled in a more free way of liberty in your tradings,</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:162458:3"/>
            <p>Secondly, That this way be effected, <hi>viz.</hi> the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, they intend onely to queſtion thoſe both in Parliament and City, which have been the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of it, that ſo they may be expunged from any farther power, in betraying their truſt, as of late, in whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling round ſo faſt into an unitie with thoſe whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they oppoſed, as the great occaſioners of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and miſeries.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That by this means the Juſtice of God may be taken off the Kingdome, which is not like to be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till juſtice be executed; for God is a juſt God and will make inquiſition for blood; and blood cryeth for blood, and its far better juſtice take hold of a few, if God ſo pleaſe, then of many thouſands as muſt be expected, if juſtice be not executed; for believe it, the way of the Treatie is the high way of ruine even to thoſe who cry it up, work it and manage it, and you will finde the Army to be in the hands of God, your ſaviours in delivering you from it. This is that others ſee, although you ſee it not: and that which you cry up as the onely way of Peace and Libertie, others ſee it to be the high way of bondage and ruine; give them therefore Libertie to ſave you with feare pulling you out of the fire, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That they might once ſee this poore bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying Kingdome delivered from its oppreſſions and burdens, and eſtabliſhed in its juſt Rights and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; and this is that which God will effect, whatever ſhall ſay him nay, although at preſent to many, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie ſeems worſe then the diſeaſe, yet the end ſhall be glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps you will ſay, this is that which belongs to the Parliament and we are to look to them; and to acquies in what they doe, they being choſen for that end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, it properly belongs to them indeed, but they betraying their truſt in making peace with men of blood, contrary to Law and Religion, contrary to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162458:3"/>Law of Nature or of God; they are to be queſtioned by thoſe for whom they are imployed: For if we will allow of Arbitrary Will and Power in the Parliament, as good in the King; as good an unlimitted power were in the hands of one, as of many; for this is a truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by all, that the Parliament are ſervants of State un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the People, and I hope the ſervant may be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by his Maſter if he betray his Truſt and that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully too, as a great part of this Parliament hath done, in Voting and carrying on a Treaty of Peace with the Enemies of Peace, and that not onely ignorantly but wilfully, contrary to the mindes of thoſe who truſted them, as appears in their rejecting of all Petitions from all Counties who Petitioned them the contrary: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in their not freeing the Kingdome from burdens, but rather increaſing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But thoſe Petitions came not from the major party in the City and Counties to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, for the major party are ſuch as have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed their intereſt in the Parliament, in fighting againſt them, and are not to have any Vote in the choice of them; and ſo are not to be looked upon as within the liberty of propounding grievances, or judging the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe whoſe ruine they have ſo long d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſired: they are capable to receive government from them, but not govern or vote in governing; therefore the Parliament is proper to the honeſt wel affected party that have ſtood by them and with them in all difficulties, and they it is, who are ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led to have an eye to their Parliaments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and they it is who have Petitioned their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment time after time, but could not be heard; and now their eyes are greatly upon the Army, waiting what God will doe by the Army for them, the Army being the Kingdomes ſervants as well as the Parliament, the Army being in the hands of God, the only viſible power in and of the Kingdome, by whom the enemy is ſubdued, upon whom the eyes of all thoſe who expect Righteouſneſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162458:4"/>and Juſtice are for the accompliſhment of it; and therefore I muſt tell you that if the Army ſhould altogether be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, they ſhould likewiſe be perfideous and traytors to that truſt repoſed in them, betraying both the Lives and Liberties of themſelves and friends into the hands of implacable and murtherous men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that the Army is very tender of a Parliamentary power and intend not to act things themſelves, but to ſee thoſe who have betrayed their truſt purged forth, that ſo there may be a free courſe of Juſtice in a lawfull Parliamentary way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But its reported that the Army are Levellers, and intend to make all things common.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its very falſe and untrue raiſed by thoſe who are enemies to truth and peace, its true they deſire to levell all powers which are contrary to and againſt God: and this is that aſſure your ſelves the great God will beare them out in, for its God indeed who is the great leveller both within and without his people; and who art thou O great mountaine that will ſtand up before him, thou ſhalt be made plaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But there is not unity in the Army in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they are much divided amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is likewiſe an untruth, for God hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down a mighty ſpirit of unity and courage amongſt them that as one man they are united for the common good, and this I muſt tell you likewiſe that God hath not only given them that ſpirit of unity but a ſpirit of prayer and faith likewiſe, beleeving a deliverance before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage they are in good earneſt, a praying, a beleeving peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore I ſhall now proceed to a word of advice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you and that firſt be adviſed how you entertaine thoughts of oppoſition &amp; ſo of the beginning of another Warr in England, and that for theſe reaſons firſt before if you oppoſe you will have the great God againſt you: ſecond, then be ſure you ſhal fal before him for he is able, and will daſh you to peices like a potters veſſell, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162458:4"/>multitudes nor tumults can ſave before him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 According to principles of reaſon, you of all people in the Kingdome declare your folly and weakneſſe: if you ſhould begin a tumult, for be ſure if ever you ſtrike ſtroke you are undone; if not by the Army, yet have you not ſo much wiſdome as to fore; ſee that there are thoſe amongſt your ſelves who waite for a pray to be inriched in your fall; O London, London, doſt thou not yet know what belongs to thy peace; ſhall it be hid from thine eyes or wilt thou not doe good, nor ſuffer good to be done, mine eye and my heart pittieth thee, if thou wilt worke out thine own ruine,</p>
            <p n="3">3 And be you therefore adviſed as you tender the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Perſons, Eſtates, Trading, the Peace of the Kingdome, the honour of the great Jehovah that you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not his worke in hand, leſt you periſh in your way, for who is he that ſhall ſtand before him; I muſt tell you that God hath a diſpenſation of righteouſneſſe to bring forth in the worke and he will effect it though all the world ſay-him nay; and he will make his people his batle and weapon of Warr, by whom he will breake all that ſhall oppoſe him; have you not ſeene God breaking to pieces great and mighty powers by them, O when will you ſee that its God fights our batles for us and delivers enemies into our hands; take heed how you are found fighters againſt God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Conſider you have for the moſt part all the godly people in this Kingdome, as one in this act, and as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, if you oppoſe and they are the great intereſt of the Kingdome; for firſt, they are a praying people, ſecondly, they are a beleeving people: thirdly they are made a couragious fighting people, and then with them you will have their God and Father to be againſt you, in a word you will have all the powers of Heaven againſt you, and nothing but the powers of darkneſſe and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be for you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And finally be you ſure to periſh in any deſigne you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162458:5"/>undertake againſt them for there is neither polliſie nor power againſt them, God undermines it all and brings it to nothing Faith is given in already in this particular, and that which I have ſaid to the City, I ſay to the whole Kingdome of England: be not perverſe ſeek not to raiſe new troubles be at the leaſt paſſive, ſuffer good when it commeth for all that oppoſe muſt be led forth with the workers of iniquity into confuſion and miſery: God will puniſh them with aſtoniſhment and madneſſe, and will recompence unto them the fruite of their own waies: thus have I very briefly and that with much bowels and tenderneſſe, given you this word of warning, that if God ſo pleaſe thy ruine may be prevented, but if you will not heare my ſoule ſhall weep in ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for thy pride; yet know that thou haſt had a word of warning from him who foreſees both thy ſin and miſery; and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this thou will be rebellious and oppoſe the work of the great Jehovah, and ſo periſh in thy oppoſition, thy Deſtruction is of thy ſelfe and thy Judgement will be the more juſt: hearken not to flatterers neither flatter thy ſelf, it will be to late to repent when the judgement is paſt: conſider that thou thy ſelfe by thy clamourous petitions to the Parliament, haſt been the cauſe of this approaching ſtorme, add not therefore ſin to ſin, but repent and amend looke not at diſhonour in thy ſubmitting, beter be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in receiving good then honourable in oppoſing it: better be diſhonourable in being paſſive in receaving them: to loſe al in oppoſing, and your greateſt honor now at leaſt will be to conquer luſt and pride; before you are conquered for your pride, you know what ſad doomes have been paſt upon you by many, I cannot yet ſay that is paſt upon you by God; I deſire the Lord to deliver you from that fiery deſtruction threatened, therefore have I written that you might be prevented from working out your one ruine that ſo you might have peace</p>
