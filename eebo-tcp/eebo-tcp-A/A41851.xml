            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By which brief Description of their manner of seating themselves in that Wildernesse, Your Lordship may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that their very manner of Planting themselves, hath caused them hitherto to rob God in a great measure of that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship and Service, which as a Homage due to his great name, he requires to be constantly paid to him, at the times appointed for it, in the publick Congregations of his people in his House of Prayer.</p>

            <p>This Sacriledge I judge to be the prime Cause of their long languishing improsperous condition, for it puts them under the Curse of God, according to that of <hi>Malachy</hi> 3.9. <hi>Ye are cursed with a Curse, because ye have robbed me.</hi> Which Curse we find executed upon the Jews, after such a manner, as any observing Person that knows <hi>Virginia,</hi> need not doubt to conclude, that it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God was executed upon the Jews, for the same Sacriledge <hi>Virginia's</hi> Planters are guilty of, the same Sin of robbing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lusion therefore is, that their great Sin of Sacriledge, for which the Curse of God was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and executed vpon them, was, that they robbed God of his publick Worship and Service in his Hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er they rob God any of these wayes, the Sin hath the same stamp of Sacriledge, and therefore the same Curse attending it. But long experience hath ascertained, and the before described manner of their Planting makes it evident, that whilest our Planters in <hi>Virginia</hi> continue as at this day, dispersedly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of Prayer. Which is the same Sin the Jews were Cursed for, and must needs put them under the same Curse of God.</p>
            <p>But though this be the saddest Consequent of their dispersed manner of Planting themselves (for what Misery can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to live under the Curse of God?) yet this hath a very sad Train of Attendants which are likewise consequents of their scatter'd Planting. For, hence is the great want of Christian Neighbourhood, of brotherly admonition, of holy Examples of religious Persons, of the Comfort of theirs, and their Ministers Administrations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These things considered, men may wonder why the attempts made by the fore-mentioned Honourable Governours to reduce <hi>Virginia's</hi> Planters into Towns did never succeed, and perhaps it may be hard for any that never lived among them rightly to conjecture. But the truth in plain <hi>English</hi> is this,</p>
            <p>Whatsoever is of publick concernment in <hi>Virginia,</hi> is determined by their Grand Assemblies, which are usually held once a year, and consist of Governour and Councell, which make the upper house, and the Burgesses which represent the People, and make the lower house, and are chosen out of every County by the People, after the manner that Burgesses are chosen for Parliaments in <hi>England,</hi> and are more or fewer according as the People agree, who are to defray their charges<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Whatsoever passes into an Act of Assembly, must be agree'd upon by the Major part of Burgesses, and these are usually such as went over Servants thither, and though by time and industry, they may have attained competent Estates; yet by reason of their poor and mean education they are unskilful in judging of a good Estate either of Church or Common-wealth, or of the means of procuring it. No marvell therefore, if the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100355:13"/>
best proposals, which have been made to such persons, for reducing them into Towns, offending in the least against their present private worldly interest (though never so promising for the future) have been from time to time bandied against by such Major parts of their Burgesses, and the fewer wise heads over-voted by them.</p>
            <p>And if at any time it hath so happened, that the Major part of the Burgesses have been so meetly qualified and tempered, as to enact any thing tending to such a publique good; The following Assemblies have usually repealed it. The consideration of which, is the true ground of the whole third Proposition: of the Contents of which and the rest, if Your Lordship shall become the blessed procurer. The forlorne Church which is now scattered in desolate Places of that wildernesse, without any comlinesse, which should make her desired, and sought after, may (through Gods blessing) in a few years, gain such beauty, wealth, and ornament, as may either enable her to nurse up Children of her own, to become her servants in the Gospel, or allure Strangers to court her for the Favour, and if it shall please God to prolong your Honourable dayes, till you shall hear of the promised blessed fruits of your labour of love and charity for that poor Church, (which God grant in mercy for his name and Churches sake) what ravishing joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will affect your pious and charitable heart, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate at this distance, the Glory of the Communion of Saints, in their united holy Societies and Assemblies; the constant beauty of their publique Worship; of their holy Sacrifices of prayers and praises offered in a comely order in their publique congregations.</p>
            <p>To contemplate the poor Church (whose plants now grow wilde in that Wildernesse) become like a garden enclosed, like a Vineyard fenced, and watch'd like a flock of Sheep with their Lambes safely folded by night, and fed by day; all which are the promised fruits of well ordered Towns, under Religious Pastours and Magistrates, with what joy, and delight may you likewise think upon their comely and most ingenious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100355:14"/>
Children, like hopefull plants growing up in Nurseries of learning and piety, and when their time of fruit is come, Transplanted into the enclosed gardens of God, and becoming fruitfull and usefull trees of righteousnesse; which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised happinesse and benefit of well ordered Schooles, in well governed Towns.</p>
            <p>And lastly, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t rejoycing will it be to your most Christian heart, to behold the glorious issue of that Prophecy, concerning the calling the Gentiles fulfilled in those numerous herds of Heathen in <hi>Virginia.</hi> Isa. 11.6. &amp;c. <hi>The Wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe, the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid, &amp;c.</hi> To contemplate the Heathen, who in that Prophesie are likened to Wolves, Leopards, Lyons, Bears, Apes, and Cockatrices; couching quietly &amp; harmlesly in the same fold of Christs Church with the Sheep and Lambes of Christ, which will be the hopeful Consequent of well ordered Towns and Schooles. And the procuring these, the only true effectual Remedy for <hi>Virginia's</hi> Disease, as hath been shewed.</p>
            <p>But this is a Work of time to compasse; and we have an <hi>English</hi> Proverb, <hi>Whilst the grasse growes, the Steed Starves,</hi> before this can be compassed, many poor Christians there, may p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The encouragement therefore of Ministers to adventure thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to help them, I humbly propound,
<list>
                  <item>First, That your Lordship be pleased to procure, that the next grand Assembly in <hi>Virgin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a</hi> may enact. That what <hi>Tobacco</hi> any Parish agrees to pay their Minister, shall be payed of the best <hi>Tobacco</hi> of every Mans own Crop, and with Cask, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise experience hath shewed, that a Ministers livelyhood there will be very uncertain.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t at the same Assembly it be Enacted, that every Parish chuse a Vestry (in case they have not one already chosen) and the Vestry of each Parish be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to subscribe what quantity of Corn and Tobacco
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100355:14"/>
of the best of their own Crops, with Cask, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a sufficient Minister yearly.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, That in the next and every Assembly, the Act for paying 15 <hi>l.</hi> of Tobacco <hi>per annum,</hi> for every Tyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able person, in every Parish destitute of a Minister (which Act was made at an Assembly <hi>March</hi> 27. 1656.) be carefully executed, and strict Enquiry made, whether the Tobacco due by that Act, be duely collected, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ends express'd in that Act, <hi>viz.</hi> Building Churches, purchasing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>leabes, and stocks of Cattel to belong to them. And if any Parish hath imployed any part of such Arrears to any other use, that they be enjoyned to make them good again.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, That the Act made in the same Assembly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning disposing intestate estates to publick uses, in case no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministratour of Kin to the diseased Proprietour appears) may serve in the first place the needs of the Church, for furnishing each Parish with Gleabes, and the Gleabes with Stocks of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, before any part of such estates be employed to any other use.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, that there being divers persons already in the Colony fit to serve the Church in the office of Deacon, a Bishop be sent over, so soon as there shall be a City for his See, as for other Needs of that Church, so also, that after due Probation and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xamination, such persons may be ordained Deacons, and their Duty and Service be appointed by the Bishop.</item>
                  <item>Sixthly, That the Ministers that go thither, be not hired by the year, as is now usual, but firmly instituted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into Livings of stated value by the Subscriptions of their Vestries, according to the second Proposition.</item>
                  <item>Seventhly, That all Ministers desirous to go to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and not able to transport themselves, be acquainted with an Act of Assembly of that Country, whereby it is provided, that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oever sufficient Minister, shall not be able to pay for his transportation, any Merchant that shall defray the charge of it (if such Minister agree not with him upon other conditions)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100355:15"/>
shall receive 20 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> for his passage, from the Parish that entertains him, or two Thousand pound of Tobacco, who shall also repay any Sums of money disburs'd for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and the Minister to be free to choose his Parish, which shall make such disbursements for him.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This is all I can think meet to propound at present, only for a Conclusion I shall add for the Encouragement both of Bishop and Ministers, that shall adventure thither out of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to the souls of so many of their poor Brethren, that as their reward will be great in Heaven, so also, they shall (in a very pleasant and fruitful Land) meet with a People, which generally bear a great love and respect to their Ministers; And (if they behave themselves as becommeth their high calling) they shall find their ready help, and assistance in their Needs; and (which should be much more encouraging) they will find a People, which generally bear a great love to the stated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her Government and publick Worship; which gave us (who went thither under the late Persecutions of it) the advantage of Liberty to use it constantly among them, after the Naval force had reduced that Colony under the power (but never to the obedience) of the Usurpers.</p>
            <p>Which Liberty we could not have enjoyed, had not the People generally express'd a great Love to it. And I hope even this will be a consideration (not of least regard) to move Your Lordship to use all possible care and endevour to supply <hi>Virginia's</hi> Needs with sufficient Orthodoxe Ministers, in the first place, and before any other of our forraign Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which crave your help, because in the late times of our Churches Persecution, her people alone, cheerfully and joyfully embraced, encouraged, and maintained the Orthodoxe Ministers that went over to them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Conformity to the Church of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> in her Doctrine and stated manner of Publick Worship.</p>
