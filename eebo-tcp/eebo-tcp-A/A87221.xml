            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>It is humbly propoſed on the behalf of the PURCHASERS OF <hi>BISHOPS,</hi> and <hi>DEANS</hi> and <hi>CHAPTERS</hi> Lands.</head>
            <p>WHereas his late MAJESTY of bleſſed memory, in his Conceſſions upon the Treaty at the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> did grant, That the Purchaſers of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lands ſhould hold the ſame for 99 years; and did alſo declare his Judgement and Condeſcention for the alienating Deans and Chapters Lands in Fee, for ſuch uſes as ſhould be afterwards reſolved on:</p>
            <p>It is humbly propoſed, That the Purchaſers of the ſaid Lands reſpectively, may hold the ſame for 99 years, paying one fourth part of the firſt Purchaſe-money; or to be confirmed to them in Fee, paying one third part of the ſaid purchaſe-money; one Moiety thereof within two moneths after an Act of Parliament ſhall be paſs'd for that purpoſe; and the other Moiety within ſix moneths then next following: which is conceived will amount to about ſix hundred thouſand pounds, for that the ſaid Lands were ſold for about three and twenty hundred thouſand pounds; and paying a twentieth part of the preſent improved Rent to his MAJESTY, or ſuch other uſe as by Act of Parliament ſhall be appointed; which, with the Remainder of the Poſſeſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold, will raiſe a greater yearly Rent then formerly.</p>
            <p>Hereby, a conſiderable ſum of money for his MAJESTIES ſervice, will be ſpeedily raiſed; the Kingdom ſo much eaſed, and diſcharged of ſo great a debt as three and twenty hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, for which the ſaid Lands were ſold; the Honour of Parliaments, and the Publick Faith given for the ſame, repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as great a Revenue as formerly to his MAJESTY, or the Church, continued; the Purchaſers ſatisfied, their Poſſeſſions quieted; Induſtry and Improvements encouraged; no Sales, Settlements or Securities diſturbed, and infinite Suits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
