            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Play, and the unknown Author, possibly both of 'em wanting merit enough to appear in full Glory, <hi>viz.</hi> with an <hi>I. Dryden,</hi> in Heroicks, <hi>in laudem Autoris</hi>; however, not to thrust it naked into the World without some Garniture, I shall treat my Reader with a short Anatomy Lecture upon a late notoriously famous piece of Rhime, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Encomium upon the Tragedy call'd <hi>Heroick Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first, I must desire the Honourable Author of that Ingenious Play, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, here's not the least Reflection designed to a Person of his high Quality: No, though with all the natural Confidence of a Player, I am not arrived to the Impudence of a superannuated <hi>Laureat</hi>; that, (as far as his toothless snarle can bite) spares neither <hi>Honour</hi> nor <hi>Quality,</hi> but upon occasion can make even <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of <hi>Crown'd Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Posthumus Offspring of <hi>I. Dryden,</hi> late <abbr>Esq</abbr> (for so I may venture to call it, his Gasping Muse being almost defunct) is all its Daddies own true Begotten, as the very Features and Lineaments will plainly shew; being a true <hi>Dryden</hi> Composition, in all his own celebrated perfections of <hi>Pride, Fawning,</hi> and <hi>Scandal.</hi> This Poem, though designed a Caress to the Honourable Author, however, makes the top Compliment at home; the main flourish upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: when with his own long and laudable Vanity, all true <hi>Drydenism,</hi> he gives the Reader to understand, That <hi>I. Dryden</hi> is the very Father of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Sourse, Fountain, and Original of Poetry, nay, the <hi>Apollo</hi> himself; when all the Address he has to make this Ingenious and Honourable Author, is, the Resignation of his own Lawrels.</p>
            <p>But here, I am afraid, he makes him but a course Compliment, when this great Wit, with his Treacherous Memory, forgets, that he had given away his Lawrels upon Record, no less than twice before, <hi>viz.</hi> once to Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> and another time to Mr. <hi>Southern.</hi> Prithee old <hi>Oed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>For what your Conscience cannot blame you?</l>
                  <l>It was a fatal Curiosity, 'tis true,</l>

                  <l>'Twas not well done, excuse it not, <hi>Arapsia</hi>:</l>
                  <l>'Twas Disobedience was the cause of it:</l>
                  <l>My cruel Husband left my Bed, thou know'st,</l>
                  <l>For several Years before; and Heav'n can witness,</l>
                  <l>'Twas not for any Fault by me committed:</l>
                  <l>I always was a very humble Wife;</l>
                  <l>I lov'd him still, for all his great Unkindness,</l>
                  <l>And try'd all Ways to gain his Heart again,</l>
                  <l>But 'twas in vain: then you propos'd the way</l>
                  <l>You thought would do, and that, alas! undid me.</l>
                  <l>I strove to charm him in another's room,</l>
                  <l>While Night and Darkness favour'd my Design,</l>
                  <l>But little thought I entertain'd another.</l>
                  <l>Curs'd be the Day, the Night, I sought that Remedy:</l>
                  <l>Why hinder'd I the Pleasures of my Husband,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58044:5"/>When 'twas not in my power to give him any?</l>
                  <l>He us'd me like a dear and only Friend,</l>
                  <l>I wanted nothing but a wanton Love:</l>
                  <l>I ought t' have been like him, so much himself,</l>

                  <p>Come, my Dear, methinks I can't call you Aunt, you look so charming, I'm sure you don't look like my Uncle's Wife; What could possess you, with all your Youth and Beauty, to marry my old covetous nasty Uncle?</p>

                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>The Devil, I think: wou'd I had been hang'd when I entertain'd but the least thought of him; but I had taken it into my Fancy, that an old man would be so fond of me, but now you see how he uses me.</p>

                  <speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
                  <p>Why there 'tis now; had not you better have follow'd the dictates of Nature, which, I am sure, never inclin'd a Woman of eighteen to an old fellow of fourscore? But what has he done to provoke you so this morning?</p>

                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>Why Cousin, I went into the Garden to gather a Nosegay, and stooping down, I found a piece of Paper, and having little else to do, I walk'd on, and tore it bit and bit; he follow'd me as fast as his old limping Legs could carry him, and has taken a conceit, that it was a Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-deux sent to me, or hid in some Bush in the Garden; and, thank my Stars, he's now breaking his Back with looking under every Leaf that can but hide the bigness of a Cockleshell.</p>

                  <speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
                  <p>Methinks this Adventure should make you forgive the Occasion that is his Jealousie, since I think he has chosen a Punishment as bad as any one could wish him, considering his Years.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>There's nothing bad enough for him. Well, I will rail so much when I see him, I'll make him hate me so, he shall let me alone to do what I will.</p>

                  <speaker>Cleon.</speaker>
                  <p>Have a care what you do, for since you are truly virtuous, you would be thought so; and, I dare say, your Discretion tells you, this is not the way to keep up that Character, by provoking him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose both himself and you.</p>

                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>Why what would you have me do? Have you seen in your Life but the least sign of Fault in me? Have I given him but the least cause for Distrust? therefore I here resolve to take my own way, and at least to make my self merry with my Misfortune; I'll be as imperious as a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Woman that has been faulty her self before Marriage, and just come
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58044:6"/>
to the honour of the title of Wife; I will give him more false Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to believe I abuse him, than a City Wife can give her Husband true ones: therefore, dear Cousin, aid and assist me in this honest Design, for you shall know all my Intrigues so, that you may justifie me when it is gone far enough.</p>

so much beneath him: He kept it from his Father's Knowledge as long as he could, but now he knows it, he grows careless, and gives his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on greater Liberty: I wish she could find some way that might answer her Ends, and divert him, if possible.</p>

                  <p>Sir, she is a Foundling, my Mother going into the Country for a little Air, just before my Father dy'd, found this young creature thrust out by an unnatural Parent into the World, laid in a little Cradle, with a Note writ on't, I think these were the words:
<q>
                        <l>A wretched Birth has been thy Doom,</l>
                        <l>Do thou prevent the Il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>'s to come.</l>
                     </q>
My Father died before my Mother did return, but when she came, she brought the little Creature with her, and she did prove to me a good Companion, I was not above three or four Years older: my Mother took great care of her, and scarce did make a difference 'twixt us in any thing. Truly I think she wants nothing but the addition of Birth and Fortune to make her compleat in all things; she has a sweet Disposition, discreet to a wonder for one of her Years, and is Mistress of all Qualifications that belong to a Woman of Quality, and I often believe her such. — Oh madam! I see my Uncle; now let's see what you'l do.

                  <p>Really Captain, let him think what he will, it will never turn to your advantage with me; therefore let me entreat you to be good-natur'd, and not help to make my life more uneasie than it is.</p>

                  <p>And you wou'd really have me go? I know you'll say so, but I know your Sex too well to believe you, this seeming aversion you Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men use to try your Power as you call it, 'tis a foolish Policy in your Condition, for whilst you are keeping off, in expectation of more pains taking on my side to Court you, the end of my Courtship will be quite blown up; your Husband will be here, and prevent the bewitching an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of I'll see you another time, and convince you, you are deceived, ever to believe I can be prevail'd upon, and then tell me the Dear Place, consider you have but a little time, and come to this kind answer; and suppose I have said all you could ever expect from the most true sincere Adoter you can ever have.</p>

                  <p>So, Sir, I am very much obliged to you, for your good opinion, but assure your self, you will meet with no such kind answer from me, therefore pray leave me before you force me to use you worse than will be proper for me to do, or you to receive.</p>

                  <p>And can you have so much of Folly, and so little of the Woman, really to refuse the Love of a young Fellow, and have such a wretched old nasty Husband, gad, well thought on, now I think on't, you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to me for making love to you; for no body but I would accept of you after such a Monster.</p>

                  <p>And will you really hold this Opinion, that you are obliged to value that thing called a Husband? then now hear me, and see what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect your Justice will be. I will Torment you wherever you go, Plague you with Letters, throw them into your Window, if you wont receive them, you shall not dare to peep abroad, but you shall meet some-body or other, that shall solicit you in my behalf, and if all the ways which I can think on take no effect, I'll to the last Revenge of a disappointed Lover, Swear I have had all I wish'd to have, report it so privately publick, it shall be one of the greatest Secrets was ever known by the whole Town, and at last it will infallably come to your Husbands ear, and then you know what follows.</p>

                  <p>To answer your good-natur'd threat, know, that there is no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret you mean to render, but shall be privately publick before-hand: and for my Husband, perhaps I shou'd be glad he really believed what you threaten, but to let you see how much you mistake the way to gain any thing with me; know, that it is to make my self easie, I condescend to be uneasie. 'Tis something mystical I confess, as most Women are, but my real design, time will best explain. So, Sir, I hope I have convinced you, how little to the purpose all your Revenge will be, and take my leave. Your Servant.

The Women make themselves too cheap to be valued, and the easiness of the worst of 'em makes the best not minded, If I thought I cou'd not easily compass this business, it would make me wonderful diligent: well, I have a mind to try her, and if I find
