            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And because I found some strong impressions in you, that if the <hi>Treaty</hi> came not to a fortunate end, and that some <hi>manifest</hi> were not published in His Majesties name, to satisfie the Subject in the carriage of it, the blame thereof was likely to be cast upon His Majesty, as if he had no thoughts nor intents of <hi>Peace:</hi> I sent you <hi>the Collection of all the particular papers that passed between His Majesty and the Committee</hi> here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> assoone as it came off the Presse, wherein my care to give you satisfaction was so great &amp; urgent, that I would not stay the comming of the common Foot-post.

            <p>What is this but to keepe all still in their owne hands? for surely if you were to name a man for any place, and I approve him, I could weary and necessitate you to name such a one that depended on me, not you.</p>

               </hi> of this Kingdome out of the King into the two Houses? for both which you cannot but know, (and His Majesty often cals upon them for it) they have not the least pretence of Law. If this be said that it is desired but for three yeers; that is sufficient argument: to shew it is a new thing they pretend to. 'Pray, who thinkes that they who can doe all this without any right or president, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such a title to it, will not find Jealousies enoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47813:17"/>
Nor did they thinke so themselves when they askt a <hi>Parliament</hi> every three yeeres, they should have pretended to one alwayes. But as the best reason to ans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er this, Why should the King (to whom all making <hi>Warre</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> belongs; and if others had not invaded this right, we had beene still in peace) divest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of this power, since this power in this Kingdome vvas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any person single, or representative body of all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, saving himselfe and Predecessors? What will this effect, but the continuance of the misery we now groan under? for if the Houses can now vvithout the Kings authroty make this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Warre</hi> betwixt Subject and Subject, and put those heavy loads on all fellow Subjects that will not comply, as that their persons may be imprisoned, nay slaine; their goods plundered, thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> estates sequestred, nay, given away; (if more could be) vvhat might vve not expect, when they had a pretence of interest and power in disposing the Armes of this Kingdome? And doe they not use us as the King, say, they fight for Him, when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hoot to slay Him; say, it is for the good of the Kingdome, when authority is given to plunder all mens estates they will call ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant? and when neither Country nor person that would be a neutrall, (which I know not how they can answer in Law to the King) can be admitted by them by Law, to shew why he is not bound to contribute to their Assessements.</p>
            <p>I promised you, I would not say much of my owne: and you see that few Articles are treated, therefore I vvill not exceed them: this onely I'le tell you, that if these tvvo Articles vvere granted as desired, I knovv not vvhy they might not; nay, I feare they vvou'd presently force the King to the other 17. So little they had left in him to defend himselfe: for how could I that by Law am now bound to attend him in his Warres, stay with him when a new Law said he could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eavy no force but with such a consent? Consider therefore his Answer to the 19 Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: his Answers to these particulars in this Treaty; and see, whether he make not the rule of all his Actions, Law, and Right; they feares and jelousies? by the one you may measure any thing, (indeed the Law is but the rule of our publike actions) by the other no man can measure any thing; for to measures feares and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47813:17"/>
jealousies, is as hard a taske, as to take measure of the Moon for a garment: which is ever waxing or declining, never in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine condition.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore with this advice, Remember the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Princes: God requires the strict Allegiance our Lawes enjoyne; The Oathes we have taken, or by nature are bound to observe to him. Feare then God, and honour the King, and have not to doe with those that love change; lest, as you may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to continue our miseries for a time, you make your owne everlasting.</p>
