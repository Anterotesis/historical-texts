            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the vſual maner of the most which publiſh bookes, to dedicate the ſame to ſome honorable perſonage, or to ſome one of ſpeciall place, partly to ſhew thankefulneſſe for ſome receiued fauors, partly to procure credite and countenance to their writings, that vnder ſo good protection, they may the more boldly paſſe forth to the common view of all men. If I now varie from this generall recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued courſe, think not I pray thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that I do it in ſome humour, as if I either affected ſingularitie, or miſliked the common cuſtome: but know for a truth that there are theſe two cauſes of my ſo doing: The firſt is, the obſcuritie of mine owne condition, who liuing here in a remote part, haue wanted either wil, or oportunitie, or both, to ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">The cauſes of writing it.</note>If thou demaund againe, what hath moued me to attempt this? I anſwer in as few words. There are two questions common in the mouthes of many, either ignorant, or il-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons, by which the beautie of Preaching is and hath bene much defaced in the eyes of many not ſo well ſetled: the one is, <hi>What need all this preaching?</hi> the other is, <hi>Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whom to beleeue among theſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers?</hi> Theſe two demaunds were firſt hatched in hell, but ſince being cheriſhed by Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisticall and Popiſh ſpirits,<note place="margin">2.

The giuing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe helliſh interrogatories, as it hath many times exerciſed me in the execution of my publike miniſtery, ſo it hath at this time drawne me to the compiling of this preſent Treatiſe: both that thoſe of theſe parts, who to

On the other ſide, they repute the reſtraint from any of theſe things to be the greateſt thraldome; a miſery it is to be kept within compaſſe, that a man may not ſweare, may not ſpend the Lords day in ſports, or in worldly buſineſſes, or in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling vpon his owne occaſions, that he muſt ſet ſuch a narrow watch before his mouth, as that there ſhould be no filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nor fooliſh talking, nor ieſting: that he ſhould be tied to the continuall hearing of the word, to often receiuing the ſacrament, and the like, this is a miſery of all miſeries, a thing not to be endured: they crie when you tel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things, <hi>This is a hurd ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who can abide it?</hi> and determine as thoſe of whom you ſpake, <hi>Let vs breake their bands, and caſt their cords from vs.</hi> But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue me herin I pray you ſir, is this liberty?

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13 14</note> So the adulterer is a ſlaue to his ſinne, becauſe he is wholly at the commaund thereof, ſtudying how to compaſſe the ſame, and to ſatiſfie his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane deſires to the vttermoſt. The drunkard is a vaſſall to his ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is as it were his buſineſſe, to ſet himſelfe to the committing of it, to get money to beſtow vpon it, to gather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16516:15"/>
that he may haue fellowes in it, to riſe early to follow it, to make his body able to beare it. The couetous perſon is a drudge to his money: for, for it he will do any thing, he will defeate one, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud another, and oppreſſe a third, and grind the fourth, and take vſury of the fift, and rake and wring, and extort, and lie and forſweare, and whatſoeuer elſe for his money. He is ſuch a ſeruant to it, as the Centurions ſeruants were to him: If money ſay to him, Go, he trudgeth by and by: if it ſay Come, it hath him at a becke: if it bid him do this, be it neuer ſo vile, vniuſt or vnlawful, eftſoons he doth it. In like maner the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual gameſter, is as it were in the ſtate of villenage to his humor, he will neglect all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, either of reſt for his body, or of profite for his outward eſtate, or of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for his ſoules good, to fulfill it: for his life (if company be for him) he is not able to forbeare it. In like ſort, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man is in bondage to his blindnes; for bring all the perſwaſions you can againſt it out of the word of God, yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance ſhall ſtill haue the vpper hand, either he will not conceiue you, or he wil
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16516:15"/>
not beleeue you, or he wil not be directed by you. So againe, the ſuperſtitious is in thraldome to his owne peeuiſhneſſe; for let God commaund what he will, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what form of worſhip he thinketh good, yet thus and thus it hath bene ſo long, and ſo it ſhal be, and ſo wil I do for euer. In a word, whoſoeuer ſuffereth himſelfe to be led by the corruption of his owne heart in any thing, without making reſiſtance, without deſiring the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit to withſtand it, whether it be pride, malice, reuenge, or whatſoeuer elſe, the ſame is a ſlaue to his ſinne, a drudge to his owne humor, and the baſeſt creature vnder heauen. Nay he is more ſlauiſh by degrees, then thoſe ſlaues who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vſed in old times (and as they do ſtill in ſome countries) to buy with money, and to vſe at their pleaſure. For there is no ſuch ſlaue, but he keepeth a free mind in a ſeruile eſtate: but men generally being in this moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and wretched thraldome, thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be in the moſt happy eſtate that may be, and haue no will nor diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be freed, but are enemies to the meanes of their deliuery.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16516:21"/>
which you know is nothing to ſpeake of in ſo ſhort an allegation. Firſt of all, they wil neglect preaching now, becauſe they haue liued without it hitherto: as though it were wiſedome for a man in his old or middle age, to refuſe a kindneſſe offered, becauſe in his youth or childhood he had no meanes to enioy it. Had it bene a good reaſon for <hi>Paul,</hi> when Chriſt called him from heauen, to haue ſaid, O ſir it is now too late, I am a man that haue ſpent the beſt part of my time without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thee &amp; of thy religion, &amp; therefore I pray thée trouble me not now, I hope to ſhift out as wel for ſo much of my life as is behind, as I haue done ſo this day?

Secondly they erre in this, in that they account the time of their ignorance to haue bin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, becauſe they neuer ſaw the danger. Alas, litle do they conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſery of thoſe times.<note place="margin">Iohn 12 3.</note> Chriſt ſaith that <hi>he that walketh in the darke,</hi> namely without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bright ſhining light of Gods holy word <hi>knowes not whither he goeth:</hi>

                  </gap>et him be brought back at light of day, it wil make him euen quake to thinke vpon the peril he was in, &amp; wonder that euer he ſhould eſcape it. In like ſort, he that is in the blindneſſe of ignorance without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, the ſame is hourely ready to fall into the pit of hell; yet he feareth it not, becauſe he ſeeth it not: but if euer he haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce by the light of the Goſpel ſhining in his heart, it wil terrifie him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his former miſery, and make his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tremble to conſider it: ſo that here is the ſecond errour in this ignorant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16516:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
A third error there is yet in this excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; that is, that they conſider not how that the refuſall of Gods mercy which is freely offered in the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, doth double their ſinne, and make their condemnation more iuſt by whom it is refuſed.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5 32.</note>

it ſheweth notably what a fond thing it is, not to take notice of the truth reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but to preferre a long continued ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance before it.

                  <hi>Yes ſure: when the multitude heare it taught, that the preaching of the word is a thing of that nature and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vſe, that without it men ordinarily can not be ſaued, they crie out by and by; And what is then become of our forefathers, they had no preaching, yet they were in their times good people, honeſt, and well eſteemed in the places where they liued. If we ſhould then yeeld to this, that this preaching is with ſo reuerent a regard to be depended vpon, we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our progenitors out of whoſe loyns we are come, which to do were more then inhumanitie. I can tell you ſir, this is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that hath a generall approbation,

Whether they were ſaued or no, it is not for vs to enquire: if the Lord haue dealt more mercifully with vs then he did with them, we haue cauſe to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his holy name, to looke to our ſelues that we deſpiſe not the riches of his bountie, and to leaue them to the Lord to whom they ſtand or fall.

there is more in it then indeede there is; do but conſider of it by the like: If a man ſpeaking of huſbandrie, and hearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to diſcourſe of the great ſkill and long experience that is requiſit to make a man a good huſband, ſhould ſay by and by, Tuſh, what talke you ſo much of ſkil and knowledge herein? Why? It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this, to plow, to ſow, and to reape: ſhould not ſuch a one deſeruedly be laughed at, and be a ſcorne to thoſe which heare him? Yes, and not without cauſe: for euery man knoweth, that though this be the ſum of huſbandry, yet there are diuers particulars belonging to theſe, which are neither ſoone learned nor eaſily practiſed: ſo that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be a good huſband, and to profit by his labors, and to make the beſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, muſt not ſatiſfie himſelfe to know this, that there is nothing in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry but to eare the land, and to reape the fruite, but he muſt learne alſo what belongeth to the right performance of theſe, otherwiſe he may erre in ſowing, play the foole in plowing, and come ſhort in reaping.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16516:26"/>
conſiſteth in this, in louing God aboue all, and a mans neighbor as him ſelfe: but what then? If a man ſhall thinke by and by that he is a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and knoweth enough, becauſe he apprehendeth theſe generals, the ſame is exceedingly deceiued, for there are many other branches belonging to each of theſe, which vnleſſe a man do know, he can neither loue God as hée ought, nor his neighbour as hee ſhould: ſo that to my ſeeming, euen common reaſon is ſufficient to conuince mens ignorance herein. There is not the meaneſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the courſeſt trade, the plaineſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, but it hath (as we ſay) a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine myſterie in it, there are many rules belonging to it: which muſt be knowne, not in groſſe onely, but euen very preciſely, before a man can in any mediocritie practiſe the duties of the ſame.</p>

It commonly runneth thus: in former times when there was leſſe preaching, and the Scripture was more geaſon then now it is, the world (they ſay) was much better, there was more loue, more hoſpitalitie, more truth, more mercie, more good dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men then is to be found at this day: ſo that whereas there is now much lawing, much contention, much oppreſſing, much cruelty, and ſinnes of the like nature, al this is layd vpon the backe of preaching: this is the leauen that hath put the whole world out of taſte; this is alſo a peece of Dagon; ſtump.

               <p>I perceiue the Diuell much doubteth the ruine of his kingdome: and therfore though preaching amongſt men is thought to be but wind,<note place="margin">Ierem 5.13.</note> yet he féeleth his ſtate begin to totter with the power of it, ſo that he doeth ſtretch his wit, and ſet his pollicy on worke, and ſpareth for no engines to beat downe that which he ſhal neuer be able to ouerturne. And that as we haue ſeene hitherto, ſo I doubt not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16516:40"/>
but we ſhall further ſée it in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particulars. For thoſe elder times (as men call them) firſt it is to be noted, that it is true indeed that many of thoſe who liued in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were in the eies of men very commendable for thoſe morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (as they are termed) of hoſpitalitie, of bountie, of humanity, of plain dealing, &amp; the like: the reaſon was this, Satan let them alone in theſe things, becauſe he did hold them captiue at his will in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. Though he doth hate theſe ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their owne nature, being an vtter enemie to all goodneſſe, yet he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to giue way in thoſe leſſer things, ſo long as he could nuzle them in ignorance of God and of his word, which he well knew was both hold enough for himſelf, and ſufficient inough alſo to blemiſh and diſgrace all thoſe reputed vertues before God. But now the light of knowledge being come into the world, and ſpreading it ſelf further by the more common vſe of preaching, Sathan ſecretly perſwadeth many, that it is enough for them to haue knowledge, though they neglect practiſe, &amp; he laboreth alſo by killing mens care to ſhew themſelues forward in theſe duties
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16516:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ciuilitie, to leſſen the credit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, &amp; to haue matter of ſlaunder againſt the knowledge of Gods truth. Secondly to ſpeake more ſpecially of this laſt and worſt age of the world: if it be well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, preaching may be ſayd to be the occaſion, though not the naturall cauſe of the extreame wretchedneſſe thereof: according as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, that <hi>ſinne tooke occaſion by the commaundement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.8.9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and when the commaundement came, ſinne reuiued, and grew out of meaſure ſinfull.</hi> Now the preaching &amp; publiſhing of the truth, may be ſayd to be the occaſion of much euill in theſe laſt times, in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: firſt, becauſe of the fuller diſcouery of ſin: In the dayes of former ignorance many of the ſame groſſe ſins were which now are, but either they were ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the darkneſſe of the times, or if they were a litle diſcried, yet they were reputed nothing ſo odious. But <hi>althings when they were reprooued of the light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>became manifeſt; for it is light that maketh all things manifeſt:</hi> ſo that now ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeene more, is thought alſo to be more; for ſinne not eſpied, is in mens iudgements as no ſin. So then partly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16516:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in this reſpect it may be ſaid, that ſince there was ſo much preaching, the world hath bin worſe, becauſe the holy doctrine which is taught, condemneth many things for ſin, which the blind world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed as no ſin, and becauſe the liues of thoſe which are conuerted by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do ſhew more euidently the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſins of thoſe which are giuen ouer to vngodlineſſe. Secondly, the preaching of the word is an occaſion of ſin, (as alſo the law of God is) not in it ſelfe, or in it owne nature; (for it reproueth ſin, and ſetteth it ſelfe againſt all maner of vngodlineſſe:) but it is ſo, partly through the corruption of our nature, partly tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the iuſt iudgment of God: the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature is alwayes the more furious, the more it is reſtrained, ſtriuing ſtill to do that moſt which is moſt forbidden: euery humor deſireth that moſt, whereby it may be moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Let a Phyſitian forbid a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike man ſuch and ſuch meates, he ſhall find himſelfe to haue an appetite to no meate ſo much, as to that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. I do verily think the other trees in Paradiſe affoorded fruite as pleaſant
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16516:41"/>
to the eye, and as good for meate as the forbidden tree: but when as Satan had made a little entry, then euen that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that it was forbidden, did ſet an edge vpon the womans deſire, and made her more faine to eate of that one, then of any of the reſt which were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth that <hi>the law is the ſtrength of ſinne,</hi> both becauſe it encreaſeth the guilt of ſinne, and becauſe ſin thereupon becommeth more outragious: according as <hi>Ieremie</hi> witneſſeth out of his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: <hi>I cried out</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>of wrong,</hi>

Beſides, there are many points of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to be taught, which though they be deliuered with neuer ſo great circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet the leudneſſe of mans heart, not being ouer-ruled by the power of Gods ſpirit, will abuſe the ſame. So we ſee, the doctrine of Iuſtification by faith only, breedeth negligence in good works, as appéereth by the caueat of the Apoſtle, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.1.</note>

So the doctrine of our fréedom by Chriſt from the curſe of the law, bringeth forth carnal libertie: that made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo carefull to vſe that reſtraint, <hi>Only vſe not your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie as an occaſion to the fleſh.</hi>

                  <hi>What exception theſe wiſe men will make againſt this your anſwer, I know not; you haue reſolued me to the full: and concerning yong Miniſters, I heard once an acquaintance of mine, who was brought vp in the Vniuerſitie, ſay, that he knew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſchollers in his time, that when they were yong and freſh, were of very great hope, and were alſo very zealous, and had a good gift in preaching, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in time grew cold, and leſſe able for gifts, both of iudgement and zeale, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance to do good in Gods Church: but theſe points I will not mell with, onely your diſcourſe brought that into my mind
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16516:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which I heard a friend of mine ſay a good while ſince. I muſt craue your iudgement yet a litle further, touching theſe men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides al theſe pretended reaſons, they ſtand much vpon two things, which fleſh and bloud doth well approue of: one is, that few of the great men of the world do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme preaching; the other is, that it is not wiſedome for a man in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be too forward.

In the former there are two things to be noted: firſt, that if the practiſe of men were a ſufficient rule in matters of Religion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16516:60"/>
there are (thankes be to God) many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable perſonages, many nobles, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gentlemen, many of good note for worldly reſpects, who do vnfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and heartily embrace the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods word, and no doubt it is vnto them <hi>the ioy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reioycing of their hearts,</hi>

                  <hi>The power of God vnto ſaluation:</hi> ſo that if the approbation of men were a reaſon of force, it is not wanting vnto preaching: but as God hath a people out of all, ſo that alſo hath friends and fauourers among all. Secondly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this courſe of Preaching were vtterly deſpiſed, and all the great wiſe men of the world did euen ſcorne it, and tread it vnder their feete, yet this were a poore argument, vnleſſe we will ſay, it was a good reaſon which they vſed againſt Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 7.48.</note>

               <p>The calling by the Church, I acknowledge to be ſo neceſſary, that without it (a ſetled forme of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement being eſtabliſhed) no man is to be reputed a lawfull Miniſter, though he be otherwiſe of neuer ſo great ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie. God I know calleth men extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſometimes, as namely, in the firſt founding &amp; planting of the Church: ſo were the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts called: and when the Church of God is defaced, &amp; an vniuerſall Apoſtaſie ſpread ouer it; ſo it is thought they were called who reſtored the ſinceritie of religion, after the long night of Popery.

For the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, this is a cleare caſe, that whereas euery former age hath brought forth ſome one or moe, to the diſturbance of the peace of Gods Church, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of the beſt learned that each time could affoord, all theſe are flowne together into this laſt age as into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſewer. So that there is not any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which the former times knew, and withall condemned to the pit of hell, but this our age hath raked it vp againe, and ſet (as it were) a new gloſſe vpon it, and made it by addition much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Beſides, we haue Popery, which is a fardle of hereſies, and the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of all the reſt. Now for the quality of thoſe which are the patrons thereof, (of Popery eſpecially) it is well knowne that though they haue among them, as it was ſaid of old, many woodden prieſts,<note place="margin">Lignes Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. <hi>Boniface.</hi>

Thirdly, I am as cléere in this, as in any of the two former, that there is no ſuch difficulty in the faculty of reading, which as it is the firſt ſtep to learning, ſo it is of all other things incident to a ſcholler the moſt eaſie. So that, ſeeing to hold opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that an onely reading Miniſter is a ſufficient Miniſter, maketh that calling of all other the moſt eaſie, which in it own nature, as it is deſcribed to vs in the ſcripture, is moſt laborious, requiring ſo ſtudious preparation to it, and ſo great intention &amp; diligence in the performance of it, I muſt needes ſettle my ſelfe vpon this point, &amp; perſwade others alſo to it, that there is more required in a miniſter of the new Teſtament, then to reade the ſcripture, though I ſtill hold that a part of his duty, and (as I haue ſayd before) a matter very behouefull for the ſpirituall benefite of Gods Church.</p>

                  </note>For anſwer to that doubt, firſt this is a true and a receiued rule, that a ſacrament is not to be eſtéemed by the hand of him which adminiſtreth it: neither doeth the dignitie of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer, adde worth to the ſacrament, nor the indignity leſſen the true nature of it. Secondly, he which hath an outward calling by the Church, though happely he be vnworthy and vnméet for the place whereto he is called, yet he is to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as more then a priuate man: and therefore becauſe by the appointment of the Church he ſtandeth in the roome of a right and lawfull Miniſter, if there be no fault in the ſubſtance of the action of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring, the ſacraments are true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, though the party executing that office be not altogether ſo allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Scribes and Phariſées, who were the Doctors of the Iewes, many of them were of other Tribes then of the tribe of Leui, and crept in by corruption and bribery into thoſe places, and were of vnſound iudgement in many things, as many eaſily be gathered by the ſtory of the Goſpell; yet our Sauior willed his Diſciples to heare them, becauſe they

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0.</note> ſtood vpon two things, one was to <hi>put incenſe before the Lords face, and the burnt offering vpon his altar;</hi> therein they were the peoples mouth vnto God: the other was <hi>to teach Iaakob Gods iudgement, and Iſrael his law:</hi> in that they were Gods mouth vnto the people: for this cauſe it was the ordinance of God (according as I noted to you the place in the beginning of this conference) that <hi>the Prieſtslips ſhould preſerue knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2.7</note> 
                  <hi>and they ſhould ſeek the law at his mouth: for</hi> (ſayth the text) <hi>he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoaſts:</hi> that is, one appointed to be the opener and declarer of the will
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16516:79"/>
of God among the people. And leſt any man ſhould thinke, that the law which the people were to ſeeke at the Prieſtes mouth, was nothing but the bare letter and written text of the law, we may remember firſt, that the people had the frée vſe of the law in their priuat houſes,<note place="margin">Deuteron. 6.7.</note> ſo that they had no ſuch neede to ſeeke that at the Prieſts hands. Secondly, that it was the vſe of the Leuites when they did reade in the booke of the law, <hi>to giue the ſenſe alſo, and to cauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to vnderſtand the reading.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nehemiah 8.8.</note> And hence it was, that when our Sauior Chriſt <hi>ſtood vp to reade on the Sabbaoth day,</hi>

Thence alſo was it that <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> being at Antioch vpon a Sabbaoth day, <hi>After the Lecture of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the rulers of the ſynagogue ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> to intreate them,<note place="margin">Acts 13.15.</note> that <hi>if they had

                  <hi>both read and preached euery Saboth day.</hi> Thirdly, this may be noted alſo, that whereas the Lord threatned <hi>to refuſe them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.6</note> 
                  <hi>that they ſhould be no prieſts to him, who had refuſed knowledge:</hi> by that <hi>refuſing of knowledge</hi> is to be vnderſtood both their ignorance in the doctrine of the law, and their negligence to informe the people in it: otherwiſe to thinke that there was nothing reproued in them more, then an vnabilitie to reade the law, were a very groſſe conceit. And thus much to proue that for the times of the old teſtament, none had the allowance of Prieſts, but ſuch as were able to inſtruct. Now for the times of the Goſpell, <hi>S.

                  <hi>that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould liue of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:</hi> none haue any right to <hi>liue of the Goſpell,</hi> that is, of the exhibition and ſalary of the Church, but thoſe <hi>which preach the Goſpell.</hi> If you demand of me what it is to preach the Goſpell, <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall reſolue you in another place; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is this,<note place="margin">1. Timot. 5.17.</note> to <hi>labour in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi> which whether it be not more then to reade the word, I refer it to any mans iudgement. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth, that theſe words require of a Miniſter,<note place="margin">Vt pradicit, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat &amp; concio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur.</note> that he do preach, and teach, and make ſermons: and the old rule of the law, which <hi>Paule</hi> applieth to the purpoſe, requireth ſo much, <hi>Thou ſhal not muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne.</hi> The oxe that is allowed to eate of the corne, is not he onely which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the corne, but which treadeth it out, that worketh it out of the huſkes, that it may be fit for mans vſe.

ignorant perſons: ſecondly, cauillers: and laſtly, iudiciall and carefull hearers. The ignorant are as vncertaine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that which we call the ſcripture, whether it be be the word of God, as they be touching our preaching: they haue no aſſurance of it, but tradition and report, which is a poore certainty, &amp; they haue as good an opinion of the Apocripha books, as of the other which we call cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. Beſides that, it is buzzed into many of our common peoples eares, by whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Papiſts, &amp; it is thereby become ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in many mouthes here in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country that our Bible is no true Bible, and that our tranſlation is iuſtly to be doubted of.

               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed I acknowledge that to be true out of my owne experience: for though by priuate Reading the Scripture as alſo by hearing it read, I haue receiued much comfort: (the memorie of things taught thereby renewed, and the truth of them confirmed) yet I haue often bene quite ſet, often bene altogether miſtaken, and ſtill affraid of my owne iudgement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in plainer places, vntill I haue found the publike expoſition giuen by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16516:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to iumpe and accord with my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But what ſay you to the ſecond reaſon: namely, that in the Scriptures read, we heare the worthie ſermons of Chriſt, of the Prophets, and of his Apoſtles: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reading is Preaching?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Epaph.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay it is a very weake ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. That the ſermons of Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles were excellent ſermons, and that the ſumme &amp; abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them is to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no man goeth about to denie: yet this being granted, will neuer prooue a Reader to be a Preacher. For he is not a Preacher, who reciteth publikely things of another mans inditing, but he which deliuereth matters (though not inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) yet in reſpect of art and induſtrie compiled and framed by himſelf. If it be ſaid, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſermons of Chriſt, &amp;c. though they be not of his framing that readeth them, yet being read may turne to the profite of the people, I anſwer, that the queſtion is not, whether they may be profitable, but whether the reading of them may be called preaching. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any man ſhould denie the publike reading of them to be for the behoofe of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16516:92"/>
Gods people, (I hope you haue not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten what I told you as my iudgment in this caſe) but how it may be ſaid, that he which hath read them to the people, hath performed that office of a Miniſter which we call preaching, neither can I conceiue, neither (as I thinke) is any man able to ſet downe. Beſides, if the word <hi>Sermon,</hi> ſhall be preciſely vrged, that which was the ſermon of Chriſt, or <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> when they liued, and the ſame vttered by them, cannot be now being recorded in the Bible, and read out by another, ſo properly called a Sermon; becauſe in our common ſpeech a Sermon requireth the tongue and voice of him that framed it. And therefore to ſay (as ſome do) that Chriſt or ſome one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets or Apoſtles preacheth to vs, when we heare the ſumme of their ſermons read vnto vs, is but a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kind of ſpéech, vſuall amongſt ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Such as that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.24. Cap. 11.4.</note> that <hi>the bloud of Abel ſpeaketh;</hi> and that <hi>he being dead yet ſpeaketh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.1.3.</note> or which is ſaid of the <hi>heauens and firmament, that there is no ſpeech nor language, where their voice is not heard;</hi> and the like, common in the Scripture.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16516:93"/>
Againe, let the nature and eſtate of thoſe which are called the Sermons of the Prophets, of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles be a litle conſidered. Firſt in generall this is to be knowne, that we haue but the briefe and ſumme, and as it were the heades of their ſermons related in the Scripture: for if al that euery one of theſe ſpake publikely by way of teaching had bene written, we might well ſay as S. Iohn ſaid,<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.25.</note> touching the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as and ſayings of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>the world could not containe the bookes:</hi> and therefore (if profite be deſired) there muſt neceſſarily be ſome courſe taken, by which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things abridged, by the penmen of the holy Ghoſt in their writings, may be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Secondly, the ſermons of Moſes, are ſo interlaced with iudiciall ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ceremoniall rites, appertaining onely to the pollicie of thoſe times, that for the peoples behoofe, it is more then conuenient, that they ſhould enioy the benefite of an able Miniſter, who may informe them herin, what things be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and what be temporarie, what is the ſubſtance of euery ceremoniall ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and what the perpetuall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16516:93"/>
equitie of euery iudiciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Thirdly, touching the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Prophets; though they be full of comfort and abounding with ſweet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, becauſe the maine ſcope and drift of them all, is to foreſhew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and reſtoring of the Church by Chriſt, and though they do alſo notably make knowne the iuſt iudgement of God againſt ſinne; yet they are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with myſticall prophecies, with hidden parables, with hiſtoricall narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deſcriptions of countries, with borowed ſpéeches, and proprieties of that holy language in which they were deliuered: that, howſoeuer ſometimes a lambe (as the prouerbe is) may find a foord eaſily to be waded through, yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be added the helpe and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſome learned <hi>Ezra,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 8. Iob. 33.23.</note> ſome <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,</hi> or <hi>Interpreter,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, and the ſame no ordinarie man,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.17.</note> but (as the text ſpeaketh) <hi>one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> the people cannot poſſibly reape that good which God hath intended in the reuealing of thoſe things. Fourthly, for the ſermons of our Sauiour, as we haue but the very ſhort ſumme of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16516:94"/>
many of them (according as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſo for thoſe which are reported more largely by the Euangeliſts,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.21.</note> I perſwade my ſelfe there is no man, but (if he will ſpeake the truth, out of his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) he will confeſſe, that he learneth more by them when by preaching they are explaned, then when they are onely read vnto him. Fiftly, we haue in the Bible very few copies of the Apoſtles ſermons: thoſe that be, are in the booke of the Acts,<note place="margin">Act. 4.2. Act 1.4.5.12.</note> and yet many times, this is all which is ſaid of them: <hi>they preached in Ieſus the reſurrection from the dead, they went to and fro preaching the word, preached Chriſt, preached the things that concerne the kingdome of God,</hi> and many the like ſpéeches: all which are like vnto the litle <hi>cloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 18.44.</note> which the ſeruant of <hi>Elias</hi> ſaw; which though at the firſt it was but <hi>like a mans hand,</hi> yet at laſt it couered the face of heauen: ſo theſe being clauſes of very few words, yet miniſter iuſt matter of many large diſcourſes, &amp; the ſame alſo very néedfull for the well vnderſtanding of them. If it ſhall be ſaid that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles writings were ſermons, I anſwer, they cannot properly be called their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16516:94"/>
Paul writing to the Romaines, ſaith, that beſides this labour of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.15.</note> he was <hi>readie alſo to preach the Goſpell</hi> vnto them: ſo that he did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his writing to be preaching. The Epiſtles of the Apoſtles were the ſummes of that doctrine which they had taught by word of mouth, and according to the tenour whereof, their deſire was, that the Miniſters of the places to whom they wrote ſhould proceede. I know they were read in the Churches, according as it was méete,<note place="margin">Col. 16.</note> that a matter written to a whole congregation ſhould be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to all in publike: but what then? I doubt not, but the paſtors in the ſeuerall aſſemblies, did (as we now do) preach vpon thoſe Epiſtles, and open and apply them to their auditories: &amp; ſo much may eaſily appeare, as by other places, ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by that ſpeech to the Hebrewes, by the author of the Epiſtle written to them: <hi>I beſeech you alſo brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.22.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuffer the words of exhortation: for I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto you in few words:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caluin and Iunius.</note> which ſpéech (as it is well obſerued by two learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of our later times) the Apoſtle purpoſely vſed, leſt his writing ſhould
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16516:95"/>
be an occaſion to any, of leſſening that due eſtimation, which the ordinarie courſe of preaching did deſerue. It is all one as if the Apoſtle had ſaid: <hi>Brethren, notwithſtanding al this which I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto you, yet I pray you continue your accuſtomed reuerence to the labours of your owne Miniſters: I, as the nature of an Epiſtle requireth, haue written briefly, therefore you ſhall ſtill need the aſſiſtance of your watchfull and learned Ouerſeers, who ſhall enlarge theſe points, which I haue drawne as it were into a narrow roome, and by powerfull exhortations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them either to your comfort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, as their knowledge in your eſtate from time to time ſhall direct them.</hi> This is the meaning of that place, plainely prouing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neceſſitie of ioyning the pains of a preaching Miniſter, with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings &amp; Epiſtles of the Apoſtles of Chriſt Ieſus. And thus haue you my anſwer to this ſecond ſtout reaſon, why reading ſhold be preaching, becauſe forſooth, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to vs the ſumme and ſubſtance of the worthy ſermons which Chriſt, and the Prophets and Apoſtles haue formerly deliuered. The weakneſſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16516:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of which reaſon, I hope this ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, hath made you to perceiue.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For theſe two alleaged reaſons, you haue indifferently ſatisfied me. I do now expect, what you wil ſay, touching the laſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why reading ſhold be preaching.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Epaph.</speaker>
               <p>The third reaſon (as I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber) was, that reading may therefore truly be called preaching, becauſe in our Church the reading of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture is ſo ordered, that firſt, there is a portion of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament read, next of the new, and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome parcell of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epiſtles: which they will haue to be called preaching, becauſe as the new Teſtament is an expoſition of the old, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epiſtles are the applying of both vnto Gods people. This I think, is the third reaſon, that you told me of.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>

               <p>To make a ſhort anſwer to a ſlight reaſon, this is that I ſay: It is true, if we compare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole new Teſtament, with the whole old Teſtament, that the latter is an expoſition of the former, becauſe it maketh knowne vnto vs, that all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

But what then? though this hold in general, that the new Teſtament is the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to the old, and the Epiſtles, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyers of both, yet it will ſcarcely be found to hold in particulars: namely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch a parcell of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new teſtament which cometh in order to be read, is an expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpecial doctrine, and matter of that portion of the old Teſtament, which was read before it, or that that part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, which followeth both, is a direct and expreſſe vrger of both. So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer when we diuide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe thrée parts, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Teſtament, the hiſtory of the Goſpell, &amp; the Epiſtles, it be

true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon nature &amp; ſtate of them, that the ſecond part giueth light vnto the firſt, &amp; the latter raiſeth exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of both, yet when we come to ſingle out theſe parts into ſeuerall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhall not find that preciſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act correſpondence, as that the expoſition of the ſame points, ſhall be ſaid to follow one the other. And this is all which I wil oppoſe to this third reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which though perhaps it may make a ſhew among thoſe that are of leſſe iudgement, yet it can deceiue no man, that hath any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſkill in the ſtate of an argument.</p>

               <p>They ſay, the ouer-commonneſſe of preaching, will breed contempt of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Firſt of all, ſuppoſe it fareth with ſome, in reſpect of preaching, as it did with the vnthankfull Iſraelites,<note place="margin">Num. 11.6.</note> which loathed the Manna, wherwith the Lord ſo miraculouſly fed them in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo they alſo ſeeme to be (as it were) glutted, with the continuall vſe of the word preached: yet this can be no reaſon why a diligent and frequent Preacher ſhould remit any thing of his former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, and ſpeak more ſparingly, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sermons into a ſmaller number, then he was wont. It is truly ſaid, that there are thrée very good mothers, which haue three very bad daughters, and they are theſe: <hi>1.</hi> Truth, which yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world bréedeth hatred. <hi>2.</hi> Peace, a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, and yet through our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it cauſeth Idleneſſe. <hi>3.</hi> Familiarity, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vſe of a good thing, which is notwithſtanding moſtly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Contempt. And yet this is not in the nature of theſe things, but onely in our corruption. For as the nature of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16516:111"/>
God is ſo perfectly good, that he doth turn euen very euill things, into very good things: (as he made the malice of the Iewes, in putting his Sonne to death, to be a meane of our ſaluation) ſo our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo abſolutely euill, that it turneth very good things into euill: as ſometimes <hi>the grace of God into wantonneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iud. 4. Gal. 5.13.</note> and Chriſtian <hi>libertie into an occaſion vnto the fleſh,</hi> &amp; ſo in theſe particulars which I haue named. Now becauſe truth is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hated, ſhall men therefore baniſh it from their ſpeeches, and frame their toungs to flatterie? Becauſe many abuſe the bleſſing of peace, ſhall we therefore voluntarily raiſe tumults, or deſire God to put an end to our happie dayes of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe? There is in the world no reaſon for it. Neither is there any iuſt cauſe, why we ſhould go about to make our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, ſomething more dainty, becauſe it may ſéeme to ſome raw and ill diſpoſed ſtomackes, to breed a kind of fulneſſe and ſatietie. Secondly, if we looke better into it, we ſhall ſee, that the true cauſe of mens contempt of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, is not ſo much the common vſe of it, as the ignorance of the worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16516:112"/>
of it. The Sun, the water, the fire, what things more common, and yet what things leſſe deſpiſed? and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon is, becauſe we all know, we cannot liue without them. Let men be once perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this, that neither the Sunne, nor water, nor fire are more neceſſary for the outward man, then preaching is for the ſoule and ſpirit, and that where it is wanting,<note place="margin">Prou. 29.18.</note> there <hi>the people decay,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they will neuer be cloyed: or at leaſt, if ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie through the in-bred corruption of our nature créepe vpon them, by the remembrance hereof it will quickly be recouered. Thirdly, do but marke, what courſe of preaching it is, which pleaſeth ſome to call ouer-common: namely, a ſetled courſe for euery Sabboth, and it may be ſome wéeke day Lecture, as it is called vſually. Now I would faine ſée, how any man can ſay with reaſon, that this is ouer often. Paule commaundeth to <hi>preach in ſeaſon.</hi>

I know ſir, that in good manners it is now high time to forbeare troubling you any further, yet I would gladly craue your direction in one thing more; and that is this: for mine owne part I thanke God, I both do, and euer (ſince I had any taſt of goodneſſe) hue loued preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, onely I find a great defect in my ſelfe, that I cannot ſo profite by it as I would, and as I ſee many do.

The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of many men, are herein verie ſtrange: ſome ſay that there are ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of opinions among you that be learned, that a common man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not which of you to beleeue: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hold opinion, that it is not for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ordinarie perſons, to take vppon them to iudge of the things they heare; ſo that the reſolution of the greateſt part is, that it is the wiſeſt way
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16516:122"/>
either not to heare, or elſe if for ſatisfying the lawes they muſt heare, yet not to giue credit. Beſides, there are many of vs which heare vſually, and yet are little bettered by it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1 6.</note> 
                  <hi>their knowledge is but <hi>vaine iangling,</hi> and their conuerſation not much differing from the irreligious mulitude: they are like the fiſh in the ſea, which howbeit it liueth in the ſalt water, yet is without all taſt of ſaltneſſe.</hi>

               <p>I muſt néeds commend your good care in this matter: for indeed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer men think, there is nothing ſo ful of danger as is idle and vnprofitable hearing. Thoſe things which are in their owne nature beſt, being ill vſed become moſt hurtfull. Hearing is the ordinance of God to draw vs vnto himſelfe: but being vſed careleſly and vnprofitably, it turneth to our greater condemnation: and therefore you cannot be too carefull

herein. It is true that men pretend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things whereby to ſhift off the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which is required in this behalfe: but their pretences being examined will become lighter then vanitie it ſelfe.

If I ſay, a man pleade thus, what would we thinke of him, but that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16516:123"/>
either he were very fooliſh or very fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? And indéed we might well ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme him, becauſe we know that the fraud of others muſt be preuented rather with care and circumſpection, and not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as an occaſion of abridging a mans ſelfe of neceſſaries. Is not he then as much a foole, who wanting the ſauing knowledge of the truth, and being called vpon to repaire vnto the houſe of God, (which is as it were the Lords market, in which the hid treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge are laid open to the view and offered freely to the vſe of all men) ſhall eftſoones plead the deceiueableneſſe of falſe doctrine, the corruption of many Preachers, the ſhew of ſome contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties among them? Yes verily, for is he to depriue himſelfe of the neceſſarie foode of his ſoule, becauſe it may be for lacke of care, that in ſtead of hoping to be fed, he may be poyſoned? Nay rather, he is to become the more warie, the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in prayer, the more exerciſed in the Scripture, that when he cometh to buy the truth he may not be deceiued.</p>

Mark a litle, and I will ſhew you the reaſon of this rule. Firſt of all, the end why God made all things, was the glorie of his owne name:<note place="margin">Prou. 16.4.</note> the thing eſpecially aymed at by him, in that great and admirable worke the redemption of mankind, and in all the particulars of it, euen from the firſt foundation of it, his eternall electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnto the laſt end hereof, our glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in heauen,<note place="margin">2.

                     </gap>.</note> is: <hi>That no fleſh might glorie in his preſence,</hi> but that <hi>he that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth might glorie in the Lord.</hi> This being then the maine end of all Gods courſes,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16516:127"/>
to kéepe the glorie of al things entire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, it muſt needes be, that that doctrine is the moſt ſound, which doth not admit the leaſt empeachment of Gods glorie. Secondly, one chiefe end of the Scripture is, as to beate down man, and to cleane ſtrippe him of all goodneſſe and inclination thereunto, for the kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Gods glorie whole vnto himſelf, ſo alſo to put gladneſſe into all diſtreſſed hearts,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.12.</note> and to bring the <hi>ioy of ſaluation</hi> to all afflicted ſpirits.<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.8.</note> Dauid ſaith it is one propertie of the word of God to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce the heart:</hi> and Paul affirmeth that the drift of all the Scripture is,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note>

                  </note> Others (as the Papiſts) ſay, that to the iuſtifying of a ſinner before God, two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, remiſſion of ſinnes, and the habit of inward righteouſneſſe, that is to ſay, charitie with the fruites thereof. So that we exclude, they eſtabliſh the merit of mans works. Well then, in this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of opinion, there being learned men on both ſides, and Scripture alleaged on both ſides, you deſire to know which is the truth: bring them both to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, &amp; ſée which of the two maketh moſt for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God, &amp; the matter wil ſoone be anſwered, the doubt will quickly be cleared. Conſider therfore how euen the Apoſtle Paul by this rule decideth this controuerſie:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>by what law</hi> (ſaith he) that is, by what meanes of ſaluation, <hi>is boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting excluded?</hi> Not by the law <hi>of workes, but by the law of faith.</hi> Hereupon he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>therefore a man is iuſtified by faith without the workes of the Lawe.</hi> And indéede the reaſon is excellent: for if man could by any of his owne doings, further his owne ſaluation, or procure the increaſe of glorie in heauen,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16516:129"/>
he had then ſome matter of glorying, and might (as it were) account himſelfe the leſſe beholden vnto God. But iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith onely, taketh all vtterly from man, and aſcribeth his whole ſaluation, the beginning, middle, and ending vnto the Lord: haue you both an example of this rule, and warrant for it, being vſed by the Apoſtle to decide ſo great a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie: and I am ſure, that you ſhall find it of very great vſe in many main points of our religion. Secondly, for the ſecond branch of the rule which is about the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and reliefe of a diſtreſſed and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted conſcience; marke this particular for the manifeſtation of the force of the rule. It is taught and maintained in our Church, that a Chriſtian man may be vnfallibly certaine of his ſaluation in his owne conſcience in this life, and that by an ordinarie and ſpeciall faith. Others there are (both Papiſts, and ſome alſo amongſt our ſelues) which hold that the certainetie of ſaluation, which in this life can be attained to, is onely coniecturall and probable, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely vpon likelihoods: and this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie they confeſſe to be vncertain, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16516:129"/>
ſuch as many times doth deceiue. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, here is a great controuerſie, and much is ſaid on either ſide: now you that are a priuate man, would gladly know to which part you may ſafely encline, and what to reſt vpon as the alone truth in this caſe. My aduiſe is therefore, that for your full ſatiſfaction herein, you ſcan the matter by this rule: ſuppoſe a ſpirit déepely wounded, a conſcience ſet as it were vpon the racke, ſeeing nothing in God but iuſtice and maieſtie, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire; finding nothing in it ſelf but ſinne and corruption, and infinite matter of deſpaire, ſo that by this meanes it is brought to ſuch an exigent, that it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not which way to turne, but is euen readie to crie out with Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhall deliuer me?</hi> Enquire now which of thoſe two doctrines doth affoord the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this wofull caſe, that will quickly appeare: for the one holdeth the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in a continuall ſuſpence, the other laboureth to ſettle it in the firme aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods vnchangeable loue in Chriſt Ieſus: the one bringeth a plaiſter, but much too litle for the ſore, telleth of the riches of Gods mercie, of the depth
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16516:130"/>
of his loue, of the vnſearchable ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Chriſts merite, but yet denyeth the ſoule to be aſſured of a particular intereſt into it, and by that meanes rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth then relieueth the anguiſh: the other applyeth the medicine to euery part of the wound, ſheweth Chriſt, diſcouereth the riches of Chriſt, and putteth the amazed heart into a full, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and comfortable poſſeſſion of Chriſt. So that whatſoeuer ſhall be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to the contrarie, you may be bold to build vpon that which bringeth the moſt ioyfull and welcome tidings to an affrighted conſcience: that is beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing to the ſcope of the Scripture, that cometh neareſt to the nature of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Come now to the third bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, which is concerning the libertie of the fleſh, and let me giue an inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that alſo. There is at this day a doctrine, (almoſt openly taught, or at leaſt tolerated by many that ſhold teach otherwiſe) namely, that a man may do well inough, without ſo much preaching: that it is not a matter of that great neceſſitie to frequent the places of Gods publike ſeruice, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a body may do well inough at home, with
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16516:130"/>
ſome priuate deuotions: that common men néed not trouble themſelues greatly with the ſcripture, or with knowledge in religion: that the religious ſpending of the Sabboth is a thing indifferent: that often communicating at the Lords table is not of any great importance, but that once or twiſe in a yéer is as good as euery day: that it is not good to be too forward in matters of religion, ouerſtrait in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that God wil beare with many ſmal matters, &amp;c. On the other ſide, there is a doctrine that telleth vs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto vs, that if we deſire to walke and to liue ſo as may pleaſe God, and as becommeth Chriſtians, we muſt make conſcience of often hearing the word, we muſt <hi>as new born babes deſire the ſincere milke</hi> thereof, <hi>that we may grow thereby,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

al things that may diſable vs and make vs more vnfit for Gods ſeruice, either in reſpect of preparation before it, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and meditation after it: we muſt for the ſtrengthning of our faith, and the ſolemne reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring of the death of Chriſt ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> communicate: we muſt in our liues walk circumſpectly, with zeale &amp; courage and openneſſe in the practiſe of religion: we muſt make conſcience of the ſmalleſt ſin, &amp; neuer thinke we haue done enough in the duties of holy obedience.

be free to ſpend the Sabboth, euery one as himſelfe liſteth? to receiue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion when men think good? to neglect knowledge? to baniſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible out of their houſes, or elſe to let it ly like old harneſſe ruſting for lacke of occupying? wil it not by and by be receiued, that it is not good for men to be preciſe, to be ouer ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to ſtand too nicely vpon points? Surely he that ſhold teach this, I might ſay of him as the Prophet ſpake of old,<note place="margin">Micah 2.11</note> 
                  <hi>He were a Preacher for the people.</hi> But now for the other doctrine, ſee what an acceptation it hath in the world: fie vpon it will one ſay, what a tedious thing is this to heare ſo many ſermons, what a trouble to come ſo often to the Church, what a miſery to be reſtrained from our ſunday-ſports, what a dull time wil it be and how long will the day ſeeme if thus we be limited? what need ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions? what ſhold men be ſo hot and earneſt in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? if this once take place, farewell all mirth, farewell all good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, adieu to all thriuing, if this be hearkned vnto. This is and will be the entertainment of this doctrine: it will be reputed as the Prophets ſermons were
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16516:132"/>
of old, euen <hi>the Burden of the Lord.</hi> So by the generall yéelding or gaineſaying of the multitude, it may ſoone appeare which of the two is the greateſt enemy to the fleſh: and therefore you both may and muſt conclude with the latter do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that that is from aboue, becauſe it meeteth with our corruption at euery turne, and is ſtill beating it downe, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to keepe it within compaſſe. And by this rule (to gaine it the more credit) <hi>Paul</hi> tooke vp the queſtion among the Galathians, touching the vſe of Chriſtian libertie, ſetting it downe for a ground, that it is then beſt vſed when it is not <hi>vſed as an occaſion to the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.13.</note> but with a holy reſpect <hi>to become ſeruants each to other by loue.</hi> Thus I haue (for your better vnderſtanding) giuen you an example of euery branch of this rule, that you may know how to apply it; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring you out of mine own poore experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there are very few of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of religion, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concerne the worſhip of God, or our conuerſation with men, but they may receiue their triall by this Canon, and may truly be ſayed to ſtand or fall,

                  <hi>I thanke you vnfainedly for this direction; yet touching this latter branch, it ſeemeth to me that there may be ſome doubt made, becauſe the popiſh religion is thought to reſtraine and puniſh the fleſh more then ours: for it impoſeth many very ſtraite things and vnpleaſing, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, penance, going barefoote, pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, payings of money, to purchaſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when men are dead, and diuers the like: I pray you therefore cleare me in this onely doubt, and then I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>

                  <hi>They haue indeede a ſhew of wiſedome in voluntarie religion, and humbleneſſe of mind, and in not ſparing the bodie:</hi> but yet another way they giue greater libertie: for when it is taught that theſe things are meritorious, and of worth to do away many ſinnes, what will not a man be content to do, for a wéeke or an houre, or a ſhort time, for the remouing of the ſinnes of his whole life? and who will not be content when he is dying,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16516:133"/>
to giue all that away which hee muſt needs leaue behind, for the deliuery of his ſoule from a ſuppoſed purgatory? Who wold not go an hundred miles on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the ſhrine of ſuch or ſuch a ſaint, to be aſſured that it ſhal be his diſcharge for the remainder of his life? So that though theſe bodily impoſitions may ſeeme ſomething ſtraite one way, yet they giue trebble libertie another way, and therefore may truly be ſayd, rather to be an occaſion to the fleſh, then to li-limit the corruption of the fleſh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is very true; for what will a man feare to do, ſo long as he is taught, and by teaching perſwaded, that by almes-deeds and faſting (falſly ſo called) and ſome legacies bequeathed to religious vſes (as they terme them) or by conformitie to the penall iniunctions of a prieſt, he may make ſufficient ſatisfaction? therefore I hold this for anſwer enough to that obiection.</hi>

               <p>Well neighbor, to let that paſſe, &amp; to follow the motion which you made, I muſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former rule adde one thing, which is this: Take heed by all meanes of ſuch eares as the Apoſtle calleth <hi>itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eares,</hi>

of teachers.</hi> It is a dangerous humor to affect variety of inſtructors, and it muſt needs cauſe diſtraction: it filleth mens heads with a world of idle queſtions, &amp; draweth them <hi>into vaine iangling.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.6.</note> It is Satans policy as long as he can to hold men in ignorance, and in the contempt or neglect of <hi>knowledge:</hi> when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preuaile that way, but men will li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to inſtruction, then he will endeuor to buſie them with <hi>prophane fables and vaine bablings, which breed queſtions,</hi>

A ſetledneſſe of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, following vpon an orderly courſe to bring a man thereunto. The ſecond thing that muſt concurre, is the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the parties of whom we haue learned: as if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſayd, <hi>Obſerue and marke well what kind of men they are, by whoſe miniſtery thou haſt bene inſtructed; if they be men, who by their fidelity in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and by the bleſſing of God vpon their labors, in vſing their miniſtery to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert mens ſoules, do cary with them the
