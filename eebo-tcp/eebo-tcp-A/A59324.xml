            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>May it please your Grace,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat so worthless a Present to so Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a Person, is a piece of Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
I am as Conscious as I am
that your <hi>Grace</hi> has Goodness to
Pardon it; for if sins of Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could not be forgiven, the punishment of
Offences would put a restraint on Virtue, and
<pb facs="tcp:50757:3"/>
make Mercy one of the noblest Ornaments of
Greatness a Stranger to it; and at that rate
a Patron would be as confined as a Iudge, who
at the same time he is a Kings Representative,
and presides over Iustice, is a Slave to it; whilst
his Sentence is but the voyce of Law, &amp; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or Cruelty, not voluntary, but prescribed.
Your Patronage is not so bounded, your Favours
are unlimited, and your <hi>Grace</hi> can execute a
more peculiar Kingly power; You can give Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
and by your Smiles create Merit where
you do not find it. But above that Title of a
favourer of Poetry, which single Attribute were
enough to make the <hi>Muses</hi> your Votaries; the
World is sensible of your Conspicuous Eminence
in more adorable Qualities. In a <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Newcastle</hi> Wit has found a Pillar, Valour a
Pattern, Loyalty a Standart, and <hi>England</hi> a
Patriot: In which rank of <hi>Heroes</hi> so placed
and so adorned, your <hi>Grace</hi> has the advantage
over both the ancient <hi>Worthyes,</hi> and those of
the present Age. For when <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi>
Character'd <hi>Greatness,</hi> with them the Walls of
Cityes were built by the Hands of Gods, their
<pb facs="tcp:50757:3"/>
               <hi>Heroes</hi> descended from <hi>Deities,</hi> and their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities</hi>
personally Interested in National Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels;
whilst the almost fabulous Gallantry they
painted, was set off by False Lights, and so their
Presidents of Glory were but things of Noyse,
and works of Art. But your <hi>Grace</hi> lives in an
Age where <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> are the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of Nature; and he that describes
your Worth, draws your true Self; and Story
must render you <hi>Illustrious</hi> by Glories that are
your Own: And when Fame (which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
your <hi>Memory</hi> longer then <hi>Marble</hi> can
your Ashes) shall speak of a <hi>Newcastle;</hi> its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
will be undisputable, as its Subject is
unimitable. Nor can this Age (should it joyn
the <hi>Noblest Blood,</hi> and the most forward Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in one Person,) raise your Equal. For
Loyalty now under a Flourishing King, is but
like Ripe Fruits in Summer: The kindness of
the Season, &amp; the Blessing of the warm Sun take
off their Rarity, and lessen their Price. But you,
my Lord, are the truest and noblest Miracle of
Honour, whose Arms, whose Policy, and whose
Fortunes were Vigorously engaged, and as Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb facs="tcp:50757:4"/>
signaliz'd under a great, but drooping
Cause; whose Fidelity was ripend by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of a declining Sun. Thus the faithful
<hi>Newcastle</hi> laid a foundation for Immortality;
and to compleat so fair a Structure, Fate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
with his just and sacred Ambition. For
when <hi>Rebellion</hi> durst strike at Majesty, and
the Quarrel of a threatned King had made
<hi>Newcastle</hi> an Assertour of his Countreys Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Victory waited on his Arms, and added
Gems to his Coronet, when it deserted a Crown;
wherever he led in Person, Conquest attended
him, and his Royal Cause had never sunk, had
<hi>Newcastle</hi> admitted of Rivals; had all its
Champions been as great Favourites of Fortune
as He. But Providence, as it had more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
obliged your <hi>Grace</hi> with extraordinary
Parts and Ornaments of Nature, so it adjusted
the Laurels which it gave you, to the Merit of
the Brow that wore them. Nor did your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
spring only from the Trophies of the Field,
the Harvest of War: Your Glory began its
Ascension, before it had those steps Conquest and
Triumph to mount upon. His late Majesty of
<pb facs="tcp:50757:4"/>
ever blessed Memory out of the Deserving No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of <hi>England,</hi> singled out your <hi>Grace</hi> for
the Care of a Nations Hopes, the Tuition of a
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales:</hi> So visible were your Sacred
principles of Honour, that they were thought fit
to be precepts for an Heir to a Crown, and by
that pow'rful inspirer Education, to be imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Bosom of a growing Majesty. In which
high Trust, your <hi>Grace</hi> reacht that height which
<hi>Seneca</hi> could not arrive to. He, though in his
Learning and Integrity he resembled You, met
not your Success in the stubborn <hi>Nero.</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has justly lengthen'd out your happy Life,
to see the prosperous Raign of a Great, a Pious,
and Gracious <hi>Monarch</hi> in your Royal Charge.
Thus whilst your Matchless Gallantry has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
your Character so great in the Records of
Fame, and your Worth an Object for a
Kingdoms Veneration; in the vast numbers
of those whom the Admiration of your Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
has made your Creatures, I, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
you an ill Play, have made the
meanest Offering to your <hi>Grace;</hi> yet I
<pb facs="tcp:50757:5"/>
humbly beg you would not condemn an Effect
that has a Cause so powerful. Every one cannot be
deserving in Crowds; &amp; not to have your Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
numerous, is as impossible, as 'tis for your
<hi>Grace</hi> to bid your Fame spread thus far, and no
farther; whilst That knows no bounds, They
must be Infinite; which is the only justification

            <p>THis Play is founded on a Tragedy call'd the <hi>Fatal Contract.</hi>
And in the two First Acts, there is much of the Original
Copy remaining. But from Page 25th. 'tis entirely New
to the End, excepting the Last Scene in the 4th. Act, and a little
Scene beween <hi>Dumane, Lamot,</hi> and <hi>Burbon.</hi> For in the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Contract,</hi> after the supposed Death of <hi>Lewis,</hi> in the 2d. Act,
<hi>Aphelia</hi> in the very next Scene after, at First Word asking,
much like the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Marton, Marries the <hi>King</hi> her Lovers Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
which quite varied the Intrigue to the End of the Play.
I could make Excuses for putting an ill Head upon Worse Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
Or tell you as some of our Impertinent Tribe do, that 'twas
Written in three Weeks, or a Months time, if I thought any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Man, would be more Favourable to the Defects of the Play
for such an Apology. But as I am Sensible, that that Excuse to
a Play, would be much like that of a Builder, that after the fall
of a House, shall tell you, truly he Built slightly, and chose in ill
Foundation; I will not urge that Plea for the Plays Defence;
which in the best Interpretation must render an Author Lazy, if not
Dull: In the first of which, he shews himself Impudent, when he
dares be so Disrespectful to an Audience, as to obtrude such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct
