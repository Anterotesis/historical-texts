         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE common aim of Prefaces to prepossess the Reader in favour of the Book, is here wholly useless; for what is now publish'd is none of the trifling Performances of the Age, that are yet to make their fortune, but a Collection of those vaulable Pieces, which several great Men have produc'd, no less inspir'd by the injur'd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of their Country, than by the Muses. They are of Establish'd Fame, and already receiv'd, and allow'd the best Patriots, as well as Poets. I am sensible, that should we consult our superficial Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticks, they would often be apt to arraign the Numbers; for there are a sort of Men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little other merit, than a happy chime, would fain fix the Excellence of Poetry in the smoothness of the Versification, allowing but little to the more Essential Qualities of a Poet, great Images, good Sense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay they have so blind a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for what they Excell in, that they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all variety of Numbers from <hi>English</hi> Poetry, when they allow none but <hi>Iambics,</hi> which must by an identy of sound bring a very unpleasing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety upon the Reader. I must own that I am of
<pb facs="tcp:36411:4"/>
opinion that a great many rough Cadencies that are to be found in these Poems, and in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Paradise Lost,</hi> are so far from Faults that they are Beauties, and contribute by their variety to the prolonging the pleasure of the Readers. But I have unawares faln into this Digression, which requires more time and room than I have here to allow to set to it, in that just Light it requires. I shall return to the following Poems, writ by Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marvell, &amp;c.</hi> which will shew us, that there is no where a greater Spirit of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to be found, than in those who are Poets; <hi>Homer, Aristophanes,</hi> and most of the inspired Tribe have shewed it; and <hi>Catullus</hi> in the midst of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Triumphs attack'd the Vices of that great Man, and expos'd 'em to lessen that Popularity and Power he was gaining among the <hi>Roman</hi> People, which he saw would be turn'd to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Quis hoc potest videre, quis potest pati, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>And
<q>
                  <l>Pulchre convenit improbis cinaedis</l>
                  <l>Mamurrae,, Pathicoque, Caesarique.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And again
<q>Nil nimium studeo Caesar tibi velle placere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But it would be endless to quote all the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Poets have of old taken with Ill men, whose Power had aw'd others to a servile Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the succeeding Tyrants have not been able to suppress the numerous Instances we have yet of it. We have therefore reason to hope that no <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:36411:4"/>
that is a true lover of his Countries Good and Glory, can be displeased at the publishing a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, the design of each of which was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move those pernicious Principles which lead us directly to Slavery; to promote a Publick and Generous Spirit, which was then almost a shame to the Possessor, if not a certain Ruine. I believe were a man of equal Ability and unbyass'd Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make a just Comparison, some of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Authors might claim perhaps an equal share with many of the most celebrated of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> or <hi>Greeks.</hi> I know in a Nation so factious as this, where the preposterous Principles of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very are run into a point of Conscience and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and yet hold abundance in unseasonable and monstrous Divisions, it would be a task that must disoblige too many to undertake. But when all <hi>Europe</hi> is engag'd to destroy that tyrannick Power, the mismanagement of those Times, and the selfish evil Designs of a corrupt Court had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Rise to, it cannot be thought unseasonable to publish so just an Account of the true sourse of all our present Mischiefs; which will be evidently found in the following Poems, for from them we may collect a just and secret History of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Times.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And looking backward with a wise Affright,</l>
               <l>See Seams of Wounds dishonest to the Sight.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Oh that we cou'd yet learn, under this Auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Government founded on Liberty, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous principles of the Publick Good! Sure th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consort of Divine <hi>Amphions</hi> will charm the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted pieces of the publick Building into one noble and regular Pile to be the wonder, as well as safeguard of <hi>Europe.</hi> This being the aim of this present Publication, it must be extremely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by all true Patriots, all lovers of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good of Mankind, and in that most certainly of their own particular.
<q>

Take off the gawdy veil of Slavery, and she will appear so frightfull and deform'd that all would abhorr her: For all Mankind naturally preferr Liberty to Slavery.</p>
            <p>'Tis true some few of these Poems were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before in loose Papers, but so mangled that the persons that wrote them would hardly have known, much less have owned them; which put a Person on examining them by the Originals or best Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and they are here published without any Castration, with many curious Miscellaneous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems of the same great Men, which never before see the Light.</p>

There are two things especially in which they stand in need of your Defence: One is, That they fall so infinitely below the full and lofty <hi>Genius</hi> of that excellent Poet, who made this way of writing free of our Nation: The other, That they are so little proportioned and equal to the Renown of that Prince, on whom they were written. Such great Actions and Lives, deserving rather to be the Subjects of the noblest Pens and divine Fancies, than of such small Beginners and weak Essayers in Poetry as my self. Against these dangerous Prejudices, there remains no other Shield, than the Universal Esteem and Authority which your Iudgment and Approbation carries with it. The Right you have to them, Sir, is not only on the account of the Relation you had to this great Person, nor of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral favour which all Arts receive from you; but more particularly by reason of that Obligation and Zeal, with which I am bound to dedicate my self to your Service: For having been a long time the Object of you Care and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence towards the advantage of my Studies and Fortune, having been moulded (as it were) by your own Hands, and formed under your Government; not to intitle you to any thing which my meanness produces, would not only be Injustice, but Sacrilege: So that if there be any thing here tolerably said, which deserves pardon, it is yours Sir, as well as he, who is</p>

               <l>NAY Painter, if thou dar'st design that Fight,</l>
               <l>Which <hi>Waller</hi> only Courage had to write;</l>
               <l>If thy bold hands can without shaking draw,</l>
               <l>What ev'n th' Actors trembled at when they saw,</l>
               <l>Enough to make thy Colours change like theirs,</l>
               <l>And all thy Pencils bristle like their Hairs.</l>
               <l>First in fit distance of the prospect Main,</l>
               <l>Paint <hi>Allen</hi> tilting at the Coast of <hi>Spain</hi>;</l>
               <l>Heroick act! and never heard till now!</l>
               <l>Stemming of <hi>Herc'les</hi> pillars with the Prow!</l>
               <l>And how he lest his ship the hills to wast,</l>
               <l>And with new Sea-marks <hi>Cales</hi> and <hi>Dover</hi> graft.</l>
               <l>Next let the flaming <hi>London</hi> come in view,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Nero</hi>'s <hi>Rome,</hi> burnt to re-build it new;</l>
               <l>What lesser Sacrifice than this was meet</l>
               <l>To offer for the safety of the Fleet?</l>
               <l>Blow one ship up, another thence will grow:</l>
               <l>See what free Cities and wise Courts can do!</l>
               <l>So some old Merchant to insure his name,</l>
               <l>Marries afresh, and Courties share the Dame:</l>
               <l>So whatsoe'er is broke, the Servants pay't,</l>
               <l>And Glasses are more durable than Plate.</l>

               <l>Nor one Barge all the Companies contain'd.</l>
               <l>Then Painter draw Cerulean <hi>Coventry,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Keeper, or rather Chancellor o'th' Sea;</l>

               <l>Until of him they learn that one point more.</l>
               <l>The constant Magnet to the Pole doth hold,</l>

               <l>Swoln like his Purse, with tackling like his strings,</l>
               <l>By slow degrees of the increasing gale,</l>
               <l>First under Sail, and after under Sale:</l>
               <l>Then in kind visit unto <hi>Opdam</hi>'s Gout,</l>
               <l>Hedge the <hi>Dutch</hi> in, only to let them out.</l>
               <l>So Huntsmen fair unto the Hares give Law,</l>
               <l>First find them, and then civilly withdraw.</l>
               <l>That the blind Archer when they take the Seas,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Hambrough</hi> Convoy may betray with ease.</l>
               <l>So that the Fish may more securely bite,</l>
               <l>The Angler baits the River over night.</l>
               <l>But Painter, now prepare t' inrich thy piece,</l>

               <l>So the Land-Crabs, at Natures kindly call,</l>
               <l>Down to ingender to the Sea do crawl.</l>
               <l>See then the Admiral with the Navy whole,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Harwich</hi> through the Ocean carry Coal:</l>

               <l>To draw her parting Passions and each Tear:</l>
               <l>For Love, alas! hath but a short delight;</l>
               <l>The Sea, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the King, all call'd to fight.</l>

               <l>To <hi>Brunker, Pen,</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> her Friends,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Pen</hi> much, <hi>Brunker</hi> more, most <hi>Coventry</hi>;</l>
               <l>For they she knew were all more fraid than he:</l>

               <l>And hop'd by this he thro' the Air might spin;</l>
               <l>The other thought he might avoid the Knell,</l>
               <l>By the invention of the Diving Bell;</l>
               <l>The third had try'd it, and affirm'd a Cable</l>
               <l>Coyld round about him was impenetrable.</l>
               <l>But these the Duke rejected, only chose</l>
               <l>To keep far off; let others interpose.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rupert</hi> that knew no fear, but Health did want,</l>
               <l>Kept State suspended in a Chair volant;</l>
               <l>All save his Head shut in that wooden case,</l>
               <l>He shew'd but like a broken Weatherglass;</l>
               <l>But arm'd with the whole Lyon Cap-a-Chin,</l>
               <l>Did represent the <hi>Hercules</hi> within.</l>
               <l>Dear shall the <hi>Dutch</hi> his twinging anguish know,</l>
               <l>And see what Valour whet with pain can do.</l>
               <l>Curst in the mean time be that treach'rous <hi>Jael,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That thro' his Princely Temples drove the Nail.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rupert</hi> resolv'd to fight it like a Lyon;</l>

               <l>Till some judicious <hi>Dolphin</hi> might approach,</l>
               <l>And land him safe and sound as any Roach.</l>

               <l>Imperial Prince! King of the Seas and Isles!</l>
               <l>Dear Object of our Ioy, and Heaven's smiles!</l>
               <l>What boots it that thy Light doth gild our Days,</l>
               <l>And we lie basking in thy milder Rays,</l>
               <l>While swarms of Insects, from thy warmth begun,</l>
               <l>Our Land devour, and intercept our Sun?</l>
               <l>Thou, like <hi>Jove</hi>'s <hi>Minos,</hi> rul'st a greater <hi>Creet;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And for its hundred Cities, count'st thy Fleet.</l>
               <l>Why wilt thou that State-<hi>Daedalus</hi> allow,</l>
               <l>Who builds the Butt, a Lab'rinth and a Cow?</l>
               <l>If thou art <hi>Minos,</hi> be a Iudge severe,</l>
               <l>And in's own Maze confound the Engineer.</l>
               <l>O may our Sun, since he too nigh presumes,</l>
               <l>Melt the soft wax wherewith he imps his Plumes!</l>
               <l>And may he falling leave his hated Name</l>
               <l>Unto those Seas his War hath set on Flame!</l>
               <l>From that Enchanter having clear'd thine Eyes,</l>
               <l>Thy native sight will pierce within the Skies,</l>
               <l>And view those Kingdoms calm with Ioy and Light,</l>
               <l>Where's Universal Triumph, but no Fight.</l>
               <l>Since both from Heaven thy Race and Power descend,</l>
               <l>Rule by its Pattern there to re-ascend:</l>
               <l>Let Iustice only awe, and Battel cease:</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>SAnd—ch</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> now, and the Duke in love,</l>
                  <l>Let's with new Generals a new Painter prove:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Lilly</hi>'s a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> danger's in his art,</l>
                  <l>His Pencils may Intelligence impart.</l>
                  <l>Thou <hi>Gibson,</hi> that among thy Navy small</l>
                  <l>Of Muscle-shells, commandest Admiral;</l>
                  <l>Thy self so slender, that thou shew'st no more</l>
                  <l>Than Barnacle new hatch'd of them before:</l>
                  <l>Come mix thy Water-colours, and express</l>
                  <l>Drawing in little what we yet do less.</l>
                  <l>First paint me <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Rupert</hi> ratling far</l>
                  <l>Both in one Box like the two Dice of War;</l>
                  <l>And let the terrour of their linked Name,</l>
                  <l>Fly thro' the air, like Chain-shot, tearing fame:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Jove</hi> in one Cloud did scarcely ever wrap</l>
                  <l>Lightning so fierce, but never such a clap.</l>
                  <l>United Generals sure are th' onely spell,</l>
                  <l>Wherewith United Provinces to quell:</l>
                  <l>Alas, even they, though shell'd in treble Oak,</l>
                  <l>Will prove an addle Egg with double Yolk.</l>
                  <l>And therefore next uncouple either Hound,</l>
                  <l>And loo them at two Hares e're one be found.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Beaufort,</hi> halloo; ah, there <hi>Rupert</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Like the phantastick hunting of St. <hi>Hubert</hi>;</l>
                  <l>When he with airy Hounds, and Horn of air,</l>
                  <l>Pursues by <hi>Fontain-bleau</hi> the witchy Hare.</l>
                  <l>Deep providence of State! that could so soon</l>
                  <l>Fight <hi>Beaufort</hi> here e're he had quit <hi>Thouloon.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>So have I seen, e're Human Quarrels rise,</l>
                  <l>Foreboding Meteors combat in the Skies.</l>
                  <l>But let the Prince to fight with Rumour go,</l>
                  <l>The Generals meet a more substantial Foe:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ruyter</hi> he spies, and full of Youthfull heat,</l>
                  <l>Though half their number, thinks the odds too great.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:36411:23"/>The Fowler watching, so his watry spot,</l>
                  <l>And more the Fowl, hopes for the better shot.</l>
                  <l>Though such a Limb was from his Navy torn,</l>
                  <l>He found no weakness yet, like <hi>Sampson</hi> shorn;</l>
                  <l>But swoln with sense of former Glory wone,</l>
                  <l>Thought <hi>Monk</hi> must be by <hi>Albemarle</hi> out-done:</l>
                  <l>Little he knew with the same Arm and Sword,</l>
                  <l>How far the Gentleman out-cuts the Lord.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ruyter,</hi> inferiour unto none for Art.</l>
                  <l>Superiour now in number and in Heart;</l>
                  <l>Ask'd if he thought, as once our Rebel-Nation,</l>
                  <l>To conquer theirs too, with a Declaration?</l>
                  <l>And threatens, though he now so proudly sail,</l>
                  <l>He shall tread back his <hi>Iter Boreale</hi>:</l>
                  <l>This said, he the short period, e're it ends,</l>
                  <l>With Iron-words from Brazen-mouths extends:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Monk</hi> yet prevents him e're the Navies meet,</l>
                  <l>And charges in himself alone a Fleet;</l>
                  <l>And with so quick and frequent motion wound</l>
                  <l>His murthering sides about, the Ship seem'd round;</l>
                  <l>And the Exchanges of his Circling Tire,</l>
                  <l>Like whirling Hoops, shew'd of triumphant Fire.</l>
                  <l>Single he doth at their whole Navy aim,</l>
                  <l>And shoots them through a Porcupine of flame.</l>
                  <l>In noise so regular his Cannons met,</l>
                  <l>You'd think that Thunder was to Musick set:</l>
                  <l>Ah! had the rest but kept a time as true,</l>
                  <l>What age could such a Martial Consort shew!</l>
                  <l>The listning air unto the distant shore,</l>
                  <l>Through secret Pipes conveys the tuned Roar;</l>
                  <l>Till as the Eccho's vanishing, abate,</l>
                  <l>Men feel a dead sound like the pulse of State.</l>
                  <l>If Fate expire let <hi>Monk</hi> her place supply,</l>
                  <l>His Guns determine who shall live or dye.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Victory</hi> doth always hate a Rant;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Valour</hi>'s her <hi>Brave,</hi> but <hi>Skill</hi> is her <hi>Gallant.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ruyter</hi> no less with vertuous Envy burns,</l>
                  <l>And Prodigies for Miracles returns:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:36411:24"/>Yet he observ'd how still his Iron Balls,</l>
                  <l>Recoyl'd in vain against our Oaken Walls.</l>
                  <l>How the hard Pellets sell away as dead,</l>
                  <l>By our inchanted Timber fillipped.</l>
                  <l>Leave then, said he, th' invulnerable Keel,</l>
                  <l>Wee'll find their feeble, like <hi>Achilles</hi> Heel.</l>
                  <l>He quickly taught, pours in continual Clouds</l>
                  <l>Of chain'd Dilemma's through our sinew'd Shrowds.</l>
                  <l>Forrests of Masts fall with their rude embrace,</l>
                  <l>Our stiff Sails masht, and netted into Lace;</l>
                  <l>Till our whole Navy lay their wanton mark,</l>
                  <l>Nor any Ship could sail but as the Ark,</l>
                  <l>Shot in the Wing, so at the Powder's call,</l>
                  <l>The disappointed Bird doth fluttering fall.</l>
                  <l>Yet <hi>Monk</hi> disabl'd still such courage shews,</l>
                  <l>That none into his mortal gripe dare close:</l>
                  <l>So an old Bustard, maim'd yet loth to yield,</l>
                  <l>Duels the Fowler in <hi>New-Market</hi> Field.</l>
                  <l>But since he found it was in vain to fight,</l>
                  <l>He imps his Plumes the best he can for flight:</l>
                  <l>This, Painter, were a noble task to tell,</l>
                  <l>What indignation his great Breast did swell.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Not vertuous Man unworthily abus'd,</l>
                  <l>Not constant Lover without cause refus'd,</l>
                  <l>Not honest Merchant broke, nor skilfull Player</l>

                  <l>Oh, 'twas at <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the brave <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Now for a <hi>Cornucopia</hi>: Peace, all know</l>

                  <l>And counterfeit the counterfeit disdain.</l>
                  <l>Draw a brave Standard, ruffling at a rate</l>
                  <l>Much other than it did for <hi>Chatham</hi>'s fate.</l>

                  <l>A Bonfire here and there; but none too bright,</l>

                  <l>These things are far off, not worth looking after:</l>
                  <l>Give not a hint of these: Draw Highland, Lowland,</l>

                  <l>So much for Peace. Now for a Parliament:</l>
                  <l>A petty Sessions draw: with what content,</l>
                  <l>Guess by their Countenance, who came up post,</l>
                  <l>And quickly saw they had their Labour lost:</l>

                  <l>No wonder then it dy'd so soon away.</l>
                  <l>Yet breath'd it once, and that with such a force,</l>
                  <l>It blasted Thirty Thousand Foot and Horse.</l>

               <l>If't be'nt too slight grown, or too hard for thee.</l>
               <l>Canst thou paint without Colours, then 'tis right?</l>
               <l>For so we too without a Fleet can fight.</l>
               <l>Or canst thou daub a sign-post, and that ill?</l>

               <l>'Twill serve this race of Drunkards, Pimps and Fools.</l>

               <l>As th' <hi>Indian</hi> draw out Luxury in Plumes.</l>
               <l>Or if to score out our compendious Fame,</l>
               <l>With <hi>Hook</hi> then through your Microscope take aim;</l>
               <l>Where like the new Comptroller all men laugh,</l>
               <l>To see a tall Louse brandish a white Staff.</l>

               </byline>
               <l>OF the old Heroes, when the Warlike Shades</l>
               <l>Saw <hi>Douglas</hi> marching on the <hi>Elysium</hi> Glades,</l>
               <l>They all consulting gather'd in a Ring,</l>
               <l>Which of their Poets should his Welcome sing:</l>
               <l>And as a favourable Penance chose</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> on whom they would that task impose.</l>
               <l>He understood but willingly addrest</l>
               <l>His ready Muse to court that noble Guest.</l>
               <l>Much had he cur'd the tumour of his Vein,</l>
               <l>He judg'd more clearly now, and saw more plain;</l>
               <l>For those soft Airs had temper'd every Thought,</l>
               <l>And of wise <hi>Lethe</hi> he had drunk a Draught.</l>
               <l>Abruptly he began, disguising Art,</l>
               <l>As of his Satyr this had been a part.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36411:46"/>Not so, brave <hi>Douglas,</hi> on whose lovely Chin,</l>
               <l>The early Down but newly did begin:</l>
               <l>And modest Beauty yet his Sex did veil,</l>
               <l>While envious Virgins hopes he is a Male.</l>
               <l>His yellow Locks curles back themselves to seek,</l>
               <l>Nor other Courtship knew but to his Cheek.</l>
               <l>Oft as he in chill <hi>Esk</hi> or <hi>Seyn</hi> by Night,</l>
               <l>Hardned and cool'd, his Limbs so soft, so white;</l>
               <l>Among the Reeds to be espy'd by him</l>
               <l>The Nymphs would rustle, he would forwards swim;</l>
               <l>They sigh'd, and said, Fond Boy, why so untame,</l>
               <l>That fly'st Loves fires, reserv'd for other flame?</l>
               <l>First on his Ship he fac't that horrid Day,</l>
               <l>And wondered much at those that run away:</l>
               <l>No other fear himself could comprehend,</l>
               <l>Than least Heaven fall e'er thither he ascend;</l>
               <l>But entertains the while his time too short,</l>
               <l>With birding at the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as if in sport;</l>
               <l>Or waves his Sword, and could he them conjure</l>
               <l>Within his Circle, knows himself secure.</l>
               <l>The fatal Bark him boards with grappling Fire,</l>
               <l>And safely through its Port the <hi>Dutch</hi> retire.</l>
               <l>That precious Life he yet disdains to save,</l>
               <l>Or with known Art to try the gentle Wave;</l>
               <l>Much him the honour of his ancient Race</l>
               <l>Inspir'd, nor would he his own Deeds deface;</l>
               <l>And secret Joy in his calm Soul does rise,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Monk</hi> looks on to see how <hi>Dowglas</hi> dies.</l>
               <l>Like a glad Lover the fierce flames he meets,</l>
               <l>And tries his first Embraces in their Sheets:</l>
               <l>His Shape exact, which the bright flames infold,</l>
               <l>Like the Suns Statue stands of burnisht Gold.</l>
               <l>Round the transparent Fire about him glows,</l>
               <l>As the clear Amber on the Bees does close;</l>
               <l>And as on Angels heads their Glories shine,</l>
               <l>His burning Locks adorn his Face divine.</l>
               <l>But when in his immortal Mind he felt</l>
               <l>His alt'ring Form, and soder'd Limbs to melt;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:36411:46"/>Down on the Deck he laid himself, and dy'd,</l>
               <l>With his dear Sword reposing by his Side:</l>
               <l>And on the flaming Plank so rests his Head,</l>
               <l>As one that warm'd himself, and went to Bed.</l>
               <l>His Ship burns down, and with his Reliques sinks,</l>
               <l>And the sad Stream beneath his Ashes drinks.</l>
               <l>Fortunate Boy! If either Pencils Fame,</l>
               <l>Or if my Verse can propagate thy Name;</l>

               <l>He, and his Duke, had both too great a Mind,</l>
               <l>To be by <hi>Justice</hi> or by <hi>Law</hi> confin'd:</l>
               <l>Their boiling Heads can bear no other Sounds,</l>

                  <l>And when all's done that can be done by man,</l>
                  <l>Much must be left to chance, do what we can.</l>

               <l>NEar <hi>Holborne</hi> lies a Park of great Renown,</l>

               <l>For brevity's sake the Name I shall not tell,</l>
               <l>Because most genteel Readers know it well,</l>
               <l>Since middle Park near <hi>Chairing-Cross</hi> was made,</l>
               <l>They say there is a great decay of Trade,</l>
               <l>'Twas there Gleek of Dukes by Fury brought</l>
               <l>With bloody mind a sickly Damsel sought,</l>
               <l>And against Law her Castle did invade,</l>
               <l>To take from her her instrument of Trade,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:36411:80"/>'Tis strange (but sure they thought not on't before)</l>
               <l>Three Bastard Dukes should come t'undoe one Whore.</l>
               <l>Murder was cry'd (truth is, her case was sad)</l>
               <l>When she was like to lose ev'n all she had:</l>
               <l>In came the Watch, disturb'd with Sleep and Ale,</l>
               <l>By shrill Noises, but they could not prevail,</l>
               <l>T' appease their Graces; straight rose Mortal Jarrs</l>
               <l>Betwixt the Night black Guard and Silver Stars;</l>
               <l>Then fell the Beadle by a Ducal Hand,</l>
               <l>For daring to pronounce the sawcy Stand.</l>
               <l>The way in Blood certain Renown to win,</l>
               <l>Is first with Bloody Noses to begin.</l>
               <l>The high-born Youths their hasty Errand tell,</l>
               <l>Dam ye you Rogue, we'll send your Soul to Hell.</l>
               <l>They need not send a Messenger before,</l>
               <l>They're too well known there to stay long at Door.</l>
               <l>See what mishaps dare ev'n invade <hi>Whitehall</hi>;</l>
               <l>This silly Fellow's death puts off the Ball,</l>
               <l>And disappoints the Queen, poor little Chuck,</l>
               <l>I warrant 'twould have danc'd it like a Duck.</l>
               <l>The Fidlers, Voices, Entries, all the sport,</l>
               <l>And the gay Show put off, where the brisk Court</l>
               <l>Anticipates in rich Subsidy-Coats</l>
               <l>All that is got by Mercenary Votes:</l>
               <l>Yet shall <hi>Whitehall</hi> the Innocent, the Good,</l>
               <l>See these men dance all daub'd with Lace and Blood.</l>
               <l>Near t'other Park there stands an aged Tree,</l>
               <l>As sit as if 'twere made o'th nonce for Three;</l>
               <l>Where that no Ceremony may be lost,</l>
               <l>Each Duke for State may have a several Post.</l>

                  </date>.</head>
               <l>TIr'd with the novsom Follies of the Age,</l>
               <l>And weary of my part, I quit the Stage;</l>
               <l>For who in Lif's dull Farce a part would bear,</l>
               <l>Where Rogues, Whores, Bawds, all the head Actors are?</l>
               <l>Long I with charitable Malice strove,</l>
               <l>Lashing the Court, those Vermin to remove,</l>
               <l>But thriving Vice under the Rod still grew,</l>
               <l>As aged Letchers whipp'd, their Lust renew;</l>
               <l>Yet though my Life hath unsuccessfull been,</l>
               <l>(For who can this <hi>Augaean</hi> Stable clean)</l>
               <l>My gen'rous end I will pursue in Death,</l>
               <l>And at Mankind rail with my parting breath.</l>
               <l>First then, the <hi>Tangier</hi> Bullies must appear,</l>
               <l>With open Bravery, and dissembled Fear:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mulg—e</hi> their Head; but Gen'ral have a care,</l>
               <l>Though skill'd in all those Arts that cheat the fair,</l>
               <l>The undiscerning and Impartial <hi>Moor,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Spares not the Lover on the Ladies score.</l>
               <l>Think how many perish by one fatal shot,</l>
               <l>The Conquests all thy Ogling ever got.</l>

               <l>This sure the Ladies had not fail'd to do,</l>

               <l>For say, what reason could with you prevail,</l>

               <l>To the more tolerable Alcaid of <hi>Alcazzer,</hi>

               <l>One flies from's. Creditors, the other from <hi>Frazier;</hi>

               <head>An Essay upon Satyr:</head>
               <byline>By <hi>J. Dr—en,</hi> Esquire.</byline>
               <l>HOW dull, and how insensible a Beast</l>
               <l>Is Man, who yet would Lord it o'er the rest?</l>
               <l>Philosophers and Poets vainly strove</l>
               <l>In every Age the lumpish Mass to move:</l>
               <l>But those were Pedants when compar'd with these,</l>
               <l>Who know not only to instruct, but please.</l>
               <l>Poets alone found the delightful way,</l>
               <l>Mysterious Morals gently to convey</l>
               <l>In charming Numbers; so that as men grew</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with their Poems, they grew wiser too.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Satyr</hi> has always shone among the rest,</l>
               <l>And is the boldest way if not the best,</l>
               <l>To tell men freely of their foulest Faults,</l>
               <l>To laugh at their vain Deeds, and vainer Thoughts.</l>
               <l>In Satyr too the Wise took different ways,</l>
               <l>To each deserving its peculiar praise.</l>
               <l>Some did all Folly with just sharpness blame,</l>
               <l>Whilst others laugh'd and scorn'd them into shame.</l>
               <l>But of these two, the last succeeded best,</l>
               <l>(As men aim rightest when they shoot in jest:)</l>
               <l>Yet if we may presume to blame our Guides,</l>
               <l>And censure those who censure all besides;</l>
               <l>In other things they justly are preferr'd,</l>
               <l>In this alone methinks the Ancients err'd;</l>
               <l>Against the grossest Follies they disclaim,</l>
               <l>Hard they pursue, but hunt ignoble Game.</l>
               <l>Nothing is easier than such blots to hit,</l>
               <l>And 'tis the Talent of each vulgar Wit;</l>
               <l>Besides, tis labour lost; for who would preach</l>
               <l>Morals to <hi>Armstrong,</hi> or dull <hi>Aston</hi> teach?</l>
               <l>'Tis being devout at Play, wise at a Ball,</l>
               <l>Or bringing Wit and Friendship to <hi>Whitehall;</hi>

               <l>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:36411:96"/>But with sharp Eyes those nicer faults to find,</l>
               <l>Which lie obscurely in the wisest Mind;</l>
               <l>That little speck, which all the rest does spoil,</l>
               <l>To wash off that would be a noble Toil,</l>
               <l>Beyond the loose-writ Libels of this Age,</l>
               <l>Or the forc'd Scenes of our declining Stage;</l>
               <l>Above all Censure too, each little Wit</l>
               <l>Will be so glad to see the greater hit:</l>
               <l>Who judging better, though concern'd the most,</l>
               <l>Of such Correction will have cause to boast.</l>
               <l>In such a Satyr all wou'd seek a share,</l>
               <l>And every Fool will fancy he is there.</l>
               <l>Old Story-tellers too must pine and dye,</l>
               <l>To see their antiquated Wit laid by;</l>
               <l>Like her who miss'd her Name in a Lampoon,</l>
               <l>And grieved to find her self decay'd so soon;</l>
               <l>No common Coxcomb must be mention'd here,</l>
               <l>Not the dull train of dancing Sparks appear;</l>
               <l>Not fluttering Officers, who never fight?</l>
               <l>Of such a wretched Rabble who would write?</l>
               <l>Much less half Wits, that's more against our Rules;</l>
               <l>For they are Fops, the other are but Fools.</l>
               <l>Who would not be as silly as <hi>Dunbarr</hi>?</l>
               <l>As dull as <hi>Monmouth,</hi> rather than Sir <hi>Carr</hi>?</l>
               <l>The cunning Courtier should be slighted too,</l>
               <l>Who with dull Knavery makes so much adoe;</l>
               <l>Till the shrew'd Fool, by thriving too too fast,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fox, becomes a Prey at last:</l>
               <l>Nor shall the Royal Mistresses be nam'd,</l>
               <l>Too ugly, or too easie to be blam'd;</l>
               <l>With whom each rhyming Fool keeps such a pother,</l>
               <l>They are as common that way as the other:</l>

               <l>Who all that while was thought exceeding wise,</l>
               <l>Only for taking pains and telling lies.</l>
               <l>But there's no medling with such nausceous Men,</l>
               <l>Their very Names have tyr'd my lazy Pen;</l>
               <l>'Tis time to quit their company, and chuse</l>

               <l>Against his careless Genius vainly strive;</l>
               <l>Quit his dear Ease, some deep design to lay,</l>
               <l>'Gainst a set time, and then forget the day:</l>
               <l>Yet he will laugh at his best Friends, and be</l>
               <l>Just as good Company as <hi>Nokes</hi> and <hi>Lee.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But when he aims at Reason or at Rule,</l>
               <l>He turns himself the best in ridicule.</l>
               <l>Let him at business ne'er so earnest sit,</l>
               <l>Shew him but Mirth, and bait that Mirth with Wit;</l>

               <l>Her manners oft my Indignation raise,</l>
               <l>But straight her Beauty the short storm allays.</l>
               <l>Her Life I loath, her Person I adore;</l>
               <l>Much I contemn her, but I love her more.</l>
               <l>Both with her and without her I'm in pain,</l>
               <l>And rage to lose what I should blush to gain:</l>
               <l>Uncertain, yet at what my wishes aim;</l>
               <l>Loath to abandon Love or part with Fame:</l>
               <l>That Angel-form ill suits a form all sin;</l>
               <l>Ah! be less fair without, or more within.</l>
               <l>When these soft Smiles my yielding Powers invade,</l>
               <l>In vain I call her Vices to my aid;</l>

                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:36411:100"/>Tho' now disdaining the disguise of Art,</l>
               <l>In my esteem her Conduct claims no part,</l>
               <l>Her Face a natural right has to my Heart.</l>
               <l>No Crime's so black as to deform her Eyes,</l>
               <l>Those Clouds must scatter when these Suns shall rise.</l>

               <l>By these dear Joys, (Joys dear tho' they are past)</l>
               <l>When in the kindest Links of Love we held each other fast;</l>
               <l>By th'injur'd Gods your false Oaths did prophane</l>
               <l>By all those Beauties that support and feed your proud disdain;</l>
               <l>By that lov'd Face from the whole Sex Elect,</l>
               <l>To which I all my Vows and Pray'rs direct,</l>
               <l>And equal with a Power divine respect:</l>
               <l>By every feature of a turn so fine,</l>
               <l>And by those Arms that charm and dazle mine.</l>
               <l>Spare from new triumphs, cherish without art,</l>
               <l>This over-faithfull, this too tender Heart:</l>
               <l>A Heart that was respectfull while it strove,</l>
               <l>But yielding is all blind impetuous Love:</l>
               <l>Live as you please, torment me as you will,</l>
               <l>Still are you fair, and I must love you still.</l>
               <l>Think only, if with just and clement Reign,</l>
               <l>A willing Subject you wou'd chuse to gain,</l>
               <l>Or drag a conquer'd Vassal in a Chain;</l>
               <l>But to what ever Conduct you incline,</l>
               <l>Do suffer, be what my worse fears divine,</l>
               <l>You are, you ought, you must, you shall be mine,</l>
               <l>Reason for ever, the vain strife give o'er,</l>
               <l>Thy cruel Wisdom I can bear no more;</l>
               <l>Let me indulge this one soft Passion's rule,</l>
               <l>Curb vexing Sense and be a happy Fool;</l>
               <l>With full spread Sails the tempting Gale obey,</l>
               <l>That down Love's Current drives me fast away.</l>

               <head>The Town Life.</head>
               <l>ONce how I doated on this Jilting Town,</l>
               <l>Thinking no Heaven was out of <hi>London</hi> known;</l>
               <l>Till I her Beauties artificial found,</l>
               <l>Her pleasure's but a short and giddy round;</l>
               <l>Like one who has his <hi>Phillis</hi> long enjoy'd</l>
               <l>Grown with the fulsom repetition cloy'd:</l>
               <l>Love's Mists then vanish from before his Eyes,</l>
               <l>And all the Ladies Frailties he descries:</l>
               <l>Quite surfeited with Joy, I now retreat</l>
               <l>To the fresh Air, a homely Country Seat,</l>
               <l>Good Hours, Books, harmless Sports, &amp; wholsom Meat.</l>
               <l>And now at last I have chose my proper Sphere,</l>
               <l>Where Men are plain and rustick, but sincere.</l>
               <l>I never was for Lies not Fawning made,</l>
               <l>But call a Wafer Bread, and Spade a Spade.</l>
               <l>I tell what merits got Lord — his place,</l>
               <l>And laugh at marry'd <hi>M—ve</hi> to his Face.</l>
               <l>I cannot vere with ev'ry change of State,</l>
               <l>Nor flatter Villains, tho' at Court they're great:</l>
               <l>Nor will I prostitute my Pen for Hire,</l>
               <l>Praise <hi>Cromwell,</hi> damn him, write the <hi>Spanish Fryar</hi>:</l>
               <l>A Papist now, if next the Turk should reign,</l>
               <l>Then piously transverse the Alcoran.</l>
               <l>Methinks I hear one of the Nation cry,</l>
               <l>Be Christ, this is a Whiggish Calumny,</l>
               <l>All Virtues are compriz'd in Loyalty.</l>
               <l>Might I dispute with him, I'd change his Note,</l>
               <l>I'de silence him, that is, he'd cut my Throat.</l>
               <l>This powerfull way of reasoning never mist,</l>
               <l>None are so possitive but then desist,</l>
               <l>As I will, e'er it come to that extreme;</l>
               <l>Our Folly, not our Misery is our Theam.</l>
               <l>Well may we wonder what strange Charm, what Spell,</l>
               <l>What mighty Pleasures in this <hi>London</hi> dwell,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:36411:101"/>That Men renounce their Ease, Estates and Fame,</l>
               <l>And drudge it here to get a Fopling's Name.</l>
               <l>That one of seeming sense advanc'd in years,</l>
               <l>Like a Sir <hi>Courtly Nice</hi> in Town appears:</l>
               <l>Others exchange their Land for tawdry Cloaths,</l>
               <l>And will in spight of Nature pass for Beauxs.</l>
               <l>Indulgent Heaven, who ne'er made ought in vain,</l>
               <l>Each Man for something proper did ordain;</l>
               <l>Yet most against their Genius blindly run,</l>
               <l>The wrong they chuse, and what they're made for shun.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Ar—n</hi> thinks for State affairs he's fit;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hewit</hi> for Ogling, <hi>Chomly</hi> for a Wit:</l>
               <l>But 'tis in vain, so wise, these Men to teach,</l>
               <l>Besides the King's learn'd Priests should only preach.</l>
               <l>We'll see how Sparks the tedious day employ,</l>
               <l>And trace them in their warm pursuit of Joy;</l>
               <l>If they get drest (with much ado) by Noon,</l>
               <l>In quest of Beauty to the <hi>Mall</hi> they run,</l>
               <l>Where (like young Boys) with Hat in hand they try</l>
               <l>To catch some flutt'ring gawdy Butterfly.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Gray</hi> pursues the Lady with a Face,</l>
               <l>Like forty more, and with the same success,</l>
               <l>Whose Jilting Conduct in her Beauty's spite,</l>
               <l>Loses her fame, and gets no pleasure by't.</l>
               <l>The secret Joys of an Intrigue she slights,</l>
               <l>And in an Equipage of Fools delights:</l>
               <l>So some vain Heroes for a vain command,</l>
               <l>Forfeit their Conscience, Liberty and Land.</l>
               <l>But see high Mass is done, in Crowds they go,</l>
               <l>What, all these <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Mall Howard</hi> too?</l>

               <l>There comes a Spark with six in Tarsels drest,</l>

               <l>A Belly smooth as Ivory.</l>
               <l>Yet Nature to declare her various Art,</l>
               <l>Had plac'd a Tuft in one convenient part,</l>
               <l>No Park with smoothest Lawn or highest Wood,</l>
               <l>Cou'd e'er compare with this admir'd abode.</l>
               <l>Here all the Youth of <hi>England</hi> did repair,</l>
               <l>To take their pleasure and unease their care.</l>
               <l>Here the distressed Lover that had born</l>
               <l>His haughty Mistress Anger or her Scorn</l>
               <l>Came for Relief; and in this pleasant Shade,</l>
               <l>Forgot the former, and this Nymph obey'd.</l>
               <l>And yet what corner of the World is found,</l>
               <l>Where pain or pleasure does not still surround?</l>
               <l>One wou'd have thought that in this shady Grove,</l>
               <l>Nought cou'd have dwelt but Quiet, Peace and Love.</l>
               <l>But Heaven directed otherwise; for here,</l>
               <l>I'th' midst of plenty bloody Wars appear:</l>
               <l>The Gods will frown where ever they do smile;</l>
               <l>The Crocodile infests the fertil Soil:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:36411:107"/>Lyons and Tygers on the <hi>Lybian</hi> Plains,</l>
               <l>Forbid all pleasures to the fearfull Swains:</l>
               <l>Wild Beasts in Forests do the Hunters fright,</l>
               <l>They fear their ruin 'midst of their delight.</l>
               <l>Thus in the shade of this dark silent Bower,</l>
               <l>Strength strives with strength, &amp; power vies with power.</l>
               <l>Two mighty Monsters did this Wood infest,</l>
               <l>And struck such awe and terror in the rest,</l>
               <l>That no <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant e'er could boast</l>
               <l>He e'er with greater rigour rul'd the roast.</l>
               <l>Each had his Empire, which he kept in awe,</l>
               <l>Was by his will obey'd, allow'd no Law:</l>
               <l>Nature so well divided had their states,</l>
               <l>Nought but Ambition cou'd have chang'd their fates:</l>
               <l>For 'twixt their Empire, stood a briny Lake,</l>
               <l>Deep as the Poets do the Centre make;</l>
               <l>But dire Ambition does admit no bounds,</l>
               <l>There are no limits to aspiring Crowns.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> by his <hi>Europe</hi> Conquests bold,</l>
               <l>Sail'd o'er the Ocean for the <hi>Indian</hi>'s Gold:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Hero did not stay,</l>
               <l>Because he met vast Mountains in his way:</l>
               <l>He pass'd the <hi>Alps</hi> like Mole-hills; such a Mind</l>
               <l>As thinks on Conquest will be unconfin'd.</l>
               <l>Both with these haughty thoughts one course to tend,</l>
               <l>To try if this vast Lake had any end:</l>
               <l>Where finding Countries yet without a Name,</l>
               <l>They might by Conquests get eternal Fame.</l>
               <l>After long Marches both their Armies tired,</l>
               <l>At length they find the place so much desired:</l>
               <l>Where in a little time each does descry,</l>
               <l>The glymps of an approaching Enemy.</l>
               <l>They in this sight do equal pleasure prove,</l>
               <l>As we should do in well rewarded Love:</l>
               <l>Blood-thirsty Souls, whose only perfect Joy,</l>
               <l>Consists in what their fury can destroy.</l>
               <l>And now both Armies do prepare to fight,</l>
               <l>And each of th'other unto War incite;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:36411:107"/>In vain, alas, for all their force and strength</l>
               <l>Was quite consumed by their Marches length;</l>
               <l>But the great Chiefs, impatient of delay,</l>
               <l>Resolve by single fight to try the day.</l>
               <l>Each does the other with Contempt defie,</l>
               <l>Resolv'd to conquer, or resolv'd to die;</l>
               <l>Both Armies are commanded to withdraw,</l>

               <l>While the amaz'd Spectators full of care,</l>
               <l>Hope for a better or worse Tyrant fear:</l>
               <l>And now these Princes meet, now they engage</l>
               <l>With all their chiefest Strength and highest Rage:</l>
               <l>Now with their Instruments of Wrath they push,</l>
               <l>As Hills in Earthquakes on each other rush;</l>
               <l>Where their Militia lies is still in doubt,</l>
               <l>Whether like Elephants upon their Snout;</l>
               <l>Or if upon their Heads vast Horns they wore,</l>
               <l>Or if they fought with Tusks like the wild Boar.</l>
               <l>Some <hi>Greshamites</hi> perhaps, with help of Glass,</l>
               <l>And poring long upon't, may chance to guess;</l>
               <l>But no Tradition has inform'd our Age,</l>
               <l>What were their chiefest instruments of Rage.</l>
               <l>With small or no advantage they proceed,</l>
               <l>Both are much bruised, and their Wounds do bleed:</l>
               <l>Both keep their Anger, both do lose their force,</l>
               <l>Both get the better, neither get the worse;</l>
               <l>Justice her self might put into each Scale</l>
               <l>One of these Princes, and see neither fall:</l>
               <l>Spurr'd on by Fury, now they both provide,</l>
               <l>To let one grapple, this great cause decide;</l>
               <l>Joyning, they strive, and such resistance make,</l>
               <l>Both fall together in the Briny Lake,</l>
               <l>Where from the trouble of a tottering Crown,</l>
               <l>Each mighty Monarch is laid gently down:</l>
               <l>Both Armies at this sight amazed stand,</l>
               <l>In doubt, who shall obey, who shall command:</l>
               <l>In this extremity they both agree,</l>
               <l>A Common-wealth their Government shall be.</l>

               <l>Hold modestly your Fan before your Eyes;</l>
               <l>And when the nauseous Husband tedious grows,</l>
               <l>Your lifted Hands with scornfull Anger close,</l>

               <l>AS restless on my Bed one Night I lay,</l>
               <l>Hoping with Sleep to ease the toils of Day,</l>
               <l>I thought, as graver Coxcombs us'd to doe,</l>
               <l>On all the mischiefs we had late run through,</l>
               <l>And those which are now likely to ensue:</l>
               <l>What 'tis that thus the frantick Nation dreads?</l>
               <l>And from what cause their jealousie proceeds?</l>
               <l>Whither at last to what event and end,</l>
               <l>These sad Presages probably might tend?</l>
               <l>For as Physicians always chuse to know</l>
               <l>Th'original cause from whence Distempers flow;</l>
               <l>And by their early Symptoms boldly guess,</l>
               <l>Whether or no their art shall have success:</l>
               <l>So I, like a young bold State Emp'rick too,</l>
               <l>Did the same methods, and same course pursue;</l>
               <l>Till with variety of thoughts opprest,</l>
               <l>I turn'd about to sleep and take my rest:</l>

               <l>And did this Vision in a Dream convey.</l>
               <l>Unknown, and unperceiv'd, I was me-thought,</l>
               <l>Into a close retiring Chamber brought,</l>
               <l>And by my Guide behind the Hangings plac'd,</l>

               <l>The Directory, Mass, and Common-Pray'r.</l>
               <l>This in a Cloak, That had a shaven Crown,</l>
               <l>The other in a Surcingle and Gown;</l>
               <l>VVho by his Garb, Demeaner, and grave Look,</l>
               <l>I for a Church of <hi>England</hi> Preacher took;</l>
               <l>For howsoe'er they're drest they may be known</l>
               <l>By a peculiar Carriage of their own.</l>

               <l>Nor could the meaning, nor the sense expound:</l>
               <l>Till he I mention'd last in rage up rose,</l>
               <l>And partly thro' the Mouth, and thro' the Nose,</l>
               <l>Did thus his whining Sentiments disclose.</l>
               <l>And is this all the great reward we must</l>

               <l>VVill all the Services we've done the King,</l>
               <l>No better recompence and profit bring?</l>
               <l>And can our boasted Loyalty return</l>
               <l>No other payment but Contempt and Scorn?</l>
               <l>Must we thus basely from our hopes fall down,</l>
               <l>And grow the publick scandal of the Town?</l>

               <l>Be with their goodly Lands and Lordships blest?</l>
               <l>Did we for this the Popish Plot deride,</l>
               <l>And all our Sense, and Nonsense too apply'd</l>

               <l>By Scripture for to prove the Common Prayer,</l>

               <l>And whosoe'ere the business would dispute,</l>

               <l>O precious Book! the dearest thing that's ours,</l>
               <l>Except our Livings and our <hi>Sine-cures</hi>;</l>
               <l>For which, might they but still with us abide,</l>
               <l>We'd part with thee, or any thing beside:</l>
               <l>As heretofore without reluctance we,</l>
               <l>Have truckt our forfeit Consciences for thee:</l>

               <l>Seeing the wretch with too much Grief o'relaid,</l>

               <l>As bad or worse than we have done before;</l>

               <l>Who were but under-Actors in the thing;</l>
               <l>Then what do we deserve, whose wit and brain</l>
               <l>Contriv'd the Plot and every private Scene?</l>
               <l>For though a Conquest always is obtain'd,</l>
               <l>And by each Souldier's single valour gain'd;</l>
               <l>Yet those who did command and lead them on,</l>
               <l>Share all the open Honour and Renown.</l>
               <l>Ye were our Instruments, and Drudges too;</l>
               <l>As <hi>Rumney, Keeling, Howard,</hi> were to you;</l>
               <l>Who when they brought about your own design,</l>
               <l>You left them to themselves to starve and pine:</l>
               <l>So we the grand projectors of the Plot,</l>
               <l>Who did to you your several parts allot,</l>
               <l>Having no farther Service to employ,</l>
               <l>Think fit, as useless Tools, to lay you by.</l>
               <l>Besides, what title or pretence have you,</l>
               <l>To any thing ye hold as right and due,</l>
               <l>Since they were setled first on us alone,</l>
               <l>And could no other Lords and Masters own;</l>
               <l>Till ye by Rapine, Sacrilege and Force,</l>
               <l>Discas'd us of our Rights and made them yours?</l>
               <l>Nor can a Case more Legal e're appear,</l>
               <l>At Court of Conscience, or at Chanc'ry Barr,</l>
               <l>Than what ye did by violence obtain,</l>
               <l>Should to their ancient Lords return again.</l>
               <l>But that which you so much insist upon,</l>
               <l>Your boasted Loyalty and Service done,</l>
               <l>From whence ye most erroneously inferr'd,</l>
               <l>The Justice of your Claim to a Reward,</l>
               <l>Is a meer trifle and a weak defence,</l>
               <l>With no validity of Consequence;</l>
               <l>For there's no reason he should be repaid,</l>
               <l>Who undesignedly a Kindness did;</l>
               <l>When all the while his thoughts were fix'd upon</l>
               <l>His own advancement and increase alone;</l>
               <l>And all the profit that to me he brings,</l>
               <l>Is by the bye and natural course of things.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:36411:118"/>'Twas rancour, envy, meer revenge and spite,</l>
               <l>That made ye thus against Fanaticks fight;</l>
               <l>And the dear dread of losing all ye had,</l>

               <l>The King might have been banish'd, hang'd or drown'd,</l>
               <l>E're Succour or Relief from you have found.</l>
               <l>But matters and affairs as yet are not</l>
               <l>To such a difficult Conjuncture brought,</l>
               <l>But that an handsome fetch may bring ye off</l>
               <l>With Honour and Security enough:</l>
               <l>One gentle turn will all the business do,</l>
               <l>Advance your Livings and secure them too;</l>
               <l>Safe ye shall lie from all Fanatick harms,</l>
               <l>Encircled in your Mother-Churches Arms,</l>
               <l>From which ye've stray'd so long, and now to whom</l>
               <l>Ye ought in duty and respect to come.</l>
               <l>The mournfull <hi>Levite</hi> straight prick'd up his Ears,</l>
               <l>As glad that things were better than his fears,</l>
               <l>And joyfull heard what means the Priest had found,</l>
               <l>That might for his dear Benefice compound,</l>
               <l>Compos'd his Band, and wip'd his blubber'd Cheeks,</l>
               <l>Stood up again, and thus demurely speaks.</l>
               <l>The Proverb to my case I may apply,</l>
               <l>Winners may justly laugh, and losers cry:</l>
               <l>For when I thought my Livelihood was gone,</l>
               <l>It was no wonder that I so took on;</l>
               <l>As 'tis none now, Smiles should my gladness shew,</l>
               <l>For these good tydings I receive from you;</l>
               <l>Therefore, dear Sir, let us our Hearts combine,</l>
               <l>And both in league against Dissenters joyn.</l>
               <l>My self I under your tuition place,</l>

               <l>Stood up to speak and to compleat the Jest:</l>
               <l>But glowing Anger had so now prevail'd,</l>
               <l>That in the first attempt he stopp'd and fail'd;</l>
               <l>And when he found his Tongue to be confin'd,</l>
               <l>He made his active Hands declare his Mind.</l>
               <l>The one engag'd the <hi>Levite</hi> on the place,</l>
               <l>And with the Directory smote his Face.</l>
               <l>Confounded with the Stroke he stagger'd round,</l>

               <l>T'other he laid directly o'er the Chest,</l>
               <l>Sent Ecchoes from the hollow Breast of Priest,</l>
               <l>Who stumbling as he went to take his flight,</l>

               <l>Unpitied, unbewail'd by every Eye;</l>
               <l>May after-Ages your curst Names deride,</l>
               <l>As we your damn'd Hypocrisies and Pride;</l>
               <l>No mark remain to know what ye have been,</l>
               <l>But the remembrance of your Curse and Sin;</l>
               <l>Which shall down time's continual Tide descend,</l>

               <l>That with his Soul his Body too might burn:</l>

               <l>Fine Ornaments indeed to cheat the Fair;</l>
               <l>And which is yet the strangest thing of all,</l>
               <l>He has not got a Friend to mourn his fall;</l>
               <l>But 'tis but just that he who still maintain'd,</l>
               <l>Disdain to all should be by all disdain'd:</l>
               <l>Had not the lazy Drone been quite as blind,</l>
               <l>Equally dim both in his Eye and Mind:</l>

                  <l>NOW the Reformer of the Court and Stage,</l>
                  <l>The common Beadle of this wilfull Age,</l>
                  <l>Has with impartial Hand whipt Soverain Sin,</l>
                  <l>In me it is but manners to begin.</l>
                  <l>To correct Vice keen Satyr may prevail</l>
                  <l>Beyond the Law, when preaching Blockheads fail:</l>
                  <l>For Law and Satyr from one Fountain flow:</l>
                  <l>Were not men vicious there would be no Law.</l>
                  <l>But to cry up his sawcy Cant and Rule,</l>
                  <l>For lawfull Satyr, proves the Witt or Fool.</l>
                  <l>To rail at States, and Monarchs ill entreat,</l>
                  <l>Then cry 'tis Good because the Subject's Great:</l>
                  <l>As Man were onely plac'd in Paradice,</l>
                  <l>To nibble on the Fruit on which he dies.</l>
                  <l>Can Owls and VVoodcocks with the Eagle play,</l>
                  <l>And not in danger to become a Prey?</l>

                  <l>For me to labour in a lower sphere</l>
                  <l>I think too much, yet it is safest there:</l>
                  <l>Nor do I covet matter to my Rhymes</l>
                  <l>The greatest Person, but the greatest Crimes.</l>
                  <l>VVhat is't to me, who keeps a Mis, who's VVed,</l>
                  <l>Or who got <hi>Carwell</hi>'s costly Maidenhead:</l>

                  <l>VVhat Lord was drunk, or Lady — last night.</l>
                  <l>These are the crying Crimes; yet one may do</l>

                  <l>VVho lately Lord Lieutenant of a Realm,</l>
                  <l>Seem'd a good Pilot while he sat at Helm;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:36411:129"/>But when he was depos'd, he overthrew</l>
                  <l>His Master's Cause and sided with the Crew.</l>
                  <l>Now <hi>B—d</hi> he had much the worst o'th' lay,</l>
                  <l>Having more Wit or honesty than they,</l>
                  <l>Sneakt off and left the Club, his Game to play.</l>
                  <l>Who after he had led them to the Porch,</l>
                  <l>Like <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he left them in the lurch:</l>
                  <l>At such a juncture of a time as odly,</l>
                  <l>As <hi>Peyton</hi> for his Highness left the Godly;</l>
                  <l>Or <hi>Escrick Howard</hi> to become a bawler,</l>
                  <l>Withdrew from Court to cry up active <hi>Waller.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>These are the Men who all the bustle make,</l>
                  <l>And Empire check meerly for Empire sake.</l>
                  <l>They lay their stamp on the revolting Darling,</l>
                  <l>And in the Club make Treason pass for Sterling.</l>
                  <l>There are some other Beagles in this pack,</l>
                  <l>That make a noise the Royal Chase to back;</l>
                  <l>But when a Mastiff opens in the dark,</l>
                  <l>The little Dogs will shake their tails and bark:</l>
                  <l>And though the foremost Hound but start the Hare,</l>
                  <l>The rest will mouth it as they claim'd a share:</l>
                  <l>Who follow by the scent, and scarce have sense</l>
                  <l>To judge 'twixt Treason and Allegiance;</l>
                  <l>As Fops meet in a Pit to damn a Play,</l>
                  <l>Not as they know, but by what others say.</l>
                  <l>Unmeaning Fools, who something to be at,</l>
                  <l>Follow the leading Cuckow, like the Batt;</l>
                  <l>And justly merit as they are despis'd,</l>
                  <l>Rather to be rejected than chastis'd.</l>
                  <l>So bawling <hi>H—n</hi> and <hi>K—</hi> the mute,</l>
                  <l>With Noise and Nonsense fill up the Dispute;</l>
                  <l>And while the Club proclaims the lawless strife,</l>
                  <l>One is the Drum, and t'other is the Fife.</l>
                  <l>What shall we say of <hi>Fa—ge, Br—er,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Or <hi>C—ry,</hi> or dull <hi>D—gh</hi> shall I flatter;</l>
                  <l>Who in the Synod drudge like Gally-slaves,</l>
                  <l>And buy the Stock to make a Gleek of Knaves.</l>

                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:36411:130"/>Like Beasts insensible of wrong they stray,</l>
                  <l>And find a Pound quitting the King's Highway.</l>
                  <l>And now behold in triumph to their Follies,</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Noll</hi>'s old Coach of State comes sneaking <hi>H—s.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Who sold the Father by an old Commission,</l>

                  <l>When <hi>B—rd</hi> civilly had made his legg,</l>
                  <l>The Club engender'd and brought forth an Egg;</l>
                  <l>Which like Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> for a quick dispatch,</l>
                  <l>Hot <hi>Monsieur Parliament</hi> must sett and Hatch.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>R—ly</hi> began to puff and shake his Noddle,</l>
                  <l>And told them in plain terms the Brood was addle;</l>
                  <l>That to a Rump he never more would give</l>
