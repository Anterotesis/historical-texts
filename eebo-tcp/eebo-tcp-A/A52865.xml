         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Sir, I have nourisht in my self a continual care of seeking opportunities to do you service.</p>
            <p>Sir, You have so pursued me with your favors, that I am capable of no other pleasure, but to entertain them.</p>
            <p>Sir, Such is your deserts and my necessity, that I want both words and services to express how unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly I honor you.</p>
            <p>Sir, Your bounties have been showr'd upon me with such excess, that I am uncapable of a Complement.</p>

            <p>Sir, Your goodness hath forced me to a silence, that I am not able to render you sufficient thanks for so great a favor.</p>
            <p>Sir, You are so highly generous, that I am altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sencesess.</p>

            <p>Sir, I have made a vow to honor you all my life, and not to remit one point of the passion I have to do you service.</p>
            <p>Sir, I am daily in disquiet, and shall be, till some occasion be offered me suddenly wherein I may appear to you to be more than verbal.</p>
            <p>Sir, This tyranny of your humor or inclination, is too great a punishment for me to groan under.</p>
            <p>Sir, 'Tis my ambition to conserve the Honor I have obtained of being your servant.</p>

            <p>Sir, I am grown jealous of your generosity, your favors come so fast on me, that I shall be forced to seem ingrateful.</p>
            <p>Sir, Your passions are mine; Nor can I live more in freedom, than when I am bound to you in the bonds of Friendship.</p>

            <p>Sir, It is the design of my Ambition to be passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately your most faithful servant.</p>
            <p>Sir, The pleasure I have in your love, and the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my own innocency, hath caused me to give this new remembrance of my being wholly yours.</p>

            <p>Sir, Your suit is an impertinent trouble to us both, for be assured it is as possible for the Stars to forget their course, as for me to love you.</p>
            <p>Sir, Nothing shall rob my heart of the fair image of your Vertues, but Death it self.</p>

            <p>Sir, The late courtesies you did me, are but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, and like an honest Tenant, I shall provide my Rent against the time of your demand.</p>

            <p>Sir, I have a new life in being yours, your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness gives me a new creation.</p>
            <p>Sir, Futurity shall crown the Reliques of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored Ashes with Palms and Laurels.</p>
            <p>Sir, I shall not hold my self absent from you, whilst I retain any room in your heart and memory.</p>
            <p>Sir, You are the heir of a rich inheritance, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your Vertue entitles you to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Sir, 'Tis no wonder there is so little goodness in the world, since by the rich stock of Vertue that rests in you, others are become bankrupts!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63258:9"/>Sir, I owe my good Fortune to your favourable assistance.</p>
            <p>Sir, My wishes go along with your endeavours, may your desires be happily performed.</p>
            <p>Sir, I should prove cruel to my self, should I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect one that nobly loves me.</p>
            <p>Sir, Forbear your hasty protestations, I do believe your soul's without a blemish, and I glory in my choice.</p>
            <p>Sir, Leave your superfluous Language, I am none of those Ladies that are enamoured with flattering Acrosticks; or to have their names so dis-jointed in an Anagram, 't would puzzle ten Magicians to set them together again.</p>
            <p>Sir, You have a good smack at Poetry, and I grant you too, Love and Poesie are divine, commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused together; yet 'tis ordinarily tyed to rules of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>Sir, Your Oratory makes me suspect your faith, let it suffice I love you; Nor shall it be long ere <hi>Hymen</hi> shall seal the Contract.</p>

            <p>Madam, Your features bound me in fetetrs as soon as first I saw them, and the excellent endowments of your minde hath since retained me not onely your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, but your servant.</p>
            <p>Madam, You are the Epitome of Nature, in whom is comprised all that favours of what is sweet or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>Madam, give me leave to call you mine, and one day the effect shall be your own.</p>
            <p>Dear Madam, spake once more, Angels will listen to the Musick of your Voice.</p>
            <p>Madam, you have laid a charm upon my soul, my senses are captivated by the incomparable Harmony of your hand and voice.</p>

            <p>Madam, It is the glory of great minds, to forgive great faults, and upon the acknowledgement of my error, you cannot finde an object more deserving your compassion.</p>
            <p>Madam, May your own Vertues attend you ever, that you may continue as faithful to me, as I esteem you dear.</p>
            <p>Madam, The chiefest grief I bear with me from this place, is the sence of leaving my heart where I cannot stay my self.</p>
            <p>Madam, I have a heart, but it is worn in your brest.</p>
            <p>Dear Madam, Conceal not your eyes from me, they are the two bright stars by which the Barque of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections steer's to the wish'd for shore of my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>

From whence come these suggestions of yours, that things will look hereafter with a worser face, and that you fear your condition will have an ill change? Do you hold intelligence with heaven? Or can you divine, or dive into the hidden mysteries, or secret cabinet of a Deity?
