            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HERE thou hast some Remains of the Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> late of <hi>Chichester;</hi> Those that knew him say, that he was a man endued with the wisdom that is from above, that is first pure, and then peaceable, gentle, (meek, moderate,) and easie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without hypocrisie; therefore it is conceived that any thing which he had designed for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick use, may be well accepted of, by all those that desire to follow after peace with all men, so far as is consistent with purity: Whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of these Remains of his be not to vindicate the truth, and to promote purity first, and then peace, is left to thee to judg after thou hast im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially perused and considered them in the
<pb facs="tcp:64712:3"/>
fear of God; and if in any measure they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to so good an end, it is hoped thou wilt be thankful to God for the benefit which the Church of Christ, and therein thy felf, mayst receive by the use of them. Thou hast them just as they were left under his own hand; if himself had lived to publish them, thou mightest possibly have had them in some better method: but it is not thought sit that any other person should take upon him to alter any thing in them.</p>

            <head>The Nonconformists Plea for Lay-Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>NOtwithstanding my Nonconformity, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of my Ministry in that state, I am inclined upon the following considerarions to have communion with Parish-Churches in the worship of God, at those times in which our own Congregations do not require my presence therein.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I own Parish-Churches, having a competent Minister, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of credible Professors of Christianity, for true Churches, and the Worship there performed, as well in the Liturgy or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, as in the preaching of the word, and prayer before and after Sermon, to be in the main sound and good for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or matter thereof. And I may not disown the same in my practice by a total neglect thereof, for my judgment and practice ought to be concordant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho I judg their form of Worship to be in many respects less perfect than is to be desired; yet I have found my heart spiritually affected and raised towards God therein, and more especially in the receiving of the Lords Supper. I judg that this form may be used formally by the Formal, and spiritually by those that are Spiritual. It is my part to make the the best of it, being the Established Form.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am desirous of joining, as far as I may, with all Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions worshipping God in Christ, out of my high regard to all Christian Worship, and out of my love to the communion of Saints universally, and a desire to testifie that I am a truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christian.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64712:4"/>
4. Tho I am constrained by force of conscience to be among those that dissent from the enjoined Conformity; yet my design and business is not to advance a severed party as such, but true Christianity or godliness among all that profess the Christian Faith, and what in me lies to keep up a Reverend esteem of Gods Ordinances celebrated among them all.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Tho I have reason to have a very tender regard to those that own and accept my Ministry, for their edification and satisfaction, yet by ways of love and concord I am to seek the edification of others also, while I lay no stumbling-block before the one or the other sort.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Against the putting of this intention in practice, I meet with these Objections.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. I may seem a contradiction to my self, and to justifie what I disallow, having refused to give my assent and consent to all and every thing contained in the Book of Common-Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The denying of assent and consent to all and every thing contained in that Book, doth not gainsay the lawfulness of parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in that Worship, it being sound for the substance in the main, and the mode thereof being laudable in divers forms and orders, and passable in the most, though in some offensive, inconvenient, or less perfect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The chief matters for which I refuse to declare an assent as is enjoined, lye not in rhe ordinary Morning and Evening Prayer, but in other parts, as the Order of Baptism, Confirmation, Burial of the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in certain Rubricks or Rules to which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subscribe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. It is to countenance a more defective and inconvenient way of worship, and it tends to the rooting of others in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and to the encreasing of their number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. My partaking in any Divine worship which is holy and good for the matter, and allowable or passable for the mode in the main, doth not involve me in the blame of some sinful defects therein, to which I consent not, and which I cannot redress.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do not acquiesce in this Form of worship only, nor do I by my example induce others so to do, seeing in other Congregations I both dispence and attend upon the word and prayer in another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rm, and judg it necessary for me so to do.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64712:4"/>
3. It is to me indubitable that this form is so far profitable and edifying, as that meerly for the defects found therein, there is no cause of renouncing it, or the Communion of the Churches for its sake, especially while other prayer and the preaching of the word is not there by excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. It is against our engagements for reformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. I am engaged to indeavour reformation only according to my power and calling, and this practise doth not gainsay my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the same within those limits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My engagement to indeavours of reformation, doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate me to unwarrantable separation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My engagement to indeavours of reformation, doth also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me against Schism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. It will offend (that is to say, displease) many of my own side.</p>
               <p>An. 1. They have no reason to be more offended with me for practising according to my principle, than I am offended with them for practising according to theirs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a trouble to me to do any thing in Religion, displeasing to those that are seriously religious, and more especially to those that own my Ministry, and suffer under the same impositions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which I do; but I may not sin for their sakes by a renouncing of true Churches, or by a perpetual neglect of communion with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. It may prove an occasion of raising a greater enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against those that cannot be satisfied to partake in this worsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p, yea, it may stir up a greater severity against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> This objection (if that which is suggested in it be true) is of great mdment, for I must have a tender regard to conscientious brethren and must not use my liberty to be an occasion of their suffering. But to this I say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The moderate judgment and practise of some (who in the mean time have maintained their plea for reformation, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Ministry according to their capacities and opportunities) hath been advantagious to the general interest of Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If so bad a consequence should indeed follow, as is objected, I would for that season forbear the said use of my liberty, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with my brethren in their sufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64712:5"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6. It may weaken my own party, and make many of them more indifferent towards reformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. I disclaim being of a party as such: I confine not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness to any peculiar way narrower than mere Christianity. If any among us place their Religion in being of a party, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their own souls, and it behoves me being a Teacher among them to let them understand so much.</p>
               <p n="2">2. While I use my liberty, and shew my moderation and charity towards all true Churches, I do not shew an indifferency towards all opinions, and forms, and constitutions, but by word and deed I manifest a desire and indeavour of the best constitution, that hath the greatest tendency to make the best Christians, and to advance holiness and peace in the Churches</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 7. It may raise suspiti ons that I may proceed further in Conformity, and that I am but a lukewarm Nonconformist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. The Kingdom of God stands not either in Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Nonconformity as such.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I desire that my zeal in the matter of Nonconformity may be proportionable, that is neither more nor less than the thing it self requires.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I am not willing to stand at a greater distance from others than I needs must.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How ready soever I am to pursue peace and concord, I am not like to conform, till the grounds of my Nonconformity, which are with me of great weight, be removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 8. Hereby I may lose or lessen my reputation and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest among those of my own side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. My reputation and interest among men, must give place to the pleasing of God, and the keeping of a good conscience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To me the most valuable benefit of reputation is an advantage thereby gained of being acceptable and successful towards men in the work of the Ministry; and that which is most advantagious hereunto, is the reputation of integrity, and to do all things ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly, honestly, peaceably, without partiality, hypocrisie and felfishness, is the best means of such reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 9. It will not please those of the other side, unless I absolutely conform; and it may be some of them will despise and hate me the more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64712:5"/>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. My design is not man pleasing, and I think it looks not like such; I were very ill advised indeed, if while I venture the displeasing of my own, I should aim at the pleasing of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent party.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reference to the other side, my design is not to please them, but to convince them, that what in me lies, I follow after Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace and concord, and that the cause of the divisions that are, lies not on my part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tho on the Conforming side there may be some, who hate those most that come nearest to Conformity, if they are not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row therein; yet there be others, who are more valuable, that are of a better spirit, with whom my moderation may have good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob:</hi> 10. It may hazard a breach in our own congregation, and the dissolution thereof, as things now stand with us, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder the good of souls, that is now gained by the word and prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. Indeed such an evil is carefully to be avoided in this time of our difficulty and danger; but I rationally hope that it will not so fall out: Our friends are not ignorant of the latitude of my principle, and the practise here propounded will' be no great surprisal to them, it being no more than what I declared that I did before I came to my present station among them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I shall keep a watchful eye upon this concern; if I see any distemper that threatens a breach arising upon this occasion, I will for a while suspend my liberty, and I wil proceed herein no otherwise than they can bear, I will be calm and gentle towards them, and not carry it peremptorily in any wise. And this I shall do not for my own private ends (the Searcher of hearts knows) but sincerely for their good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I will by degrees insinuate into them the equity of their bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me in my perswasions, as I bear with them in theirs, and of allowing me the liberty of my own acts in things that concern my self alone, when in such acts as concern the society, I do nothing without their consent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it should come to pass that they will impose upon me what is not fit for me to comply with; in that case, I will not violently break from, nor stay to make breaches among them, but quickly withdraw my self.</p>

            <head>A Defence of my Endeavours for the Work of the MINISTRY.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT I might not be wanting to my just Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this Cause, I hold my self obliged to present the aforesaid Defence to the consideration of all impartial Readers: it takes its rise from the several heads of the Bishops charge against me, all which were owned by himself before many Witnesses, and are here set down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That forasmuch as I did not exercise the Ministry in subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Bishop, and as regulated by him, I transgressed against the nature of my Office, as not being the Office of a Pastor menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That I violate my oaths and promises which I made at my Ordination, to obey the Bishop or Ordinary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That I trespass against the Right of the Bishop, upon the account of exercising the Ministry where he is the Pastor.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That I make a Schism in the Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That I violate the Authority of the Civil Magistrate.</p>
            <p>To these particulars, the several Heads of my Defence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are a direct Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That I have received from Christ the Office of a Pastor mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Eph. 4. 11. <hi>and that I am bound in my present state to fulfil it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That I am not obliged either by the nature of my Office, or by any oath or promise, or by being under the regulation of Authority, to exercise my Ministry no otherwise than as in subordination to, and as authorised and regulated by the Bishop of the Diocess.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That I invade not the Right of the Diocesan Bishop in exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Ministry where he claims the right of being the Pastor.</hi>

               <head>§ 1. That I have received from Christ, the Office of a Pastor, mentioned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. And that I am bound in my present state to fulfil it.</head>
               <p>THE Ministry that I have received, is the sacred office of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterate, to which I am ordained according to the form of Ordination that was established in the Church of England.</p>
               <p>That this office is of divine right, I take for granted; and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture it is the office of a Pastor, mentioned <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. I thus prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wheresoever this office is set forth in the Scripture, it is set forth as the office of a spiritual Pastor or Bishop, which is to feed the Flock of God by teaching and ruling it: And a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who is a sacred Officer of the Christian Church, but not a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or Pastor, is no where mentioned in Scripture. If it be said, that this Office is otherwise set forth in Scripture, or that a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, who is a sacred Officer of the Christian Church, yet no Bishop, is there mentioned, let the Assertor shew the place or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>If it be said, that this Order of Presbyterate may be of divine inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tution, yet not defined or expressed in Scripture, I desire sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory proof from some other Authority; both of its being of divine institution, and what its nature is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have the Power of the keys of binding and loosing, of remitting and retaining sins in Christs name, as his commissioned officer, is to have Episcopal or Pastoral Power, and this Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the said Office of Presbyterate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64712:7"/>
Forasmuch as some distinguish the Power of the keys into that which is in <hi>in foro interiore,</hi> or the Court of Conscience within, and that which is <hi>in foro exteriore,</hi> in the exterior Court, to wit, that of the Church; the former of which is said to belong to the Bishop and the Presbyter, and the latter to the Bishop only. I further inforce my argument; 1. The Scripture makes no such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction; and where the Law distinguisheth not, we may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish. 2. The distinction in this case is vain, for all power that belongs to the Pastors of the Church, purely respects the Conscience, and it respects the Conscience as having the conduct of the outward man, and that in reference to Church communion, as well as other matters. 3. If Presbyters may in the name of Christ, bind the impenitent, and loose the penitent as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which is the greater and primary binding and loosing, then by parity of reason, and that with advantage, they may bind and loose as to Church-communion, which is the lesser secondary and subsequent binding and loosing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Officer is a Pastor or Bishop, that hath a power of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative declaring or judging in Christs name, that this or that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked person in particular is unworthy of fellowship with Christ and his Church, and of charging the congregation in Christs name, not to keep company with him, as being no fit member of a Christian so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; &amp; also a Power of <hi>authoritative declaring</hi> or <hi>judging</hi> in Christs Name, that the same person repenting of his wickednes, and giving evidence thereof, is meet for fellowship with Christ and his Church, and of requiring the congregation in Christs Name again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into their Christian fellowship; for these powers are no other than the powers of Excommunication and Ecclesiastical ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: Now the Presbyter hath apparently the said Powers, as he can undoubtedly declare, and judg, and charge as aforesaid, touching this or that person or particular; all particulars being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the general, he hath undoubtedly a Power of applying the Word in Christs Name as well personally as generally.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the further clearing of what is already argued, let it be considered, that an Authoritative Teacher in the Church commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by Christ, is also a Pastor; for the government of a Pastor is only by the Spiritual Sword, which is the Word of God; and the discipline which he exercises, is no more than the personal applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same word to judg the impenitent, and to absolve the penitent in Christs Name; and he that Authoritatively teaches
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64712:8"/>
in Christs Name (as the Presbyter doth) can do so much in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Application of the Word.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Pastoral Authority of Presbyterate is further cleared by many passages in the publick forms of the Church of England touching that order.</p>
               <p>In the very form of my ordination according to the ancient use of this Church, I received the office of a Pastor and Successor of the Apostles; I mean not in their Apostolick but Pastoral office: The form was this, Receive the holy Ghost; whose sins thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittest, they are remitted; and whose sins thou retainest, they are retained; and be thou a faithful dispenser of the Word of God, and his Holy Sacraments, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Amen.</hi> Now the former part hereof is intirely and compleatly the form of Words used by our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 22, 23. towards the Apostles, expressing their Pastoral Authority; and the latter part, Be tbou a faithful dispenser, &amp;c. is no derogation or diminution from the Power granted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part. If the Presbyters are not the Apostles successors in the Pastoral Authority, how could they have right to that form of ordination?</p>
               <p>In the form of ordering Priests or Presbyters in one of the prayers after the mentioning of Christs sending abroad into the world, his Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists Doctors, &amp; Pastors, there follows thanksgiving to God for calling those that were then to be ordered Priests, to the same Office and Ministry of salvation of mankind. Whence it appears, that this Office is the same with some of the forementioned kinds. And what can it be but that of Doctors and Pastors?</p>
               <p>This Church did before the last alteration made <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. in solemn form of words require the Presbyters, when they were ordained, to exercise the discipline of Christ as the Lord hath commanded; and this Realm received the same according to the commandments of God.</p>
               <p>And that they might the better understand what the Lord hath commanded therein, this Church did appoint also, that at the ordering of Priests there be read for the Epistle that portion of, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. which relates St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sending to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Elders of the Congregation, with his exhortation to them to take heed to themselves, and to all the flock, among
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64712:8"/>
whom the Holy Ghost hath made them Overseers, to rule the congregation of God. Or else 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, which sets forth the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and due qualifications of a Bishop. These portions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this Church appointed to be read to the Presbyters, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their Office, and to instruct them in the nature of it. And afterwards the Bishop speaks to them that are to receive the office of Priesthood in this form of words. <hi>You have heard, brethren, as well in your private examination, as in the exhortation and the holy lessons taken out of the Gospel, and the Writings of the Apostles, of what dignity, and of how great importance this Office is whereunto ye are called</hi>—That is to say, the Messengers, the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Pastors and Stewards of the Lord, to teach, to premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, to seed, to provide for the Lords Family.</p>
               <p>I acknowledg that the passages here alledged are taken out of the old Book of Ordination, that was established in this Church till the late alterations made <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. if those alterations sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie another meaning about the several Holy Orders than what was signified in the old Book, then the sense of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in these times differs from the sense of the same Church in all times preceding the said Alterations; but if they signifie no other meaning than what was signified in the old Book, my cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are of force to shew what is the sense of this Church, as well of the present as of the former times about this matter.</p>
               <p>Here I must take notice, that in opposition to part of what hath been alledged, it was asserted, That that part of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. which contains the office and qualification of a Bishop, was read at the Ordination of Presbyters, not because it belonged to their Office, but because it was joyned with that which follows touching the office of a Deacon, then likewise read as properly concerning the office of a Presbyter, pretended to be no other than the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con there mentioned.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, If the Presbyter in the Church of <hi>England</hi> be indeed no other than the Deacon spoken of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. it see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> strange that this Church, yea and the Universal Church, should so miscall an Officer, as to give him a name, <hi>viz. Presbyter,</hi> which the Scripture always appropriates to another Officer (as is pretended) and to neglect the Scripture name of this Office, <hi>viz.</hi> Deacon. It is strange that an Officer said to be no other than the Deacon there spoken of, should have the power of the keys, the same form of Ordination which Christ used towards his Apostles. If it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64712:9"/>
were so, it is likewise strange that the qualifications of the said Deacon should be appointed to be read at the Ordination of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as properly belonging to him; and also at the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Deacon inferior to a Presbyter, as properly belonging to him, the former part of the Chapter touching a Bishop, being omitted. Besides all this, the new Book of Ordination puts the matter out of doubt, and evidently refutes the aforesaid evasion. For in it the latter part of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. beginning at verse 8. touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Office of Deacon, is appointed to be read at the ordering of Deacons; and the same is not appointed to be read at the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Priests, but another portion of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> Eph 4. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Furthermore, if the Deacon mentioned in <hi>Timothy</hi> be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the subject Presbyter, I would know in what place of Scripture the Deacon of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> inferior to a Presbyter, is set forth. And be it noted, that the Deacon of this Church is not so much the Deacon of Tables, as of the Word; and therefore a Presbyter must needs be degraded in being made no more than a Deacon of the Word.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have insisted on the nature of my Office, and have proved it to be the Office of a Pastor. Now I proceed to prove, That in my present state I am bound to fulfil it.</p>
               <p>Being dedicated to this Ministry, I stand under a perpetual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to fulfil it, according to my ability and opportunity, and as the necessity of souls requireth of me. And whatsoever some think, the thing is most evident, That the souls of men cry aloud for all the help that can possibly be given them by those whom Christ hath qualified and called to the work of the Ministry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r Conformists or Nonconformists.</p>
               <p>This apprehension reflects no dishonour upon conscientious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Ministers, for whose ability and industry I bless God. But the number of them is not so proportionable to the people of this Land, as to make the labours of those that are cast out, to be needless. The harvest is great, and the labourers are too few.</p>
               <p>As for this City, in which are six Parishes within the Gates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides two in the Suburbs, I leave it to the consideration of those that know the state thereof, whether there be sufficient care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the preaching of the Gospel; when as there is no setled preaching on the Lords days, or week days, in any of the Parish Churches. The Parish in which I dwell, hath for many years had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64712:9"/>
no Minister at all, and the two Parishes without the Gates for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years have had neither Ministers nor Churches, in one of which is the house that was licensed by his Majesty for our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The only setled preaching is at the Cathedral, performed sometimes by the Superior Clergy, but mostly by a greater number of others in their courses, who generally living at a distance, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so well known to the people as their appointed Teachers ought to be; and let them that know the place of preaching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and judg, whether it can contain the inhabitants, if all should repair thither.</p>
               <p>I pass not to be despised or judged by them, who make slight work of the cure of Souls, for whom Christ hath given himself a ransom: Certainly they are more precious than to be exposed to perish for lack of sufficient instruction and exhortation, rather than preachers authorized by Christ, if silenced by men, when not disobedient to any ordinance prescribed by his word, should speak to them that they might be saved. The necessary means of saving souls, such as is the due publick preaching of the Gospel, together with personal instruction, is incomparably more valuable than the maintaining of uniformity in little opinions, and ceremonies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidental forms and orders.</p>

               <p>THIS Head hath Three distinct Branches to be distinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whereof the first is, That I am not obliged by the Nature of my Office to exercise my Ministry no otherwise than in subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to, and as authorized and regulated by the Bishop of the Diocess.</p>

1. The Nature of this Office doth not require it either in reason, or from the declared will of Christ: first not in reason, for there is evidently no reason in the nature of the office, beng the office of a Bishop or Pastor, that it cannot be exercised but in subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to a Diocesan Bishop: if any say that there is, let him shew it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Christ who is the Author and only proper giver of all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual authority in the Church, hath not either by himself, or by the Mediation of the Apostles, so defined or limited the aforesaid office of Presbytetate, as that it can be exercised no otherwise, than in the aforesaid subordination. If any one affirm that Christ hath so defined or limited it, it rests upon him to make proof of it.</p>
               <p>If it be urged, that I have no power but what I received by the Ordainers, and that is a power of administring only in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said subordination. I answer, 1. I have already proved that by the very form of my ordination I received the office of a Pastor and Successor of the Apostles in their Pastoral office. 2. Tho Christ give the ordinary spiritual power, and particularly that of Presbyters in some respect by the mediation of men, yet he gives it not by them as giving the power, but as instruments either of designing the person to whom he gives it, or of the solemn inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture of that person, as the King is the immediate giver of the power of a Mayor in a Town Corporate, when he gives it by the mediation of the Electors, not as giving the power, but designing the person to be invested with it, or by the mediation of some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as instruments of the solemn investiture <hi>3ly,</hi> For asmuch as the ordainer or ordainers that designed me to this office of Christs Donation, could not by any act of theirs inlarge or lesson it as to its Nature or Essential State, or define it otherwise, than it is stated by Christ in his word; in case such words were pronounced out of the Book of ordination (I say not that they were, but in case they were) as import a lessening of the office in its essential state, they are void and null. If a Minister, that joyns a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Marriage according to the true intent of that ordinance, shall add other words that forbid the husband the government of his wife, that addition is a nullity.</p>

2. I am not obliged by any Oath or Promise, to exercise my Ministry no otherwise than as in subordination to the Bishop of the Diocess.</p>
               <p>I acknowledg that when I was ordain'd, I made those promisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Answers to the Bishops Interrogatories, which are contained in the Book of Ordination that then was. But, 1. let it be considered, that if the said interrogatories and answers, or any of them, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced any limitation upon the Office, that takes away any thing essential to it, (I say not that they did, but in case they did) they were nullities. 2. The promise then made to obey my Ordinary, and other chief Ministers to whom the government and charge over me is committed, concerns me only as a Presbyter standing in relation to the Bishop, as one of the Clergy of the Diocess, which I now am not, being cast out of that relation, and made uncapable of it; and consequently the said capacity ceasing, the obligation c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aeth. 3. The said promise must be understood either unlimitedly, or with limitation; if unlimitedly, it was a sinful promise in the matter thereof, and therefore void; if with limitation, as in things lawful and honest, then I have not broken it; for it is not lawful nor honest for me to desist from fulfilling the Ministry that I have received, if the Ordinary so require.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor am I obliged as aforesaid by being under the regulation of Authority. I Treely acknowledg, that in the exercise of my Ministry I am not exempt from the Regulation of any just Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Authority in the Church (as for the Civil Authority, it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wards to be spoken of) whether it be by way of government, or of agreement.

               <head>§ 3. That I invade not the Right of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishop in exercising the Ministry, where he claims the Right of being the Pastor.</head>
               <p>HERE lest my sense of Episcopacy be mistaken, I judg it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to premise, 1. That I fully own the Scripture-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or Evangelical Pastor. 2. That I do not disown the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy that was of ancient Ecclesiastical custom in the time of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> yea or of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> 3. That Bishop <hi>Ushers</hi> Model of Church-government by Arch-bishops and bishops, with their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, was offered to his Majesty by the Divines of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian persuasion (as they were called) for a ground-work of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation between the Bishops and them. And I assent to the offer which they made. 4. After the same manner I assent to the state of Episcopacy as described by K <hi>Charls</hi> the first in his discourse touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the differences between Himself and the Two Houses in the point of Church-government, in these words: <hi>That he is not against the managing of the Episcopal Presidency in one man, by the counsel and consent of many Presbyters; but that he had offered to restore it, as a fit means to avoid those errors, and corruptions, and partialities, which are incident to any one man; also to avoid Tyranny, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes no Christian, least of all Church-men; besides, it will be a means to take away that odium and burden of affairs which may lye too heavy on one mans shoulders, as he thought it did formerly on the Bishops here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I do not as yet discern the divine Right of Episcopacy in the state and priviledges thereof here following, wherein I desire information, and would gladly receive satisfaction, if there be such divine Rights indeed. None can be justly offended with me for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining in my own defence that Right which I am accused to have invaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64712:11"/>
do not discern that a Bishop <hi>infimi gradus,</hi> I mean one that hath none under him but Parish-Ministers, who are pretended to have no Episcopal governing-power, I say I discern not that such a Bishop can by divine Right challenge to himself alone the Episcopal Authority over hundreds of particular Churches. For every particular Church should have its proper Pastor or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>
               <p>And particular Churches with their proper Pastors, are so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently of Divine Right, that some eminently learned men in the Church of <hi>England</hi> have declared their judgment, That no Form of Church-government besides the meer Pastoral Office and Church-assemblies, is prescribed in the Word of God, but may be various, according to the various condition and occasion of several Churches.</p>
               <p>Neither do I discern, how it is possible for one man to do the work of a bishop towards hundreds of Churches, I mean the work of a bishop <hi>infimi gradus,</hi> under whom there are no subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Bishops or Pastors. For the work of such a bishop is to oversee all the Flock, to preach to them all, to baptize and confirm all that are to be baptized and confirmed, to administer the Lords Supper to all, to bless the Congregation, publickly and privataly to admonish all as their need requires; to excommunicate the impenitent, to absolve the penitent, and that upon knowledg of their particular estate.</p>
               <p>If such a Diocesan bishop saith, it sufficeth that he perform all this to the Flock by others, namely by the Parish-Ministers as his Curates, and by other Officers his Substitutes; it is answered, 1. That the Pastoral Authority is a personal trust. 2. It is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he shew his Commission from Christ the Prince of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, to do his work by others; for I am now inquiring what is of divine, and not of humane Right. 3. None but a bishop can do the proper work of a bishop.</p>
               <p>But if it be said, That the Parochial Congregations are not Churches, but only parts of the Diocess, which is the lowest particular Church: I desire proof from Scripture, That such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations as our Parishes, having their proper Presbyter or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters invested with the power of the keys, are not particular Churches properly so called. The reason of my desire of this proof is, because the Scripture is a perfect Rule for the Essential constitution of Churches, tho accidents there unto belonging may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64712:12"/>
be regulated by humane prudence. 2. It is most evident in Scripture, that a particular Congregation of Christians, having their proper Pastor or Pastors, Presbyter or Presbyters, are Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches properly so called: And a Parochial Minister I conceive to be a Pastor or Elder according to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Moreover if a Diocess containing a hundred, two hundred, five hundred, or a thousand Parishes (as somewhere it doth) do constitute but one particular Church, and those particular Parishes be not properly to be accounted Churches, but only so many parts of that one Diocesan Church, why may not ten thousand, yea ten times ten thousand Parishes be likewise accounted but one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and brought under one man as sole Bishop or Pastor thereof?</p>
               <p>In all this I have not argued against the right of an Arch-Bishop, or Overseer of other Bishops, such as <hi>Titus</hi> must needs be, if he were Bishop of <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te,</hi> where Bishops or Elders were to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in every City. If either Scripture, or Prudence guided by Scripture, be for such an office, I oppose it not, and nothing here spoken makes against it.</p>
               <p>If our Diocesan Bishops be in very deed Arch-Bishops or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Overseers of inferior Bishops, to wit, Parish-Ministers, I do not here argue against it, but only say, that in their, Archiepiscopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocess or Province they cannot exercise their authority any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than according to the rules of Gods word for the edification and peace of the Church, and that they cannot discharge the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Bishops from their obligation to Christ, whose immediate Ministers and Stewards they are, and to whom they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately accountable.</p>
               <p>Moreover I do not discern that any Bishop can by divine right so challenge or claim such a circuit of ground for his Diocess (as for example the County of <hi>Sussex)</hi> as that thereupon he can by the said right prohibit all other Pastors whatsoever to do the work of the Ministry in any case without his licence within such a circuit of ground, or that such a measure of ground is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Episcopal office as a propriety for government Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, like as certain territories, and dominions are as a propriety in reference to Civil government, related to the temporal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raingty of a Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64712:12"/>
The partition of one Church from another by local bounds, is not of divine institution, but of humane prudence from the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the thing; I say convenience, not absolute necessity; And the state of things may be such as to compel to vary from it in some particulars.</p>
               <p>It is supposed by learned men, that in the Apostles times there were several Churches at <hi>Rome</hi> under their several Bishops or Pastors in the same local bounds, as one of the Circumcision, and another of the Uncircumcision. And if it were not so <hi>de facto,</hi> I think few will deny but that it lawfully might have been so.</p>
               <p>If upon the aforesaid diversity of condition in the persons, namely, as being of different nations and languages, there may be several Churches under several Bishops or Pastors within the same local bounds, why not also upon other diversity of condition, which may render them as uncapable of being of the same parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, as if they were of divers nations? One instance may be an unmovable diversity of persuasions about points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>As for example, Why may not <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> of the same nation, town or village, have their several Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their several Pastors, and live in peace? Nothing could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the said peace, but want of Christian Humility and Charity. And consequently, why among us may not Christians that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible diversity of persuasions in matters of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment live peaceably within the same precincts in their several Churches?</p>
               <p>Besides all this, if the local bounds assigned for one mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Pastoral charge be so vast, and the multitude of Souls therein be so great as to render it impossible for any one man to fulfil that charge towards them, can it be judged an usurpation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst dwine right, if another Pastor without license from him should perform ministerial service within those bounds? Likewise let it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Is it an intrusion or usurpation, if in that case one that is dedicated to the work of the Ministry shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour without licence from the said neglecters, by preaching and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministerial service to save souls that are so exposed?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64712:13"/>
Furthermore, let it be considered how any Clergy-man can be the proper pastor of a people, that doth not the work of a pastor towards them, which work I have before set forth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I cast in this consideration also, how any Clergy-man can be the proper pastor to a people against their wills. I doubt not but a people may sin, yea, greatly sin in not receiving a pastor duly offered to them, and so they may as greatly sin by receiving such a pastor as may be imposed on them. But how any one can actually bear the pastor al relation to a people, that never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to that relation, I would be better informed.</p>
               <p>Thus it hath been examined, whether I am culpable by trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing against the divine right or rights of a Diocesan Bishop in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising the Ministry where he claims the right of being pastor. And it hath been examined in that form, which the matter being a tender point is capable of. As for his humane rights, they are his preeminence and jurisdiction under the King as Supreme, and to which he is intituled by the Law of the Land. Now I am no usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per against this; for I claim no such preeminence, I exercise no such jurisdiction. As for my obededience to his jurisdiction as an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer subordinate to the King, it shall be spoken of in its own place.</p>

               <head>§ 4. That I do not violate any true bonds of Church-Unity, nor in any respect cause divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and offences.</head>
               <p>THE Case of Schism now in controversie is not to be hudled up, but well stated, whereunto many considerations are prerequisite. Those that are set down, I take to be of moment: but the express application of them, I forbear, and doubt not but the considering and impartial Reader will excuse me therein; and judg that he himself can easily do that part with more convenience than I can in this writing. Church-Unity is not to be built upon the doctrines and ordinances of men, but upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief corner stone; and none are to be shut out from the Communlon of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64712:13"/>
Church, or the work of the Ministry, whom Christ hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but qualified and called thereunto according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are the rule of admission and exclusion from the said priviledges.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The unity of the spirit, which we are charged to keep in the bond of peace, is not concord in external forms and orders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out participation of the same new nature, and walking in the same holy way. It is said <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. One body, and one spirit, and one hope, one Lord, one faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all; but not one ceremony, one posture of body, one garb of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornaments, one habit of vestments, one ritual and unity of assent to all opinions and formalities: An holy fellowship in the spirit of grace, and in the life of faith and love, is far more excellent than the greatest complyance in ceremonies and unnecessary doctrines of doubtful disputations, and consequently, is far more regardable in that estimation and reception of persons either for Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or the holy Ministry.</p>
               <p>Touching Schism, let this be noted: It is not Secular power and interest, that of it self can constitute a true Church or Pastor, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> can it excuse those that are born up by it from Schism when they act Schismatically, and do all that they can to continue the snares of division; neither are all they without more a do to be accounted Schismaticks who are destitute of Secular power, and who cannot in all points observe the commandments of men, or neglect to give their necessary help in Christs service, when they are forbidden of men.</p>
               <p>Schism is the causing of divisions in or from the Church, as the Apostle sets it forth <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. Mark them that cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine that ye have learned: And let them be marked indeed whosoever they are. The guilt of it lies as much upon those that make unwarrantable separations; and they are most culpable that are the chief causes of the division; and such are they, who impose unlawful terms of Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nisterial liberty, and they also that rigorously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such terms thereof, as Christ and his Apostles never war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted them to impose, either expresly or by consequence.</p>
               <p>Let the case of such as are cast and kept out of a Church by wrong sentence, or by imposition of unlawful terms of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or unnecessary terms, that are unlawful to them by unremova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doubts of conscience, be considered, for such a case may be:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64712:14"/>
What shall they do? Must the unrighteousness of others be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual bar to them against the injoyment of those priviledges, to which they have a right before God? Why may they not lawfully injoy Gods ordinances in distinct assemblies, if they hold them peaceably and charitably?</p>
               <p>Let the case of such Ministers as are cast and kept out of the Ministry by the imposition of unlawful terms, or unnecessary terms that are unlawful to them by unremoveable doubts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, be considered, for this case also may be: What shall they do when they are under an obligation to Christ to fulfil their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; and when the necessities of fouls make theirs, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ministry to be necessary, and when all the help that can possibly be given both by them and by those that dissent from them, is little enough? Every pastor tho he be under the publick judgment of Superiors, hath a judgment of discretion also (that is to say, a right of discerning) about his own call a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d obligation to this service.</p>
               <p>Let it be here also considered, whether the necessary means of saving souls, such as is the due preaching of the Gospel, be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more precious than uniformity in matters of opinion and ceremony, and accidental order.</p>
               <p>There is a great difference between inimical segregation, like sedition in a Commonwealth; and a going severally upon weighty reasons, and without breach of charity: And among other weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reasons this may be one, That all Christians of sound faith and good life, that are dissatisfied about some humane injunctions and orders in a Church, may not for lack of tender regard towards them, be utterly abandoned and exposed to be led aside into the errôrs of the wicked, as to heresie, apostacy or a course of irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>It is in the power of Rulers to grant this Indulgence to such Dissenters, when it is not in the power of Dissenters to change their Judgments. And this is not to set up Church against Church, or according to an ancient manner of speaking, Altar against Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but only either occasional and temporary Assemblies, or at the most but divers Churches distinguished by their several places of Assembling, as one Parish-church from another; and by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of External Order, as the allowed Congregations of Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>London</hi> from the Parish churches. The same true Religion for the substance thereof, is exercised; and the same holy ends
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64712:14"/>
are pursued in the one and the other. And there will be no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition between them, but what an unchristian Enmity proceeding from Worldly lusts and interests will produce.</p>
               <p>If any object the inconveniencies that may follow the permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Church-Assemblies besides those of the established Order, I have this to reply: 1. Our Rulers may so provide, if the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot gainsay, that few may stand in need of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, in comparison of those that now do; and the way is to fix the terms of Church-communion and Ministerial Liberty, so as to comprehend all sober Protestants; and this is done by requiring no more as necessary to the one or the other, than what Christ hath made necessary thereunto. 2. After such Comprehension set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Toleration of all tolerable Dissenters within such limits as will secure publick peace and safety, is more agreeable to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and clemency of Rulers, and the charity of Christians, than the Rigorous constraining of the said Dissenters to what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear, and the restraining of them from the liberty of serving God according to their eonsciences. 3. But if the present state of things must continue, the inconveniences that may follow the present practise of the Protestant Nonconformists, are far less than what will follow the deserting of their Ministry, and the neglect of fouls in so great a need of their help.</p>
               <p>The considerations aforegoing I submit to the judgment of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Readers, in reference to the case of Protestant Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, of whom I am. Moreover, I judg it necessary to give some account of my own principles and practice. I have not wilfully forsaken my Ministerial station in the established Order, but am driven from it. I am ready to make Oath before any that have power to administer it to me, That my conscience is not satisfied, that it is lawful to observe all the terms that are imposed. Let it be noted, That I do not affirm the unlawfulness of the terms; but that they are unlawful to me in regard of my conscience, and I am ready to render Reasons of my dissatisfaction. It hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. That so much hath been written for Conformity, as may satisfie any that have a mind to be satisfied: But I profess in his sight, who knows my heart, That I have a mind to be satisfied if I knew how.</p>
               <p>I set up no Faction or severed Party against the common interest of Religion; but according to my mean ability I seek the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peace and concord of all Christians of all persuasions, and the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64712:15"/>
encrease of true godliness among them all.</p>
               <p>I renounce not Parochial Churches as no true Churches; I have not forsaken the communion of such Churches, nor encouraged others to forsake them; but have communicated with them in the Worship of God, and so shall do: and this my principle and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice I am not sparing to declare to my friends that are of another mind in this particular. Nevertheless where a Parish Minister is utterly unmeet for the charge of souls, I cannot encourage any to commit the charge of their souls to him. But as for all conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and faithful Conformists, I highly prize them for their works sake, and seek to promote their Reputation, and the success of their Labours.</p>
               <p>I will thankfully accept the liberty of Ministeral imployment in the said Churches, when it shall be granted me. And for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of my liberty, I am ready to submit not only to whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is <hi>in specie</hi> or particularly injoined in Gods word, but to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is necessary <hi>in genere,</hi> and left <hi>in specie</hi> to humane determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if it be determined according to the general Rules of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>I have given an account of my self according to the latitude of my own principles; but I have not done it to the prejudice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are of sound faith and good life, but of narrower prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples touching <hi>Church-government;</hi> for by the considerations here propounded, their due liberty is provided for.</p>

                  </gap>ct to fulfil it, tho the subject must not Resist their power.</p>
               <p>The Civil Magistrate, notwithstanding his Authority in Ectle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sticks, cannot discharge any Minister of the Gospel from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his Ministry in those circumstances wherein Christ commands him to exercise it.</p>
               <p>The Civil Magistrate is to judg what laws are fit for him to enact and execute about Ecclesiastical matters, and the Ministers of the Gospel have a right of discerning, which is called a judgment of

discretion, about their own pastoral acts, what they ought, and what they ought not to do, according to Gods word, otherwise they must be held obliged to a Blind, Popish, Brutish Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>But whatsoever the Ministers discern to be their duty to do, they ought to do the same only in such ways as are consistent with their Loyalty to God and the King.</p>
               <p>The Bishop hath no external jurisdiction in his publick Courts, but what is derived from the King as Supream; and the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, by which the Bishop is to proceed, are the Kings Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Laws. Consequently no Minister, that lives under any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Jurisdiction which is but derived, can be obliged to obey the Bishop proceeding in his Court, any further than he is obliged to obey the King, who hath the supreme jurisdiction under God and Christ, and that is no further than is consistent with obedience to God.</p>

               <p>I <hi>Presented this clear and open defence with desire and expectation of his Lordships answer in writing according to his promise, (as I apprehended) but he refused to receive it. I trust through the grace of God, that I am ready to renounce any error, whereof I shall be convicted, and to receive any truth that shall be made manifest to me. And I give this account before men in the sense of that great account which I must give to the Chief Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, who searcheth the hearts and reins, and will give unto every one according to his works.</hi>
