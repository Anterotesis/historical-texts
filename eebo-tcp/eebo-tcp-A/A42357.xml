            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37606:3"/>
hithertills to be silent, and to rest satisfied with what was by them formerly published in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their cause and persons. Neither would we have any to wonder that they do not return an Answer to that Paper, lately published, bearing title, <hi>A Declaration of the Brethren, who are for the established Government and Judicatories of this Kirk, expressing their earnest desires of Union and Peace with their dissenting Brethren;</hi> Though we do not (as the authors of this Paper, in order to the Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolution party) take upon us to speak in their name, Yet may we, as not being altogether stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their mind in these matters, say, that they are silent also at this Paper, 1. because, though it do in some part of the Title and Contents thereof professe for, and pretend unto peace; Yet, is it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, and for the body of it, but <hi>crambe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocta</hi> with the former, a bundle of the same calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies where with the former was fraughted, a little more closely knit, and published to the world in a nevv dresse and set off with a profession and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of desires to union and peace; And why should so many put themselves to the pains to assemble together for answering things that have been often answered already; And, is not indeed an overture of peace, but in effect a heap of bitter invectives and reproaches. If the authors of it had not set the words of <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in the frontispiece of it, we doubt that ever any should have owned it, or known it by that name; for, it doth every-where breath discord and war: that we may truly say with the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> ch. 3. 5. whilest they cry, Peace, peace, they bite with their teeth: and with the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 21. that whilest the words

Or, we may say of them, as <hi>Georgius major</hi> writeth of the fathers of <hi>Berge,</hi> who were authors of the book, called <hi>Formula concordiae Bergensis,</hi>

therein as to tread the paths of peace, and to speak the words of sobernesse and truth, we are hopefull it had found answerable entertainment from their Brethren for the Protestation, who, from no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect to them, but from the conscience of their duty and zeal of the Lord's Cause, have in some things witnessed against their way; but when they do thus use them, or rather abuse them, as seeming to speak them for union and peace, and yet not only hold fast most of what hath been the ground of their grievance and complaint, but operously labour and industriously endeavour by a conges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of groundlesse alleagences and grosse mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations of matters of fact, with ill-knit consequences deduced therefrom, and from some other things true and honest in themselves, to prove them, and proclaim them to the world to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ambitious, turbulent, subdolous men, who have been all this while affecting domination in the Church, and designedly projecting the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and overthrow of its Government; yea, that their leading men have of late attempted the utter ruin of this Church, and of those who differ from them. We hope that no man of an impartial judgment will think that the protesting Brethren can otherwise entertain such a treaty of union and peace, that is the eslux of so bitter and unpeaceable a spirit, than with deep silence and just contempt, unlesse they would betray their own innocency, and the justnesse of the cause which they do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by treating a Peace upon such perswasives and foundations, as do all-along heighten division and build up war. 2. Though this Paper, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of <hi>A Declaration of the Brethren who

are for the established Government and Judicatories of the Church,</hi> And so seem to lay claim to all the publick resolution party, as its father; Yet is it a thing very doubtfull whose it is, or who do own it: certain it is that it did not proceed from any Church-authority, but from some persons in an extrajudicial capacity: whether these were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted by their Brethren in the several parts of the Land for that effect, themselves best know. In the mean while they must give us leave to tell what we know, that sundry of their Brethren in several parts of the Country do professe themselves stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the contrivement of it, and dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>These things do haply prevail so far upon the apprehensions and thoughts of some, at least, of these Brethren, as to make them allow the protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren more charity than to think that they have changed their judgements concerning the Government, or, that they do entertain formal and direct intentions, and a stated design to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and destroy the same: We know that they have alwayes had that candid construction in the hearts of some of them, though they have just cause to complain of others, that no professions, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations

But let us come to that upon which they lay the stresse and weight of all these harsh constructions, to wit, their actings and irregular practices (as they are pleased to call them) being such as in their opinion are contrary to all order, and do clearly tend to the subversion of the Government.

upon record to this day, and so far have they been by men of sound judgments, from being judged because thereof to be against the Government, that they are honoured amongst the greatest patrons and preservers thereof. The protesting Brethren do not acknowledge these two Meetings to be any of the supream Church-Judicatories in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor to have any Authority belonging unto them, but look upon them as unfree and corrupt Assemblies (for the reasons long ago published to the world) that have not upon them the stamp of any of the Courts of Jesus Christ; neither do they think that testifying against the corruptions of many of these that are now in the exercise of the Government of the Church, is to dissent from, or to do injury to the Government it self; And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but say, whatever be our Brethren's intentions in studying some way to wrap up the Authority of these two Meetings, and of that part of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Church which is of their judgment, as it were, in the very being of the Government (for this they seem to hint, though it be not directly spoke in that word of <hi>the established Government and Iudicatories of this Kirk,</hi> which they set in the frontispiece, and carry along in their Paper) as if the Government could not be owned nor subsist, the Authority of these two Meetings being denied, and the corruptions of men discovered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; We say, whatsoever they do herein to please themselves, and to amuse the ignorant, yet the protesting Brethren do not so judge, and the other by doing, so make moe adversaries to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

grief of heart call it so, because God was thereby mocked, and sin and wrath increased; and though these Brethren may deny it, and love not to hear it, yet not only the Godly, but the Body of the Land are witnesses, and do bear record of it; yea, that party themselves are witnesses, and do make it the matter of their sporting to this day, by this semblance of repentance they were made capable of all Church-priviledges, and put in equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for calling of Ministers, and ruling in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, with men of a blamelesse and christian conversation, and of known integrity and good affection to the work of Reformation; And when the diet of the General Assembly came, having first done what they could for incapacitating all Brethren of differing judgment from these Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, to sit in the Assembly, by citing them to the Assembly as guilty persons, and excluding them from being elected Commissioners, where they could have power, they did not only ratifie these Resolutions, with all the proceedings of those Commissioners (who were authors thereof) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereunto, but did also make Acts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing and ordaining Censures against all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in this Church, whether Ministers or Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, that did not acknowledge the Authority, and submit to the Acts and Constitutions of that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly concerning those Resolutions, and barring all such Expectants from entrance to the Ministery as should not acknowledge that Authority, and submit to those Constitutions; And in their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the next yeat at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> do provide and ordain Presbyteries to take special care, that upon the calling of any Expectant to a particular

By these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and practices, the most unjust and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that we have known in this Church since we did begin to look at Reformation, in the year, 1638. and which were indeed the great cause of the distempers and distractions that have since fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, malignant and disaffected men in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Presbyteries have got up the head, and having the advantage of the Acts, already mentioned, they do make a bar thereof to shut the door against the calling of able and godly men to the work of the Ministery, who cannot bring their consciences in bondage to these things; And do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37606:12"/>
labour every-where almost, to thrust-in others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own heart, notwithstanding of the dislike and dissent of many of the godly and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected, who are best able to judge; or, if any such happen to be called, a stop is put to their trials and admission upon the same accompt; or, if admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and received by the Presbytery, then refused to be acknowledged Ministers by the Synod; And the intrudings of others upon their charges, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37606:12"/>
been, and that they have more just and weighty grievance against them, even upon this accompt, than they have against the protesting Brethren: Have not these Brethren, some of them, intruded both upon the people and charges of other able and godly Ministers already setled? Have not others of them, being the smaller part, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a very small part of the Presbytery, separated and withdrawn themselves from the body and greater part thereof, because they were of the other judgment? Have they not counteracted and been instrumentall to cause people in Congregations counteract to the Determinations and Sentences of their own Presbyteries and Synods? Have they not in Synods violently taken things out of the hands of the Presbytery, when there was neither reference, nor appeal, nor male-administration? Have they not refused to acknowledge Ministers for members of the Synod, or to suffer them to sit &amp; vote among them, though called by the whole Congregation, and duly tryed and admitted by the Presbytery? Have not some of their Synods taken upon them the power of a Gen. Assembly? and other things of that kind which were tedious to collect and enumerate. They that teach others, would teach them own selves. And if they would have their Brethren to abhor Idols, they would not commit sacriledge. If they say, that there is a difference upon the matter betwixt that which is done by them, and done by the other: take the matter sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and without respect to their numbers, and we believe the protesting Brethren will be content to stand or fall by it: and if it be the plurality of the number only, we cannot accompt that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

in a time of corruption, a sufficient plea either for condemning the one, or justifying the other.</p>
            <p>The third thing wherewith they labour to make out the designs and endeavours of the protesting Brethren to subvert the Government, is, as they are pleased to expresse it in the fourth page of their Declaration, <hi>That they have cast many and foul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches upon them at home and abroad, both by word and writ, that so they might make them hatefull, and purchase credit and power to their own party, whereby also they have endeavoured to render this National Church odious in the view of the world, and exposed her to be a laughing-stock to all her enemies, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them with weapons</hi> (<hi>if</hi> (say they) <hi>their foul slanders deserve to have credit</hi>) <hi>whereby to fight against her, and justifie their opposition to her, when her own children bear such witnesse against her.</hi> And as they expresse it in the fifth page of that Paper, <hi>their branding Church-Officers and inferiour Iudicatories, as generally corrupt, that so all of them might be cast loose, or at least moulded to their mind.</hi> If our Lord and Master Jesus Christ had not forewarned us herein, we should have wondred that the Brethren for the publick Resolutions should see a mote in their neighbours eye, and not consider the beam in their own eye: Hath it not been their work at home and abroad, in private and publick, in print and writ, to cast foul reproaches and slanders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the protesting Brethren? That one scurril pamphlet, published under the name of <hi>Uldericus Veridicus,</hi> (which had been better stiled <hi>Falsidicus</hi>) may testifie of what spirit some of our Brethren are, who knowing that the tongue of the poor man the Author thereof would be no slander at home,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37606:13"/>
(so small was his credit in this Church when he lived) that now after his death they have sent his crazie discourses abroad in a Latin dresse, to gain credit to their cause amongst strangers in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and make the world believe the Protesters are men fanatick and abominable, like <hi>Thomas Munster</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden:</hi> But would any be at the pains to turn it into the Scotish tongue, it should not only prove a sufficient resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the manifold lyes and calumnies therein contained, but open the eyes of many, that they might perceive by what pillars that cause is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it doth most grieve us that the Name of the Lord is so often taken in vain, by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's filling their preachings and prayers in the pulpit with such stuffe as goeth abroad in others of their pamphlets; whether it be for scarscity of other purpose, or from the abundance of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour predomining in their breasts, we shall not determine; but sure we are, that thereby not only many hungry souls are disappointed of their food, but those Ordinances are rendred irksome even to many hearers of their own judgment, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That it was oftentimes after the Reformation begun in the year, 1638. not only by godly men in private, but publickly by our General Assemblies in their publick Warnings and Declarations, and Causes of Humiliation, acknowledged, that though there was an external forsaking of the prelatical way, and engaging in the Covenant, Yet that the sin of former defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and backsliding was by many still unrepented of, that many did still remain either neutral and cold, or backward and ill-affected to the work of God. 3. That the General Assemblies in the progresse of Reformation did begin to be so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the multitude of insufficient and scandalous men that did still remain in Presbyteries and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37606:15"/>
that they did judge Presbyteries and Synods not able to purge themselves, and that therefore it was necessary to give Commission to some select Brethren, nominated by themselves, for visiting the bounds of Presbyteries and Synods, with power to these Brethren to try and censure such Ministers and Elders as they found insufficient or scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. 4. That these Brethren found so much work in many places of the Country as they were not able soon to overtake, but after the continuing of their diligence by renewed Commissions for two or three years space, the General Assembly, upon the report of what was yet to do in places that had only been in part visited, and in consideration of the condition of other places, not yet visited, did find it necessary to appoint select persons, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by themselves, for visiting most of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That those almost general visitations of the whole Land, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit judged most necessary for purging of the Kirk of the multitude of corrupt or insufficient men, whom Presbyteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> their entertainment) unto the sober and serious thoughts of others these few considerations, for vindicating this Overture from all those mistakes our Brethren have about it. 1. That there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt a sound or a healthfull growing reforming, and an unsound sickly decaying decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning state of a Church. 2. That there is a difference betwixt a troubled distempered, and a quiet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able state of a Church. If our Church were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether sound and healthfull, if in a growing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37606:19"/>
condition, if in a peaceable and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered state, there would be no need of any such overture; And we believe the protesting Brethren would be in that case as far from pressing it as any other: but her sickly, decaying, declining, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, distempered condition doth necessarily call for, and allow for something of that kind. 2. The General Assemblies (as we have already shewed) did conceive extraordinary Commissions and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitations to be needfull, when the Church was in a much better condition than she is now; And though not a few in Presbyteries and Synods did then speak the same language that our Brethren do now, to wit, that it did lay a foundation for an universal imputation upon the Synods and other Church-Judicatories as not worthy to be trusted with the work committed to them by Christ, and was a tyrannical imposition upon them; Yet that did not hinder the Assembly so to do, because they did see that such a way of Commissions and Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations was necessary for the time, when Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Synods (many of them) were either no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> able, or not willing to do that duty in order to the purging of the Church of corrupt officers. 3. That there is a difference betwixt the essentials and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials of Presbyterial Government; the one being such as are of divine or scriptural instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in themselves unalterable; the other being such as are of positive humane institution, which are to be regulated by that great end of edification, and therefore may be altered accordingly as they do or do not contribute for that end. It is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that the resolution Brethren in this and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other of their Papers, do in many of these chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges

               </gap> in the Overture, the same for substance as it was propounded to our Brethren in the Conference at <hi>Edinburgh, Novemb.</hi> 8. and 27. 1655. Whence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> appeareth that our Brethren speak more passion than reason, when they say, It is a tyrannical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position upon Synods, that they must give their power to persons whom they have not liberty to choose, nor power to call them to an accompt, and must set up a Jurisdiction above themselves, with at least a negative voice, to frustrate all their actings, if these Delegates please. Is it tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to impose, to desire the Synod for the better and more unanimous carrying-on the Work of God, to ratifie the Nomination of some of the choicest of their own members, made by no forin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick persons, or party, or power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick members of the Synod it self, and that in such a distracted condition of the Church, And that they are not comptable, is alleaged <hi>gratis.</hi> The Article, as propounded to our Brethren, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly provide, that these Committees shall in their proceedings be comptable to the Synods, nor doth that clause of the Synods not reversing any thing

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>one by these Committees, without the previous advice and consent of the general Committee of Delegates, import any thing to the contrary, but that the Synod may take an accompt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of their own Committee, and admonish and rebuke them; yea, and take away their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Power, in the case of male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and give it to others of their number, nominated as aforesaid: And for a Jurisdiction by this means set up above themselves, we can see no such thing in the Overture, but only a power of advice upon the part of these Delegates (which yet the Synod are not simply tyed by the Overture to follow, as in the case of their advising the Synod to reverse the deeds of these Committees) and a brotherly condescension in the Synods in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition of the Church, not to reverse things done by these Committees without the advice and consent of these Delegates. Neither will our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's negative voice prove it; because as these Delegates have not a negative voice in all cases, as we have already shewed, to wit, in the case of ratifying of the proceedings of these Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, the Synod being free, notwithstanding any thing in the Overture to ratifie, albeit the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates should not consent, but advise otherwise; So it is a new device to say, that a negative voice inferreth a superiour jurisdiction and power; for, at most it maketh but a co-ordinate power: And that there is any absurdity in this, That a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Delegates, nominated by the common consent of all the Synods, should, in this condition of the Church, have such a power (if yet it be a power of Jurisdiction) we do not see. 4. This
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37606:21"/>
Overture was not propounded as a perpetuall standing way, alwayes to be followed and kept up in the Church, as our Brethren are pleased to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate, much lesse was it propounded hereby to lay a way for perpetuating of differences and contentions (a prejudice also they are pleased to load it with) but, as it expresly beareth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue only till the present differences be healed, or, till the Lord in providence minister some better way for setling peace amongst us. Will the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution Brethren in this present sickly declining and distracted condition of the Church, allow of no remedy for purging thereof, and composing differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that is in any circumstance out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road of the ordinary procedures of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Synods? We know that they will tell us that the Church is sound and healthy, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently able by Presbyteries and Synods to purge her self. But why then (we pray our Brethren to tell us) did the General Assembly, before these differences did arise, unanimously, judge that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries and Synods were not sufficiently able to do it, and did, upon conviction hereof, appoint extraordinary Commissions and Visitations for doing of it? If our Brethren say, That the Gen. Assembly is the supream Church-Judicatorie in the Nation, and therefore may so do. They can easily answer themselves, That the question is of the moving cause; or, the ground or reason upon which they did it, it was not to shew their Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Authority, which was not questioned nor controverted by any Synod or Presbyterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but (as our Brethren well know) because they did conceive and were convinced, that Presbyteries

and Synods were not so healthy as to do these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of themselves; and if they were not so then when neutral, and malignant, and disaffected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And, in the next place, shall speak somewhat to the matter it self. As to the first. In so far as concerneth Presbyterial Government, and the due subordination of Church-Judicatories, that they might testifie their approbation there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, and that they did continue constant in their former so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn publick Professions and Engagements, they did propound unto their Brethren, <hi>That in matters concerning the Doctrine, Worship, Government and Discipline of this Church, and the Enemies of Truth and Godlinesse, and the work of Reformation, there may be mutual evidence and assurance given for adherence unto these Articles of our Covenants, and the solemn publick Confession of Sins and Engagement unto Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all the Acts of uncontroverted Assemblies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereunto, in the literal and genuine meaning thereof:</hi> By which, we hope, that unlesse they be taken for grosse dissemblers, it doth manifestly appear that they are willing to six themselves, and desirous also to have their Brethren (who gave but a shie answer in this particular) also fixed in the matter of the Government of the Church. But,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37606:23"/>
secondly, our Brethren, having in that Conference overtured, <hi>That all the members of this Kirk, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and People, shall submit themselves to their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries and Synods respectively: And if any be grieved with the Determination of Presbyteries, they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Synods: And if any be grieved with the Determination of a Synod, they may appeal to a General Assembly; but that in the mean time the Sentences of Presbyteries and Synods are to be acquiesced unto, until the Determination of the respective supream Iudicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereupon.</hi> The protesting Brethren did quere upon this Article, <hi>Whether the submission and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence required in the same, doth import a submission and acqutescence in every person, in all cases, even when the plunality of a Kirk-Iudicatory doth act contrary to the Word of God, and imploy their power to destruction and not to edification, and their Determinations doth necessarily infer present detriment to the Church;</hi> and finding that by their Answers they did upon the matter require an absolute and unlimited submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Sentences of the Church-Judicatories whether just or unjust; They did declare unto them, <hi>That as they did not willingly desire to enter in any debate anent that matter, conceiving it unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to start and debate such questions at that time, or to make any Declarations thereanent; So they did conceive that such a submission hath not hithertils been required, nor could warrantably be yeelded in such a way as it was then required, especially there being to their sense and apprehension so much corruption in the plurality of Presbyteries and Synods,</hi> whereof they professed themselves willing and ready to give the evidences. And afterwards, <hi>That they did not differ
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37606:24"/>
with their Brethren about what was cited by them in that Conference, from the Acts of the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of this Kirk concerning subordination and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, particularly from the Act of the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,</hi> 1647. <hi>concerning the hundred and eleven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and in the seventh head of doctrine therein contained; but that they did not see how that which i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> required by them, is no other than that which is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the General Assemblies of this Kirk; because they require such a Declaration of subjection and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Sentences of the Iudicatories of this Kirk, as hath not hithertils been established by the uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Assemblies thereof, to wit, that which doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a like submission to sentences whether just or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, or of corrupt or uncorrupt Iudicatories, and doth exclude Declin<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>But because this point is of importance, and stateth the Brethren for the Protestation in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the more rigid of the Resolutioners, as adversaries to the very essence and being of Presbyterial Government; therefore it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, in order to their vindication, to speak more fully to it. The Question (so far as we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them in it) is, Whether such a submission be due from all the members of this Kirk, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and People, to the Judicatories of the Kirk, and from the inferiour to the superiour Kirk-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories in matters of Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,

as ought upon the sentence (whether just or unjust) of these Judicatories to sist the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the person or party grieved therewith, and make them aquiesce thereunto, untill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the respective superiour Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory therein, without any counteracting to the same, unlesse it be to appeal unto, and follow their appeal before the superiour Judicatory? Upon this Question we find the Brethren for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation in their last Paper at the Conference <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 25. 1655. expressing their judgment thus; <hi>We are willing to subject our selves to all the just sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the lawf<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

God) should be asserted to be at all of kin or alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the divine Ordinance of Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is a part of the sweet and gentle yoke of Jesus Christ, that is far from tyranny and oppression.

If Presbyterial Government hath (as we do believe and assert it to have) its foundation in the Testament of Jesus Christ, upon whose shoulder the Government is, then whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of the essence and being thereof, must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it self from the fountain of Christ's revealed Will about the Constitution and Essentials of that Government? But we know no tittle in his Book that saith as our Brethren say, or from which, what they say in this matter, can be deduced by good and necessary consequence, to wit, that it is essential to the Government which He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed His House to be ruled by, that all the Children of the House should submit unto, and acquiesce in the Determination of the Governors, without any counteracting, though their Sentence be contrary to the Law and the Testimony; and therefore till our Brethren prove thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> they will give us leave to deny it. We acknowledge that power and authority, and subjection, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission are co-relatives, and that the power and authority of the superiour can no more actually subsist without the subjection and submission of

            <p>Their second Reason is, That without this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and subordination <hi>they do not see how Unity and Order can be continued in the Kirk, It being in vain to think of a remedy by superiour Iudicatories without this, the refusing thereof being the way to make all Union void:</hi> So in their Answer to the Queries propounded upon their Overtures, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1655.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37606:27"/>
the Truth? They may appeal, say they. But, say we, they have appealed, and have therein suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbed. What remedy now? No remedy, but that at one stroke the precious Truths of God, and interests of Jesus Christ must be born down and buried in oblivion; And the Saints and Ministers of the Gospel be buried under the rubbish there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, because one Assembly will have it so. But say our Brethren, how shall Unity and Order other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be preserved in the Church of God? We <hi>Answer,</hi> Very well; because if the Sentence be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, it ought to be recognized and repealed: If it be just, and of an inferiour nature; If the persons will not submit, they are, after due procedure, to be cast out, as those that will not hear the Church, and so both Unity and Purity, both Order and Truth are preserved. Will our Brethren under a pretext of Order, destroy Christian-liberty, and bring-in Popish-tyranny? It is Christ's Order and the King of Saints Peace, that every Believer have the judgment of discretion, whether the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories of the Kirk speak according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or whether they ought to obey or submit, or gainsay or counteract, and what Christ hath given them, no man can take from them.</p>
            <p>Their third Argument, is taken from the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of this, and other Churches, which (as they affirm) plead for this subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and submission, required by them in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Queries of the 16. of <hi>November,</hi> 1655. they say, <hi>That this submission hath been established by the General Assemblies, especially by the Assembly in</hi> Anno 1648. sess. 30. <hi>and practised by the General Assembly,</hi> 1646. <hi>in the case of Mr.</hi> James Morison

As to what is cited by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, from the Act of the General Assembly, in <hi>Anno,</hi> 1648. sess. 30. We answer, That though the word, <hi>justly,</hi> be not expressed in the letter of the Act, that being amongst the <hi>praecognita</hi> or <hi>praesuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita</hi>

of all those that do make or require obedience to Laws, that they make and mean of just Laws; yet it is evident that it speaketh of those Ministers, who being justly suspended, or deposed from the function of the Ministery, shall continue in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Ministery, or intromet with the sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends belonging to those Kirks they served at, as doth appear from the passages before cited. If our Brethren will not admit this glosse, then surely the meaning must be this; Whatsoever Minister just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or unjustly and contrary to the rule of the Word of God, suspended or deposed from his Ministery, shall continue to preach the Gospel, or to intromet with his stipend, We, the General Assembly of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> do appoint, that because of his disobedience to our Sentence, whether just or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, he shall be excommunicated and cast out of the Church: But as we abhorr to fasten such a meaning upon that reverend and grave Assembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So we desire to think that our Brethren, upon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and serious thoughts, will abhorr it also, and will acknowledge with us, that it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of just Sentences only; and if so, we do willingly acknowledge and professe, that who so, being justly suspended or deposed from the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ministery, doth continue in the exercise thereof, doth deserve to be processed with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. What was practised by the General Assembly, 1646. in the case of Mr. <hi>Iames Morison,</hi> because we have not the Records of that Assembly concerning that matter, we will not take upon us to speak positively to their Determination, what it was, or to the reasons thereof, in that particular, it being a matter of fact done long ago, and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37606:30"/>
with many circumstances, some of which have haply escaped our memorie; but as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and can collect from the printed <hi>Index</hi> of the Acts of that Assembly, not printed, the case was this; Mr. <hi>Iames Morison</hi> being sentenced with suspension from the exercise of his Ministery by the Presbyterie of <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> did appeal to the General Assembly and go on in his Ministeriall function, for which the Presbyterie did pronounce against him the sentence of Deposition: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess coming before the Assembly, they did sustean his appeal, and rebuking both him and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie for their contentious and litigious carriage one towards another in that businesse, did (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out (so far as we remember) any ratification of the Presbyteries sentence of Deposition, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of Mr. <hi>Iames Morison</hi> to make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his offence, for violating the just submission and subordination due to the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories of the Kirk, (which doubtless they would have done before his reposition, if they had been of our Brethrens judgment) did appoint him to be reponed again to his Ministery. If the case was this, our Brethren have no advantage, but rather disadvantage in alleaging of it; because the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly were so far from proceeding to a further sentence against Mr. <hi>Iames Morison,</hi> for counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the Sentence of the Presbyterie, that they did appoint him to be again reponed to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. When our Brethren shall make it appear from the Registers to have been otherwise, we shall lay the weight upon it that it doth deserve. Our Brethren overshoot, when they say. That thus to submit, hath been the constant practice of all the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37606:30"/>
members and Judicatories of this Kirk ever since the late Reformation; If they mean of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Church from Popery, they cannot but know that there was nothing more ordinary sor the members and Judicatories of this Kirk than not to submit unto, but to counteract the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and Sentences of the Prelates and their Synods and Assemblies, not only in matters of Doctrine and Worship, but also of Discipline and Government. It was ordinary for godly men, who were deposed by them and their Courts, to preach and continue in the exercise of their Ministry, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of their Sentences. Some of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren themselves did it. It's true, that the Prelates were not a lawfull Authority, nor Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers agreeable to the Word of God: but our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do very well know, that as the Prelates, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Act of their Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> did sometimes in the suspension and deposition of Ministers, associate to themselves the Ministery of those bounds, where the supposed Delinquent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that is, the Presbytery, wherof he was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which was a lawfully Authority; and that as they did plead for such a submission to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Sentences, as these Brethren do now plead for, and upon the same grounds of its being essentiall to Government and preserving of Unity and Order, and shunning of Confusion, &amp;c. so also that those who did refuse and decline that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, did it not only upon the ground of their want of lawfull Authority, but also upon this ground, That no obedience nor subjection is due to Ecclesiastick Laws thatare unjust and contrary to the Word of God; as will appear to any that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37606:31"/>
shall read the Treatises that were published by the defenders of the Truth in that hour of temptation, concerning the binding power of Ecclesiasticall Laws. And for the practice of the Members and Judicatories of this Kirk since the Reformation begun in <hi>Anno</hi> 1638. untill these differences did arise, when our Brethren shall bring instances of unjust sentences pronounced in that time by the Judicatories of the Kirk, it will be time for the protesting Brethren to bring instances of not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thereto, or counteracting the same. If the sentences were just, submission was due unto them; and they do but trifle to make that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission a precedent to that unlimited submission which they do now plead-for.</p>
            <p>Their citation from the Act of the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. concerning the hundred and eleven Propositions, and the seventh head of Doctrine therein contained, doth make against our Brethren, and not for them: 1. Because the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words of that Act do clear, that the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly speaketh of Ecclesiasticall Government, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and intrusted by Christ to the Assemblies of the Kirk: but Christ hath committed no power to any Assembly to tyrannize, nor hath He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any Church-member, or any inferiour Church-judicatorie to subject themselves to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall tyrannie. 2. Because the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themselves to which that Act do relate, do confine the obedience and subjection that is to be given to the Ordinances and Decrees of Classes and Synods, to lawfull Ordinances and Decrees; <hi>It is not lawfull,</hi> say they, <hi>to particular Churches, or (as commonly they are called) Parochiall, eitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37606:31"/>
the Authority of Classes or Synods where they are lawfully setled, or may be had (much lesse to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themselves from that Authority if they have once acknowledged it) or to refuse such lawfull Ordinances and Decrees of the Classes or Synods, as being agreeable to the Word of God, are with Authority imposed upon them,</hi> Act. 15. 2, 6, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29. Act. 16. 4. <hi>Prop.</hi> 32. It seemeth it came not into the minds of our Brethren who were appointed to prepare these Articles and Propositions (though they did well understand the nature of Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment) and tendered them unto the Assembly, nor into the Assemblies mind, who after hearing of them publickly read, did unanimously vote and agree to the eight generall heads of Doctrine therein contained and asserted, that men should submit to unlawfull Ordinances and Decrees of Classes and Synods; and therefore we wonder that our Brethren should cite such testimonies for confirmation of their new doctrine, as do indeed make against it. Neither have our Brethren been more happy in what they tell us in their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, that this practice of ours in matters of Discipline and Government, was never heard of in any Church where the Officers and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof were acknowledged to be agreeable to the Word of God. What hath been heard of in this Church we have already told them, and for other Churches, we would desire them to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the story of the Church within the first four or five hundred years after Christ, and see whether many of the worthy Servants of Christ who lived of old, such as <hi>Athanasius, &amp;c.</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse submission to Sentences and Decrees of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37606:32"/>
and counteract thereunto, not only by preaching contrary to their Determinations, but by preaching and exercising their ministeriall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction after Sentences of Deposition and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication passed against them: and it will be but a poor shift for our Brethren to tell us, that these Synods did not consist of Officers and of a Constitution agreeable to the Word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these worthy men had no exception against the Officers, because of their office of Bishops or such like, they being such themselves, nor against the constitution, but their exception was against the heterodoxie and iniquitie of their Decrees and Sentences, upon which account they did refuse obedience and subjection thereunto, and did coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract them, to the utmost of their power; and though because of their so doing, they were then persecuted and reproached by many of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and of the Kirk-judicatories of these times, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the fire-brands of the time, and troublers of the peace of the Church; yet hath their praise been amongst all sober and sound men in all the Churches of Christ throughout many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and will be so to the end of the world. And those who did persecute them for so doing, are, and will be justly condemned as men of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant spirit. We remember, to this purpose, an observation of <hi>Osiander</hi> upon one of the Canons of a Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in which it was decided, That if any Ecclesiasticall persons, should without the advice and letters of the Bishop of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and chiefly of the Metropolitan, go to the Emperour to put up any grievance unto him, he should be cast out, not only from the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37606:32"/>
but from his proper dignity which he had in the Church. <hi>This Canon</hi> (saith <hi>Osiander</hi>) <hi>was composed against holy</hi> Athanasius; <hi>for</hi> Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius <hi>being expelled by the</hi> Arians, <hi>had fled to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> Constantine <hi>the younger, and bad from him obtained regresse to his own Church. Now this Canon</hi> (saith he) <hi>is very unjust, which forbiddeth that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or any other Minister of the Church being unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppressed, flie to his godly civil Magistrate, since it was lawfull to the Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>to appeal to the Roman Emperour, wicked</hi> Nero, <hi>as the Acts of the Apostle witnesse: but it may be seen in this place, that Bishops were very soon seeking dominion</hi> (saith he) <hi>yea, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie over the Church and over their colleagues, Hist.

            <p>The last part of their alleagance, that both the protesting Brethren and they, were solemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to this submission at their admission to the Ministrie, if it were meaned of such as were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by, and gave engagements to the Prelates, it hath indeed too much truth in it, that many of their number, and haply some of the other also, did at their admission to the Ministrie, give these engagements for absolute and implicit submission to their ordinary, the Lord-Prelate, to which the submission required by our Brethren, as we shall afterwards shew, is too neer a kin; but that ever such an absolute unlimited submission, was either required by Presbyteries, or engaged into by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trants since the casting out of the Prelates, we do deny, and are confident, that our Brethren can bring no relevant proof of it in the form and order of the electing of Ministers, condescended upon in the Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> March 9. 1560. where
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37606:33"/>
               <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> was Moderator; sundry questions are ordered to be propounded to the intrant to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie, which (for ought we know) are (and no other for substance) the same that have been propounded since the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> 1638 Among other things, It is demanded of him, if he will not be subject to the Discipline of the Church with the rest of his Brethren? And the answer is, That he doth most willingly submit himself to the wholesome Discipline of the Church; yea, to the Discipline of the same Church, by which he is now called to this office and charge, and that he doth in Gods presence, and theirs, promise obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all admonitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, what doth this amount unto, will our Brethren say, to such a subjection as they contend for? The subjection here spoken of, is upon expresse supposall of sliding and offending upon his part who promiseth the subjection: upon which case, the protesting Brethren are as much for subjection to Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline as the resolution Bretheren are: But if they will extend it further, and say, that it is meaned of absolute subjection to the sentence of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whether he have osfended or not, they may as well, and with more colour of reason, say, that he is bound by his oath, not only to give subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also obedience to all their admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether just or unjust, lawfull or unlawfull; because there is no expresse limitation in the words of the oath, these qualifications, being as we said before, amongst the <hi>praecognita</hi> and <hi>praesupposita</hi> of all such questions and answers, and there being no need to expresse them, except where there are grounds of jealousie. As to the reasons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37606:33"/>
which do plead against this submission, so much contended for by the resolution Brethren, we shall set them down when we come to speak of the iniquity of these Brethren their demands in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Union and Peace.</p>
            <p>The sixth thing that our Brethren bring in, for attesting the protesting Brethren their projecting to subvert the Government of the Church, is, <hi>That some of them did endeavour to enervate the power of Church-judicatories, by procuring an order, puting the power of giving testimonie to intrants (which is due to Presbyteries only who are authorized to judge of their call, and to try and to ordain them) in the hands of some select persons of their own choosing, Declar. pag.</hi> 6. We do somewhat wonder at our Brethrens mentioning of this, and that in a Paper pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to earnest desires of Union and Peace. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole Land, and their consciences know, that that order was not imbraced nor made use of by the protesting party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that many of those whose names were in it, gave their reasons why they were not clear in their consciences to close with it. 2. Because it is well known to themselves, that the reverend Brother, upon whom they would cast the blame in this matter, and others of both judgements, were required by the Lord Protector to go to <hi>London;</hi> where being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he gave his opinion, That seing there was a Court established in <hi>Scotland</hi> for disposing of the legall maintenance to such Intrants of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, as upon certificates should be approved of by the Judges of that Court, whereby the Judges were left to an uncertainty, whose certificates to receive; It was therefore fittest in the present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37606:34"/>
of the Church, that those certificate should be granted by a select number of both judgements; which being embraced by my Lord Protector and his Council, and an Ordinance passed for that effect, and sent to <hi>Scotland;</hi> When the reverend Brother did perceive that it was not accepted, he laid it aside and did not prosecute i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But (say they in the next place) <hi>When it pleased the Lord to break that snare their leading men have again of late attempted the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of this Church, and of these who differ from them, under the pretext of seeking a Commission for plantation of Churches, they projected to have the power of disposing the legall maintenance of Ministers pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37606:34"/>
               <hi>That the protesting Brethren, or their leading men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have of late attempted the utter ruine of this Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of those who differ from them.</hi> When the civil powers were pleased to put in the hands, first, of a peculiar Court appointed for that end, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into the hands of the Council, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the legall maintenance of Ministers to such Intrants, as upon certificates should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven by them; The protesting Brethren having represented the inconveniencie of this thing unto his Highnesse Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and finding that they were not impowered to change that way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did afterward by some of their number, suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Highnesse, <hi>That as it is allowed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be governed by her own Laws, the like freedom may be given to the Church to be governed by her own uncontroverted Acts and Constitutions, and that Intrants to the Ministery might have full access to their stipends and maintenance, conform to the Laws of the Nation, without any bonds or engagements of a civil nature, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, and that all the Acts of Parliamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> which do relate to the liberties of the Kirk, may be declared to be still in force; and that there might be a Commission of able and godly men, who know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our Church affairs, nominated by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which might exercise the power which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Commission of Plantation of Churches in</hi> Scotland; <hi>and also do the duty of the Civil Magistrate anent Ecclesiastick matters, according to the Rules and Acts of uncontroverted Assemblies, and Laws of the Land preceding the year,</hi> 1651. Was there herein any thing faulty, much lesse so hainously faulty as an attempt for the utter ruin of the Church and of the resolution Brethren? Yes, say they, there was a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37606:35"/>
project in it to have the power of disposing the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal maintenance of Ministers put into the hands of that Commission, though such a power was never given nor assumed by such a Judicatory, and is contrary to the order established by the Law of the Land: But as the first part of the protesting Brethren their desire, which we have already set down, doth expresly bear, That Ministers might have accesse to their stipends in such a way, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> conform to the Laws of the Land; So doth the last part expresly qualifie the power which they desire to be given to the Commission of Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kirks in the exercise of it, that it might be according to Acts of uncontroverted Assemblies and the Laws of the Land: It is neither falshood nor vanity for the protesting Brethren when they are charged as underminers of the Liberties of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> desired that the disposing of Ministers mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance might be in the hands of that Commission<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> was it a fault, when they could not prevail to bring it in conformity to the Laws of the Land, to desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that there might be a translation of the power in its exercise from one subject to another, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not necessarily diverted with multiplicity of affairs, as the Council is, might more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently attend it? But, say they, the great design of this was, to call the Authority of late Assemblies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37606:35"/>
in question. Supposing that to be true, that the Authoritie of these Assemblies were not only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question, but pronounced null, would that bring utter ruine to this Church, and to those who plead for them? do our Brethren think that the Church and themselves must stand or fall with the Authority of these late A ssemblies? We wish the Church and them too, better foundations then such bowing walls and tottering fences. <hi>But could not the Commission for plantation of Kirks have exercised that Power, and the Authority of these Assemblies have also stood? we see no inconsistencie between them.</hi> Next, say they, The design was to have the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance put in the hands of men to their mind, that so they might discourage all from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie who are opposit to themselves. If our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren judge such discouragement to be so great a crime, why have they so much practized it, and framed the mischief thereof into a Law, that none shall have liberty to be a Burser in a Divinity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>College, or to wait upon a Family, much lesse to be admitted to the Ministrie, that doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Constitution, and submit to the Acts of these two late Assemblies? But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the men into whose hands the protesting Brethren would have had the disposing of the maintenance put, though we cannot say that they are, or ought to be so self-denied that they would not have wished it to have been so, yet did they never expect such a Commission as should wholly consist of men according to their mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor was that ever any of their Propositions to his Highness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directly or indirectly; Yea, their Propositions did not contain that qualification, as to any of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37606:36"/>
them. And we can also say, That though they had been mostly or wholly of that mind, there would have been room and encouragement for men of our Brethrens judgement, both to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and enter into the Ministrie.</p>
            <p>Thus now have we answered that first and great prejudice, wherewith our Brethrens Paper, and (it seemeth) their spirits, are fraughted, against the protesting Brethren, to wit, That they do not only dissent from, but also that they have it in their thoughts and design, to subvert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the established Government of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> by Presbyteries and Synods, and that their practices do manifestly tend thereunto. And in this we have been the larger, not only because we have more then probable ground to look upon it, as the great scope of our Brethrens Paper, to fill and possess this Church, and the Churches abroad, with this opinion of these Brethren that they are indeed such a shrewd party as they describe them to be, that so they may acquit and justifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution Brethren in all that they have hitherto done, or shall hereafter do against them; but also, because if there be any remnants of real inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our Brethrens bosoms to a Peace approven of God and tending to edification; we did conceive it necessary to endeavor, though with much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to roll out of their way that great rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which they have by their own mistakes so long and so much stumbled upon, unto the making of them halt more and more, day by day, in their affections towards the protesting Brethren.</p>
            <p>There be yet two prejudices more, which we find in their Declaration, that we shall more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37606:36"/>
speak unto; one is, <hi>That they have begun a needlesse rent in the Church upon a question so extrinseck to our Doctrine, Worship and Government;</hi> so they speak in the fourth page of their Declaration: and in the third page they call it <hi>a tossing about a debate, now so far removed out of our way.</hi> To which we answer; first, Whatever be the nature of the Question about the publick Resolutions, it is certain and manifest that the Rent thereupon was begun by the resolution Brethren; because they did in a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious meeting of some of the Commissioners of the General Assembly, without giving timous and due warning to others, in the year 1651. sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly take these Resolutions, when the whole Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was in possession of, and by solemn Covenants and Vows engaged to the Truths, to which these Resolutions are contrary and destructive. 2. This Question is not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick to our Doctrine, Worship and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as our Brethren would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; it doth involve a portion of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truth of God, which he hath been pleased to reveal and hold forth in His Word for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of His Church and People, that they may know what they ought to do, and what they ought not to do, in the case of intrusting of known wicked malignant men, enemies to Truth and Godlinesse, with the interests of the Lords Work and People; And this Truth, as it hath all along since the Reformation from Popery been taught and holden forth by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> so hath the preservation and practice thereof been judged necessary for preserving the rest of the Doctrine, and the Worship and Government in their puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37606:37"/>
and from the pollutions and corruptions which evil men use to bring in, or give way unto; yea, this very thing (as our Brethren do well know) was no small part of the controversie all along from the year 1638. betwixt the wel-affected, and the Popish and Prelaticall and Malignant party? they may take One instance of many, to wit, the desires of the Commission of the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. concerning the unlawfull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; amongst which, that about the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of instruments was one of the chief. We desire them to remember what spirit that man would have beenjudged of, who in the Assembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. should have pleaded that to be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion much extrinsick to our Doctrine, Worship and Government, and that it would furnish just ground of complaint against the Assembly, if they should, because thereof, divide from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which carried on that unlawfull Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in war against <hi>England?</hi> 3. If our Brethren do indeed judge this question to be so extrinsick to our Doctrine, Worship and Government, How cometh it to passe that they are so tenacious of the determinations of their Assemblies about it? If Doctrine, and Worship, and Government may be preserved intire without it, may they not for the Peace of the Church condescend to take course that these Determinations shall not be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the definitive judgement of this Kirk, or any of the Judicatories thereof in these matters? And how cometh it to passe, that upon a question so extrinsick, they did make and still keep up against Ministers, Elders, Expectants and Professours, Acts imporrting so severe censures against those
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37606:37"/>
who do not submit to the Determinations of their Assemblies concerning these things? Next, If the question be so extrinsick, how cometh it that they sometime place the standing or falling of this Church therein, and now again they would make it of no moment? But further we say, The subject matter of these debates is not so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way as our Brethren do talk, but do still continue in many respects: 1. In regard of the sin and guilt thereof, which hath not been taken-with, nor repented-of till this day. And as the resolution Brethren judge it hard for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing Brethren to be satisfied with nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they do repent of that, as a sin which in their consciences they judge to be a duty; So they must give leave to the protesting Brethren to judge it hard, that the Church, of which they are Members and Ministers, should lye under the guilt of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick transgression, and under great and sore wrath, because thereof, and they in the mean while not be permitted to discover her iniquity therein, that her captivity may be turned away, especially when they are engaged by Covenant so to do. 2. These Resolutions do continue, in regard of the Synodicall approbation and tye thereof upon all the Members of this Kirk. 3. They do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in regard of the Acts which were made for carrying on thereof, to wit those which appoint censures against all the Members of this Kirk, who do not approve of the Authority of that Assembly at Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Acts and Constitutions thereof. 4. They do continue in regard of the publick Warnings, Remonstrances and Declarations of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37606:38"/>
1650. and the pretended Assembly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, against the opposers thereof. 5. In regard of the authoritative approbation of many of these things by Provinciall Synods and Presbyteries, many of which have made and past particular Acts for that effect. 6. In regard of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Acts of the pretended Assemblies at Saint <hi>Andrews, Dundee,</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> against Ministers, Elders and Expectants, who adhere to the Protestation. 7. In order to the taking-in of many disaffected and malignant persons, and making them capable of Ecclesiastick priviledges and trust, such having vote in Congregations in the Election of Ministers and Elders, and sitting as Elders in Kirk-judicatories in a wrong way. 8. They do continue in all these sad fruits and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of defection, which the protesting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did long ago represent to the several Synods, and have since that time collected together in one; And therefore the Authors of this Declaration do give their Readers but words, and wrong the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing Brethren, when they tell them of tossing about a debate now so far removed out of the way; and so do others of their party when they do discourse and write in such a strain, as if there, were no obstruction of Peace and of an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from any thing p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rtaining to these Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that is now in being, or that is urged by these who do adhere thereunto, upon, or against the protesting Brethren; but that all the ground of the continuing of the difference, is, because the resolution Brethren will not quit their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and professe Repentance for what they have done; When as, besides repentance and changing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37606:38"/>
of their judgment (which though the protesting Brethren do wish, and pray for, and hold forth as their duty) yet do they not make it a condition, without which they will have no Union and Peace with them. There be many things relating to these Resolutions that are still in being, and are adhered unto, and prosecuted by these Brethren, that do prove hinderances and impediments of an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt them and the protesting Brethren; which, as it is partly manifest from what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said, so shall it more evidently and fully be made to appear when we shall take in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the Overtures of Union propounded by them in this Paper.</p>
            <p>Another of their prejudices, is, <hi>That the protesting Brethren affect preheminence, and would set up a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their party in this Church, and over their Brethren,</hi> Decl. pag. 4. &amp; pag. 6. If we should say, that there is nothing of that root of pride and ambition in the protesting Brethren, that took hold on our first parents in paradise, and hath from them been derived unto all the posterity descended from them by ordinary generation, and keepeth some footing in the best of men, in whom a body of death dwelleth, we should but flatter them, and lie against the Truth; there is, no doubt, as much of that bitter root in them as may be matter of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mourning and humiliation unto them before God; neither will they (we believe) deny, but that they would wish the whole Church of God in this Land, and the Judicatories thereof, to be of their judgment in these points of difference, though, we hope, not upon the accompt that it is theirs, but because they judge it to be of the Lord, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37606:39"/>
consonant to the rule of His Word; but that they do affect preheminence, and would set up a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their party over the Church, and over their Brethren, We have confidence and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to deny it, and have their works to witnesse the contrary. Our Brethren do well know that in their judgments, the Commission of the Generall Assembly, 1650. is still in force; and might they not, if they had been a party affecting prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, have exercised the Power contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these years past? But how soon those of their number, who are members thereof, had, with the advice of other Brethren of that judgement, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-forth the causes of the Lords controversie against the Land, they did abstain and have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thertills abstained from acting in that capacity; How frequently also have they offered unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution Brethren, that if they would by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alone, and without them purge the House of God, that it should satisfie them to look on and rejoyce in their work; and if when they had long waited for it and saw them like to do nothing in it; yea, that most of them were adverse to it, and were polluting in stead of purging, Must it be an affecting of domination for Ministers and Elders in the House of God, to propound such means and overtures as do carry in them some probability to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doing somewhat in that necessary work, wherein they are yet still willing that the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Brethren should have more than equal share with themselves? It hath been ordinary for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men, whose consciences could not suffer them to be silent and to couch under publick corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without bearing testimony against the same,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37606:39"/>
and endeavouring a remedy thereof, to meet with such reproaches from oppressing and loose parties and persons that have stood in the way of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that they would needs be judges, and did take too much upon them, and were seeking to set up themselves: It being amongst the policies of Satan (wherein not only the common world, but even good men may sometimes through weaknesse and mistake be subservient unto him) because he cannot finde in the outward carriage of those whom God calleth to witnesse against, or pull down his kingdom, sufficient ground of challenge by which they may be made odious to the world; therefore he thinketh it for his advantage to charge them with inward abominations, such as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and ambition, and covetousnesse, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous projects and designs, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowing that though they may justly deny these things, yet they shall not be able easily to refute them, there being alwayes somewhat in the most innocent and best actions of the best and most innocent men, that may by an uncharitable judgment be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued to spring from such roots.</p>
            <p>It remaineth in the last place, that we should speak to those Proposals, and Overtures of Union and Peace, that are tendred to the Protesting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and published to the world in that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; concerning which, before we descend into particulars, we offer these generall Observations; 1. That in the very entry, they lay such a stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-block in the way, as seemes to render Union very hopeless: For, having spoken of the tearms of Union, propounded by the Protesting Brethren, and of the pretended injuries done by them to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37606:40"/>
Government, they do the in eight page conclude thus; <hi>For our part</hi> (say they) <hi>we resolve in the power of the Lord's grace never to accord therunto, nor to reced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> from the estbalished Government, be the hazard what it will;</hi> that is in plain English, We resolve never to condescend to any overture of purging of the Church, that hath in it any circumstance out of the common road of doing it, by the plurality of corrupt men in Presbyteries and Synods, nor to recede from that arbitrary unlimited submission, which we have declared to belong to the essence and being of the Government. As long as these Brethren will condescend to no effectuall means of purging the Church, and will unite with the Protesting Brethren upon no other tearms, then upon their yeelding to such a submission; How can there be a comfortable Union and Peace? 2. That whilest they make an offer of Peace, and profess themselves to be heartily content to bury in oblivion all former injuries, and to be far from any animosities which might have flowed from the same: They do in this Paper rake the very bowels of by-gone actings; and from thence come and raise heapes of alleaged injuries, and that with such a height of animosity, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, open and professed enemies could hardly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip them therein: so that the white and black of that printed Paper are not more opposite, then their professions and practices therein are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent. 3. That it cannot be certainly and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what are the Overtures of Union and Peace, which they tender to their Brethren in that Declaration; because they do for the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their minde in order therunto, refer to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37606:40"/>
Conference at <hi>Edinburgh, November</hi> 1655. and to their late Representation: And do thereafter in this Declaration enumerate some particulars, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by others mentioned in the Conference, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring themselves, whether they do continue still of the same minde, as to these; wherby the Protesting Brethren and others are left in the dark, as to their present thoughts about these things. It is true, that in the last page of their Declaration they do tell us, <hi>That notwithstanding all the violent attempts of the Protesting Brethren against the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Government and them, since their Conference with them, yet they are not at all irritated therby to recede from the condescentions and offers then made.</hi> Whether the frame of their spirits, as to the matter of irritation, doth answer so fair expressions, let the tenor of their Representation and this Declaration bear witness. But as to their Proposals, if they do not recede from any of their condescentions and offers, made at the Conference at <hi>Edinburgh, November</hi> 1655. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that after they have expressed but a few of them, without mentioning the rest, they do in the penult page of their Declaration tell us, That they have made choise of this way of making known their inclinations to Peace, that their condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may not be hudled up in a Conference with some few, who may keep them up, or represent them to others as they please? These words seem to us in the scope of them clearly to import, that this Declaration bears all, and the outmost length of their condescentions; and yet it comes short in sundry particulars of what they granted in the Conference, and also of what they required; and therefore, though they may understand themselves,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37606:41"/>
yet we believe, it will be hard for others to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them; whether from this Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>r only, or also from the Papers at the Conference, we be to take the just measure of their Proposals and Desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es. 4. That they do usher in these things, which they would make the world believe to be great conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentions to the protesting Brethren, with great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations of the nature of their Acts and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded assertions of matters of fact. As first, Speaking to these Acts of their Assemblies, that are a Barr in the way to keep Protesting Brethren from the Ministery, and from being members of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicatories. <hi>We shall not now insist</hi> (say they) <hi>to clear the justice and necessity of the conclusions of these Assemblies at that time, and to shew that nothing was then done but what was done formerly in like cases.</hi> Our Brethren do by these hints, give the Protesting Brethren clearly enough to understand what lot they might have expected from them, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of these Acts, if the times had not altered. Were these Acts just and necessary at that time, and are not so now also? What hath made them change their nature? Our Brethren give just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to people to stumble, and have the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in contempt, by pleading conscience, and justice, and necessity a long while for things; and then receding from them upon politick grounds, as if there were no conscience, nor justice, nor necessity of duty in them. Surely, if there be any variation, as to these Acts, it is not from the nature of the things themselves, but because the times have changed; and if the times should change again, it is more than probable that they would find the same justice and necessity in them still: We do
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37606:41"/>
not know why when they proffer a suspension of the execution of them they should assert the justice and necessity of them, but that they may have a handsome regresse to take them up again when they find an opportunity, which saith, that it is not regard to justice, but to necessity, that prevails upon them to lay them down. But what justice or necessity was there for such conclusions as these, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hat did enact censures of Deposition against all the Ministers, and of Excommunication against the Professors of this Church, that did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Constitution and submit unto the Acts of these Assemblies? Was there justice and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity for so severe procedure for refusiing submission in things, which in our Brethrens opinion are so extrinsick to our Doctrine, and Worship, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and Government? Or, was there justice and necessity to persecute all those who did plead, and bear testimony against the open breach of a sworn Covenant and Engagement? We know no precedent or parallel that our Brethren can shew for this, unlesse they fetch it from the times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Prelacy. <hi>We might also</hi> (say they) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, that though some very few Presbyteries have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Intrants to the Ministery, of whatsoever judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they should promise not to trouble the peace of the Church with these needlesse debates; Yet, to our best knowledge, none of these Acts have been</hi> de facto <hi>a bar to hold out any godly man who was lawfully and orderly called and tried; though we may but too justly complain how industrious and active they have been to thrust-in men of their judgment, and crush godly and able men, who did not agree with them.</hi> Though all that's here asserted were true, yet hath there been
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37606:42"/>
too much mischief done by these Acts, to wit, the thrusting of godly men out of Elderships, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Synods, and the barring of hopeful young-men from trials, in order to publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching, and of able and godly Expectants from being called and tried, in order to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in the Ministery; because they had no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their consciences to take upon them the bonds required, which we have already set down: for, this Act, as it hath kept sundry Congregations from calling Expectants of that judgment, because there was no probable way how they could b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37606:42"/>
who are for the Protestation; so serious are our Brethren in these matters, that it seems they love to jest: But who gave them this power to require these bonds of men of their own judgment, seing the Act speaketh only of men of the other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Or, if they do exercise it, do they mean to bind up men of their own judgment from deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the Protestation and against the Publick Resolutions? or, to bind them up from debating for the Publick Resolutions, and against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation? If so, why do they themselves shew them so bad example in their Representation and Declaration, which are fraughted with debates of that nature? Why do they that teach others, not teach them ownselves? But what rational man, who readeth these Acts, will think that they were equally made for, or that they can be equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against men of both judgments? Their last refuge is, That, to their best knowledge none of these Acts have been <hi>de facto</hi> a bar to hold out any godly man, who was lawfully and orderly called and tried. We have already told them, that it is a bar to keep some from being called, and others from being tried; and therfore this, though true, were but a sophistication as to the point they speak unto: but there is not truth in the thing it self, because godly men, lawfully and orderly called and tryed, have been barred from entring the Ministerie by this Act, as themselves do well know, and whereof we can give the instances. As to what they speak of the protesting Brethren, that they may but too justly complain that they have been industrious and active to thrust-in men of their judgement, and to crush godly and able
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37606:43"/>
men who did not agree with them: it is but a groundlesse complaint, that is as easily denied as asserted; For our parts, we think that there is cause to wish there were more industrie and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity amongst the protesting Brethren for their duty, and that there were more ability and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse amongst the Expectants who are of the Resolution judgement. Next, they tell the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing Brethren, That <hi>though they make a great noise of the Censures inflicted on some of their number, by the Assembly,</hi> 1651. <hi>yet they might say much on the behalf of the Assembly their proceeding at that time, and of their lenity, who did only censure four of their number; who yet have never submitted to these Censures, and consequently have the lesse cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</hi> It seemeth they do still resolve to justifie all their unluckie proceedings to a tittle, and that they do rather repent that they have done so little, in persecuting the protesting Brethren, then that they have done so much: Was it lenity, first, to suspend and depose innocent men from their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, because of their witnessing against Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breaches, and then to ordain the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Kirk to proceed against them with the sentence of Excommunication, if they should not submit to their unjust Censures? That they have not submitted, was not because of any abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of rigor upon the part of the Brethren who are for the publick Resolutions, (they having caused some of these Sentences to be publickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, four or five years time after the enacting of them, and having denyed to admit others of them as correspondents, though clothed with a commission from their own Synods, for that effect)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37606:43"/>
but from the conscience of their own innoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ncie and of the iniquity and nullity of these Sentences, as being unjust in themselves, and proceeding from these who had no Authority; and yet, have they great cause to complain, because they have thereby not only been violently thrust out of these Kirk- Judicatories, where the resolution Brethren could carry the vote, but also have been exposed to railing and reproach and hazard from profane and malignant men throughout the Land, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of them to suffering and pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>cution from ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected persons in their own Congregations, who have, upon that account, not only separated themselves from their Ministerie, and set up others according to their own heart in their stead, but done their utmost to thrust them out of their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and when that could not be obtained, have done what they can to make their life a burden and comfortless unto them; in all which (for ought that ever we did hear) they have been connived at by the resolution Brethren, and in most of these things countenanced and assisted, by not a few of the chief of them, who have thought it good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, so to do: but bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed be His holy Majestie that hath not herein accomplished their desires, but hath upholden His weak Servants and keeped them from fainting in the day of their trouble. And though the resolution Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do now seem to proffer some mitigation in the matter of these Censures, yet is it (being duly weighed) in such a way and upon such hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as maketh it nothing upon the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For why? They do not offer that these Censures
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37606:44"/>
shall be declared void or null, or, that these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, notwithstanding thereof, shall be declared standing Ministers of the Gospel; but after a preface of the justice of these Censures, they are content that the Synods do take off the Censures that are upon their respective Members; which doth suppose, and lay for a gronnd, that they have been reall and just Sentences, rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, for reall and just causes, and are now taken off (as these Brethren explain themselves at the conference at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) for the Peace of the Church; which is, in stead of making them void, in effect to establish and fix them, as to the equity of them, however a dispensation be granted to these Brethren, whom they concern, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Ministerie for Peaces sake; and neither is even this to be done, but upon their giving assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their submission to the Judicatories; that is, in our Brethrens sense, never to counteract any of the Sentences of the Church- Judicatories hereafter, but to submit thereunto, whether they be just or unjust, the iniquity whereof we shall afterward discover.</p>
            <p>But leaving these generall considerations, we shall take notice of the insufficiencie, inequality and iniquity of their proposals for Union and Peace. First, They are insufficient; because, 1. There is no remedie, unlesse it be a mock-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, holden forth therein, as to the matter of the publick Resolutions, and the corrupt constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two pretended Assemblies, at Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for preventing the like corrupt constitution for the time to come;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37606:44"/>
which things they know to be two great grounds of the protesting Brethren their grievances. These Brethren do in the conference at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb. 8. 1655. propound and desire, <hi>That the Acts of the Commission of the General Assembly,</hi> 1650. <hi>concerning the publick Resolutions, and their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Warnings, and Acts resulting thereupon, and the Declarations and Acts of the two late contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Assemblies of</hi> Dundee <hi>and</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and all other Declarations and Acts in Presbyteries and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, that are the results thereof, be rendered of none effect, in order to censure past or to come; and also, so far as they do import, or may be alleaged as the publick definitive judgement of this Kirk, or of any of the Iudicatories thereof, anent the matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, and that they be not re-acted in any time hereafter. Next, that it be declared, That the two controverted Assemblies at Saint</hi> Andrews, <hi>and</hi> Dundee, <hi>and</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>shall be, as to their consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in the things protested and excepted against, no precedent nor prejudice to the constitution of future Generall Assemblies.</hi> Of all that is contained in these desires, they do only proffer a cessation from the execution of these Acts, whereby a barr is laid in the way to keep men who are not of their judgement from the Ministerie, and that they shall agree that they be made void and null by the next Generall Assembly. If it be said, that they do also agree that the matter concerning the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Resolutions be remitted to the Determination of a Generall Assembly. It is true, they do so, and that is the mock-remedie we spoke of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving we have just reason to call it so; not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37606:45"/>
only, because in the same place they will have it an Assembly according to the established order, which, being expounded according to the Acts of their two late Assemblies, importeth an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of such only to be Members, who do acknowledge the constitution, and submit to the Acts of these Assemblies that ratified these Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and the things relating thereunto, all others by their established order being incapable to be chosen Members; but also, because they are sure to have an Assembly according to their mind, the plurality of Presbyteries being of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the protesting Brethren being (as they call them) but a small number in comparison of these who are for the publick Resolutions. But haply, some will say, That the resolution Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren cannot, without quitting of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, condescend that the publick Resolutions shall not hereafter be looked upon or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as the publick definitive judgement of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> We know, that themselves do so say, but of this we could never hear a satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reason from them; and, we believe, men of more piercing judgements then we are, shall hardly reach it. Is the repealing of one Act of that Assembly, to which they did vote, and which they do still in their judgements approve, as just and equitable upon the matter, a quitting of their judgements, more then the repealing of another, to which they did also vote, and do still approve of? They are content for the peace of the Church to repeal these Acts that do relate to the censuring of such as do oppose these Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37606:45"/>
and this they can do without condemning or quitting of their judgement: And may they not also, without condemning or quitting of their judgement, for the peace of the Church, repeal these Acts that declare these Resolutions to be the definitive sentence of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland?</hi> this would not be a quitting or altering their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the things themselves, but only the taking-off the Synodicall or Juridicall tye; not because of any error in the things themselves, but upon other extrinsick considerations, a thing very ordinary in Judicatories both Civil and Ecclesiastick: And we believe, unbyassed men will think that our Brethren, who professe and publish the matter of the publick Resolutions, to be a question so extrinsick to our Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Government, and a debate now so far removed out of our way, are bound the rather so to do, because our Doctrine, Worship and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can receive no prejudice by taking-off a Synodicall tye in matters of opinion that are so extrinsick thereto. If our resolution Brethren do indeed judge them so extrinsick, and yet will not herein condescend, they give more then cause even to indifferent men, to apprehend that all their professions for, and pretensions unto Peace, are but professious and pretensious; or else, that they mean to hold up the tottering foundations of these rotten Resolutions, in order to some new fabrick that they intend to build thereupon when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity shall serve, unto the producing of the like or worse divisions and persecutions in the Church then they have formerly brought forth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:37606:46"/>Secondly, These Proposals of theirs are unsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, because they do contain or hold forth no effectuall means for purging of the Lords House of insufficient and scandalous and corrupt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Elders, which is one of the main desires propounded by the protesting Brethren, and one of the most necessary duties that lyeth upon the Church at this time, there being so many of that sort in the Land: they do in this particular give them a number of good words, but when they are compared with their practices and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, they shall be found but words and no more; they tell them that <hi>they do not contravert with them in this businesse, having often professed their willingnesse to go about that work in the most strict way, according to justice, and the common rules of Church-Iudicatories in such cases; and that they have not only often intreated them to unite upon this very account, that the work of purging might be carried-on more effectually, but have upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any report of scandall or insufficiencie, laid forth themselves to the utmost to try and examine the truth thereof, and have not been wanting in inflicting due censure for any thing that at any time was found.</hi> When we read these words, our spirits were filled with astonishment and grief, and what answer to return to such asseverations, we do not know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be to commit the cause unto God, who knoweth their way in these matters, and whether they have made conscience of the work of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these seven years past, or have neglected and obstructed the same; yea, have in a great measure undone what was formerly done therein.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37606:46"/>
How few insufficient, scandalous Ministers, since the birth of these publick Resolutions to this day have been removed from bearing charge in the House of God, and how many such have been brought-in? We do believe that it may be truely asserted, that the resolution Brethren in one Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod since that time have brought in moe, who were formerly publickly censured for their scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and malignant carriage, then all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of that judgement, have purged out. There be in one Synod nine or ten such brought into the Ministery, besides four or five others, whose mouths are opened to preach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and likewise some others who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at to preach and administer the Ordinances, notwithstanding of their being twice deposed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, because of grosse offences. Let them name us, if they can, so many purged-out by the Resolution-party in all the Synods of their way these seven years past; Why then do they speak such big words of their willingnesse to, and activity in purging? Yea, who knoweth not that many of their party oppose Union upon this very accompt, and that even good men amongst them, who were wont to be of another spirit, are too slow and backward in this duty, by which it hath come to passe that a few processes that have by importunity been set on foot against some naughty men in some Synods, have by the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution Brethren their exercising their wits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to find out and cast in legal shews of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, such as variety of exceptions against witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and glosses upon their depositions, and such
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37606:47"/>
like, been rendred more tedious, and involved in moe notional debates than readily are to be found at the most litigious Civil Bar; and after all, these things have come but to a poor issue in the end, very few (if any) of these men being deposed from the Ministery, notwithstanding of many and gross scandals which they do lye under. It is the sad complaint of the Godly, that the simplicity of the Gospel, and the good old way that was wont to be used in the Church, in the trying of insufficient and scandalou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Ministers is forsaken, and such a way taken as rather giveth them ground and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to cover and hold fast their iniquity, than doth contribute to the convincing of their consciences and making them acknowledge their sin, by which it comes to passe that poor souls, who groan under the burden, are discouraged to offer the grounds of their grievance, as much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to find any remedy thereof: But, say the Resolution Brethren, <hi>they are so far from foreslowing or obstructing purging, that, to delare their readinesse and sincerity in that matter, they are content, if their Brethren be not satisfied with the Rules of procedure hitherto agreed upon, that they condescend upon the strictest Rules can be desired in justice for trial and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and that they shall be willing to observe them; providing they be Rules binding for all, and to which all will submit, both we and they.</hi> To which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, first, That they do not adhere unto, nor put in practice the Rules already agreed upon, to what purpose then should new Rules be agreed upon? It was formerly agreed upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Synods ought, in the case of the negligence of Presbyteries, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37606:47"/>
Visitations for trial and censure in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bounds: but in very few of the Synods of the Resolution judgment have there been any such Visitations appointed or kept since these Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had a being, albeit Presbyteries be negligent of their duty; yea, sundry Brethren in sundry of these Synods shew themselves dissatisfied with, and speak against such Visitations; And as long as the Synods themselves do not practise them, there being so much need of them, how can we otherwayes judge but that they do dislike them? Secondly, It was formerly agreed upon, That the Kirk-judicatories might, in the trial of Ministers, proceed by way of Inquisition: but now this is dissented from and casten at by many of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution Brethren, who will have no trial; some of them without a Libel and others of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Libel and an Accuser too, engaging to prove his Alleageance under pain of being censured as a Slanderer. Thirdly, Sundry things, such as drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> swearing, &amp;c. which were formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against with the censures of Suspension and Deposition, are now so ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nuated by many of these Brethren, that they do refuse to censure them with these Censures, unlesse the habits or many continued re-iterated acts of these things can be proven; And yet the Authors of this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do so talk, as if all the Brethren of that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did strictly adhere unto, and were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous about the former way of procedure in the trial and censure of Ministers: but besides this departure from former Rules, they do but trifle when they say, that they are content that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37606:48"/>
Brethren condescend upon the strictest Rules can be desired in justice for trial and censure, because it is alwayes with the supposal of this foundation which they have already laid, to wit, That these Rules shall be applied or executed by men of their own judgment, who are the plurality in Presbyteries and Synods, And what purging we may expect from them, these seven years pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice do now sufficiently manifest.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The insufficiency of these Proposals doth appear from this, That they do offer and hold forth no remedy for the grievance of the Protesting Brethren, and of the Godly throughout the Land, in the matter of planting Congregations upon the Call of the plurality in Paroches, many of which are ignorant, and disaffected, and malignant, by which it comes to passe that men get into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, that cannot speak a word in season to a weary soul, and who discountenance piety and godlinesse, which (if there be not some effectual remedy provided against it) cannot but prove an evil very destructive to the Church, and afflicting to all who do unfeignedly desire and seek the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Gospel, and of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, These Proposals do not mention any remedy against such Ministers, Expectants and Schoolmasters, who were deposed or silenced, or removed from their Charges by General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies or Synods, or their Commissioners, or by Presbyteries before these differences did arise, and have again intruded themselves, or are reponed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to publick stations in the Ministery, or Schools, or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37606:48"/>
have their mouthes opened by Presbyteries or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, without confession and acknowledgement of, and repentance for all the particulars contained in their sentence and otherwise, then is provided in the Acts of uncontroverted General Assemblies: Nor do they hold forth any thing as to the way of calling of a General Assembly, and the electing of Commissioners thereunto, and handling of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters therein; all which, as also the giving of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual evidence and assurance in matters concerning the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Church, and the enemies of Truth and Godlinesse, and the work of Reformation, for adhering unto these Articles of our Covenants, and the solemn publick Confession of Sins and Engagement unto Duties, and all the Acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted Assemblies relating thereunto, in the literall and genuine sense and meaning thereof, which were propounded by the Brethren for the Protestation in the Conference at <hi>Edinburgh, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1655. as conducible and fit means to the making up of a solid Union and well-grounded Peace.</p>
            <p>In the next place, we desire it to be considered, Whether these Overtures of <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by these Brethren, be not very unequall: It hath been, and is their manner to professe and print, that they are willing to offer very equall tearms of Peace; So in the ninth page of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, <hi>That they have already offered, that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ough they hold fast their own judgment, yet they will not impose upon the Protesting Brethren their judgments in the matter of their first difference.</hi> But these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37606:49"/>
notwithstanding, they do in sundry parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars impose upon their judgment; As first, in the matter of the <hi>Protestation:</hi> They do require that these Brethren do declare, that their Protestations against the two late controverted Assemblies and their Resolutions and Acts therunto relating, shall not hereafter be made use of in any Judicatory of this Kirk, for continuing (as they are pleased to expresse it) or holding up debates about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our present differences; So in their Paper of the sixteenth of <hi>November</hi> 1655. in the Conference at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which in another Paper of the 24. of <hi>November</hi> at that Conference, they expound thus, That their meaning is that they shall not make use of these Protestations in any Judicatory to call in question and anul the Constitution and Authority of these two late Assemblies; which if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing Brethren should consent unto, would upon the matter make them to condemn their own judgement, and infer their passing from, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of these Protestations in so far as they might be a remedie against the corrupt Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these two Assemblies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to which they did conceive themselves bound in duty and conscience to make them; yea, it should with their consent make way to establish for the future the Constitution and Authority of these two As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, because it should with their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, take out of the way all the legall barr that is standing against that Constitution and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Secondly, What greater imposing can there be upon their judgements, or what more unequal conditions of Peace can be propounded unto them
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37606:49"/>
then to require that they should engage themselves to an absolute and unlimited submission to the Sentences of the Kirk-judicatories especially when the Resolution Brethren are not only the plurality in most of the Judicatories, but when many of them are not such for qualification and carriage as they ought to be; What were this but to give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up their judgments and consciences unto the meer arbitriment and will of men, to be imposed upon by them, and ruled at their pleasure? Thirdly, How unequal a Proposal is it, that the matters in difference shall be referred and submitted to the determination of the next General Assembly, when most of the Ministers of the Land, of whom that Assembly is in all probability to be made up, (how contrary to the Covenant, and many Acts and Declarations of former uncontroverted As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies is already declared) have engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves many wayes for these Resolutions, which are the ground of the difference. These few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars may make it appear that the Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Brethren do not walk with an equal and even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>oot in their Proposals; We mean, they do not offer such tearms of Peace as are equally free of imposing upon either party, or do equally ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ld as much as they require; which we do not take notice of as if this were a commendable and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven way in the things of God, we judge it but the effect of the wisdom of the flesh and to smell rankly of a carnal poltick spirit, to half and divide the thiugs of God, for making Peace amongst men: But to discover that our Brethren do not walk up to their own professions in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37606:50"/>
matter of Union and Peace, and that whilest they would make the Nation and the World believe, that they offer equal Conditions, and do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in any thing to impose upon their Brethren; yet their Conditions are very unequal, and that they would highly impose upon them.</p>
            <p>But if the Overtures for Union and Peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by these Brethren, were insufficient and unequall only, though upon these two branches there be just ground for the Protesting Brethren to deny them entertainment; yet were they more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, if they did not involve injustice and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which might be shewed in sundry particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: But this Answer having drawn to a greater length then was at first intended, we shall now only speak to that one, in which these Brethren assert the essence and being of Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to consist; and for denying of which, they hold forth the Protesting Brethren, as men that have receded from their former principles, and have in their judgments and practises turned adversaries to the very being of the Government, to wit, That arbitary and unlimited submission to the Sentences of the Church-judicatories, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Discipline and Government, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by these Brethren. We have already spoke unto the state of the question, and have shewed how far submission to the Sentences of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories of the Kirk is condescended and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lded unto by the Protesting Brethren; as also, how far it is urged and required by the Brethren for the Resolutions, and what Reasons and Grounds they do bring for their judgement in that particular,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37606:50"/>
to which we have answered. It now remaineth that we should bring these Reasons, that seem to plead the unwarrantableness and iniquity of that Submission required by them, that if they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently satisfie therein, they may be receded from; or if otherwise, that they may cease to urge that matter any further; or at least, that indifferent persons may know that it is not refused, but upon weighty reasons. Before we propound our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, we shall premise some common and known truths, concerning Church- Judicatories, and their Decrees and Sentences; As, 1. That (to express it in <hi>Calvins</hi> words, in the eight chap. of the fourth book of his Institutions) whatsoever reverence or dignity is by the Spirit of God in the Scriptures given, whether to the Priests, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that it is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the duty and priviledge of every Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and of every inferior Church-judicatory, to examine by the judgement of discretion every thing which the Church-authority joyneth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be agreeable or repugnant to the rules of the Word; and if after a diligent and impartiall search it be found repugnant, they are not to bring their consciences in bondage therto, neither is the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exercising of the judgement of descretion by inferiours, the setting them as judges over their superiours, or making them transgress the line, or limits of that due subordination and submission ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto them of God. Protestant Divines in their writings, <hi>de judice Controverstarum</hi> have fully answered this, and shewed us, That it doth not make a private man or an inferiour, Judge of the Sentences and Decrees of his superiours, but only of his own actions. Having premised these
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37606:52"/>
things, we offer these Reasons against the Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so much pleaded for by our Brethren.</p>
            <p n="1">First, This submission, we mean an absolute submission, or such a submission as is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of subjection to such Decrees and Sentences of Church-Judicatories as are upon the matter, and for the ground of them unjust and repugnant to the Word of God, hath neither precept nor precedent for it in the Book of God; if any man say, it hath, we desire him to bring it forth: we know that the Lord did enjoyn His People under the Old Testament, under very severe punishments, to do according to the sentence which they should be taught by the Priests, the Levits, in the place which the Lord should choose, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 9, 10, 11, 12. But <hi>Calvin</hi> telleth us well, <hi>Ubi de ijs audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endis agitur, ibi nominatim ponitur, ut secundum Legem Dei respondeant:</hi> That in the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where it is commanded to hear them, that it is also commanded, that they should answer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of the Lord. We also know, that under the New Testament we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey them that have the rule over us, and to submit our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is in the Lord, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. that which we call for is some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or binding precedent in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that holdeth forth submission to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Ecclesiastick Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Sentence, that is unjust and contrary to the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is contrary to clear Scripture precepts and Scripture precedents: to Scripture precepts, such as these, <hi>Be not servants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 23. <hi>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37606:52"/>
hath made us free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage,</hi> Gal. 5. 1. <hi>It is better to obey God then men,</hi> Act. 5. 29. <hi>Preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 24. To refrain from duty upon the meer will and commandment of men, is to be a servant unto men, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Christian liberty, and to be intangled with the yoke of bondage, and to obey man rather then God: and to say, that we will not preach the Gospel, nor receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, though God hath commanded us so to do; Let us suppose that a man duely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is suspended from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or from the exercise of the Ministrie, or excommunicated and cast out of the Church, because of his pressing and holding forth some precious Truth of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which a Kirk-Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory condemneth for a lie, and passeth such Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Censures upon him because he doth adhere thereunto; Shall we say, that this man is bound not to communicate, not to preach the Gospel, to absent himself from the fellowship and Prayers of the Saints? Our Brethren will haply tell us, that he is bound for Peaces sake so to do, till his appeal be discussed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what shall the innocent man do when it is discussed against him, and the unjust sentence of the inferiour Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie confirmed by the superiour? shall he go to a higher, and when he is gone to the highest, and is condemned there too, (as Christ was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>) what will they now allow him? will they have him still to be a servant of men,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37606:53"/>
and still to be in bondage? and though the Lord Jesus hath commanded him to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and said unto him, Wo unto thee, if thou preach not the Gospel; and hath commanded him, to eat of His body, and drink of His bloud, and not to forsake the assembling himself with the Saints of God; yet, because men <hi>pro arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratu &amp; imperio;</hi> yea, because of his adhering to the Truth of God which they have rejected and condemned, hath forbidden him so to do; <hi>That be shall not obey God, this is a hard saying, who can receive it?</hi> It is also contary to clear Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was often commanded by the Authority both Ecclesiastick and Civil, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear speaking of the Word of the Lord; yet did he give no subjection to the sentence, either of the one or of the other, but went on in his Ministrie, notwithstanding of all the Inhibitions and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures past against him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. <hi>ch.</hi> 32. <hi>ch.</hi> 37. and <hi>ch.</hi> 38. <hi>Amos</hi> was commanded by <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Priest, to prophesie no more at <hi>Bethel,</hi> because it was the Kings Chappell and the Kings Court; yet he did not submit, but did counteract that commandment, and did continue to prophesie in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 13, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15, 16. <hi>Daniel</hi> was commanded to make no petition to any God or Man for thirtie dayes, save to King <hi>Darius;</hi> yet did he not submit, but counteract, by going into his house, and opening his Chamber-window towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and kneeling on his knees three times a day, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and giving thanks before His God as he did aforetime, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The <hi>Iews</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:37606:53"/>
did agree, that if any man did confesse that Jesus was the Christ, he should be put out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue; yet did the poor man, whose eyes He had opened, confesse Him openly; and though he was actually cast out for doing of it, yet did he not submit, but went on to confesse Him still, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 22, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. The Apostles were commanded once and again by the Council at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not to speak nor teach any more in the Name of <hi>JESUS;</hi> but they told them, that they could not but speak the things which they had seen and heard, and that they ought to obey God rather then men, and notwithstanding they were first threatened, and afterwards imprisoned, and thirdly beaten by them for so doing; yet did they not submit nor forbear, but daily in the Temple and from house to house they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 29, 40, 42. <hi>Paul</hi> being accused, first before <hi>Festus,</hi> and afterwards before <hi>Felix,</hi> the Roman Deputies, That he was a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the Sect of the <hi>Nazarens,</hi> who also had gone about to profane the Temple; Did not only appeal to <hi>Cesar,</hi> but went on in his course, and preached the Gospel, and preached that the <hi>Iews</hi> killed the Lord Jesus, and their own Prophets, and persecuted the Apostles, and pleased not God, and were contrary to all men, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 5, 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This submission dethroneth Jesus Christ, who only hath power over the consciences of men,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37606:54"/>
to bind them by His Authority, by attributing such a Power and Authority to Church-Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torics as doth bind mens consciences upon their meer arbitrement and pleasure: for, we must be subject, because they will have it so, though the reason why they command this subjection, to wit, our supposed delinquencie, be a meer <hi>non ens</hi> and such as hath no foundation in truth and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If it be told us, that the conscience is not bound, because the judgement is still left free, and the outward acts only restrained. We would have our Brethren to remember, that some of themselves, and others who did oppose confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Ceremonies, did tell the Prelats and their party, when they used this defence against the argument taken from binding the conscience, to wit, That if the bare Authority of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Law, without any other reason then the will and pleasure of men, be made to restrain us in the use of things which are in themselves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, then is Christian liberty taken away; and if so in things indifferent, how much more is it so in things necessary, such as keeping fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with the Assembly of the Saints in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers and Praises, and eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Table of the Lord, and preaching the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c</hi> the practice whereof are things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God unto persons duely qualified and instructed thereunto. If it be said, That these things cease to be obliging duties to such a person <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and that the sentence of the Church commanding him to abstain, looseth him from the obedience that he doth otherwise owe unto
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37606:54"/>
the Commandment of God: we desire a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Scripture of Truth for such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as that which preferreth the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men unto the Commandments of God, and say, That it is better to obey men than God. Shall the sole will and meer pleasures of men loose a man from the obligation he oweth unto the Commandments of God? If so, let us no more blame the Pope for dispensing with divine Laws. I cannot abstain from taking Christ's body and bloud, or from preaching the Gospel, saith the innocent man, unjustly sentenced, because I am thereunto called and commanded of God. But saith the Synod or Kirk-judicatory, We have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to abstain, and therefore you should abstain, and may be satisfied in your conscience so to do; because our Command looseth you from the Commandment of God. Hence a fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This submission concludeth a man under a necessity of sinning against God, by omitting those necessary duties that are commanded him of God, upon a non-relevant reason, to wit, the meer will and pleasure of men, to whom God hath given no power against the Truth, but for the Truth; no power to destruction, but to edification.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If such a submission be due to the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Kirk in matters of Discipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, We do not see how it is not also due unto them in matters of Doctrine and Worship. The authoritative and juridical power belonging to Classes and Synods is threefold, <hi>Dogmatick, Diatactick</hi> and <hi>Critick.</hi> Dogmatick, in reference to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37606:55"/>
matters of Faith and Rules of Worship, which God hath laid down and prescribed to us in His Word, and the inconsistency of heresies, errors, and corruptions therewith. Diatactick, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to external order and policy in matters cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial, relating to time, place and persons, the conveniency whereof is determinable by the light of Nature and Christian prudence, and the general Rules of the Word; such as these, That we should do all to the glory of God, to the edification of the Church, and in order and decency, &amp;c. Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, in reference to the repressing of Scandal, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Heresie, Schism, Obstinacie and Contempt, and preserving of the Purity of the Truth, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of Conversation, and Unity of Judgment and Affection in the Church of God, by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the spiritual censures of Admonition, Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper, Excommunication and Suspension, and Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Ministery. Now all these Powers being authoritative, and in their determinations and exercise confined unto, and circumscribed within the bounds of the Word of God, for their rule and being, given to the Church for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not for destruction. We would desire from our Brethren a Reason, why the Critick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power should be more binding than the other? or, why submission is due to an unjust sentence proceeding from the Critick-power, whilest it is not due to any erroneous or corrupt Decree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Dogmatick or Diatactick power; Hath God put more honour and respect upon the last than upon the two first? Or, hath He given

And if this submission be equally due to the judicatories of the Kirk in all the three; then if they shall determine that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Faith alone is an error, That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under both kinds is not necessary, That kneeling is a necessary gesture at the Sacrament; That it is necessary to forbear working on Yule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and to keep it holy, and such like; We are bound not to professe, nor preach, nor act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Commissioners of the Gen. Assembly,

1650. did declare, That a great company and faction of wicked men, sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, may and ought, in the case of necessity, be imployed in a Christian Army and Covenanted Nation, for the defence of Religion and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

Have the Ministers and Saints and Courts of Jesus Christ received Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and His Ordinances upon these tearms, that if a superiour Court will have it so, they shall all crouch down, as Asses under the burden, and let them, without gainsaying (they being now cudgel'd into silence by a sentence of suspension from the Sacrament, or Deposition or Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication) ruin Church, and Ministers, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and Professors, and all the precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of Jesus Christ; And shall we say that such a submission is required in this case, as though they ought to do nothing but weep and pray in secret? How great tyranny is this, and how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medilesse a way to ruin? And yet, this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of our Brethren's opinion. If they tell us, that there is no hazard of these things, because the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is sound in Doctrine, and Worship, and Discipline, and Government, and that it is upon the account of the soundnesse of the Church-judicatories only, that they challenge this submission as due unto them: We desire 1. to know whether they will grant that such a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as they do now plead for, may be denied to Church-judicatories that are unsound? and what degrees of unsoundnesse they will have them to fall into before this submission can be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37606:60"/>
denied unto them? It seems to us, by our Brethrens judgement, as long as they keep any thing of the being and authority of Kirk-judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, though they be corrupt, not only in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Determinations, to which submission is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but in many things besides, both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Discipline, and Government, this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission must be granted them, because to deny it, is to deny the very being and essence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: How this shall be avoided we do not see, unlesse they say, That a Church-judicatory that is unsound in any point of Truth doth lose its being and authority, which we hope they will not say, having in some of their Papers charged it as heterodoxie upon the Protesting Brethren. 2. As we shall be glad that they will confine this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to sound Judicatories, upon the accompt of their soundnesse only; so in the case of their so doing, we do not see what this importeth more in the matter of submission than the Protesting Brethren are willing to yeeld, to wit, A submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to all sound Determinations and just Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the respective Judicatories of the Kirk, without any counteracting; because if it be given to them upon that accompt only, that they are sound, then is it only to be given to them when they are sound and right in their resolutions and actings, which the Protesting Brethren willingly yeeld, and be like, in some particular cases some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more. We finde them in their last Paper, in the Conference at <hi>Edinburgh, November,</hi> 25. 1655. professing that if the case were only of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, in things of more private interest and personal concernment, and of Judicatories

We conclude this debate of the nature of that submission that is due to Church-Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, with two testimonies of men, who are deservedly acknowledged to be great and worthy asserters of Presbyteriall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Government. The first is of the Authors of the Divine-right of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Government, who in the 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> of that book treating of the subordination of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to greater Assemblies, for their authoritative judging and determining of causes Ecclesiasticall, and the Divine right thereof, do write thus; <q>It is granted (say they) that the highest Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37606:61"/>
Assembly in the world, cannot require from the lowest, a subordination absolute and <hi>pro arbitrio, i. e.</hi> at their own meer will and pleasure; but only in some respect, subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion absolute, being only to the Law of God, laid down in the Scripture. We detest Popish tyrannie which claimeth a power of giving their will for a Law. It is subjection in the Lord that is pleaded-for, the streightest rule in the world, unlesse the holy Scricpture, we affirm to be <hi>regulam regulatam, i. e.</hi> a rule to be regulated, peace being only in walking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture Canon.</q> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. The other is of our Country-man, Mr. <hi>George Gillespie</hi> in his Assertion of the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>sec. part, ch.</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 127. <q>We must distinguish (saith he) betwixt a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance absolute, and in some respect; a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation doth absolutely depend upon the holy Scriptures alone, as the perfect rule of Faith, and manners, of Worship and of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for we accurse the tyrannie of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, who claimed to themselves autocratorick power over Congregations to whom they gave their Naked-will for a Law: one of themselves told a whole Synod, that they ought to esteem that best which seemeth so to superiours; and that this is a sufficient ground to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for obeying, though the thing be inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. We say, that Congregations ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be subject to Presbyteries and Synods, yet not absolutely, but in the Lord, and in things lawfull: and to this purpose the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Presbyteries and Synods, are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined

            <p>Having now vindicated the Protesting Brethren from the Aspersions unjustly cast upon them in that Declaration, and given a Reason why they cannot accept thereof, as containing right and fit foundations of Union; We have only to add, That we know and are perswaded in our spirits, that as the divisions of this Church, are amongst the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est wounds and greatest afflictions of their souls; so there is nothing (next unto communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with God in his Truth) which they do more earnestly desire, than a sinlesse Union and Peace in the Church; and would redeem it at any rate that shall not pollute their consciences, and widen the breach with God: And therefore, as through the goodnesse and mercy of God, these Brethren have a witness of their innocency, and of the justice of their cause in the hearts of many of the precious and godly in the Land: So we desire, that none of the Lord's People will receive the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations that are laid against them, or look upon them as men of implacable spirits, who hold up contention and division in the Church, but esteem them such as stand for the defence of the Truth, and are seeking and pursuing such an Union and Peace as may be not for the destruction, but for the preservation of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Cause of God,</hi> which they conceive themselves bound to, and tender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own Persons and Ministery</p>

               <p>AFter that this Answer was sent to the Presse, the Authors of the Declaration, to which it doth contain a Reply, together with several other Brethren of their judgment, meeting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in an extrajudicial way, two moneths after the first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing thereof, did resolve that the Declaration should be tendered to the several Presbyteries of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for their approbation, and thereafter offered by them to the Protesting Brethren in the several parts of the Country, and that their Answer should be desired thereupon.

That herein they have had little or no regard to the due liberty of Presbyteries and Synods, notwithstanding of their great pretentions and professions unto the contrary in all their debates with the Protesting Brethren, a few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons having first, without acquainting them with that Paper, or desiring their approbation thereof, published the same as the Iudgment, and in the Name of the Brethren who are for the established Government of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then <hi>ex post facto</hi> a long time after it had gone abroad materially in their names, to endeavour to engage them in the approbation thereof. 2. That the Presbyteries of that judgment have walked in a very different and dissonant way in order to that
