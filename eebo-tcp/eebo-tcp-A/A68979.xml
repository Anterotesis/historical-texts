            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>And this vnhappie countrey, which before flouriſhed in great wealth, ſtate, pleaſure and peaceable commerce with ſtrangers, no warre at hand, nor none towards, but ſuch as no man looked for, was on the ſudden, before a mans

And finally, what end followes ſuch treaſonable and deſpiteous crueltie, as the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſequell of this hiſtory ſhall declare.</p>
               <p>You ſhall therefore vnderſtand that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the laſt of that name, Emperour of <hi>Ruſhia,</hi> after the death of his father <hi>Baſilius,</hi> called for his ſtearne and auſtere gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well by ſtrangers, as his owne naturall ſubiects, the great Tyrant of <hi>Ruſhia</hi> ſuccéeded him, both in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and hatred of his ſubiects: For notwithſtanding that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was a moſt excellent Prince, framd euen in the prodigality of Nature, endued with many commendable parts, and hereyicke vertues, in the flower of all his youth and beauty, which commonly the people do much eſtéeme full of rich hope and expectation. Yet ſuch was the hatred they bare vnto his father, that not dying with his death, it liued ſtill in his iſſue, and proued in ſhort time the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Prince, who (ſetting aſide his haughty diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) which ſéemed to be inherent in him by Nature, he was otherwiſe a moſt abſolute Prince, noble in mind, and of a kingly preſence.</p>
               <p>He hauing thus by his fathers death obtained, but not eſtabliſhed himſelfe in the Empire, deuiſed the beſt meanes he could for the aſſurance of his eſtate, which by reaſon of his ſubiects minds (being Alians to him) and many alſo of the Nobility (which for his fathers ſake alſo bare him no affection) ſtood very fickle: Amongſt which, there was at that time one <hi>Kneſeuanſuſce</hi> a noble man, and of great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14548:4"/>
power, that in the Raigne of the great Tyrant, being great Maiſter of the Horſe, did alſo at this time beare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Offices in the Empire, which the preſent King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> more for feare then loue, ſuffered him to enioy. And that ſtate in a Prince muſt néedes bee vnaſſured, where the ſubiects power ſhall bréed the Princes feare.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Vanſuſce</hi> in the former Emperours raigne, did flily by his bounty and popularity wind himſelfe into the loue and opinion of the people: and becauſe that ſome fewe turbulent broyles and dangerous innouaſions were by his power and policy pacified, he was held in great eſtimation of the Prince, and great veneration of the Nobility, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which neuertheleſſe there were ſome that looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his ſtate, with an enuious eye, did alſo with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eyes looke into his actions, that ſpringing from ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more then from countries care or honorable ends, they found his greatneſſe to be dangerous, and thoſe acts which caried the name and colour of the Emperours good, ſerued vnder hand to make way for his ambition, as hauing only a reference to himſelfe and his owne deſignes, which <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> well perceiuing, did neuertheleſſe diſſemble, and coulourably made him faire countenance, as loth (in this gréene world) to ſtirre the fire that lay hid in this embers.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Vanſuſce</hi> was very noble in bloud, deriued from a long continued aunceſtry, honored in many ages with many alliances of the Empire, alwayes held in great loue and eſtimation of the people, he was in his owne perſon of a Princely preſence, full of affability &amp; Court complement: yet neuertheleſſe ambitions, cruell, a great diſſembler, not letting to kiſſe whom he meant to kill, ſparing no mans death, whoſe life withſtood his purpoſe. He was heard once ſay to a ſecret friend of his, that that man was to be held vnworthy the ſtocke of all Nobleneſſe, that yéelded his honour to vaſſalage, whoſe fortunes might attaine to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty, whereby diſcouering his owne affections, he made himſelfe tranſparant, thinking that if his words were brought in queſtion, his power was able to defend

them. This <hi>Vanſuſces</hi> greatneſſe gane principall matter for the Emperours diſtruſt, knowing well that his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once ioyned with the peoples hate againſt him, whoſe natures are euer wout to follow Nobility, there might be raiſed a dangerous faction: for the preuention or méeting whereof, his friends councelled him to ſtrengthen his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured eſtate, by mariage in the alliance of ſome forreine Prince: for the furtherance whereof, there was a young Lady at that time of Princely birth and admirable beauty, as yet vncontracted in the Court of <hi>Poland.</hi> Thither with great preparations were Embaſſadors with great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſent, the principall of whom was a young Nobleman, and kinſman to the Empereur, called <hi>Tragus,</hi> that bare chiefe place and honor, who being honorably entertained in <hi>Poland,</hi> found their diſſignes happely ſuccéede to their deſires: for in ſhort time this young Lady was withall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity affianced to this yong Prince, a great ioynture granted, a rich dowry conſtituted, and the Embaſſadour richly rewarded, withall ſpéed richly returned into <hi>Ruſhia.</hi>

La Vile</hi> with his troups held on his courſe, méeting with no other Occurrents by the way till hée came to a little riuer, which they found ſo déepe, and the current running ſo ſwift by reaſon of the late diſſoluing of the Snowe, that they knew not how to paſſe ouer. <hi>La Vile</hi> himſelfe proffered to giue the attempt, but was ſtayed by others that looked into the daunger: a French Souldier of his Troupe, ſhewing more courage than foreſight, tooke the riuer with his horſe, and by the violence of the Streame, were both drowned. Here they ſpent ſome time to ſéeke out a foord, but found none: at laſt they eſpied a narrow place, where (pulling downe an olde houſe ſtanding hard by) with the rafters thereof they made a little bridge, vppon which they paſſed on foote, ſwimming ouer with their horſes in their hands. Thus they marched forward till they came within ſight of <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> about the noone time of the day. <hi>La Vile</hi> when he came within view of the Towne, and ſaw how it ſtoode parted
