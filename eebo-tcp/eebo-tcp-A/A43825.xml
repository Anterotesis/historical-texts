         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Right Honorable, Alderman Warner,

The worthy Sheriffs, Aldermen and

All the sweet fruits of Truth and Love through
CHRIST JESUS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S when King <hi>Solomon</hi> built his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
which was <hi>Typical to Christ and his
Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 7. 21.</note> there were two <hi>Pillars</hi> which
did both <hi>adorn and strengthen it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jachin <hi>and</hi> Boaz.</note> When <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
speaks <hi>Prophetically</hi> of the Government of
that Church, he tells you of two <hi>Staves,
Beauty and Bands:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 11. 10, 14.</note> And when <hi>Paul</hi> writes
<hi>Apostolically</hi> of the <hi>building up,</hi> and <hi>beautifying</hi>
the Churches of Christ, he commends to
you <hi>Truth and Love.</hi> And if an <hi>Apocryphal
Book</hi> may be heard (as why not, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of maners, and things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb facs="tcp:98369:3"/>
amongst three things of <hi>strength, Wine,
Women and Truth, Truth carries it away as most
potent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the power of Love,<note place="margin">Cant. 8. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi>
will tell you it is <hi>as strong as death;</hi> the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
workings whereof, are most emphatically
represented by <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Charity

charity vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up; doth
not behave her self unseemly, seeketh not her

not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth;</hi>

have even the same in the end of that verse,
<hi>endureth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely never was there more need of
such an <hi>union</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Truth and Love</hi>
would make up amongst Saints, then now,
when the <hi>disaffected</hi> in all the Three <hi>Kingdoms</hi>
are like to make a <hi>Prey</hi> upon the people, by
reason of their unkinde and most <hi>unbrotherly
Divisions.</hi> This is like to be our sad Motto,

godliness;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3.</note> Onely we believe about all matters
of Church-Government, which are neither
so <hi>clear</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor of such <hi>concernment to

as well as <hi>Luthers;</hi> there must be morter <hi>to
binde the bricks together,</hi> some soft Spirits; if
all be rugged, we shall have no <hi>Spiritual
building.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the scope of this plain Sermon,
which now you have been pleased to make
<hi>more yours,</hi> by your order for the <hi>publishing of
<pb facs="tcp:98369:4"/>
it,</hi> intending (I hope) by your desires to have
it <hi>repeated to your eyes,</hi> that you may the better
<hi>repeat it in your practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Durandus <hi>tells us</hi> Paul <hi>was pictured</hi> with a
Sword,<note place="margin">Paulus eum ense &amp; libro pingitur, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cro furor Pauli, liber est conversio Sauli. <hi>Dur. l.</hi> 1. C. 3.</note> and with a Book; intimating by the sword,
what he was before his Conversion; by the Book,
what after, when he so much minded the edification
of the Churches of Christ.</p>
            <p>O that we Ministers and Brethren who
differ,<note place="margin">Potest mibi atiquid videri alteri aliud, sed neq ego quod dixero praescribo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri, nee ille mihi. <hi>Aug. in Psal.</hi> 16.</note> might lay aside our <hi>swords,</hi> and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
try what <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi> will do to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our unhappy and most unseasonable Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi> which
doubtless need not so divide us,
neither should we in <hi>things of this nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
or impose one upon another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were three Fellows of <hi>Merton</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the one a <hi>Thomist,</hi> the other a

<hi>Woodstock</hi> to petition the King that they
might have a door out of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge
for their conveniency; they all <hi>agreed to desire
to have a door,</hi> but could not <hi>agree upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Petition;</hi> one was for <hi>Habeamus os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
the other thought that too general, and
therefore would have it <hi>Ostium fieri,</hi> but then
the question was, Who should make it, or
<pb facs="tcp:98369:4"/>
where; the third <hi>Vt ostium factum sit,</hi> yet that
pleased not. <hi>We all would have a Government,
but cannot agree upon the maner, divers forms being
in view:</hi> O that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> might be
the <hi>Vmpire!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I have for divers years endeavored,
according to my measure, and <hi>still shall,</hi> what
ever others say of me, as being confident, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Counsels conduce much more to an happy settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then such as are high and rigid;</hi> And I rest
assured, that sober moderate Spirits are much
better <hi>friends to Presbyterial Government</hi> (which
I desire may besettled here) <hi>then they who drive
so furiously.</hi> Its true, I believe the abounding
of <hi>Heretical Opinions,</hi> and <hi>Schismatical Practices,</hi>
have begotten many <hi>Malignants</hi> amongst us,
but withal I fear, the severity of some <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
gives too much advantage to <hi>Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox</hi>
and <hi>Schismatical spirits.</hi> I cannot believe
it, though I have often heard, That some of
my Brethren were angry at this Discourse,
<hi>because so moderate;</hi> surely, it is either because
they are <hi>guilty,</hi> and too much ingaged in <hi>a
party,</hi> whereas I being uningaged, can with
<hi>freedom of spirit</hi> (which liberty, I highly value)
<hi>unpartially oppose what is amiss in any,</hi> and <hi>imbrace
<pb facs="tcp:98369:5"/>
what is good</hi> where ever I finde it. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith,
<hi>A man of understanding is of a cool spirit:</hi>

which purpose he uses four several Arguments;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, There is a</hi> common engagement of all Saints to Vnity:
<hi>I beseech you</hi> walk worthy of your Vocation, whereu to you are
called, with all lovliness and meekness, forbearing one another in
love; there is one body, one spirit, even as you are all called in one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98369:6"/>
               <hi>hope of your calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God
and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you
all;</hi> here is a whole bundle of Arguments, in this first consider
your Vocation, those Priviledges to which you are advanced
thereby; and they leave a very great obligation upon you, as
Saints to <hi>study Vnity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, There is an Argument from the <hi>Equity of the
thing,</hi> in the 7. Verse.<note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> 
               <hi>Vnto every one of us is given grace, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the measure of the gift of Christ:</hi> unto every one of us; <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
one hath <hi>some gift,</hi> as it pleases <hi>Iesus Christ to proportion out
such a measure to this Saint,</hi> and such a measure to that Saint;
the <hi>little finger</hi> in the mystical body, so much as is fit for him,
in the hand, so much as is fit for him, and this with a common
respect, that there might be a mutual use <hi>of all those,</hi> with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency
to the whole; in reference to the mystical body of
Christ, there is an equity in it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, There is a very <hi>great congruity;</hi> and that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you shall finde in the 8, 9, and 11, Verses:<note place="margin">Vers. 11, 12.</note> Jesus Christ
<hi>when he did ascend,</hi> he gave <hi>gifts to men;</hi> all the gifts that are
in the Churches, and graces, they are derived from the same
efficient cause, and therefore it is most <hi>incongruous,</hi> that they
should be distracted and divided, so as to reflect <hi>dishonorably</hi>
upon him that is the sole efficient cause of them, and that with
<hi>common intents and purposes,</hi> for good of the <hi>mystical body.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But then fourthly and lastly, You have here another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the <hi>necessity of it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 13, 14.</note> till <hi>we all come to the Vnity of
Faith,</hi> and that we <hi>be no more tossed to and fro as children, and
carried up and down with every wind of Doctrine; but that we
speak the truth in love, and so grow up into Jesus Christ in all
things, who is the head;</hi> here is the necessity of it, you'l never
grow up to intimate communion and fellowship with Jesus
Christ, you'l never make a wise improvement of him, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the mystical body, unless you learn this heavenly skill,
namely, How <hi>to advance Vnity;</hi> and so I come to shew you
what propositions this last Argument, drawn from the necessity
of the thing, will afford us; in the 15. Verse,<note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> which by Gods
assistance, according as the weak measure of strength I have will
bear, I shall insist upon at this time, <hi>But speaking or following the

               <hi>Christ is the head of particular Saints, &amp; the head of the Church:</hi>

which <hi>men</hi> had not so much as any thoughts of, or desires after,
<hi>God pitched upon,</hi> namely, Christ, and <hi>designed him the Head of

the head of a man hath a preheminence, therefore we must have

head, able to <hi>advice, and guide, and govern the body;</hi> as the
Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of him in 1 <hi>Pet, 3. 22. Who is gone into

the <hi>mystical body,</hi> the head is <hi>primum vivens,</hi> and he gives life
to us, and we derive our life from Jesus Christ, the head; he
hath life, and he hath it abundantly in himself, and he lives,
that we may live; as I remember there is such an expression in

with reference to that place; and so in these four particulars
Jesus Christ hath a Headship:<note place="margin">The appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of Christs Headship.</note> the next thing is now, <hi>The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
of this Headship, to whom is he a head?</hi> He is an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

professors as he is a vine, and doth communicate some sap to
those that are in him, no way but by an external profession,
as you have it intimated in <hi>John 15. 2. Every branch in me that
bears not fruit, shall be cut down and cast into the fire;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there are some <hi>branches in him externally,</hi> as he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

who is the Head:</hi> It is the perfection of a Christian, <hi>to improve

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The <hi>ends</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and expectation in giving gifts.</note> For the intention and expectation of Jesus Christ himself,
when he did ascend and gave gifts, it is this, in three particulars:</p>
            <p>1. That there should be a <hi>growth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there should be a <hi>growing up into Christ.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I beseech you mark these three particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> First, That <hi>there should be a growth;</hi> how a growth? so as to
compleat the number of all the Saints,<note place="margin">That there should be a growth.</note> that not one of them
be lost: Jesus Christ hath undertaken, that he will not lose one
that God the Father hath given him, and therefore all those must
be called in; and it is conceived by learned Expositors, that that
is the meaning of this place, <hi>Christ hath given gifts, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints;</hi> that is, for the compleating the number;</p>
            <p>To fill up <hi>the number</hi> of persons, that so many as were
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98369:10"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the compleating of the <hi>graces of those Saints,</hi> both in
the degrees, and in <hi>the activity of them,</hi> for Jesus Christ (it is
an admirable condescending expression) reckoneth not himself
compleat, till all his members be compleat; I beseech you take
notice of that first Chap. and the last verse of the <hi>Ephesians,
Which is his body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. last.</note> 
               <hi>the fulness of him that filleth all in all:</hi> Jesus
Christ fills <hi>all in all,</hi> and yet (he saith) his body <hi>is the fulness of
him;</hi> he is pleased not to account himself compleat as head of
the Church, till his members be compleated, as to the <hi>number
of them,</hi> and till their <hi>graces</hi> likewise be <hi>compleat</hi> to such a
<hi>degree</hi> as he intended: but then</p>
            <p>Secondly, There must be a <hi>growing up,</hi> there must be the

not onely an <hi>incorporating into Jesus Christ,</hi> though that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Christ,</hi> that you may be moulded in Christ; I would not be too

                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> It is an admirable one that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
hath, <hi>That Jesus Christ took the nature of man upon him,
that so we might have the nature of God conveyed to us,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature; there is a ground for that expression, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.
and a <hi>delivering up into Christ,</hi> into his word, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17.
<hi>the form of doctrine into which you were delivered;</hi> here is an
admirable improvement of Christ, when a Sermon is <hi>delivered
to you,</hi> the <hi>minde of Jesus Christ</hi> discovered, for you to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up to it,</hi> that you may go out of the assembly under the
<hi>power of that truth,</hi> and <hi>moulded in it;</hi> and then withal, that
Christ might be in you, and you might be in Christ, that there
might be a mutual <hi>in-dwelling,</hi> as in that place in <hi>John,</hi> yea, that
we may come <hi>to live in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> in
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 25. yea, and that the very life of Faith, the life that we
live, may be by <hi>faith in the Son of God,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. not onely now
and then to <hi>pray in faith,</hi> but to <hi>live by faith,</hi> to act all in faith;
here is a growing up into Christ, not onely a growing to some
knowledge of Christ, or to some profession of Christ, or to
make towards Christ, but to be moulded, to be transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98369:11"/>
Christ; here is the entertainment and improvement of the
Gospel that Christ expects: but then</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Growing up to Christ in all things.</note> 
               <hi>Growing up in all things unto Christ;</hi> There is the
proportion, or the dimension, as a Head, <hi>Our growth must be
as large as his Headship;</hi> now as he is a <hi>Prophet,</hi> so we must
grow up into him, that we may have <hi>wisdom,</hi> and all those
supplies from him; as he is a <hi>Priest</hi> grow up in him, that we may
have <hi>Righteousness</hi> from him, for the covering of all our sins;
as he is a <hi>King</hi> grow up in him, that we may have a <hi>Redemption</hi>
from all our snares, bondages and enthralments; for our being
and well being, having our subsistence in him, <hi>in God the Father,
and in Christ Jesus,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 1. when we are converted,
we come to have <hi>a new subsistence in Christ:</hi> for <hi>Truth,</hi> and for
<hi>Degrees of Grace</hi> grow up into him, for <hi>habits</hi> and <hi>acts,</hi> for
the <hi>velle,</hi> as well as for the <hi>posse,</hi> for <hi>converting</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi>
grace, for it is he that works in you the will and the deed, <hi>of
his own good pleasure,</hi> as in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. for comforts, and for
hopes, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. That you may <hi>have joy through believing,</hi>
and the God of peace fill <hi>you with hope,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. all our

I have done now with the first thing, the sum of the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the next is,</p>
            <p>The ground,<note place="margin">The grounds</note> why Jesus Christ expects this; for very good

               <label type="milestone">

and knock at the door, if any will hear my voyce, then I will

(as it were, I may speak it with reverence) to want
<hi>communion with them</hi> who are his in Gods eternal counsels.
But then thirdly, Christ may well expect this,</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> Because attaining the <hi>intended stature and measure of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

all come to the unity of faith, and to the perfect stature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the age in Christ,</hi> therefore there is such a pitch, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ expects it; you will never be fit for him, till you come
to your pitch: there is a <hi>minimum quod sic,</hi> as Philosophers speak
about natural bodies, so about every member of the mystical
body, you must come to such a degree of grace before you
are fit for heaven; now God hath designed you that, that you
may be meet to be partakers of the inheritance with the Saints
in light:<label type="milestone">

               </label> it is not slipping out of a drunkards habit, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be dissolved, or to receive the communion, or to give
such and such legacies, or to send for a Minister, and say, <hi>Lord

all thy days, thou art not meet to go to heaven; <hi>Paul</hi> blesseth
God that hath made him meet: Heaven is a holy place, and
God is a holy God, and thou hast a very cursed sinful nature,
very unfit for heaven, till thou be pollished, fashioned and
framed; now Jesus Christ expects this: The third particular
follows; I shall not dispatch all, you'll give me leave to consult
for my own health. As you have had the expectation it self, and
the grounds of it, so you shall have</p>
            <p>The end:<note place="margin">The end.</note> Now the ends of it are two, why Christ intended

Health of body is a great matter,<note place="margin">The stability in Christ.</note> but truly <hi>soundness of faith,</hi>
especially in these unstable times,<note place="margin">Stability in judgement.</note> is much greater: It is a good

there lies his interest, he is a jolly man, a professor at large, &amp; he

Is it thus, that Jesus Christ intendeth this entertainment of
the Ministery,<note place="margin">For Citizens chiefly, who enjoy such rich Gospel-advantage.</note> that we may grow up into him in all things; then
I beseech you give me leave to call upon you, &amp; I do not know
where I could speak more fitly in any place of the world, then
in this famous City, and never more seasonably, then when the
<hi>Representative of the City is met,</hi> namely, that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<hi>What means you enjoy, what Gospel-light the Lord hath
entrusted you with,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 22.</note> and what <hi>he expects from you;</hi> will it not be

day? you that have been <hi>lifted up with Capernaum to heaven,</hi>
if you improve not the means, make account, if one place in
hell be hotter then another, to be thrown down into it: And
all I have to say, is this, Let it be your care so to improve the
Gospel, that you may derive <hi>more from Christ,</hi> and live <hi>more
in Christ,</hi> and <hi>express more of Christ,</hi> that you may be <hi>inclined and
enabled to do more for Christ:</hi> Here accept these two short hints;</p>

God from you that live in London;</hi> why? because as you
have higher food, and more spiritual and more glorious Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-discoveries,
the Lord expects proportionable improvements:

hath been defects in the maner of conveying our Ministery, or
else why do we desire to reform it, but we confidently affirm
our Ministery is from Jesus Christ; Christ gave gifts, with the

<hi>When did this Dispensation begin? in what year

Jesus Christ never give up his Kingdom, till the Resurrection be

word) that Jesus Christ will have a Ministery more or less, till
he have <hi>brought in all the Elect,</hi> and I have this ground for it
out of the word, He gave gifts, Pastors and Teachers, till all
come to the Unity of the faith, and to the acknowledgement
of the Son of God, and to a perfect stature: Now if they say
there is no Ministery, then they must make us believe, that all
the Saints are come in, and that there is a perfect number, &amp;c.

               <hi>Love keeps from Strife, from Schism</hi> (although there

But will some say, what, do ye blame us about Easter, and
a Communion at Easter? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Have we it not in Scripture?
See what Scripture they have for it, I would this secret were
declared to all the world, it would break many snares with
which divers are intangled:</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Acts,</hi> there is the word <hi>Easter</hi> indeed, in the

Prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of Soldiers to
keep him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
There is Easter, but will you hear now, how it came in
first? You'l easily believe that it must be jumbled in one way or
other, if you understand the Original; There was the word
<hi>Passover,</hi> but no <hi>Easter,</hi> the word Easter was not found out
in many hundred years after this was spoken <hi>of Peter:</hi> But here
was a secret.</p>
            <p>It was a glorious work of King <hi>James,</hi> he set divers <hi>Oxford</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98369:17"/>
men, and <hi>Cambridge</hi> men, and City Ministers, with others
to Translate the Bible, a glorious work, how ever <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
may be slighted amongst us, yet <hi>Bugenhagius</hi> and other

            </p>
            <p>I have it from certain hands, such as lived in those times, that
when the Bible had been Translated by the Translators appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the New Testament was looked over by some of the great
Prelates, (men I could name some of their persons) to bring
it to speak <hi>Prelatical Language,</hi> and they did alter (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the means of one that was a great <hi>observer in those
times,</hi> and lived them) <hi>Fourteen places in the New Testament,</hi>
to make them speak the Language of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
that was so cryed up: and I'le tell you some of them.</p>

man take his Bishoprick; it is forc'd, it signifies Charge or
Inspection: but that you may believe that the <hi>Bishops</hi> are the
<hi>Apostles Successors,</hi> let another man take his <hi>Bishoprick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, In the second of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is <hi>Not suffer my Soul
to lie in Hell;</hi> this is clear, <hi>Former Translations have it, not suffer
my Soul to lie in the Grave;</hi> But it was learned <hi>Bilsons</hi> Opinion,
and thrust into the Thirty nine Articles, that Christ did <hi>Locally
descend into hell;</hi> and to make that Translation agree with the
Articles, they must change <hi>Grave</hi> into <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also the Fourteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi>

               <hi>They ordained them Elders,</hi>
they loved to cry up <hi>Consecration</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> and Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and such kinde of things, and Episcopal Ordination too
(for these all advanced the power of the Priests and the Bishops,

            <q>
               <p>I had it related since the delivery of this plain Sermon, by
one who most confidently affirmed it,<note place="margin">Note this grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</note> That the <hi>learned</hi> man
to whom it belonged to <hi>Translate the first Book of Samuel,</hi>
having rendred that which <hi>Samuel from God spake</hi> concerning
<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 11. <hi>This shall be the maner of the King that
shall reign over you, He will take your sons, &amp;c.</hi> He was sent
for to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and there perswaded to make the words <hi>Will
take your sons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shall take;</hi> which he conscienciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
well knowing it was not spoken by <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> by
way of <hi>direction for duty</hi> what he <hi>should do,</hi> but <hi>Prophetically</hi>
and <hi>Eventually</hi> what he <hi>would do.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>And then lastly, for <hi>Easter;</hi> this was another place that was
altered (as you have heard) to keep up that holy time of <hi>Easter,</hi>
as they would think it, for herein was the innocency (though
unhappiness unto us) of the Primitive Worthies, and other
Christians; these had fair intentions in bringing in many things,
they thought to win upon the Heathen, and therefore would
not <hi>wholly anull,</hi> but <hi>change things,</hi> change some of their great
Feasts into <hi>Christmas-time,</hi> change now (it may be) <hi>Pentecost</hi>
into <hi>Whitsomide,</hi> and the <hi>Passover</hi> into <hi>Easter;</hi> it had <hi>a good
intent:</hi> but minding their own intentions, more then <hi>Gods
Word,</hi> their <hi>Rule,</hi> you see how these constitutions of men are
<hi>degenerated.</hi> Now I beseech you, let us not suffer our selves to
be abused, when a word <hi>Easter</hi> shall be thrust in (for it was
divers hundred years after <hi>Peter,</hi> that the word <hi>Easter</hi> came
in) shall we therefore go and keep up an <hi>Easter Communion</hi>
above all times else, for such pretences as these are? Brethren,
the more you <hi>joyn Truth and Love together,</hi> the more you'll be
free from these <hi>fond kinde of Devotions:</hi> And let me say this,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98369:18"/>
It is <hi>Blinde Devotion</hi> indeed; and many <hi>men</hi> that are so <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
for these, and <hi>women</hi> too, they think to get <hi>protection</hi> for
other courses.</p>
            <p>It may be many a Lady that <hi>paints and spots,</hi> and trifles away
precious time, if she be but zealous at an <hi>Easter Communion,</hi>
she thinks to get a protection for all vanities else: A <hi>Citizen,</hi>
if he be a <hi>Patron</hi> to such a <hi>Minister,</hi> frequent <hi>Lectures,</hi> then
he may be <hi>frollick,</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>loose,</hi> &amp;c. Here is Love
without Truth.</p>
            <p>Let me adde this, <hi>Truth</hi> without <hi>Love</hi> makes many swell,
and contemn others; and <hi>Love</hi> without <hi>Truth</hi> edifies to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and to Idolatry</hi> sometimes: What brought in <hi>Praying
to Saints,</hi> but <hi>Love without Truth?</hi> But you'll allow me to be
so indulgent to my self, as that if either the ordinary place, or
the ordinary time be not observed, to pity a man <hi>that hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Gospel method to grow up into Christ, and so to our Spiritual
thriving: <hi>For upon him all our fruit is found,</hi> Hos. 14. 8.</p>
            <p>Take this as a Use of <hi>Caution,</hi>

course taken to <hi>restrain erroneous persons, when they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the peace and welfare of the State,</hi> &amp;c. But that I would
say, is this, That <hi>Errors,</hi> they must be reduced and confuted by
Truth; and then withal, it is most certain, That Errors abound
not by reason of a <hi>Reformation</hi> (and therefore to charge it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Reformation, is very gross) but there is a defect in our
Reformation which gives occasion to them.</p>
            <p>And as for Love, they cry for Love, for Love, and it is a
wonder, men that are against the very <hi>Substantials of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
yet they will cry out against any little <hi>Heterodox Opinion,</hi>
and for Love: <hi>How can they ever expect that godly and wicked
men should joyn together in Love? What Churches then should
we have?</hi> indeed we will love the most carnal men in the
world with a <hi>love of pity,</hi> but not with a <hi>love of complacency
and delight:</hi> And Jesus Christ expects it not, but <hi>that we should
love as he loves.</hi> But then further, what love should we have?
such a love as indeed doth tend to <hi>Edification,</hi> and doth tend
to <hi>Reformation,</hi> and such a love as is <hi>Soul-love,</hi> and such a love
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98369:20"/>
as is a <hi>love to the Head,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Members;</hi> such love
as is not <hi>complemental, and frothy, and flattering.</hi> O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let it be your care still, not to suffer your selves to be any
ways misled, because there are some defects, and want of <hi>Truth
and Love,</hi> it hath always been so: In <hi>Origens</hi> time and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostoms,</hi>
they came to them, complaining, that there are <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
amongst Saints;</hi> they answered, And Divisions will be:
<hi>Are all Philosophers of a minde? Are all Physicians of a minde?
and if all Saints be not of a minde, it is no marvel;</hi> onely let
them have a care to preserve Affection, though they differ in
Opinion. But to close up all.</p>
            <p>That great <hi>Oracle of the Law,</hi> learned Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in
his <hi>Institutes,</hi> gives five properties of a Parliament-man, and I
think they will as well agree to an <hi>Alderman,</hi> to a <hi>Common-Councel-man:</hi>
I desire they may be considered;</p>
            <p>First, saith he, He must be <hi>wise,</hi> and constant, so able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
and know things a right, persons, circumstances, that he
be inflexible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He should have a good <hi>Memory,</hi> so to remember
<hi>past evills,</hi> that <hi>he labor to prevent future dangers.</hi> The other
three he takes from the Elephant: First, saith he,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, An Elephant is <hi>without gall,</hi> that gall that he hath
doth <hi>transire in nutrimentum corporis;</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Elephante melancholia transit in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimentum corporis.</note> if he have <hi>heat</hi> he will
use it, not out of a <hi>selfish passionate respect,</hi> but rather guide
and direct it to a zeal for <hi>the good of the whole Body the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>
And then secondly, for that too he draws from
the Elephants;</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Though the Elephants be</hi> maximae vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tutis &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximi intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, <hi>yet</hi> gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatim semper in cedunt, <hi>and so not</hi> nociva as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livaga <hi>are.</hi> Homini er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranti viam ostendit.</note> The Elephants they never go alone, but they go

creatures, like sheep, O keep together. And then the
third is,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Elephant is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, he saith, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
<hi>loves men:</hi> I would have all these <hi>properties</hi> meet in
every one of these <hi>Worthy Citizens,</hi> that are any way <hi>betrusted
with the Government of the City:</hi> The God of Heaven give
you wisdom, and give you to remember all Providential Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98369:20"/>
that are past, and deliver you from passion, and gall,
and make you flock together, and head together, and teach you
to love men; All this would still engage you <hi>against a common
Enemy:</hi> Love men as men, love the <hi>bodies of men;</hi> and you
have given a most glorious accompt of that this year, to your
praise I must report it, here is this year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why, here is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
proof of your love to men; <hi>Love their bodies, love their
souls, love them as Christians,</hi> especially <hi>love them as Saints,</hi>
have a care to breed them up in Callings, train them up in some
degree of learning; this is most honorable, and, I hope, being
done with an honest heart, it will further your accompt at the
great Day.</p>
            <p>I yet dare take the boldness to adde the <hi>Rules,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Truth, and the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.</note> I
chiefly intended: Some Rules now for your <hi>pursuance of Truth,</hi>
and some for the <hi>pursuance of Love,</hi> that <hi>they may be happily
married this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Truth. Ezek. 13. 2.</note> let the <hi>Word of God be Rule and Judge;</hi> when
you enquire after Truth, study the revealed will of God, and
make use of revelations in concurrence with the Word of God;
but do not set up revelations against the Word of God. It
was a desperate expression from <hi>Valde,</hi> in a Book of his in
great request now adays; it is true, he had many things good
in him, considering the darkness of the times wherein he lived,
a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> saith he, <hi>We must use the Scriptures, as we use
Pictures</hi> (he was a Papist) <hi>use Pictures for a while, till we get
apprehension of the thing or person realized to us, then throw
them away, because now we can pray without Pictures:</hi> So, use
the Scriptures till we have got our mindes raised and elevated,
and then we <hi>need no Scriptures.</hi> The Lord deliver us from
this Opinion, which tends to <hi>undermine the very Word of
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Far be it from me to say any thing against <hi>New-Light, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called,</hi> though there is some so called, which is, I doubt,
Darkness; nor against all <hi>Revelations,</hi> for there is a <hi>Spirit of
Revelation:</hi> but I desire it may be wisely considered, how the
<hi>Spirit of Revelation discovers it self;</hi> Thus chiefly, not in
bringing in a <hi>New Gospel,</hi> and such <hi>New Dispensations</hi> to us, as
<hi>many talk of;</hi> but in <hi>Discovering that Word</hi> which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98369:21"/>
and we <hi>have by us,</hi> in raising our mindes to understand
<hi>that word more fully,</hi> and those <hi>works of God</hi> that are in it
more clearly: I would heartily bless God for it in my self, or
in others, if it were such a <hi>Spirit of Revelation,</hi> as should help
me to see any <hi>Word of God,</hi> or any <hi>Work of God in me</hi> more
clearly:<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 17.</note> This is the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> speaks of; but if you'll talk of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that you have <hi>Revelations beyond the Word,</hi> and it may
be sometimes in a maner <hi>contrary to the Word;</hi> surely this is not
the way of truth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cassainus</hi> his Collat. 2. de discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, cap 5.</note> There is a poor old man <hi>Hero</hi> in <hi>Cassianus,
that thought he had a Revelation, that when he was in the bottom
of ae pit, he should get out;</hi> but for all his Revelation, he was
deceived. I desire such things may be considered. The next
thing is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minde Truth wisely:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Truth.</note> I would say under this head,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Be sure it be Truth that you contend for;</hi> not for unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
Ceremonies, not for trifles, for those things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not the name of Divine Truth: And then</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Proportion your zeal to the nature of Truth:</hi> There are
some Truths <hi>de fide, circa fidem,</hi> and in some sence <hi>praeter
fidem;</hi> I must not allow the <hi>like zeal for all;</hi> I will have the
<hi>Substantial part of my zeal for Substantial Truths, and for
other Truths, so much zeal as the nature of them calls for:</hi>
This is to minde Truth wisely, this is that that becomes you.
And then withal,</p>
            <p>Minde Truths according to the directions of Truth:<note place="margin">3. Rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Truth. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Meddle not with things too high, be sober; <hi>A Spirit of</hi>
Sobriety in Divine things, <hi>and</hi> Modesty in Secret things, <hi>is
most suitable to a Saint,</hi> Rom. 12. 3.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Minde not</hi> Curiosities, <hi>with</hi> neglect of those things that
are necessary: Affirm constantly (<hi>saith</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Titus) that
those that are believers maintain good works, but as for fables,
let them go, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>3. If you'll do what becomes you concerning Truth, Do
not clap a <hi>Jus Divinum rashly upon every one of your Opinions:</hi>
O that brings us into a great deal of bondage; divers things
may be very good, and yet better, and more safely settled is
<hi>Prudentials,</hi> as <hi>Humane Constitutions,</hi> then as <hi>Divine Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98369:21"/>
unless we be sure we are upon Scripture-grounds, then
I say nothing against it. What is the reason now that the Pope
<hi>cannot alter?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jus Divinum nititur verbo Divino. <hi>Ames.</hi>
               </note> I have heard it from some that have spoke with
learned sober Papists, asking them, What think you of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
or the like Opinions?</hi> they profess, Though we
would, yet we cannot alter them, the Pope having asserted them,
who is infallible; so that if we change one Point of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>we spoil all.</hi>

               </label> Truly, if we clap a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

comes another, and then comes another, and so at last you are
involved in <hi>inextricable Errors.</hi> But the sixth and last thing I
