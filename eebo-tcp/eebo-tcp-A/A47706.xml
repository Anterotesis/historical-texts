         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

returned you very great Thanks, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Receit of your Letter; in that,
among ſo many, and ſo great Perſons of
Worth, and Learning, that <hi>France</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
you were pleaſed to do Me ſo much
honour, as to make choice of Me, to be
the Onely man, to whoſe Cenſure you
thought fitteſt to ſubmit this your Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Not that I ſhall ever ſuffer

               </gap>, the

But ſeeing that you are pleaſed to have ſo

not ceaſed by frequent Letters, to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
me to give my Judgment, ſuch as it
<pb facs="tcp:32812:7"/>
is, upon this your Learned Piece; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it did not become me to deny you
any longer. For, that I may here give
you your Juſt Praiſes, what Glory ſoever
all thoſe Authors that have written of the
Rites, and Cuſtomes, of the Jews, (who
were ſometime called, <hi>The Holy Nation</hi>)
can have deſerved, it is all (I ſpeak it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
and without Flattery,) due to
your Excellent <hi>History.</hi> For, the greateſt
part of thoſe other Writers, were, either
not ſufficiently acquainted with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the Jewiſh Religion; or elſe,
were carried away with their own Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and a burning Hatred againſt Them:
or perhaps they were not very skilfull in
the Hebrew Tongue, or were too much
addicted to Dreams, and Trifles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
were perhaps not ſo Faithfull in their
Writings, as they ſhould have been:
Since Raſhneſſe it ſelf is Ingenious enough
in Lying; and a Haughty Spirit cares not
to inform himſelf ſufficiently, in what he
undertakes. But, I muſt needs confeſſe,
you are free from all theſe Crimes: ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:32812:7"/>
all things, here, are Perfect, and every
way Abſolute: neither can I find where
to complain of any thing, unleſſe it be,
(pardon the Liberty I take, to ſpeak free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,)
of the too much Brevity therein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
ſo that, by this means, you have
omitted to ſay any thing, concerning the
Origination, and Ground of the Divine
Precepts, to which you ſo ſtrictly keep
your ſelves: though this, perhaps, you
have done willingly, and of ſet purpoſe;
leſt otherwiſe you ſhould be forced, in
relating the moſt Prodigious Allegories
of thoſe of Your Nation, either to defend,
or elſe condemn them. For they do ſo
ſhamefully ſtuff up their Writings with
Theſe; that a man would take them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for horrid Monſters, then for ſerious
Stories; and, ſuch as ſcarce <hi>Hercules</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
would ever be able to overcome.
And yet I do proteſt ſeriouſly, that I

in <hi>Puniſhing Malefactors:</hi> of the <hi>Purging

<hi>Lilith,</hi> whom they, in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
affirm to have been <hi>Adam</hi>'s Firſt,
though Diſ-obedient Wife; if we look

all thoſe things, which are frequenly
<pb facs="tcp:32812:8"/>
brought in, by the greateſt Maſters in the
Secrets of your Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſerve to be
ſcorned, and hiſſed at. But if we but look

Points, delivered by Your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
we ſhall not be able any where to
diſcover more Deep, and Profound Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;
as may appear to any one, that will
but take the pains, diligently to conſider
that Book of yours, which you call <hi>Pardes
tract. 21. cap.</hi> 5. And as concerning the
<hi>Divination of Dreams,</hi> you might perhaps
forbear to ſay any thing here, becauſe
you had been before informed by our
Learned Countryman <hi>Naudaeus,</hi> that I
had already, in a juſt Volume, written
upon the ſame ſubject, diſcovered what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
in a manner, is to be found, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Obſervation of Dreams, both
among the <hi>Hebrews, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans:</hi>
and had alſo in another Work of
Mine, ſpoken largely of <hi>the placing of your
Beds from North to South;</hi> which is one of
your moſt Famous, and Sacred Rites:
Namely, in my <hi>Notes</hi> upon the Learned
<pb facs="tcp:32812:9"/>
               <hi>Nachman's Epiſtola Sacra,</hi> or, <hi>De Sacro Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitu:</hi>
which having Tranſlated into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
and illuſtrated with <hi>Annotations,</hi> I
promiſed to ſend to you, in a late Letter
of mine, wherein I deſired to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you, concerning the Myſterious
manner of Making your <hi>Tephilim,</hi> and
the true Uſe of them; though you return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me not anything in Anſwer. For, I
earneſtly deſired to know the reaſon, why
your <hi>Borders</hi> muſt conſiſt, each of them,
of <hi>Five Knots,</hi> and <hi>Eight Threads:</hi> for I
profeſſe, I am no whit ſatisfied with the
Applying this, to the Five Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
and to the Commandments of the
moſt Glorious and Eternal Deity: as I
neither am in thoſe other Subtle, Quaint
Niceties, concerning the <hi>Eaſing of the
Belly;</hi> where you ſay, that <hi>Thoſe that make
water, Naked; in a Porch,</hi> or Entry of any
Houſe, ſhall be <hi>Poor</hi> men: and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
uſeth the Name of God, in any
<hi>Stinking Place,</hi> ſhall die ſhortly after.
Neither am I ſatisfied any whit at all in
the Reaſon, which is given, for your ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:32812:9"/>
up all the Paſſages of a Dead Body,
after the Breath is gone out of it: and
therefore the Wiſe <hi>Ben Maimon</hi> did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſcreetly forbear to ſay any thing of
it, where he gives us the Plain Manner of
<hi>Ordering the Dead,</hi> in the beginning of
his <hi>Halaca Ebhet, cap.</hi> 4. in theſe words:
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is to
ſay; <hi>The manner of the</hi> Hebrewes <hi>Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Dead, is thus: They cloſe their
Eyes, and bind up their Jawes, if their
Mouth chance to gape; and stop up all the
Paſſages of the Body, and anoint it with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds of ſweet Spices.</hi> Where he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not the leaſt Mention at all of That
Superſtitious manner of ſtopping theſe
Paſſages; leſt he ſhould ſeem to heap
Trifles upon Trifles. He likewiſe ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſſeth over their <hi>Binding up of the
Jawes;</hi> and hath not one ſyllable, of the
Figure of that <hi>Maxillary Knot:</hi> which yet
I ſhould have taken very Unkindly at his

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. that is to ſay:
<hi>They cover their Dead with Winding-ſheets,
ſewed together with White Thread: and if
the Mouth gape never ſo little, they bind it
up with a Knot, the ends whereof repreſent
the Figure of the Letter <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This Knot is
made of Black Strings; which Sorcerers alſo
afterwards make uſe of, in their Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
I could wiſh, that you had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
furniſhed us, with ſome other ſuch
Paſſages as this, either out of the <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>

your Power of <hi>Puniſhing Malefactors,</hi>

any Criminal Perſon to Death; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
ſome Other kind of Puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

declaring the Cauſe of his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
yonr cauſing them to ſit, Naked,
upon an <hi>Ant-hill:</hi> Your making them to

and to endure their Stings: Your enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them Tedious, and Reſtleſſe <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and Perpetuall <hi>Wanderings</hi> from

by others; and to wear Iron Chaines
about their Neck, either for ever, or for

are your <hi>Sabbatarian Faſts</hi> alſo, which
they were Anciently wont to begin, by
<hi>Looking upon their Nailes, and Paring them:</hi>
for no other reaſon, as I conceive, but to
<pb facs="tcp:32812:11"/>
intimate thereby, the Prodigious Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> who,
though they were cut off, as it were, like
the <hi>Nailes</hi> of a Man's Hand, in that moſt
heavy Bondage of theirs in <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet
did their Nation ſtill ſpring up plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Multiply, in ſpight of their <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Oppreſſors. The Learned <hi>Rabbi Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chai</hi>
conceiveth the Reaſon of this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
to be; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
that is to ſay; <hi>That a
man ſhould think of the Excellency of the
Firſt Man,</hi> Adam, <hi>whoſe Garment before his
Fall, was like a Man's</hi> Nail, that is to ſay,
<hi>of a White and Ruddy colour.</hi> Whence the
<hi>Bride,</hi> being <hi>Sick of Love,</hi> Calls her <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
White and Ruddy.</hi> But I ſhall
omit to ſpeak any more of this Particular,
here; as having elſewhere diſcourſed of it
more largely. Their <hi>Sabbatarian Faſts</hi>
were begun then, by their <hi>Looking upon,</hi>
and <hi>Paring</hi> their <hi>Nailss;</hi> and were ended
with a <hi>Dolefull Hymne;</hi> which they, even
to this day, are wont to prolong, (as you
<pb facs="tcp:32812:12"/>
very well note) after Sun-ſet, every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day at Even, that the Soules of the
Wicked, (which they conceive, are free
from their Torments all that day) may
return again unto them ſo much the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by how much the longer this <hi>Dolefull
Song</hi> is drawn forth in length. In the
mean time the Pious Women take eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
care of the <hi>Lights,</hi> which they ſet up,
on the Eve before the Sabbath, that they
may burn clearly: of which Ancient Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
of theirs, you have, very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
forborn to make any mention:
Namely, how they were of old, and at
this day are wont to promiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Good, or Evill Fortune, according
as they find theſe <hi>Lights,</hi> to burn, either
cleerly, or dimly: which, certainly, is, a
a kind of <hi>Pyromancy.</hi> Theſe women are
very careful alſo, to ſee that theſe <hi>Lights</hi>
be every way Pellucid, and ſhine with an
Equal Flame: which is the True Reaſon
alſo, as I conceive, why they do ſo much
abhor <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Levanah,</hi> the Noon, when it
is Horned; and alſo forbear to do any
<pb facs="tcp:32812:12"/>
manner of Buſineſs, or Worke, in the
<hi>New-Moones,</hi> when as but a Part of it is
enlightened, towards us: and this was the
Reaſon, that there was Anciently a <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
Sacrifice</hi> uſed to be offered, in the
Temple, at this time, which was ſuppoſed
might be a means of diverting the bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the <hi>New Moons</hi> from them. So
that it may hence appear, how much
ſome of your <hi>Rabbines,</hi> (who are herein,
though upon no very good grounds, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
alſo by one of our Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
a man otherwiſe very knowing in
the Jewiſh Affairs) are wide of the truth;
where they affirm, that the Jewiſh women
keep this day holy, becauſe that it was
upon the ſame time, that they refuſed to
give up their Golden Ear-rings, Chains,
and other Pretious Ornaments, toward
the making of the <hi>Golden Calf.</hi> And thus
you may ſee, that there are no ſick mens
Dreams ſo groſſe, but that ſome of the
Wiſe ones, may chance, ſometimes, to
take them up, and maintain them for
Truth. The <hi>New Moons</hi> then were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb facs="tcp:32812:13"/>
               <hi>Unfortunate,</hi> by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
unleſſe they chanced to happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Monday: upon which day, <hi>Rabbi
Chomer,</hi> a Learned <hi>Jew,</hi> and a very great
Aſtronomer, accounts them to be moſt
Fortunate; eſpecially if they happened
after Sun-riſing: although neither He
gives any Reaſon, why it ſhould be ſo; nor
any other Author, that I ever remember
to have ſeen. Not but that I know very
well, that the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> have delivered in
<hi>Bava Kama, cap.</hi> 7. that the <hi>Divine Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
went up into the Mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Law, upon a <hi>Thurſday;</hi> and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received it, he came down again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Monday;</hi> which was the Reaſon
perhaps (ſay They) why the Women
have ever ſince kept this Day Holie. But
why ſhould it not then be ſo kept, by the
men alſo? But theſe are Trifles. If a man
might have libertie to give a gueſſe at the
reaſon, why they accounted the <hi>New-Moon,</hi>
falling upon a <hi>Monday,</hi> to be Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
I ſhould conceive this to be the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:32812:13"/>
probable; namely, becauſe that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Mankind being much governed
by <hi>Moiſture,</hi> This day having a Moderate
proportion of it, is therefore thought the
more Fortunate: and alſo, becauſe it is the
ſecond day of the week; which number
the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> conceive to be, &amp;c. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
generans,</hi> the Firſt in Generation: and
therefore, it being ſo Fortunate, and of ſo
good <hi>Omen,</hi> to the buſineſſe of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which Women, by reaſon of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
promiſed by God upon it, do ſo
much deſire; they obſerve every New
Moon, falling upon a Monday, as a Holy
day; and celebrate it, as being a Fortunate
day, as to the buſineſſe of procreation of
Children; that ſo, by this means, they
may be fruitfull and happy in Child-bearing.
However the truth of this be,
it hath been an Ancient Cuſtome, both
for Men, as well as Women, to <hi>Fast</hi> upon
<hi>Thurſdaies,</hi> and <hi>Mondaies:</hi> yet not every
week throughout the Year, as <hi>Ben Caſpi</hi>
informs us, but only vpon thoſe weekes,
<pb facs="tcp:32812:14"/>
wich they called, <hi>Sabbaticall.</hi> But, what
thoſe weeks were, I do not very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand:
and therefore I conceive it
would be more conſonant to Truth, and
to Hiſtorie too, to ſay; that, Anciently,
each ſeveral Week, throughout the Year,
was called by the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi>
whence that boaſting Speech of the
Proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> may receive no ſmall
light, when he ſaies, in the Holie Goſpel
of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Jejuno bis in Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho;
I faſt twice every Sabbath:</hi> that is to
ſay, <hi>Two daies in every week;</hi> namely <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,</hi>
and <hi>Thurſdaies:</hi> upon which daies
they yet uſe, with the moſt vehement af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of mind that can be, to ſay a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
prayer, which begins with theſe
words, <gap reason="foreign">

ſecret Virtue whereof they believe, that
thoſe Three ſhips which were filled with
the chiefeſt of their Nation, and ſent into

without either Oar, or Sail, about them,
were delivered from moſt evident perill
<pb facs="tcp:32812:14"/>
of ſhipwrack: the firſt of which, they ſay,
landed ſafe at a place, called <hi>Lovanda;</hi>
the ſecond, at <hi>Arlada;</hi> and the third, at a
place called <hi>Burdela.</hi> Which names,
though <hi>Buxdorfe</hi> ſay, are no where to be
found; yet I conceive, the two laſt of
them may, without any abſurditie, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Arles,</hi> or <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>

they have undergone your Learned Cenſure,
and have alſo, by your Care, and Goodneſſe,
been committed to the Preſſe, I cannot poſſibly
doubt, but that you have very diligently read
over, and conſidered. But perhaps, Learned
<hi>Sir,</hi> you expected from me an Account of
the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>Grounds,</hi> of theſe <hi>Rites,</hi>
and <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> of Theirs: But this was
wholly beſides my purpoſe; who never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any thing at all, ſave onely to give my
Reader a Bare Hiſtorical Narration of them:
and to ſhew only their, <hi>Quòd ſunt,</hi> and not
the <hi>Propter Quod ſunt:</hi> as the Philoſophers
uſe to ſpeak: That theſe Cuſtomes <hi>Are,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:32812:17"/>
not, <hi>Why they are:</hi> leaſt, while I pretend to
be a meer <hi>Relater</hi> onely, I ſhould appear to be
<hi>a Perſwader.</hi> If there be any thing you find
wanting here, you need not go abroad for it,
hoving ſo rich a Magazine of Learning at
home, within your own Breast; whence, I am
confident, you are able to bring forth, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the vaſt body of the Hidden Learning of
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> can afford. It remaineth, <hi>Sir,</hi>
that I commit you to the protection of God, the
Great Creator, and Former of All things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
Him, that he would preſerve you in
Health, and bleſſe you with Long Life, for the
Common Benefit of the Learned, and the
more full Increaſe of Learning; for your own
Expectation of the deſerved Rewards, due to
your Worth; and, laſtly, for my own Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Curioſity of
the Wiſeſt Men
hath ſometime
raiſed a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
in them,
of having <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of the Laws, and Cuſtoms,
even of the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:32812:18"/>
who were Worſhippers of
<hi>Falſe Gods;</hi> that ſo they might
draw thence That Benefit, which
a wiſe man knows how to gather
from a Fool: what marvel is it, if
ſome very learned <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have
alſo long ſince had a deſire, to
have ſome Account given them,
of <hi>the Rites, and Cuſtomes, of the
preſent Jews:</hi> the Ground whereof
cannot be denied to have been,
once, derived from the true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all Wiſdom? and that they
were diſpoſed, by means, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to that end. I having
therefore had my continual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with, and been brought
up in the Service of <hi>Chriſtian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,</hi>
and Perſons of Honour; it
hath been often moved unto Me,
<pb facs="tcp:32812:19"/>
that I would write a ſhort, and
true account, of the <hi>Manner of life,
Cuſtomes,</hi> and <hi>Rites,</hi> obſerved by
the <hi>Jews,</hi> at this day, throughout
the World. Which I having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
ſome years ſince, and
ſhewed to ſome of my Friends; I
have bin ſince ſollicited, by ſome
others, to enlarge it, and publiſh
it to the world, for a more publick
ſatisfaction to All, that deſire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
herein. But I, refuſing
ſo to do, gave in theſe Reaſons for
my denial: Firſt, that it was <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe;</hi>
and ſecondly, that the Thing
muſt needs be <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> from Me.
It might be thought <hi>needleſſe;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Buſineſs hath bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
done by many <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and
it would be <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> becauſe it
<pb facs="tcp:32812:19"/>
came from a <hi>Jew;</hi> of whom it
might be very well doubted, that
he would either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceal, or change
ſuch things, as he ſhould conceive
not ſo fit to be publiſhed, when
he ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider better of them.
But, to the firſt of theſe my Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
it was anſwered; that they
were not ſo very well ſatisfied, in
what ever they had yet ſeen writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of this Subject; their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
being either lame, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
or elſe, too copious in things
of leaſt concernment; and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
rather in deriſion of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to make the Reader
merry, then to inform him: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they have often laſhed out ſo
much, as that they have wander'd
very far out of the way, and left
<pb facs="tcp:32812:20"/>
their Reader very much unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
in what they ought to have
informed him. To the ſecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
it was anſwer'd, that very
many perſons of great Learning,
and Quality, were, after long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
confirmed in ſo good an
Opinion of Me, and of my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity;
as that it would not be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
by Any, but that I would
deal ingeniouſly, and ſincerely, in
my Narration: So that, they could
not ſee any juſt reaſon that ſhould
hinder me, from complying with
their deſires. Now I, that have bin
alwaies, naturally, eaſie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
by my friends, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Commands of my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
could not deny them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer; but have endeavoured
<pb facs="tcp:32812:20"/>
to ſatisfie their deſires. Take here,
therefore, Courteous Reader, <hi>a
Short Abridgment of the Rites, and
Cuſtomes of the</hi> Jews: wherein
notwithſtanding there is not any
the leaſt circumſtance omitted;
unleſſe it be ſuch, as are not at all
obſerved now, or regarded by
them. I have divided this <hi>Hiſtory</hi>
into Five Parts; according to the
Number of <hi>the Books of the Law,</hi>
written by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And, in my
Writing, I have kept my ſelf exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Truth, remembring my
ſelf to be a <hi>Jew,</hi> and have therefore
taken upon Mee the Perſon of a
Plain, Neutral <hi>Relater</hi> onely. I do
not deny, but that I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to avoid the giving occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Reader of deriding the
<pb facs="tcp:32812:21"/>
Jews, for their ſo many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
neither yet have I at all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon me to defend, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them: for as much as my
whole Purpoſe is to give a bare
Relation of them onely, and no
way to perſwade any to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of them. However, very
obſervable is the ſaying of That
Great Perſon, though not by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rightly underſtood, (which
yet is Agreeable to that of the
Prophet <hi>Hoſea, cap.</hi> 11.) <hi>Lex Judae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum,
Lex Puerorum:</hi> that is, <hi>the
Law of the Jews, is a Law of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>

               <p>THe Utenſils of their houſes, that

they dreſſe their Meat, and ſerve

ſhould have been uſed by any, beſides
Jews; or if they be of Earth, or Wood,
that hath been made uſe of in heating any

And this they obſerve, from the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>THe Counſel of the <hi>Rabbines</hi> is, that
there ſhould care be taken, that
the Bed's head be placed toward
the North, and the feet toward the
South, or elſe the contrary way; but it
muſt not ſtand from Eaſt to Weſt; out
of Reverence to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to the
Temple, which was indued with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meaſure of Holineſſe in both thoſe
parts: but there are few that take any heed
to this.</p>
               <p>2. When they are lying down to reſt,
they uſe to ſay ſome certain Prayers to
God; beſeeching him, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them from all perils of the Night,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32812:29"/>

thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi> Some add
moreover ſome other the like Prayers;
every one, according to his own cuſtome,
and fancy.</p>
               <p>3. They take very great heed to dreams;
induced thereto by the Examples, which
are found written in the Scripture, of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
Joſeph, Pharaoh, Nabuchadonoſor, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
and others; and by that paſſage in
<hi>Job,</hi> chap. 3. 14, 15, 16. <hi>For God ſpeaketh
once, yea twice; yet man perceiveth it not:
In a Dream, in a Viſion of the Night, when
deep ſleep falleth upon men, in ſlumberings
upon the bed: Then he openeth the eares of
men, and ſealeth their inſtruction.</hi>

4. And ſo great is the regard they have
to Dreams, that if any one dream of any
Ill, ſo that it cauſeth him to be ſad, and
melancholy; particularly, if it be any of
the Four kinds of Dreams, which are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
by the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> they Bleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and ſo Faſt all that day, as the
manner is in all other Faſts; as ſhall be

upon the Sabbath day alſo, whereon it is
forbidden to Faſt, for any other cauſe
whatſoever, in this Caſe of a <hi>Dream</hi> it is
lawful to Faſt, as well on It, as on any
other Feaſt day.</p>
               <p>5. And in the Evening, when he hath
ended his Faſt, before he eareth any thing,
he calleth unto him three friends: to

Dream which I have ſeen be fortunate;</hi> and
they anſwer him every time; <hi>May it be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;
and God make it Fortunate.</hi> And
then, repeating ſome certain Verſes out

unleſſe their own make them
there ſeem very deformed. Neither

Locks of hair upon their head; nor any

Natural Hair, according to the Cuſtome

are never to appear in their own hair

moved toward this buſineſſe, he muſt not
hold it: for in ſo doing, he ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himſelf willingly abominable; againſt
the Command given <hi>Levit. cap. 11. ver.</hi>
44. <hi>Nolite contaminare animas veſtras,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. If the place be ſuch, as that they
may be ſeen by any, they muſt then uſe
all poſſible Honeſty, and Modeſtie. In
Ancient times, when they had not the
Conveniencie of doing this buſineſſe
within doores, but were fain to go abroad,
they obſerved very many points, tending
toward the Modeſtie of the Act: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the place might ſometimes not be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32812:34"/>
ſo ſafe, and free from dangers, they uſed
a certain form of Prayer, or Invocation,
to their Tutelar Angels, that they would
defend them from all dangers: but at
this time there is no ſuch thing uſed.</p>
               <p>5. After they have done, they muſt
waſh their hands, and give praiſe to God;
acknowledging his great Goodneſſe, and
Wiſedome, in that he hath made Man in
ſo Wonderful a manner, and ſo preſerves
him: Whereas if the paſſages for the
Evacuating the ſuperfluities of the body
ſhould be ſtopt up never ſo little a while,
he would die. And this Benediction
they uſe to repeat, as often in the day, as
their Neceſſitie calls them to this Act.</p>

ſay a <hi>Benediction,</hi> and render particular
praiſe and thanks to God, not onely for

among them, that put them on at
the Afternoon Prayers alſo: but there are
not many that do ſo; unleſſe it be the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi>
or Chaunter, who alwaies puts on
the <hi>Taleth,</hi> or Square Veſtment.</p>
               <p>5. When they ſee, that there are Ten
men, of the age of Thirteen years and a
day, aſſembled together, (for if they be
under the number of Ten perſons, they
may not begin to ſing Prayers ſolemnly:)
the <hi>Cazan,</hi> or Chaunter goes then to the
Table, or Woodden Altar before ſpoken
of; and there begins the Prayers in a loud
voyce, all the reſt of the Congregation
ſaying after him, in a ſofter Tone.</p>
               <p>6. The Manner of ſaying their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
is very different among the Three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Nations above ſpecified: and indeed
there is not any thing wherein they differ
more, then in this; as was intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
In their ſinging, the <hi>Dutch</hi> far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all the reſt: the <hi>Levantines,</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:32812:42"/>
uſe a certain ſinging Tone, much
after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner; and the <hi>Italians</hi>
affect a more plain, and quiet way, in
their devotions. The formes and words
are more, or leſſe, according to the day,
whether it be a Feſtival, or otherwiſe; and
yet there is ſome difference among them,
on their Feſtivals alſo.</p>
               <p>7. Nevertheleſſe the main Bodie, and
ſubſtance of their Prayers, wherein all
in a manner agree, is this. In the morning
they ſay certain Pſalms, eſpecially the
145. <hi>Exaltabo te Deus meus Rex,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I
will magnifie thee O God my King,</hi> &amp;c. to
the end: and all thoſe following <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs:</hi>
then a certain Collection of Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to God, which is often repeated in all
the Prayers, and at all times: a ſhort pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

God of hoſts, &amp;c. with the interpretation
of the ſaid words in <hi>Chaldee:</hi> and after
all this is ſaid, there followes one Leſſon
more; and in the laſt place they give
thanks to God, who hath enlightened
them to do him ſervice; beſeeching him,
that he would be pleaſed to bring all men
unanimouſly to the knowledge, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Him: And ſo ſaying, the <hi>Haleno

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:32812:44"/>
8. On Mundayes, and Thurſdays, they
adde in their Prayers, after the <hi>Schemonah
Aſre,</hi> certain Confeſſions, and Penitential
Prayers. And theſe two dayes they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the fitteſt of the whole week, for
a man to indict himſelf either a Faſt, or
any manner of Abſtinence; calling theſe
two days, <hi>Days of Justice:</hi> becauſe that
Anciently, the Magiſtrates, and Miniſters
of Juſtice were wont in their ſeveral Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
to ſit on theſe dayes, and adminiſter
juſtice; and the Villages, and places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent,
came all in, as to a Market, to the
chief City, or Town, as it were in a kind
of relation to the <hi>divine Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. In their Afternoon Prayers, they
begin with the 145. <hi>Pſalm;</hi> then the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſch;</hi>
the <hi>Nineteen Benedictions;</hi> the <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona
Aſre,</hi> firſt in a low voice, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
aloud: and ſo repeating the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſch</hi>
again, they make an end.</p>
               <p>10. In the Evening they ſay certain
Praiſes to God, who bringeth on the
Night; and, who loving <hi>Iſrael,</hi> gave them
his Precepts: then the Three Leſſons,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32812:45"/>
called <hi>Chiriath Scheman:</hi> an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his mercie, in bringing them up
out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> after that, a prayer, that he
would vouchſafe to preſerve them that
Night from dangers: then 18. <hi>verſes</hi> out
of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Nineteen Benedictions,</hi>
the <hi>Schemona Aſre,</hi> in a plain Tone onely,
the <hi>Haleno Leſchabeah;</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſch,</hi>
with which they end their Evening
Service.</p>
               <p>11. Theſe are the principal parts, of
which their three daily Services do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
always: and although that on their
Solemn and Feaſtival days, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
other pieces added, ſuitable to the
day, and the preſent occaſion, as ſhall be
declared in its proper place; yet is this
the Baſe and Ground-work of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
both for the Order, and ſubſtance
of the whole. And thus farre there is no
great difference, betwixt the three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Nations above ſpecified; but they do,
in a manner, all conform to this Method
in their Devotions.</p>
               <p>12. The whole Pentateuch they divide
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32812:45"/>
into 48. or 52. <hi>Leſſons,</hi> which they call
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

and one of theſe is read every week
in the <hi>School;</hi> ſo that by this meanes,
throughout the whole Year, though it

will notwithſtanding all be read. On
Mondaies, and Thurſdaies, after the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
prayers, they take the <hi>Sepher Torah,</hi>
or Book of the Law before ſpoken of,
<hi>chap.</hi> 10. out of the Cheſt or Ark; and
ſaying the <hi>Third verſe</hi> of the 34. <hi>Pſalm; O
magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt
his name together;</hi> and ſome others the
like, they lay it upon the Table, or wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Alter: and then taking it out of the
Covers, and opening it, there are three
perſons invited up, to read the beginning
of the <hi>Paraſcha,</hi> or Leſſon for the day;
One, one piece; and another, another:
and theſe ſay a <hi>Benediction,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and another at the end. Then the
<hi>Cazan,</hi> or Chanter, giveth a bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and ſo each of them promiſeth
to give ſomething, either to the <hi>Poor,</hi> or to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32812:46"/>
the uſe of the <hi>School;</hi> or elſe to the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
himſelf, or to the <hi>Schamas,</hi> or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
Officer. After this, the ſaid <hi>Sepher
Torah</hi> is lifted up on high, open, and the
Holy Scripture, contained in it, is ſhewed
to all the Congregation; ſaying theſe
words out of <hi>Deuter. cap. 4. ver. 44. Iſta eſt
Lex, quam propoſuit</hi> Moſes <hi>coram filiis Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>This is the Law, which</hi> Moſes <hi>ſet
before the Children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. But the
<hi>Levantines</hi> uſe to hold up the Book, in
the ſight of the People, before they begin
to read in it. After this is done, they ſhut
it up, and put it into its Covers, and ſo
lay it up in the Cheſt again.</p>
               <p>13. This Ceremonie, of Reading in
This Book, and of Inviting, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
more, or fewer, up to the Reading in
it, is ſaid to have been ordained by <hi>Eſdra;</hi>
and it is done every Feaſtival, and every
Faſt day; as ſhall be hereafter declared in
order.</p>
               <p>14. And becauſe every one deſires, out
of Devotion, to have a hand in ſome or
other of theſe Religious Acts, either of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32812:46"/>
taking forth, or laying up the Book again,
or other the like Occurrences, during the
time of Prayers; theſe Favours are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bought of the <hi>Chaunter;</hi> and he that

ſet down at large in the Scriptures.</p>

and many others; either more, or leſſe,
according to the number of the Jews,
that inhabite in the ſaid Citie.</p>
               <p>6. If any Poor man have any Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Neceſſitie, greater then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Citie where he lives are
able to ſupply; he then goes to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<hi>Rabbines</hi> of the Citie, and they give
him a <hi>Teſtimonial</hi> under their hands, that
he is an Honeſt man, and one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
their Charitie; and withal intreat,
that every one would lend him his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.
Then goeth He, with this <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonial,</hi>
to all places where any Jewes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32812:52"/>
dwell; and whether it be a Caſtle, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
or other ſmall place, he is there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
a day, or two, with Meat,
Drink, and Lodging; and money, at his
departing. And if he come to any great
Citie, he there procures a Confirmation
of his <hi>Teſtimoniall,</hi> by the Subſcriptions
of the <hi>Rabbines</hi> of that place; and ſo is
ſent to the School, from the <hi>Parnaſſim,</hi> or
the Publick Officers, that have the charge
for the Relief of the Poor in that place;
and thus, in ſome one of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Manners of Collection, he is Relieved,
and receives their Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>7. The Jews ſend their Almes yearly,
from all parts whereſoever they inhabite,
to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the Maintenance of the
Poor that live there, and ſpend their time
Praying for the Well-fare of the Whole
Nation: as they alſo do to other Parts of
<hi>Judea;</hi> as namely to <hi>Saffet, Tiberias,</hi> and
to <hi>Hebron,</hi> where the Sepulchres are of
the Patriarks, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and of their Wives.</p>
               <p>8. Each man in particular may, beſides
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32812:52"/>
all this, give Alms, when, and how much
he pleaſeth, according as he ſhall think
fit.</p>
               <p>9. They account it alſo a Work of
Pietie, to relieve any one whatſoever
that is in Miſery, although he be no <hi>Jew;</hi>
and eſpecially thoſe of the City, or place,
where they inhabite: eſteeming it an Act
of Charitie due to all Mankind, Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently;
the <hi>Rabbines</hi> having alſo expreſly
enjoyned them ſo to do.</p>
               <p>10. And the Greatneſſe of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and Pity, appears in this; that they
are very careful not to torment, or abuſe,
or put to any cruel death, any Brute
Beaſt; for as much as, they are all of
them created of God: according to the

Bible, and which they commonly ſpake
before their Diſperſion: becauſe they all
generally learn, and are brought up in
the Language of the Countries, where
they are born: So that, in <hi>Italy,</hi> they ſpeak
<hi>Italian:</hi> in <hi>Germany, Dutch:</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
Parts, and in <hi>Barbary,</hi> they ſpeak the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Moors;</hi> and ſo of

Strange Languages ſo much their Own,
as that Many of them that have gone out

Language: But in <hi>Italy</hi> they uſe both the

place, from whence the Fathers are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.
So that the Common people
every where conform themſelves to the

more Perfect in the Language of

Elegantly, and according to the

               <p>2. And beſides, in the Pronunciation
of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> they are ſo different among
themſelves, that a <hi>Dutch</hi> Jew can hardly
be underſtood by an <hi>Italian,</hi> or an <hi>Eaſtern</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Dikduk,</hi> then the Italian
doth.</p>
               <p>3. And indeed the Pure Hebrew
Tongue being of little extent, and very
barren of words, there being no other
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32812:54"/>
Bookes, anciently written, to be found
now, ſave onely the aforenamed Twentie
four Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> whence
the whole Language was to be fetched;
the <hi>Rabbines</hi> have ſince thought good to
enlarge it, by borrowing many words
from the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and ſome few from the

               <p>4. This Language is ſtill in uſe among
them, in writing of Books; in all kinds of

Publick, and the like. But their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
Letters of Complement, or Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
are written, for the moſt part, in the

               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:32812:55"/>
5. In their Preaching they likewiſe uſe
the Language of the Countrie, that they
may be underſtood by All; that is to ſay,
they cite the Texts of Scripture, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> in Hebrew; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <p>6. Their manner of Preaching, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

that hath a Mind to Preach, (which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily

putting on the aforenamed <hi>Taleth,</hi> or elſe

the Style, and Method: which is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
among the ſeveral Nations.</p>
               <p>7. And this is done every Sabbath day,
and at all the chief Feaſtivals, for the

the Reader a ſhort Account of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
Order, and Continuation of it.</p>
               <p>5. In the firſt Chapter then of this Book
is declared, how that the <hi>Written Law,</hi>
which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Tora She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bichthab,

<hi>Moſes:</hi> and the Expoſition of this <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law,</hi> and Other of their Ordinances,
they have received from the Mouth of
their <hi>Rabbines.</hi> Now no Part of this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was to be put into Writing, ſo long as
the Temple ſtood: and it was therefore
called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Torah Schebeal
peh, Lex quae per os, The Law delivered by
word of Mouth,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>Traditional,</hi>
and delivered over from one to another,
by word of Mouth only.</p>
               <p>6. But afterwards about one Hundred
and Twentie Years after our Saviour
Chriſt, when the Temple was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
there was a certain <hi>Rabbine,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Rabbi Juda,</hi> who, for his ſanctitie, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:32812:57"/>
Holineſſe of Life, was honoured by the
<hi>Jewes</hi> with the Title of <gap reason="foreign">

Our Holy Maſter,</hi> who was very intimate

that ſince the Tranſmigration, and
Diſperſion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the <hi>Traditionall
Law</hi> began by degrees to be loſt, and to
be in danger of being quite forgotten; he
makes a Collection, in Writing, of all
the Decrees, Opinions, and Traditions of
all the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> that had ever been, down
to his own time; and this <hi>Collection,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made in as good a Method, and as
ſhort as he could, he called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Miſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi>
that is to ſay, <hi>Lex ſecundaria,</hi> or <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of the Law:</hi> and he divided it into
Six Tracts, or Parts. The firſt of which
treated of <hi>Seeds,</hi> and of <hi>Tillage:</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
of the <hi>Feaſtivall daies:</hi> The third,
of <hi>Marriages,</hi> and things appertaining to
Women: The Fourth, of <hi>Dammages,</hi> and
<hi>Suites</hi> of Law, and all <hi>Civil Matters:</hi>

Ths Fift, of <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> The Sixt, of <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and <hi>Uncleanneſſe.</hi> And becauſe this
<hi>Collection</hi> of his was ſo very brief, and
therefore the harder to be underſtood, in
ſo much that it gave occaſion of many
Diſputes, and Controverſies, which were
raiſed upon It; therefore about ſome
Three Hundred and Fifty Years after
Him, there were two other <hi>Rabbines,</hi>
dwelling in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the one of them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Ravenà,</hi> the other <hi>Ravaſcè,</hi> which
collected together all the Expoſitions,
Diſputes, and Additions, that had been
made upon the <hi>Miſchnah,</hi> down to their
own time; adding beſides many Reports,
Sentences, and ſayings of their own,
which they found to make any thing to
the buſineſſe in hand, and thus making,
as it were, the <hi>Miſchnah</hi> to be the <hi>Text,</hi>
and all the reſt to ſerve as a <hi>Comment,</hi> or
Expoſition upon It, they made all up into
a Book, which they called <gap reason="foreign">

made the like Collection, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
which Book is therefore in like manner
called <gap reason="foreign">

any Bone broken in its Life-time, in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
parts of the Bodie, which are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the <hi>Rabbines;</hi> or if it were any
way hurt, ſo that it might have died of
That hurt, they muſt not eat of it.</p>
               <p>10. So likewiſe, if in the Bowels of any
Bird, there ſhould chance to be found
any Thorn, or ſharp Prick, that had got
into the Bodie of it; or, in the Bodie of
any Four-footed Beaſt, any Impoſtuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Swelling, or that the Lungs grew
to the ſides, (all which Particulars they
very diligently ſearch into, after they
have killed it:) they muſt not eat of it:
Obſerving all theſe Circumſtances, from
that which is written, <hi>Exod. cap.</hi> 23. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the End of the Chapter; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in other places.</p>
               <p>11. From this Prohibition of Eating of
Blood it is, that they put all their Fleſh
into Salt, letting it lie in it for the ſpace of
an Hour, before they put it into the Pot,
or Pipkin, to be boiled; that ſo it may be
the more throughly cleanſed from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32812:67"/>
Blood: for, otherwiſe they may not eat of
it, unleſſe it be roſted. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
alſo they never boil the Liver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is wholly made of Blood: but
they either broil it upon a Gridiron, or
upon the Coles; or elſe they roſt it
throughly.</p>
               <p>12. But in the ſeveral Kinds of Fiſhes
which it is Lawfull for them to eat, they
obſerve none of all theſe things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid:
becauſe they are not forbidden to
eat theſe in their Blood; or to eat them,
though they die of themſelves, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>13. They may not eat Fleſh, and
Cheeſe, or Milk-meats, together: obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this, from what is delivered <hi>Exod.</hi>
23. <hi>ver. 19. Non coques haedum in Lacte
Matris ſuae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſeeth a Kid
in his Mothers Milk:</hi> that is to ſay, Thou
ſhalt not ſeeth Any Beaſt, in Any Milk.
Whence it is, that they not onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
not to eat them together, either
boyled, or otherwiſe; but they alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to eat them, at the ſame Meal; nor
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32812:68"/>
yet will they eat Cheefe within an hour,
after they have eaten Fleſh: becauſe they
conceive, that haply ſome of the Fleſh
may ſtick betwixt their Teeth, and ſo
may chance to mixe together with the
Cheeſe: But if they eat Cheeſe firſt, by
it ſelf, they may afterwards eat Fleſh, if
they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>14. And for this reaſon every one hath
ſeveral Veſſels, for the dreſſing, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in of their Meat; and likewiſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Knives; one for Cheeſe, and another
for Fleſh; which have their different
Marks too, that they may be known by:
as hath been formerly ſaid, <hi>Par. 1. cap.</hi> 3.
And if by Miſtake any one chance to
dreſſe either of Theſe in the Veſſels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the other; or in caſe it ſhould
be put into it while it is Hot, they may
not eat thereof; and the Veſſel, or Diſh, if
it be of Earth, muſt not be uſed any
more.</p>
               <p>15. They eat not any Cheeſe, which
is not of their own Making, or which
they have not ſeen made, and with their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32812:68"/>
Own Rennet too: leſt by chance there
ſhould be mingled together in it, the Milk
of ſome Forbidden Beaſt, or that ſome of
the Skin had been mixed together with
the Rennet; and ſo there would be both
Fleſh, and Cheeſe, in one: or elſe leſt it
might have been boiled in a Kettle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſome Forbidden thing had formerly
been dreſſed. And That Cheeſe, which
they have ſeen the Making of, they ſet a
Mark upon; that ſo they may know it
again.</p>
               <p>16. The <hi>Rabbines</hi> have delivered alſo
in their Traditions, that it is not Lawfull
to eat Fiſh, and Fleſh, together; becauſe
it is not unwholeſome ſo to do: but,
now, there are very few that obſerve
this.</p>

ſayeth the Benediction before ſet down,

Waſh their Hands, and take up their

of the Scripture made
mention of, and commanded to be kept,
even from the very Creation of the
World: as namely in <hi>Gen. cap.</hi> 2. and
Twice, in the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> beſides very
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32812:72"/>
many other places; where the doing of
any manner of Work is forbidden, and a
Reſt upon that day enjoyned to All.</p>
               <p>2. The ſeveral Works, forbidden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that day, are reduced by the <hi>Rabbines</hi>
to Thirtie Nine Heads; under which are
comprehended all kinds of Work what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
And the Heads are theſe; to
Plough, to Sow, to Mow, to bind up in
Sheaves, to Threſh the Corn, to Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
it, to Try it, to Grind it, to ſift the
Meal, to Knead dough, to Boile, to Lop
or Shread, to Whiten any thing, to
Card, to Spain, to Wind in Scaines, to
Warp, to Weave, to Die, to Tie, to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to Sewe, to Tear aſunder, to Build, to
Break down, to Uſe a Hammer, to Chaſe
any Beaſt, to Kill it, to Flea it, to Dreſſe
it, to Fetch off the Hair of the Skin of it,
to Cut it out into Joynts, to Write, to
Cancel, to Rule Paper, or the like, to
Kindle a Fire, to Quench it, and to Carry
any thing from a Private place to a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
Theſe are the General Heads, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which are compriſed all the particular
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32812:73"/>
Kinds, that are Reducible to theſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals:
as for Example; To Uſe a File up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any thing, is comprehended under the
Title of Grinding of Corn: becauſe that,
in Both theſe, One Body is reduced into
Many. So likewiſe to make any thing to
Coagulate, or to gather into a Curd, is
compriſed under the. Title of Building:
becauſe that in both theſe, One Body is
made up of Many: and ſo in all the reſt.
And all theſe things, that are herein to be
obſerved, are with very great Subtiltie,
and Punctualitie delivered by the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines;</hi>
who have declared at large, how,
and in what manner theſe Particulars are
to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>3. They may not either Kindle, or Put
out a Fire: according to that which is
commanded, <hi>Exod. cap. 35. ver. 3. Non
ſuccendetis ignem in omnibus habitaculis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,
die Sabbati: Ye ſhall kindle no Fire
throughout your habitations, upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day:</hi> and therefore neither do they
meddle with any Fire, nor touch any
Wood that is on fire, nor Kindle any, nor
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32812:73"/>
put it out; nor do they ſo much as Light
a Candle upon the Sabbath day. And
if the place be Cold, where they dwell,
except they have any Stowes, or Hot-houſes;
or elſe, have ſome one that is no
Jew, to kindle a Fire for them; or, had ſo
ordered the matter aforehand, that the
Fire ſhould kindle of it ſelf at ſuch a time;
they muſt even be content to ſit in the
cold all that day.</p>
               <p>4. And therefore they Dreſſe not any
Meat upon the Sabbath day themſelves,
neither do they cauſe any others to do it
for them: neither may they eat any thing
that is either Dreſſed, brought forth into
the World, or any Fruit gathered in, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that day.</p>
               <p>5. They may not carry any Burthen
upon that day; and therefore no man is
to have upon his back anything, that is
not of his Neceſſarie Apparel, and tied
on: for otherwiſe, they ſay, it is to be
accounted as a Burthen, or Load. And the
ſame is obſerved by the Women, in their
Dreſſings, and in that of their Children,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32812:74"/>
and Servants; and even of their Beaſts
alſo: ſeeing it is ſo commanded, <hi>Exod.
cap.</hi> 20. and likewiſe <hi>Deuter. cap. 5. ver.</hi> 14.
<hi>Non facies in eiquicquam operis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In it
thou ſhalt not do any work, Thou, nor thy Son,
nor thy Daughter, nor thy Man-ſervant, nor
nor thy Maid ſervant, thine Oxe, nor thine
Aſſe, nor any of thy Cattel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. It is not lawfull to treat upon any
Publick Affairs, or to make any Bargain,
or to make any Order, touching Buying,
Selling, Giving, or Taking into Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
as it is written, <hi>Iſaiah, cap. 58. ver.</hi> 13.
<hi>Si averteris a Sabbato,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thou turn away
thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy
pleaſure on my Holy day, and call the Sabbath
a delight, the Holy of the Lord, Honourable;
and ſhall honour Him, not doing Thine Own
ways, nor finding thine Own pleaſure, nor
ſpeaking thine Own words,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>7. They may not touch, or handle, any
thing of Weight, or burthen, nor any
Tool, or Inſtrument, of any Act, or
Work, that may not be done upon the
Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:32812:74"/>
8. They may not walk above a mile
from the Citie, or place where they dwel,
that is to ſay, Two Thouſand Yards.</p>
               <p>9. There are beſides theſe things, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Particulars, Forbidden by the
<hi>Rabbines,</hi> for the more certain avoiding of
all manner of Buſineſſe, or Work of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts
to be done that day: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
The handling of any Money, which
is the Cauſe, and Occaſion of all manner
of Trading: as likewiſe Riding on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
Going by Water, Playing upon
any Muſical Inſtrument, or Bathing.</p>
               <p>10. In caſe of any Perſons being Ill
or Diſeaſed; if the Grief require onely
the Chirurgeons hand, there are many,
and ſevere Reſtraints laid upon them by
the <hi>Rabbines.</hi> But if the Phyſicians help
be neceſſarie, if he eſteem it a ſickneſſe of
any danger, although it be not great, and
ſo likewiſe in Caſe of any Woman being
newly brought to bed, the Phyſician hath
Libertie to do any thing.</p>
               <p>11. On Friday then, every one provides
himſelf of whatſoever he ſhall need the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32812:75"/>
day following: as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
did of old, in gathering their <hi>Manna:</hi>
as it is written, <hi>Exod. cap. 16. ver. 5. Die au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
ſexto, parent, quod inferant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And
it ſhall come to paſſe, that on the ſixt day they
ſhall prepare that which they bring in; and
it ſhall be twice as much as they gather daily.</hi>
And they account it a Good Work, to
ſpend Liberallie that day, in honour of
the Feaſt: as it is written in <hi>Iſaiah, cap.</hi> 58.
<hi>ver. 13. Et glorificaveris eum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſhalt
honour Him,</hi> &amp;c. and they willinglie em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themſelves, even in the Meaneſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
that are any whit tending to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>12. They do not begin any kind of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
or work, upon the Friday, unleſſe
they are very well able to finiſh it fully,
ſome while before the Evening comes
on: and when it is now within an hour
of Sun-ſet, they ſet their Meat on the
Fire in the beſt manner they can, that ſo
it may be readie to eat, againſt the next
day: and having done this, they make an
end of working any more, till the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32812:75"/>
be over. In many Cities there is one
that is appointed to go about, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Approaching of the Sabbath,
about ſome half an hour before the time
that it is to begin: that ſo they may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch,
and quit their hands of all manner
of buſineſſe whatſoever, before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Feaſt.</p>
               <p>13. When the 23. hour then of Friday
is now come, about half an hour before
Sun-ſet, the Feaſt is underſtood to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
and then alſo the Forbearing from
all Works that are Forbidden, begins to
take place. And now the Women are
bound to ſet up a Lamp in the houſe
lighted, which uſed to carry Four, or Six
Lights at leaſt: and this Lamp burneth
the greateſt part of the Night. They alſo
ſpread the Table with a Clean Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,
and ſet bread upon it; and over the
Bread, they ſpread a long narrow Towel,
which covers it all over: and this is done,
ſay They, in Memorie of the Manna in
the Wilderneſſe, which in like manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
upon the Earth, being covered
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32812:76"/>
beneath, and having a Dew on the top of
it; and on the Sabbath, it fell not at all.</p>
               <p>14. There are many that ſhift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at that time, putting on clean ſhirts,
and waſhing their Hands and Face; and
ſo go to the School, where they ſay the
92. <hi>Pſalm: Bonum eſt confiteri Domino,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>It is a good thing to give thanks unto
the Lord, and to ſing praiſes unto thy name, O
Thou moſt High,</hi> &amp;c. together with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
Prayers; withall, naming the
Sabbath in their Prayers: and rehearſing
thoſe Verſes of <hi>Geneſis, cap. 2. Igitur perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti
ſunt Coeli, &amp; Terra,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the
Hoſt of them. And on the ſeventh day God
ended his Work, which he had made, &amp;c. And
God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>15. Then do they return, each man to
his home; and if they ſalute any one that
night, they do dot ſay unto him, <hi>Good
Even;</hi> Nor the next day, <hi>Good Morrow;</hi>
but alwaies their ſalutation is, <hi>A good Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
to you:</hi> and ſo the Fathers bleſſe their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32812:76"/>
Children, and the Maſters their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
and ſome uſe to ſay certain Verſes,
in Praiſe of the Sabbath, either before, or
after Meat, according as the Cuſtome of
the place is.</p>
               <p>16. When they are ſet down to Meat,
the Maſter of the Familie takes a Bowl of
wine in his hand, and ſaying the afore-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Verſes of <hi>Gen. cap. 2. Igitur perfecti
ſunt Coeli, &amp; terra,</hi> &amp;c. he giveth thanks
to God, who hath given them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of keeping the Sabbath: and
ſo he bleſſeth the Wine, and drinketh of
it; and afterwards gives a little of it to
each perſon at the Table with him. Then
doth he rehearſe the 23. <hi>Pſalm: Dominus
regit me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd,
therefore can I lack nothing,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo
bleſſeth the Bread, and giveth of it to all:
and after this they eat, every one as much
as ſufficeth him: as they likewiſe do, each
Meal the day following. When they
have done, then do they waſh their
hands; and ſo perform all thoſe other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,

               <p>17. The next Morning they riſe later,
then they uſuallie do on the Week daies,
and go to the School; where, after the
ſinging of many <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the Accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Prayers, together with certain <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory
Prayers,</hi> in honour of the Sabbath,
they take out the Book of the <hi>Law,</hi> before
ſpoken of, and read the Leſſons, or Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, appointed for that day; and this is
done by ſeven perſons: after this, they
read ſome place or other, out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
which they find to be moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Ordinarie Leſſon for the day:
and this is called <gap reason="foreign">

is read by ſome Child, for the moſt part,
to exerciſe him in Reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>18. After this, they take the ſaid Book,
and holding it up on high, that it may be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32812:77"/>
ſeen by all, they bleſſe all the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
               <p>19. Then is there a ſolemn Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſaid, for the Prince of that State, under
which they live; wherein they pray to
God, that he would preſerve Him in
Peace, and Quietneſſe, and that he would
proſper Him, and make Him Great, and
Powerful, and that he would alſo make
Him Favourable and Kind to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
obſerving to do thus, from that

of the City, whither I have cauſed you to be

                  </gap>, <hi>Muſaph, Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,

               <p>20. They have their Sermons alſo, or
Preaching; which is performed, either in
the the Morning, or in the Afternoon, in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32812:78"/>
the School, or ſome other place deſigned
for that purpoſe: wherein they treat of
Good Manners, and reprove Vices, fitting
their Diſcourſe to the Ordinarie Leſſon
for the day, that was taken out of the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi>
and citing many Sentences out of
the <hi>Rabbines:</hi> as hath been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>Par. 2. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>21. In the Evening they repair to the
School again; where, after the Ordinarie
Prayers are ſaid, there is added a Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of the Sabbath; and the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Leſſon for the Week follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is read, out of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> by three
perſons.</p>
               <p>22. They uſe to make three Meals, that
is to ſay, they ſit down to meat three
times, during the time that the Sabbath
laſteth: namely once, on Friday night,
and twice the day following: doing this,
in Honour of the Feaſt. And the Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
continues laid all the day long.</p>
               <p>23. In the Evening, when the time is
come that they can now ſee three ſtars of
the middle Magnitude, they account the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:32812:78"/>
Sabbath to be at an end; and it is now
lawfull to do any manner of work, ſo
ſoon as ever the Evening Prayer is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
to which they make the leſſe haſte,
that they may not ſeem to Anticipate, or
end the Sabbath before the due time.</p>
               <p>24. They adde, to the Ordinarie Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Prayers, a certain Commemoration,
or Acknowledgment of the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a day diſtinguiſhed, and ſet apart,
from the <hi>Week-daies:</hi> ſaying alſo the 91.
<hi>Pſalm. Qui habitat in Adjutorio Altiſſimi,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>He that dwelleth in the ſecret place of
the most High, ſhall abide under the ſhadow
of the Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. and many other
Verſes out of the Scripture, treating of
Bleſſings, and Proſperitie, and the like.</p>
               <p>25. Then returning, each man to his
own home, they light a Torch, or Lamp,
with two wicks in it at leaſt; and taking a
Bowl of Wine in one hand, and ſweet
ſpices in the other, they ſay certain verſes
out of the Prophets, touching Proſperitie
and Bleſſings; and alſo out of the 116.
<hi>Pſalm. Calicem ſalutis accipiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32812:79"/>
take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the
name of the Lord:</hi> and likewiſe out of
<hi>Eſther, cap. 8. ver, 16. Judaeis autem nova
lux,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Jewes had Light, and gladneſs,
and joy and honour:</hi> and the like; praying
withall, that the week following may be
proſperous unto them. After this they
bleſſe the wine, and the ſweet ſpices,
withall ſmelling to them, that ſo they
may ſeem to begin the week with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and pleaſure: then do they alſo
bleſſe the Light of the Fire, which as yet
hath not been made any uſe of; withall
looking upon their own heads, becauſe
now they may fall to their work again.
And all theſe things are, with them, of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
myſterious ſignification. Now the
meaning of all this is, to ſignifie, that the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> is now ended, and that that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of time divides it from the <hi>Working<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies:</hi>
and having ſo ſaid, it is quite finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Now all this Ceremonie is, for the
ſame Reaſon, called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Habdalah;</hi>
which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Diſtinction:</hi>
which being now ended, they caſt a little
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:32812:79"/>
of the wine upon the ground, in token of
joy, and gladneſſe; and ſome uſe to ſing
certain ſongs, and verſes, Ominating Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie,
and good Fortune the week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
And from henceforth it is lawfull
for them to do any work.</p>
               <p>26. When they ſalute one another that
night, they do not ſay, <hi>God give you a
good Night;</hi> but, <hi>God ſend you a good
week.</hi>

uſed to ſend forth two, out of the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi>
that is to ſay, the Judges of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
to be Witneſſes of the New Moon's

<hi>Judges;</hi> who immediatly appointed, and
publiſhed that day to be, <hi>Caput Menſis,</hi> the
<hi>Head,</hi> or <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Moneth: and in
this manner did they Order the buſineſſe,
for the finding out the Times, that all
their Feaſtivals were to be kept at. But
now ſince the deſtruction of the Temple,
it is done by Computation; and there is
Yearly a Kalendar, or Monethly Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack
made, and Printed, by which they
may find out the Age of the Moon, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the time of its Change, and the
four Quarters, with all the Feaſtival daies
throughout the Yeer, and all other the
like things. And they Now ſet down in

certain <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> from the 113. unto the

ſay a Laudatorie Prayer to God, who
hath created the Planers, and that renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

was in Uſe, before they had any Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

               <p>2. The two Firſt daies, and the two
Laſt, are Solemn Feaſtivals; inſomuch,
that, upon theſe daies, it is Unlawfull to
do any manner of Work, or Buſineſſe; in
like manner, as it is on the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are permitted to kindle Fires, and
to Dreſſe Meat; and likewiſe to carry any

for the Four middlemoſt daies, they are
onely in them forbidden to Labour; but
they may handle money: and there are
onely ſome few other things, wherein
they are different from the reſt.</p>
               <p>3. In all the time of theſe Eight daies,
they may not either eat, or have in their

               <p>4. And therefore they begin, before

they return home to their houſes, and ſit
down to Meat, the Table having been

               <p>IT was once a Great Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> at what time of
the Year the World was created:
ſome of them ſaid, it was in the Moneth
<hi>Niſan,</hi> or <hi>March;</hi> that is to ſay, in the
<hi>Spring:</hi> Others again maintained, that
it was rather in the Moneth <hi>Tiſri,</hi> or <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;</hi>
becauſe <hi>Autumn</hi> then begins. And
this Opinion prevailed, ſo that it was
thenceforth concluded, that the World
began in the <hi>Autumn,</hi> on the moneth
<hi>Tiſri:</hi> which Moneth they alſo ordained
to be accounted the Beginning of the
Year. So that notwithſtanding that we
find in the Holy Scripture, that they were
commanded by God, to account <hi>Niſan,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:32812:89"/>
the Firſt moneth of the Year: as appears

of reckoning <hi>Niſan</hi> the Firſt, they
would end with <hi>Adar,</hi> which would be
the Twelfth, and Laſt Moneth of the

or <hi>Birth-day</hi> of the World, He at
this time Examined, and conſidered more
ſtrictly, of all the Accidents that had
come to paſſe: Therefore do they begin,
on the firſt day of <hi>Elul,</hi> which is the
moneth immediately going before, to
think of Acts of <hi>Penance;</hi> and, in ſome
places, they riſe before day, and ſay Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
make Confeſſion of their Sins, and
rehearſe the <hi>Penitentiall Pſalms.</hi> And
there are many among them, that Indict

<hi>Be thou written into a Good year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

uſe, at this Feaſt, to have alwaies upon the
Table, Honey, Leaven, and diverſe other
things to ſignifie Increaſing, and growth,
and to ominate a ſweet, and a happie yeer
to follow; and many the like Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
do they uſe, all to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>6. The morning of the firſt of theſe
Two daies, they go to the School, and
many of them apparel themſelves all in
white, in token of Cleanneſſe, and as a
ſign of Penitence: and many alſo, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the <hi>Dutch Jewes,</hi> apparel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the ſame habit now, that they
have provided for their Funerals, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be buried in: and they do this, in
ſign of the Greater Contrition. When
they are met together in the School, they
ſay a greater number of Prayers, then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
they uſe to do; praying that the
ſucceeding Yeer may be proſperous unto
them, and begging pardon of all their
ſins. Then is the Book of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi>
taken out, and the Leſſon for the Day is
read by five perſons: then the Sacrifice
that was wont to be performed on that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:32812:91"/>
day, deſcribed, <hi>Num. cap.</hi> 28. after this, the
<hi>Haphtarah</hi> out of the <hi>Prophets</hi> is read, and
ſo they ſay a Benediction for the Prince.</p>
               <p>7. After this, they blow a horn, which
is to be a <hi>Goats</hi> Horn, giving with it <hi>Thirty
Blaſts</hi> in all; of which, ſome are to be
held out in length, and others to be ſhort
Broken ones. This they obſerve, from

alſo, <hi>Num. cap. 29. ver. 1. And in
the ſeventh Moneth on the First day of the
Moneth, ye ſhall have an holy Convocation,
ye ſhall do no ſervil work; it is a day of
Blowing the Trumpets unto you.</hi> And this is
done, They ſay, to ſtrike a Terrour into
themſelves, and to put themſelves in mind
of the Judgment of God, and to induce
them to repent them of their ſins. After
this, they ſay the <hi>Muſaph,</hi> or <hi>Additionall
Prayer:</hi> and many other things they add,
which are proper to the day, and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
in hand: and then, laſtly, they
ſound the Horn again, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as before. Then returning home
each man to his houſe, they ſit down to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:32812:91"/>
meat; and ſo ſpend the reſt of the day in
hearing Sermons, and other Religious
Exerciſes: And all theſe things are in the

following. And upon the ſecond day, in

one <hi>Monday,</hi> one <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and
another <hi>Monday</hi> again: and the reaſon
they give, for ſo doing, is, becauſe the
Precedent Feaſt being Eight daies long,
they might haply have committed ſome
ſin or other, during that ſpace of time.
And ſo they likewiſe Faſt, the <hi>Eve</hi> before

               <p>13. And if any man have a mind, out
of particular Devotion, or Penance, to
Indict himſelf a <hi>Faſt,</hi> beſides all theſe; he
then, on the Evening before the day he
intends to Faſt, before the going down of

for the lighting of the Lamps that were
to be ſet up of Courſe in the Temple, they
at laſt found by chance a ſmal Veſſel ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, wherein was Oyl hid, but onely as
much as was ſufficient for Lights one
Night onely; which Oyl notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miraculouſly laſted for Eight whole
Nights: and therefore, for this reaſon, it
was decreed, that the ſaid Feaſt of <hi>Lights,</hi>
ſhould ever afterward be obſerved. They
have a Tradition alſo, that in Ordaining
this Feaſt to be kept, they had an Eye alſo
upon that famous Exploit, performed by
<hi>Judith,</hi> upon <hi>Holofernes:</hi> although many
are of opinion, that this happened not at
this time of the Year; and that they make
a Commemoration of that piece of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantrie

the ſtock of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. During the time of theſe eight daies,
it is lawfull for them to do any manner
Buſineſſe, or Work: neither is there any
kind of ſolemnitie obſerved at this time,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:32812:101"/>
ſave onely of the ſaid <hi>Lights;</hi> and that, at
their Prayers, there is added a <hi>Panegyrick,</hi>
or Laudatorie Oration, in memorie of
that Great Victorie obtained by Them
againſt the Heathen; and beſides, every
morning they ſay the ſix <hi>Pſalms,</hi> called
<hi>Hallel,</hi> beginning at the 113. <hi>Pſalm:</hi> and
likewiſe the 30. <hi>Pſal. Exaltabo te Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>I will extol thee O Lord, for thou
hast lifted me up, and haſt not made my foes

ſome certain Ceremonies, more then Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie,

Extirpation, by the Machination, and
ſubtle Devices of <hi>Haman,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
hanged together with his ten Sons.
This feaſt is called the feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> or
Lots, for the reaſon ſet down, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. of the

               <p>2. This Feaſt continueth two daies,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:32812:102"/>
although they keep the firſt onely, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly;

that they are not forbidden to do any

they voluntarily forbear, upon the firſt
of the two daies, and make it a ſolemn
Feaſtival.</p>
               <p>3. Upon the firſt Evening they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to the School, where ſaying the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie

of the great deliverance at

the whole ſtorie of their <hi>Eſcape,</hi> that is to
ſay, the whole book of <hi>Eſther;</hi> which
they have in their Schools, fairly written
in Parchmet, in a long Roll, as the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch</hi>

make a great murmuring noiſe, in token
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32812:103"/>
of Curſing him, and execrating his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie:
and they do the like at their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

and fought with Iſrael in Rephidim,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. On this day they give much Alms
to the Poor, publickly: and they likewiſe
ſend Diſhes of Meat one to another, every
friend, and kinſman, to each other, and
Scholars ſend Preſents to their Maſters,
or Tutors, and Maſters give to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
and generally, all Superiours to
their Inferiours. And they uſe all expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

commanded, <hi>Eſth. cap. 9. Eſſéntque dies

one makes as great a Feaſt, as he is able;
eating, and drinking more freely, then at

on viſiting one another, entertaining their
friends with Banquets, Paſtimes, and all

of mirth.</p>
               <p>6. They do not make ſo great Chear,

               <p>Every Jew is bound by the Law to
Marry: and the moſt Convenient
time to do this, is determined by
the <hi>Rabbines</hi> to be, at Eighteen Years of
Age: But they muſt by no means live
Unmarried, after Twentie: and what
man ſoever is not Married, after he is of
This Age, he is accounted as One that
lives in Sin. The reaſons of this are:
Firſt, becauſe all men are bound to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the Procreation of Children; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as God Commanded <hi>Adam, Gen.
cap. 1. ver. 28. Creſcite &amp; Multiplicamini,
et replete terram,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And God ſaid unto
them, Be fruitful, and Multiply, &amp; repleniſh
the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. and they conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not to have fulfilled this Precept
here given, till they have begotten One
Son, and One Daughter, at leaſt. And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:32812:106"/>
beſides, they ſay, they are bound to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that by having Wives of their own,
they may by this means the eaſier avoid
all Occaſions of falling into the ſins of
Adulterie, or Fornication; which, if they
ſhould live Unmarried, they would be apt
to fall into.</p>
               <p>2. They may marrie as many Wives,
as they pleaſe, as we find practiſed by the
Ancient <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> Examples whereof,
we frequently meet withall in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
and this Cuſtome is in Uſe ſtill,
among the <hi>Levantines,</hi> or Eaſtern Jewes:
But the Having of Many Wives is not at
all, either permitted, or practiſed, among
the <hi>Dutch:</hi> and among the <hi>Italians</hi> alſo it
is very Rare; and ſeldome, or never uſed;
ſave onely, in caſe that a man hath lived
many Years with his Wife, and hath not
been able to have any Children by Her.</p>
               <p>3. A man may marrie his <hi>Niece;</hi> that
is to ſay, the Daughter of his Brother, or
Siſter: and yet a man may not Marry his
Aunt, to whom he is Nephew. In like
manner may <hi>Couſen-Germans</hi> marrie; that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:32812:106"/>
is to ſay, Brothers and Siſter's Children,
both by Father and Mother. All the
Other Degrees of Alliances, ſpecified <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.
cap.</hi> 20. are Prohibited, from marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with each other.</p>
               <p>4. There are many among them, that
will not Marrie a Woman, that hath had
Two, or More Husbands before; calling
Her, a <hi>Husband-killer:</hi> but however, This
is not any where Forbidden. And the
like is to be underſtood of a man, that hath
had more then Two Wives.</p>
               <p>5. A Widow, or a Woman, that hath
been put away by a Former Husband,
cannot marrie, within the ſpace of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
daies, after the Death of her Husband,
or of her Divorce: to the end, that it may
be known, whether or no ſhe be with
Child by her Former Husband; and,
that there may not be any Controverſie,
whoſe the Child is.</p>
               <p>6. If a man die, and leave behind him
a Young Child, ſucking at the Mothers

               <head type="sub">Of their Contracts, and Manner

               <p>THe Manner of their making of
<hi>Contracts,</hi> or <hi>Eſpouſalls,</hi> is thus:
There is a Writing drawn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Man, and the Kindred of the

the Woman by the Hand, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
Her for his Spouſe: and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is done, as to the Matter of <hi>Contract.</hi> In
ſome places they uſe, at this time, to put
a Ring upon her finger, and ſo betroath
her: but in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> they do
not uſe this Ceremony, for the moſt part,
when they are Contracted onely. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
they continue thus, Promiſed;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:32812:107"/>
ſome, a Year; others, Two, Four, Sixe
Moneths; more, or leſſe, as they pleaſe
themſelves, and according as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it to be moſt Convenient for them:
during which time, the Man hath libertie
to viſit, and to ſport and toy with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed
Miſtreſſe; but he muſt not know
her Carnally.</p>
               <p>2. When the time of their Marriage
approacheth, and the Day is now ſet,
(which uſeth to be in the Increaſe of the
Moon; and for Virgins, on Wedneſday,
or Friday; and for Widowes, on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:)
if the Bride hath paſſed the time
of her Monethly Courſes, ſhe then goeth
to a Bath, and waſheth her ſelf: as we ſhall
ſhew more fully hereafter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
ſhe may not lie with her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
although the Marriage may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be ſolemnized betwixt them; till
ſuch time as ſhe ſhall be in caſe to go, and
waſh her ſelf.</p>
               <p>3. It is a Cuſtome with many, that the
Bridegroom and his Bride ſhould both
faſt, upon their Wedding day, till ſuch
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:32812:108"/>
time as the Ceremonie of the <hi>Benediction</hi>
is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>4. Upon the Marriage day, the Parties
to be married are brought into ſome large
Hall, or Chamber; and there placing
themſelves under a kind of Canopie, they
have Muſick brought before them: &amp; in
ſome places they have little Boyes, with
lighted Torches in their hands, that ſing
before them. When the people are now
gathered together in the place where the
Wedding is to be celebrated, there is one
of the afore-mentioned Square Veſtments,
called <hi>Taleth,</hi> with the <hi>Pendants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, put over the head of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
and the Bride together. Then
doth the <hi>Rabbine</hi> of the place, or the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi>
or Chaunter of the School, or elſe
ſome one that is the neareſt of their kin,
take a Bowl of Wine in his hand, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Benediction</hi> to God, <hi>Who hath created
the Man, and the Woman, and hath ordained
Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. he giveth the Bridegroom,
and the Bride, of this Wine to drink. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, the Bridegroom putteth a Ring
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:32812:108"/>
upon her finger, in the preſence of Two
Witneſſes, which commonly uſe to be
the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> ſaying withall unto her: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
Thou art my Eſpouſed Wife, according
to the Cuſtome of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and of</hi> Iſrael. Then
is the <hi>Writing</hi> of her Dowrie produced,
and read; wherein the Bridegroom is
bound, in lieu of her Dowrie by Him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
both to feed, cloath, and cheriſh
her, &amp;c. and he binds himſelf to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all theſe things. After this,
they take another Bowl of wine, and ſing
ſix other <hi>Benedictions,</hi> making up the
number of Seven in all: and then do they
give of this Wine alſo to the New mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
couple to drink: and having ſo done,
they pour out the reſt of the Wine upon
the Ground, in token of Joy, and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and the emptie Veſſel being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into the Bridegrooms hand, He
takes and daſheth it with all his might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Ground, and ſo breaks it all to
pieces: ſignifying hereby, that in the
midſt of all their mirth, and jollitie, they
are to remember Death, that deſtroies,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32812:109"/>
and breakes us in pieces, like Glaſſe: that
ſo we grow not proud. And when this
done, then doth all the people with a loud
voice crie out, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Mazal tob,</hi> which
is as much as to ſay, <hi>Good fortune to them.</hi>
And ſo they all depart.</p>
               <p>5. In the Evening they make a Feaſt,
and invite their kindred, and friends: and
the Cuſtome in ſome places is, that after
ſupper is ended, the Gueſts preſent the
Bride with ſeveral Gifts, ſome with Gold,
others with Silver, &amp;c. and ſome do this
before Supper. Afterward they again
ſing over the ſeven <hi>Benedictions,</hi> before
ſpoken of, at the Solemnitie of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
having firſt ſaid the Ordinarie <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction,</hi>
uſed after meat: and ſo they riſe
from Table.</p>
               <p>6. After this, if the Bride hath found
her Monethly Courſes to be over, and
hath waſhed her ſelf, (as we have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before) if they go to Bed together: and
if ſhe were a Virgin before, ſo ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he hath made her a Woman, he riſeth
from her, and may not touch her any
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:32812:109"/>
more, till ſuch time as ſhe hath fulfilled
the time required in married women for
their continuing Clean, and hath waſhed
her ſelf again in a Bath: as ſhall be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>7. The Sabbath following, at Morning
Prayers, the Bridegroom goeth to the
School, as his Bride alſo doth, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with other women. And when the
book of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is now taken forth,
the New-Married man is invited up to
read in it: who preſently maketh a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of giving Great Alms to the Poor;
as likewiſe do all the Invited Perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him in Order. And when Prayers are
ended, the men accompanie the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
and the women the Bride, home
to their houſe: where after Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
paſſed betwixt them, they take
their leave, and depart.</p>
               <p>In ſome places they have a Cuſtome,
that the Bridegroom is to keep within
doors, ſeven daies after the <hi>Eſpouſals,</hi> or
<hi>Contract,</hi> made betwixt both parties: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time he is viſited by his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:32812:110"/>
friends and acquaintance; among whom
he entertaineth the Time with Paſtimes,
and pleaſing Recreations.</p>
               <p>8. And this is the moſt uſuall manner
of their making Contracts of Marriage,
and celebrating of <hi>Nuptials</hi> among them:
although the Cuſtomes of the ſeverall

after the Marriage, without having

Parties: which are very different, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that her <hi>Monethly Courſes</hi> are
now upon her, ſhe is bound
to give notice of it to her Husband: who
immediately ſeparateth himſelf from

may he deliver any thing into her
hand, nor receive any thing from her, nor
ſit near her, nor eat with her in the ſame
diſh, nor drink with her in the ſame cup.</p>
               <p>2. And thus ſhe continueth, during the
time that her Courſes are upon her;
which laſteth, in moſt women, for the
ſpace of five daies: but in caſe this Flux
ſhould continue upon Her longer, ſhe
muſt expect, till it ſtops. At which time,
ſhe changeth her ſmock, and the ſheets of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:32812:112"/>
the bed; and thus continuing clean, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
other daies, ſhe cutteth her Nails, and
cleanſeth them throughly, and waſheth
her ſelf in a Bathing Tub, and alſo comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her Head. After this ſhe goeth to a
Bath, made for the ſame purpoſe; which
is to be, either of Springing Water, or of
Rain-water, (but it muſt not, by any
means, have been brought thither by
Man's hand:) and the water muſt be at
leaſt Three Yards deep, and one Yard
over; for otherwiſe, the waſhing in it,
would be Inſufficient, and of no force.
But in thoſe places, where they have not
any ſuch Bathes, made for the Purpoſe,
they in this caſe go, either to ſome River,
Well, Sea, or Pond: and there muſt they
duck themſelves in, all over head and
ears, ſtark naked; ſo that, there may not
the leaſt part of their bodie ſcape being
waſhed by the water. In ſo much that, if
they ſhould chance to have a Ring upon
any of their Fingers, that ſate cloſe to
their Fleſh, ſo that the water could not
perhaps get under it, their waſhing is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:32812:112"/>
to no purpoſe; and they muſt even
return, and bath again. And while ſhe is at
her work, ſhe muſt have another woman
to ſtand by her; who is to ſee, that ſhe be
wholly covered over with water: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus done, ſhe putteth on her cloaths
again; and ſo returning home, ſhe may
lie with her Husband again, till ſuch time
as her <hi>Courſes</hi> return again upon her: at

               <head type="sub">Of the Manner of Putting away their
Wives, and of Jealouſie.</head>
               <p>IN Ancient times, when a Husband
was <hi>Jealous</hi> of his wife, he brought
her to the Prieſt; who, giving her a
certain water to drink, if ſhe were Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
it did her no harm; but if ſhe was
Guiltie of the Offence ſhe was ſuſpected
for, ſhe then preſently had a ſwelling in
her bellie, and her fleſh rotted; as we find
it written, <hi>Num. cap.</hi> 5. But now, if a Man
have forbidden his wife, and charged her,
ſaying; <hi>Let me not ſee Thee any more in ſuch
a Man's Company:</hi> if He afterwards find,
that ſhe ſtill keepes the ſaid perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:32812:113"/>
or if there be a publick Fame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that ſhe is diſhoneſt; or if there be
any ſufficient Arguments, to prove that
ſhe is naught; and eſpecially if ſhe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the act; the <hi>Rabbines</hi> have power to
force him, whether he will or no, to put
her away, and never more to have to do
with her: the manner of which <hi>Divorſe,</hi>
or putting away a Man's wife, is hereafter
ſet down. And a woman that is thus <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiated,</hi>
or put away, hath libertie after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to marry with any other man
whatſoever, ſave onely with him, for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion,
or certain knowledge of too
much Familiarity with whom ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been put away by her husband.</p>
               <p>2. A man hath power, according to
the ſtrict Letter of the Law, to put away
his wife, not in caſe of Adulterie onely,
but for any other diſlike that he hath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
her: as it is ſaid, <hi>Deuter cap. 24. ver.</hi>
1. <hi>Si acceperit uxorem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When a Man
hath taken a Wife, and married her, and it
come to paſſe that ſhe find no favour in his
Eyes, becauſe he hath found ſome Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:32812:114"/>
in her; then let him write her a Bill of
Divorcement, and give it in her hand, and
ſend her out of his houſe.</hi> Howbeit a Man
ſhould not take hold of the bare Letter of
the Law, ſo as to put away his wife, upon
any ſlight Diſlike, but onely in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
caſe of Jealouſie; or elſe, for
ſome other notorious wickedneſſe, that
he hath found in her. And to the end
that this buſineſſe of Divorce, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away of a Man's wife, may not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be put in practice, upon every light
Occaſion: therefore have the Rabbines
ſo intangled it with difficulties, and
brought in ſo many nice Circumſtances,
to be obſerved both in the Writing, and
the Delivering of this Bill of Divorce to
the woman; that by his means the time
being protracted, the Husband may have
opportunity to repent himſelf of what he
is going about, and ſo may haply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and be reconciled to his wife.</p>
               <p>3. Now the manner of putting away a
mans wife, is this. There is a <hi>Notary</hi> called
in the preſence of one, or more of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:32812:114"/>
chiefeſt <hi>Rabbines:</hi> then doth the Husband
require, that a <hi>Bill of Divorce,</hi> which they
call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Ghet,</hi> be written, for ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
his wife. This Bill of Divorce muſt
be written in Parchment, exactly Ruled,
and in a large ſquare Letter: and it muſt
not conſiſt of either more, or fewer, then
juſt Twelve Lines: and many other <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilios,</hi>
and Nice Circumſtances are there
to be obſerved, both in the Character, and
the manner of writing it; and in the name
and ſurname of the Husband, and of the
Wife. And it is neceſſary alſo, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Notary,</hi> nor the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> nor the
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> be any whit of Kin, either to the
Man, or to the Woman; nor yet among
themſelves: Neither may any one of all
the aforeſaid witneſſes, that were preſent
at the Delivery of this <hi>Bill of Divorce,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
marry, and take to wife the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
thus Repudiated before Them.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The Form of this</hi> Ghet, <hi>or Bill of
Divorce, is Briefly This:</hi> On ſuch a day, of
ſuch a Moneth, Year, and place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſuch
a One, do Voluntarily Repudiate, put away, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:32812:115"/>
ſet free, Thee, ſuch a One, Who waſt former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
My Wife; ſo that Thou mayeſt henceforth
marry Whomſoever Thou pleaſeſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. When this is written, in the Manner
as hath been formerly delivered; then
doth the <hi>Rabbine</hi> ask the Husband very
Formally, whether or no he doth this
Voluntarily, and Freely; and whether
he hath made any Vow, or Oath to do
this: if ſo, He is ready to diſpence with
him, and Abſolve him from it: Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath made any Proteſtation to
her, againſt her Keeping Company with
ſuch a man: and many Other the like Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
Queſtions are put to Him.</p>
               <p>6. There muſt be Ten perſons at leaſt
preſent, at the making of this <hi>Bill:</hi> and
the Names of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to it; and there muſt alſo be Two
other <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the Delivery of it: to
whom the <hi>Rabbine</hi> propoſeth this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>Whether or no, there be any of them
that knoweth any Impediment, why this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
ſhould not go forward: if ſo, they must
now ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:32812:115"/>
7. After this, the <hi>Rabbine</hi> commandeth
the Woman to take her Rings off her
fingers, and to open both her Hands, and
to joyn them together, that ſhe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this <hi>Writing,</hi> and that it fall not to
the Ground: and then asking ſome other
Queſtions of them, the Husband gives
the woman the <hi>Writing</hi> in her hand, and
ſaies; <hi>Take here thy Bill of Divorce; behold
thou art now put away from Me, and haſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to marry any other man.</hi> Then the
woman taking the <hi>Writing</hi> in her hand,
delivers it to the <hi>Rabbine,</hi> who readeth it
over again: which being done, She is
from thenceforth, a Free Woman. There
are many other Ceremonies, and Nice
Circumſtances to be obſerved, which
are purpoſely made ſo Numerous by the
<hi>Rabbines,</hi> to render the buſineſſe of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce</hi>
the more Difficult, and hard to be
exactly performed; as hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched: a more particular Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all which Circumſtances, I have
not here ſet down, that I might not be too
Prolixe, and tedious to the Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:32812:116"/>
8. After this, the <hi>Rabbine</hi> gives the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
notice, that ſhe is not to marrie, for
the ſpace of Ninety daies; for the reaſon
before given, concerning a Woman that
buries her Husband, who may haply have
left her with Child by him. And from
this time forward, it is not Lawfull for
that Man and that VVoman to be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Alone in any place; and either of
them hath thenceforth liberty to marrie
again.</p>

<hi>Chalitzah,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>The Taking off

Chapter of <hi>Deuteron.</hi> where it
is ſaid, that if a man refuſe to take his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Elders. <hi>Accedet mulier ad eum coram ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioribus,

ſpuétque in faciem illius,</hi> &amp;c. The manner
of this Ceremonie, is thus: Three <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi>
and Two other, who are to ſtand as
Witneſſes, are to go the Evening before,
and appoint the place, where this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is to be done: which being agreed
upon, they ſay: <hi>In this place do we intend
to morrow, God willing, to perform the</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litza:
Then do they give notice to the

               <p>5. The next morning, when they come

together to the Place appointed: and
there the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> and the Two <hi>Witneſſes,</hi>
placing themſelves upon their Seats, the
Kinſman comes before them, with his
Right Foot Unſhod, and Waſhed, and
with ſome cloath wrapped about it: and
the Kinſwoman alſo cometh, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a Mantle; and they both ſit
before the <hi>Rabbines.</hi> Then doth the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior

<hi>What buſineſſe have you in this place?</hi> Then
the man anſwereth: <hi>I am come to perform
the</hi> Chalitza; <hi>and to Releaſe this my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.</hi>
Then ſaith he to the VVoman:
<hi>And will you, Miſtris, be releaſed?</hi> She
anſwereth, <hi>Yes, Sir.</hi> Then ſaith the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine</hi>

turning himſelf to the VVitneſſes, he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

and This Man her next Kinſman; and
whether it be Ninety daies, ſince her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
died; and whether he had not any
Children by Her; and many other the
like Queſtions. After this, he tells the
man, that if he will take his Kinſwoman
to wife, he ſhall do very well in it; and
withal, exhorts him ſo to do: which the
man utterly refuſing: He then ſaith unto
him: <hi>Wilt thou Releaſe her then?</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth,
<hi>Yes Sir.</hi> After this he asketh
them both, whether they have either of
them made any Oath, or Proteſtation to
this purpoſe; telling them, if they have
ſo done, that they ought not to keep it,
but ſhould be abſolved from it: but they
deny, that they have done any ſuch thing.
Then do they ſet up a Plank or Board, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the wall, and they take a certain
<hi>Shoe,</hi> which the <hi>Rabbines</hi> uſe to have, made
for the ſame purpoſe, in ſuch a manner,
that it may be made wider, or Straighter,
by certain buttons, and ſtrings, faſtened
to it, as Occaſion ſhall require. This ſhoe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:32812:119"/>
they give to the <hi>Kinſman;</hi> and then doth
the <hi>Rabbine</hi> ask them again, ſaying; <hi>Are
you ſtill of the ſame mind you were?</hi> and they
anſwer him, <hi>Yes. Let us proceed then to the</hi>
Chalitza, ſaith the <hi>Rabbine.</hi> And ſo take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heed that the man put it not on, upon
the Left foot, inſtead of the Right: nor,
that the VVoman uſe the Left Hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the Right, the Man putteth the
ſaid <hi>Shoe</hi> upon his foot: which when it is
well fitted on to his foot, and tied with
the aforeſaid Strings, then doth He walk
Four Paces forward, and ſo returneth to
his place again: where leaning againſt the
aforeſaid Planks, or Board, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being commanded to ſtand before
him face to face, the <hi>Rabbine</hi> repeats thoſe
words out of the above named Chapter
of <hi>Deut. ver. 7. My Husbands Brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
to raiſe up unto his Brother a name in
Iſrael: he will not perform the duty of my

it after him, VVord for word. Then

him, as it followeth, <hi>ver. 8. I like not

to take her.</hi> Then doth the VVoman
ſtoop down, and with her Right Hand
untyeth, and taketh off the ſhoe from off
the man's foot; and lifting it up on high,
ſhe throweth it againſt the Ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the place where the <hi>Rabbines</hi> ſit; who
preſently command her to Spit in his
face: then doth ſhe ſpit upon Him: as it
followeth, <hi>ver. 9. Then ſhall his Brothers
Wife come unto him in the Preſence of the
Elders, and looſe his Shoe from off his foot,
and Spit in his face:</hi> and the <hi>Rabbine</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the words before Her, ſhe goes on,
and ſaith; <hi>So ſhall it be done unto that man,
that will not build up his Brothers houſe. And
his name ſhall be called in Iſrael; The houſe of
him that hath his Shoe looſed:</hi> repeating
theſe laſt words three times; and at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeveral time, all the People with a loud
voyce anſwer, and call Him, <hi>One that hath
had his Shoe looſed.</hi> Then doth the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine</hi>
tell the man that he is at Liberty now
to marry when he pleaſe: and if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
a Certificate from them, of this <hi>ſetting
Free his Kinſwoman,</hi> they preſently give
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:32812:120"/>
him one: and if there be found any
<hi>Writing,</hi> or Contract about her Dowry,
it is preſently torn in pieces. And as the

any, that mark well the place.</p>
               <p>6. And for as much as, when the Caſe
of this <hi>Ibum</hi> happeneth, a Woman cannot
have her Dowry, nor marry again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this <hi>Releaſe,</hi> or being ſet at Liberty;
therefore do many of theſe Kinſmen, hold
them off, and bear them in hand a long
while, that ſo they may vex them, and
get money of them for their <hi>Releaſe.</hi> Many
therefore, when they marry their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a man that hath Brothers, do get
the Brothers to enter into Bond, that if
need require, they will give her a <hi>Releaſe.</hi>
Others there are, that cauſe the Husband

               <p>WHen a Male Child is born
to any one, his friends come

Some of them uſe to ſet up certain Scrols,

this to be a means of defending
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:32812:121"/>
the Child from the Strix, or Night-Witch.
But they that pleaſe, may chuſe
whether they will do this, or not; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grounded upon no Precept at all,
but looks rather like an Act of Vanity and

               <p>2. Upon the Eight day they are bound
to circumciſe the Child, according to the
Command given to <hi>Abraham, Gen. cap.</hi> 17.
<hi>Infans octo dierum circumcidetur in vobis,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>He that is eight daies old ſhall be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed

This may not be done before the Eight

               <p>3. The Night before the Day of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
they call The <hi>Watching-Night:</hi>
becauſe that all the People of the houſe
watch all that Night, to guard the young
Infant: and in the Evening the Friends
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:32812:121"/>
of the Father of the Child go to viſit him;
as the women likewiſe do to the Mother,
and there they ſpend that Evening in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

               <p>4. They are to be provided before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand

Infant in his armes, while it is circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and alſo of a <hi>God-mother,</hi> who is to
carry it from the Houſe to the School,

                  </gap>, <hi>Mohel;</hi> which may be

Expert, skilfull man at the buſineſſe: and
they account it to be the moſt meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing that can be, to be a <hi>Circumciſer.</hi>
And if by chance the Father of the Infant
be one of Theſe, he then circumciſeth his
own Child himſelf.</p>
               <p>5. On the morrow morning there are
Two Seats made ready in the School, or
if they pleaſe, at Home, where they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
uſe to circumciſe them: Theſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:32812:122"/>
Seats are covered with Cuſhions of ſilk;
and are provided, the one for the <hi>God-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

Child to be circumciſed: the other, as
ſome ſay, for the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> whom

very jealous for the Obſervation of the

3. <hi>cap. 19. ver. 14. And he ſaid: I have
been very Jealous for the Lord God of Hoſts,

with a Charger in his hand, wherein

Razor, Reſtringent Powders, with little

Sand, to put the foreskin into, when it is

Hymne, till ſuch time as the <hi>God-mother,</hi>
accompanied with a Train of women,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:32812:122"/>

upon his knees, the <hi>Circumciſer</hi> unſwathes
him; and ſome uſe to have ſilver Pincers,

then doth he cut off that Thicker
skin of the <hi>Prepuce;</hi> and afterwards with
his Thumb Nail he rends in pieces that

giveth Thanks unto Almighty God, for
giving them this Precept of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the people that are preſent forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
preſage unto him, that this will be
much Advantagious to his Marriage: in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:32812:123"/>
the mean time, the <hi>Circumciſer</hi> going on in
his buſineſſe, with his mouth ſucketh the
Blood, which abundantly floweth from
the wound, doing thus two or three
times, and ſo ſpitteth it forth into a Bowl
of wine. Then doth he clap upon the
wound ſome <hi>Sanguis Draconis,</hi> Powder of
Corall, and other Reſtringent things,
wrapping it about with plaiſters of Oyl
of Roſes; and ſo binding it up cloſe, the
Child is ſwathed again.</p>
               <p>7. Then doth he take a Bowl of wine
in his hand, and bleſſing it, he ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Benediction</hi> alſo upon the child, and
ſo giveth him his Name, that the Father
will have him called by; adding withall
thoſe words out of <hi>Ezekiel, cap. 16. ver.</hi> 6.
<hi>Et dixi tibi, cum eſſes in ſanguine tuo, Vive,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy
Blood, Live:</hi> and having ſo ſaid, he taketh
of the wine, into which he had ſpit the
Blood of the Infant, and beſprinkleth the
face of the Child. After this, they ſay
over the whole 128. <hi>Pſalm. Beati omnes
qui timent Dominum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed are all
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:32812:123"/>

&amp;c. which being ended, the <hi>God-father</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
the child again to the <hi>God-mother,</hi> to
carry it home to the Mother: and then
do all the People depart; and taking leave
of the Father of the child, they wiſh that
He may live to ſee his Marriage, as he
hath now ſeen his Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>8. After this, the <hi>Circumciſer</hi> ſendeth a
Preſent of Smeet-meats, or the like, to the
woman that lyeth in; and ſo doth the
<hi>God-father</hi> alſo, and the <hi>God-mother,</hi> and
all their Kindred, and Acquaintance: and
if the Parents of the Child chance to be
Poor People, they then ſend them Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or what elſe they think beſt.</p>
               <p>9. At noon the Father maketh a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or Feaſt, for the <hi>Circumciſer,</hi> and
the <hi>God-father,</hi> and <hi>God-mother,</hi> and the
reſt of his Kindred, and Friends, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the ability of the perſon is: and
when they have dined, there is added to
the <hi>Benediction</hi> a certain Prayer for the
Child, that he may become Great and
Proſperous, and one that feareth God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:32812:124"/>
10. The Child uſeth to have his wound
healed in a ſhort ſpace, and it is never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
24. hours in healing: and therefore
ſome uſe, the third day after the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
to ſend to their Friends, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
ſome Preſent of Sweet-meats, or the
like, in token of joy.</p>
               <p>11. When a Girle is born, there is no
Ceremony uſed at all about her; ſaving
that at the Beginning of the Moneth, when
the Mother of it is now up, and goeth to
the School, the <hi>Cazan,</hi> or Chaunter, ſaith
a Benediction over the child, and putteth
a Name upon it, ſuch as the Father plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.
It is the Cuſtome in <hi>Germany,</hi> that
the <hi>Cazan</hi> goeth home to the Parents
houſe, and lifting up the childs <hi>Cradle</hi> on
high, he Bleſſeth it, and ſo giveth it the
Name. If an Infant chance to die before
the Eight day, and Uncircumciſed, ſome

him, ſaying: <hi>See, here is Gold, and
Silver; take your own price:</hi> then ſaith the

he is taught to render the Bible, in the

all thoſe, that have ever offended, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured

them to his Bed-ſide, and ſo giveth them
his Bleſſing: or if He himſelf have either

and after this, they ſay a certain
Prayer, that begins with thoſe words out
of <hi>Deut. cap. 32. ver. 4. Dei perfecta ſunt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>He is the Rock; his Work is perfect:

ſo, laying a little bag of Earth under his

to the Grave, which uſeth to be, a pit
dug up, according to the length of the

to lay him as near the reſt of his dead kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:32812:138"/>
as may be. In ſome places they have
a Cuſtome, that, as ſoon as the Coffin is
ſet down near the Grave, if it be a man
that is dead, Ten perſons are to go round
about the Coffin ſeven times, ſaying a
certain Prayer for the Soul of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Brother: but this is not uſed in all
places. This being done, the neareſt Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is to rent his cloathes a little; and ſo
letting the coffin down into the Grave,
they cover it with earth, every one of
them caſting a ſhovel-full, or a handful of
earth upon it, till it is wholy cover'd over.</p>
               <p>5. It is a ſin for any of them, either men,
or women, to ſcratch themſelves, or tear
their fleſh, or to pull their hair off, in their
mourning, or lamenting for the Dead, as
well while the Corps is preſent, as after it
is buried: obſerving the Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Deut. cap. 14. ver. 2. Ye ſhall not cut
your ſelves, nor make any baldneſſe between
your eyes, for the Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. As they return from the Grave, every
one of them plucks up graſſe from off the
ground, twice, or thrice, and caſts it over
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:32812:139"/>
his head behind him, ſaying withall thoſe
words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 92. ver. 16. Et
Florebunt de civitate ſicut foenum terrae,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And they of the city ſhall flouriſh like graſſe of
the earth:</hi> and this they do, to ſignifie
their hopes of the Reſurrection of the
Dead. After this, they waſh their hands,
and ſit down, and riſe up from their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
again, nine times, ſaying withall the 91.
<hi>Pſal. Qui habitat in adjutorio Altiſſimi,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>He that dwelleth in the ſecret place of the
most High, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of
the Almighty:</hi> And having done all this,
they return home to their houſes. And
this is the moſt uſuall manner of <hi>Burying
the Dead</hi> in moſt places; although
there may be, here and there, ſome little
diverſity found, as the Cuſtomes of the

doubling up the coverlet alſo, and laying
it all in a heap together, upon the ſame
Bedſtead: and, cloſe by the Beds head,

uſe to ſet up Lights in the School, and

ſhall here in the Laſt place give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:32812:143"/>
a view of the Thirteen Articles of
their <hi>Belief,</hi> as it is delivered by <hi>Rabbi Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Egyptius,</hi> in his Expoſition upon the
<hi>Miſchna, in ſanedrin, cap. Helech:</hi> which
<hi>Articles</hi> are generally believed by All of
them, without any Contradiction. And
they are Theſe.</p>
               <p>I. I believe that there is one God, the
Creator of all things; the Firſt Cauſe of
of all Beings, who can ſubſiſt of himſelf,
without the whole World; but that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can, without Him.</p>
               <p>II. I believe that this God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
is One, Indiviſible, and of a Unity,
different from all other Unities.</p>
               <p>III. I believe that He is Incorporall,
and that no Corporall Quality can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be imagined to be in Him.</p>
               <p>IV. I believe that He was, from all
Eternity; and that all other things, beſides
Him, had a Beginning at ſome time.</p>
               <p>V. I believe that He onely is to be
worſhipped, and ſerved; and that we ought
not to worſhip, or ſerve any other, either
as Mediators, or Interceſſours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:32812:144"/>
VI. I believe that there have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been, and may yet be Men, ſo diſpoſed,
as to be fit to receive Divine Influence;
ſuch as the <hi>Prophets</hi> were.</p>
               <p>VII. I believe that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the
Greateſt Prophet, that ever hath been;
and that He was indued with a Different,
and Higher Degree of Prophecy, then
any other.</p>
               <p>VIII. I believe that the Law, which
was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was wholly Dictated
by God; and that <hi>Moſes</hi> put not one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
in, of Himſelf; and ſo likewiſe, that
That which we have by Tradition, by
way of Explication of the Precepts of
that Other, hath all of it proceeded from
the Mouth of God, delivering it to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. I believe that this Law is Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and that nothing is to be added to,
or taken from it.</p>
               <p>X. I believe that God hath knowledge
of, and obſerveth all Humane Actions.</p>
               <p>XI. I believe that this God rewardeth
thoſe that keep his Law; and puniſheth
thoſe, that are Tranſgreſſors of it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:32812:144"/>
that the Greateſt Reward is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
in the World to come; and, that
the Greateſt Puniſhment, is the Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Man's Soul.</p>
               <p>XII. I believe that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is yet
to come; who is to be Greater then any
King, that hath ever been throughout the
whole World: who, though he be long
in coming, yet we ought not to doubt, but
that he will come at laſt; neither may we
prefixe a time for his coming, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to collect, when it ſhall be, out of the
Scriptures: Believing withall, that there
never more ought to be any King in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
that is not of the Stock of <hi>David,</hi> and
of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XIII. I believe that God will raiſe
the Dead to Life again.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Fundamentall points of
their <hi>Belief:</hi> with which I ſhall conclude
this my Hiſtory of the whole Manner of
<hi>life,</hi> and Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> of the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
