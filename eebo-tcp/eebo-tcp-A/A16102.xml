            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt againſt the iniuries that outwardly might happen vnto them. In this manner was that auncient Church of the Iewes confirmed of old by the holy ſeruaunt of God Daniell a moſt faithfull Prophet, againſt the violence &amp; fraud of tyrants and of falſe prophets that were to come: And ſo alſo this our Church ſince the firſt comming of Chriſt, remaining in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance of his ſecond and glorious appearance, hath euermore by all his good ſeruants, and eſpecially by this moſt holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Euangeliſt S. Iohn, the diſciple whom Chriſt loued, bin preſerued againſt like, or alſo greater tempeſts: ſtrengthened
<pb facs="tcp:12251:4"/>
with his owne forces, and couered as with certaine eaues leaſt by this perpetuall ſhower of incommodities, it ſhould rot, or anie way drop through. For this Apoſtle, vndoubtedly inſpired of God, hath both mightily defended the truth of the doctrine, and perſon of Chriſt, and the loue of the Church from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous teeth and bitings of heretickes by his Goſpell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by adding an accompliſhment vnto the other holy and diuine Goſpels: and alſo hath in this booke of Reuelation maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the faith and pacience of the ſaints, from the violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſions of moſt cruell enimies, and of moſt falſe hypocrites. This diuine and wholeſome prouidence, moſt familiarly layd out vnto vs in this booke, Satan hath not ceaſſed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to oppugne, that he might plucke the ſame (if it were poſſible) out of the mindes of the godly and elect. For as he hath ſtriuen againſt the credit and authoritie of this booke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much: ſo (when the authoritie thereof was eſtabliſhed) he went about by all poſſible meanes to corrupt the ſence and meaning of the Authour. What and howe mightie engines, howe cunning and daungerous vnderminings he hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſhake and ouerthrow the authority of this booke, many godly &amp; learned men haue long ſince declared. He hath pretended the vncertaintie of the Author, the phraſe, ſtile, and arguments, and hath abuſed the labour of ſome good men to bring this his purpoſe to paſſe. What? is the Author vncertain of that booke which was committed vnto the cuſtodie of ſeuen Churches, and thoſe the moſt noble and renowned of all Aſia, and preſerued of them moſt religiouſly? It is a fable. For ſhall thoſe Epiſtles which were written vnto the onely Church of Rome, of Corinth, and the like, be of certaine and conſtant au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from the teſtimonie of that one Church vnto which they were written, and ſhall the authority of that booke be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion (if God will) which was written vnto ſeuen Churches? They that prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d incongruity of ſpeech, verily ſhew themſelues to be of rude and ruſticall iudgement: who do not thinke that our ſpeech, as much as may be, ought to be attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered vnto the heauenly lawes. They obiect ſtrangeneſſe of the ſtile, the publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his own name, &amp; the ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
<pb facs="tcp:12251:4"/>
ſame things. O worthie thetoricians! who wil not haue the ſtile to differ in a different matter. They thinke it agreeth with the modeſtie of S. Iohn to haue concealed his name: as if S. Iohn in this argument did not ſee it more materiall, that by diuerſe times expreſſing of his name, he ſhould (as Daniell did of old time) commend the credit and authority of the booke vnto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of time to come: then by ſuppreſſing his name to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for this imaginarie modeſtie whereof they ſpeake. Is it not as modeſtly done of S. Iohn, that he doth in expreſſe wordes profeſſe him ſelfe the Author of this booke: as when in the laſt chapter of his Goſpell, he doth by circumlocution deſcribe him ſelfe? Verely in neither booke did he erre from modeſtie: but did in both of them, by addition of his name, confirme the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and authoritie of his writing, neceſſarily &amp; for the publicke good of the Church. That they thinke the ſame thing is often repeated, is partly falſe, and partly where any ſuch repetition is, neceſſarie: which thing our interpretation ſhal declare. How neceſſarie this argument was in the Church of God, we decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the verie entraunce: and no man will denie, that with cleane eys ſhal looke vnto the hiſtory of the Chriſtian church. Wherefore, albeit the authoritie of this booke ſeemed not ſo great vnto ſome good and godly men in times paſt, yet can not their particular iudgement ouerthrow the publike credit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but it is neceſſarie that the authoritie thereof ſhould in the Catholicke Church be accompted entire, beleeued, profeſſed, and preſerued. As for the meaning and ſence of the Author, what need many words? Here verely if any where elſe, that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is true, how many heads, ſo many opinions. But this euill of ignorance, and diſſenting in iudgement, is partly borne with vs from the darkneſſe and infirmitie of our nature: and partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or heaped vp by ſingularitie of affection: which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience that common aduerſarie of our ſaluation hath much increaſed, both by his owne practiſe, and by the indeuor of his miniſters and inſtruments. Therefore the darkeneſſe of that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance infuſed into our minds within, and ſcattered abroade without, hath for the moſt part affrayed good men, otherwiſe excelling in pietie, learning, vtterance, art, and authoritie, from
<pb facs="tcp:12251:5"/>
writing any thing in this argument, or at leaſt from publiſhing the ſame. This modeſtie I commend; but I follow it not. Why ſo? wilt thou ſay; I will ſhew in few wordes what cauſe mooued both others to require it of me, &amp; me to write of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. So ſhall I (as I hope) both approue mine enterpriſevnto good men: &amp; take away the ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of immodeſtie. There were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome good perſons that required this dutie at my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, for that (I will vſe their owne words) they eſteemed me to abound with good meanes to interpret this prophecie of the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, by reaſon of my continuall reading and diligent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the old Teſtament. I as priuie vnto mine owne pouerty, excuſed my ſelf, refuſed the worke, and denied it earneſtly. But they replyed, that this modeſtie was counterfaited, appealed vnto their owne iudgements of me, and flatly charged me to do it of enuie. The importunitie of theſe men forced me much, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when I conſidered, that both in conference with my friends, &amp; in ſcholaſticall diſputations (which I oftentimes held in mine owne houſe) I knew that ſome things had bene vttered by me, and both noted and taken in writing by mine auditours without my priuitie. Nowe, I ſee what happened in old time to the holy fathers, &amp; what now a dayes alſo vnto ſome good men. They of modeſtie withdrew and ſuppreſſed their meditations, words, &amp; writings: but by that means they opened a large field vnto the impudencie and audaciouſneſſe of others. For when yet their corps was ſcarcely buried, writings, capſodies &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were publiſhed in their names, as if they had bin authors of them, which either they neuer bred, or the other vnskilfully gathered, or impudently counterfaited. A moſt vnworthie act, and to be repreſſed by reuenge of the Magiſtrat. I had rather once be immodeſt in the iudgement of theſe men, then beget anie immodeſt perſon, which ſhould attribute vnto me his own inuentions and dreames. Of this expoſition I will ſay nothing, ſaue that I will acknowledge it to be mine owne, and that with mind not to boaſt my ſelf: but to prouide for afterwards, that no man aſcribe vnto me that which him ſelfe hath fained. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſay the truth whereſoeuer by the grace of God I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and to be brief in all things: leſt either I in writing, or good
<pb facs="tcp:12251:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men in reading, ſhould be ſaid to looſe their time. If any thinke otherwiſe then I do, their libertie of iudgement ſhall for me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnto them. For I do not, as a iudge, giue ſentence vpon the worke of others: but as one that would furniſh the ſame feaſt, bring in my diſh amongſt them.</p>
            <p>This litle worke (moſt noble Grinald) I thought good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate vnto you, for your owne ſake, for the publike, and for my ſelfe. For your ſake, that you may know and find, that I do with the conſent of many good men, vnfaynedly reioyce in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, for that godly care wherewith you are wont to examine both the word and iudgements of God, of which this booke is as a moſt plentifull treaſurie. For the publike cauſe, that the ſame your moſt holy ſtudie, which ſhortly (as I truſt) ſhall be profitable to this country, to all Germanie, and to the church, may by this ſmall light of my dedication be ſet in the ſight of all men, and may be of glorie vnto God moſt gracious and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of example vnto good men, and of ornament vnto your ſelfe. For mine owne ſake, becauſe I am bound hauing bene ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of you to honor you againe, a man moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by your owne deſert, and an ornament of your countrey of Germanie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Eaſt the ſhortneſſe of this Commentarie (gentle Reader) and thereby perhaps the hardneſſe of the ſame, might either hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or diſcorage thee in the reading ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I thought good to admoniſh thee of theſe few things. Firſt, the meaning of the Author was not to write any large or full volume at this time, but briefly, yet exactly, to ſet downe the method and order, &amp; as it were the frame of this Prophecie: and ſo to diſtribute the ſame into diverſe branches and members, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion auoyded, thou mighteſt diſtinctly ſee to what part of the ſtorie of the Church, and to what point of time, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing is to be referred.

Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nding my hope is, thou ſhalt find ſo much expreſſed briefly, as may in good part ſatiſfie thy deſire, and giue thee occaſion to conſider further of the particulars themſelues, when thou ſhalt ſee the ſence and meaning of them for thy direction. Many I know haue written more largely of this booke, whoſe labours are not to be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. Here breuity was ſought, that all things, that all things being in a maner at once ſet before thine

If thou ſhalt here find any thing different from the iudgement of others, let it not offend thee: conſidering that in myſteries of this ſort, it hath alwayes bene free for men of learning, and excelling in gifts, without either diſgrace to thoſe that went before them, or preiudice to them that follow after them, to deliuer that which they have receiued, and to commend the ſame vnto the iudgement of the Church. Now that thy labour may be with more eaſe, and with greater frute and delight; reade not the commentarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but with preſent view and conſideration of that part of the text wherunto it doth appertaine: for which cauſe thou ſhalt finde the text and the commentarie belonging vnto it, alwayes printed vpon the ſame page. As for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words of Art which could not be auoyded, and ſome other vnwonted ſpeech, they ſhall I truſt nothing hinder thy proceeding, becauſe that which is obſcure in them at the firſt ſight, will by that which followeth be made light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and plaine vnto thee. It ſhall alſo be profitable for thee, when thou art entred into the reading of this litle worke, not to ſuffer thy ſelfe to be diſtracted or carried away by wearineſſe or vnconſtancie, vntill thou haue ſeene the end of the booke: that comparing all things together, thou mayeſt make accompt of thy labour and profiting herein: both for the truth of the matter propounded, and for thine vſe and frute by the ſame. Alſo it ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee, if not attaining to vnderſtand all things at the firſt reading, thou ſhalt for the excellencie of the matter, which alwayes bringeth ſome difficultie with it, not refuſe

to repeat it the ſecond, and if need rquire the third time. The often noting of the particular Chapters and verſes is more certainly to direct thee to that, the knowledge or remembrance whereof is neceſſarie vnto the preſent place, for thy further inſtruction. For the Tables I haue contracted them as I thought might be more commodious for thee. Vnto this commentarie of <hi>Iunius</hi> is added the briefe notes of <hi>Beza</hi> and others in a diuerſe character, and that in the margent of the text, whereunto thou art directed by the letters of the alphabet: as vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie by arithmeticall figures. For the tranſlation of the text, I haue in a maner wholly vſed that which is moſt common and in euery mans hand: onely for plainneſſe ſake and more euidencie, I haue in ſome few places, framed the ſame vnto that later edition of the Latine, which as I thought, did more nearely approch vnto the originall Greeke copie. Thus commending thy ſtudies vnto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Gods moſt holy ſpirit, I bid thee farewell in the Lord Ieſus. The <hi>5.</hi> of Februarie, <hi>1591.</hi>

Dorotheus Byſhoppe of Tyrus, and a Martyr, in his abbridgement of liues recordeth that John wrote his Gospell in the Ile of Patmos, but maketh no mention of this booke. Athanaſius a Grecian in his catalogue doeth not ſay that this is Johns worke. Dionyſius of Alexandria, as Euſebius reporteth his wordes, in the ſeuenth booke of his Eccleſiaſticall historie, thinketh that this booke was written of ſome other John, who was a godly man. Euſebius him ſelfe ſo citeth this booke in diuers places of his historie, that hee doeth not flatly vouch it to be Iohns: but alleageth one Caius that was a good Christian in the fourth booke of his historie, who ſayeth it was written of one Cerinthus an heretike. Let this bee the first argument which I anſwere in this ſort. If we weigh the reaſons that moued thoſe men to reiect this booke, then wee ſhall ſee howe vndeſeruedly they did it. Againe as ſome did reiect it, ſo did the most part receiue it: in ſo much that Epiphanius recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them amongst heretikes that did reiect it: as for Iustine the philoſopher, and Irene Byſhoppe of Lions which were both martyrs, and did not onely allowe it, but alſo wrote commentaries vpon it, I will not ſpeake of them. As for that that is alledged of Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, it is to no great purpoſe, for that he is thought to reiect it, becauſe hee ſpake not of it. As touching Athanaſius, Eraſmus him ſelfe witneſſeth that it is doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that worke be his or no. Concerning Dionyſius wee will weigh by and by what hee ſayeth, when wee come to conſider of his reaſons. As for Catus (what man ſo euer hee was) hee is eaſily to be refuted euen by Dionyſius his wordes in the third booke of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall hiſtorie. As for Euſebius I make no account of him, for there are none lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but finde want of iudgement in him. Nowe let vs come to the other argument. Hierome writeth (ſayth he) that certaine very well learned men found great fault and ſpake ſharply against the whole matter of this booke, as though there were nothing in it worthie the grauitie of an Apostle, but onely a common hiſtorie of things ſhadowed with certaine darke figures and hard kinde of ſpeaches. And moreouer that in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſentences them ſelues there was nothing that becommed the grauitie of an Apoſtle. Which I anſwere in this ſort: What learned men ſo euer theſe were, they are greatly to be blamed, in that they durſt be ſo bolde to ſpeake euill of that booke, which no doubt is very ſhort, if thoſe things be excepted, which are tranſlated worde for worde out of the Prophetes. Baſil, Gregorie, Cyril, Epiphanius, Irene, Hippolite, as Aretas wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, were not of this iudgement, which thought not onely as Dionyſius of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria did, that ſome godly man wrote this booke, but alſo plainely vouched it to be Iohn the Apoſtle, which no doubt they would neuer haue done, if they had found no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb facs="tcp:12251:9"/>
of the grauitie of an Apoſtle in it. And whether of theſe ſhall J count for the better learned? whether theſe men, which haue giuen recorde both of their ſingular god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and excellent learning by publiſhing many workes, or thoſe men rather, whoſe onely names are ſcarcely heard of: and the reaſons they vſe, giue ſufficient proofe howe learned they were? They ſay there appeared no grauitie in this writer, and yet he hath taken euery what almost worde for worde out of the Prophets: they ſay he hath put downe a common historie. But howe can that be, ſeeing (a fewe things onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept) he maketh no relation of things past, but foretelleth things to come? And therefore they doe not onely not ſpeake that, that is trueth, but not ſo much as any piece or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of trueth.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs come to the third argument: Hee is very curious (ſayth one) in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe his owne name, as though he ſhould indite an obligation, and not write a booke, which is not onely not vſed of any of the Apostles, but is alſo vnaccustomed of him ſelfe: for in his Gospel where he entreateth a great deale more modest matters, then theſe are, he neuer nameth himſelfe, but onely pointeth it out by ſome ſuch markes as theſe, the diſciple whome Jeſus loued. And Paul when he is enforced to ſpeake of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, ſetteth out the matter vnder an other mans perſon. And yet this man, while he deſcribeth the ſecrete conference which he had with Angels, hath neuer done with theſe kinde of wordes, I Iohn. This reaſon mooued Dionyſius of Alexandria to thinke, that ſome other man wrote this booke. But what weake, and ſlender coniectures are theſe? litle did theſe good men conſider, that it was one thing to write an historie, and an other to ſet downe a prophecie: for the trueth of an historie hangeth not ſo much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credite of the writer, as vpon other circumstances, but a prophecie: becauſe it foretelleth things to come, ſtandeth vpon the authoritie of him that reueileth it, and his that preacheth it, ſo that it is of neceſſitte to giue vs to vnderstande, both from whence that forewarning came, and who reueiled it, and who wrote it. Whereupon we ſee, that not onely in the beginning of prophecies, but alſo almost in euery viſion, there is nothing ſo curiouſly ſet downe as the Name of God who ſpake it, and the name of the Prophet who wrote it: Take for example, onely the Prophet Ieremie, who maketh mention of his name, at the leaſt an hundred times. And ſo was it requiſite for him to doe, that hee might not ſeeme to ſeeke lurking corners to hide him ſelfe in as the falſe prophets did. And what? doe we not finde from the ſeuenth Chapter of Daniel, that almost in euery verſe hee repeateth his owne name, and ſayth, I Daniel? And howe oft doeth Eſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate theſe wordes, Eſay the ſonne of Amos? But Iohn did not ſo in his Gospell. J graunt: for he wrote an historie, wherein that befell him, which befell to none other of the diſciples: for hee was occaſioned to ſpeake many things of himſelfe. Nay, Paul alſo did not ſo: In deede hee did not ſo, in any place where he handled not his viſions pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, but whenſoeuer hee voucheth the excellencie of his miniſterie, howe boldly and howe magnifically doeth hee call himſelfe that Paul which was appointed to bee an Apoſtle, not of men, nor by men, but by Ieſus Chriſt? And howe? when hee repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thoſe his great combates, doeth hee take vpon him anothers man perſon? Nay let vs goe further: Iohns name is not to bee found (vnleſſe I be deceiued in my reckoning) aboue fiue times in all this worke: and thoſe wordes (I Iohn) but onely thriſe, to wit, chap. <hi>1.</hi> verſe <hi>9.</hi> and yet with an explication added to it, which may ſuffice aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put away all ſuspition of pride: and againe, chap. <hi>21.</hi> verſe <hi>2.</hi> and chap. <hi>22.</hi> verſe <hi>8.</hi> in both which places hee reporteth onely ſimply what he ſawe, to the ende, that no man might doubt of the trueth of his prophecie. Therefore, to make an ende of this reaſon in fewe wordes, that argument which Dionyſius maketh, is not onely vaine, but alſo argueth want of skill, and is in deede very ſlanderous: nay, I may ſay more, and ſay true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (without any malice to any as the Lorde is witneſſe) that this was too vnaduiſedly
<pb facs="tcp:12251:9"/>
ſpoken, where hee ſayeth, that the Euangeliſt is as curious in his often repeating of, I Iohn, as if he had bene writing an obligation, and no booke.</p>
            <p>Nowe to the fourth Argument: In all the Greeke copies that I haue ſeene, ſaith he, it was not intituled the Reuelation of Iohn the Euangeliſt, but, of Iohn the diuine, which is ſufficient to prooue it was Iohn the Euangeliſt: for all that are learned knowe that he was by excellencie, and by a prerogatiue as it were, called by this name The Diuine, of all the olde writers, becauſe neuer man wrote ſo plainely and diuinely of the diuinitie of Chriſt as he did. As for the other Iohn, who I thinke was a counterfaite, was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this excellent name Diuine, but an Elder.</p>
            <p>Nowe for the vnlikenes of his ſtile, and ſpeach, which that Dionyſius of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria prooueth by three reaſons as Nicephorus recordeth, Eccle. lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>23.</hi> firſt by the whole courſe and nature of his wordes, ſecondly, that whereas the Gospell and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Epiſtle of Iohn, agree in very many pointes, this booke hath not one worke like. Laſtly, becauſe Iohn had an excellent gift of ſpeach, but this man is very clowniſh, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and tripped oft in his language. To the firſt I anſwere, that in ſo diuers a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is no maruaile, to ſee ſo diuers a kinde of ſtile: for in the hiſtorie of the Gospell, and in the Epiſtles, though he ſpake as he was mooued by the holy Ghoſt, yet he ſpake what his minde led him: and here he is but the writer of ſuch things as hee heard and were deliuered him: In the other he ſomewhat maketh report of the hiſtorie, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time teacheth, but in this he ſpeaketh of things to come, and in ſuch order of wordes as he is appointed: And ſhall we maruaile then that hee vſeth not one ſelfe ſame kinde of ſentences? Nay, what writer was there euer that was tied ſo ſhort? are not many things deliuered to him in the very wordes of the olde Prophets, euen in the ſame that Ezechiel, Daniel, Zacharie, Eſai, and other ſpake withall, by the direction of the ſelfe ſame Spirit, which ſpake the ſelfe ſame in them in olde time? And therefore it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that he vſeth not ſo refined a kinde of ſpeach, as happely they would deſire, ſeeing he ſwarueth neither in ſpeache, nor in characters, from the Prophets which wrote in the Hebrewe tongue: and therefore there is leſſe cauſe of ſuspicion that it ſhoulde be any counterfeite worke ſlily crept into the Church.</p>
            <p>Nowe remaineth the laſt Argument, which ſeemeth to charge him that hee fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the hereſie of the Chiliaſtes, whereupon diuers thought that Cerinthus made this booke and fathered it vpon ſome of the Apoſtles. But for mine owne part, though I graunt that the Chiliaſtes haue abuſed many teſtimonies out of this booke, yet I can not yeelde to that, and thinke that ſome heretikes ſhould make it, vnleſſe ſome man he able to ſhewe mee, that thoſe places can not ſitly he taken in any other ſenſe: or els what booke is there, that we may receiue? And that thoſe places are otherwiſe to be taken, diuers learned men haue ſhewed long agoe: ſo that the like hath be fallen this booke as did to the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, which ſome man reiected very obſtinately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeemed to make for the Nouatians: where as in deede they ought rather to haue accuſed their owne ignorance. Moreouer, ſeeing Cerinthus had many other mad and wicked opinions, as that, hee denied that God made the worlde, and taught that Chriſt was borne of Marie, and Ioſeph, as all other men are borne, and maketh Chriſt, and Ieſus two diſtinct perſons: howe commeth it to paſſe that hee ſprinkled none of this Foule holy water amongst the reſt in this booke? But he was ſo farre from ſo doing, that contrariwiſe there may be diuers arguments taken out of this booke againſt thoſe errours: ſo that it may appeare by this one reaſon, that Cerinthus was not the authour of this booke. And againe, where as hee ſpeaketh of the thouſand yeeres, hee mentioneth no one iote of thoſe things, which Cerinthus ſo impudently chattred of. For where is there any mention of that ryote which Ceriathus talketh of? where is that cating? drinking? where are thoſe marriages and paſtimes? where are the ſacrifices and holy dayes
<pb facs="tcp:12251:10"/>
which ſhould be kept at Hieruſalem? Therefore this is a vaine and a fooliſh argument. And ſeeing theſe things are ſo, though I would not ſteffely ſtand in contention forthe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours name, yet I rather iudge it to be Iohn the Apoſtle, then any other mans: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it appeareth to be very aunctent, and the learnedſt and the godlieſt of the olde Fathers doubt not, but it was Iohns.</p>
            <p>Theſe coniectures alſo leade me to thinke ſo: for that I finde none of thoſe dayes to whome either prophecies ſo full of maieſtie, or ſo honourable a name of a diuine, may be aſcribed: and moreouer, that it ſauoureth of the worthineſſe and excellencie of an Apoſtle, to write to the Churches of Aſia, and not to one Church: Laſily, becauſe thoſe thinges which are here ſpoken of Patmos, agree wholy with that which the olde Fathers haue written with one conſent, concerning Johns bantſhment. And yet notwithſtanding if it may be lawfull to coniecture by the kiude of ſpeach it ſelfe, I would thinke it to be no mans ſooner then Markes, who was alſo called Iohn: hee is ſo like not onely in wordes, but alſo in diuers kindes of ſpeach, to the Gospell of Saint Marke, in ſo much that theſe two bookes haue almoſt one kinde of character. As for the booke it ſelfe, though I confeſſe that theſe myſteries are as yet very darke to me, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſeeing there appeareth in all partes of it a great maieſtie of the ſpirite of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, and the very ſteppes and ſentences, yea and the wordes of the olde Prphets, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are to be found in it manifeſt and mightie teſtimonies, both of the Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ete of Chriſt, and alſo of our redemption: And laſt of all, ſeeing that part of thoſe things are moſt manifeſtly come to paſſe, which were foretolde by him, as thoſe things which hee ſpake of the deſtruction of the Churches of Aſia, and of the kingdome of the whore, which ſitteth vpon ſeuen billes, I am perſwaded and thinke that the holy Ghoſts mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to heape vp together, in this moſt precious booke, all ſuch things, as by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of the olde Prophets remained to be fulfilled after the comming of Chriſt: and added alſo a fewe things, as hee thought expedient for vs. I graunt they are very darke, but that is no ſtrange thing in the Prophets writings, as especially in Ezechiels. But this is our fault, becauſe we take not diligent heede to things, but ouerſlip thoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods prouidence, which dayly are to be ſeene in his gouerning of the Church, by hauing our hearts too much ſet vpon our owne priuate affaires. To be ſhort, the Lorde knoweth what, and howe farre it is expedient for vs to knowe, and therefore in times paſt, he ſo dispoſed the light of his Prophets, as for his infinite wiſedome he ſawe it would bee profitable for his Church. And therefore godly men haue to ſearche and wade in theſe myſteries with feare and reuerence, ſo farre forth, as lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profitably they may: and let all men reuerence the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, which are comprehended in this booke, whether they knowe them, or knowe them not, rather then as many doe, either mocke at them, or defile them with their fantaſticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.</p>

The foreſignifying is ſet downe in this chapter: the caution for preſeruing the church, is in the next chapter: and the execution is deſcribed chap. 8. &amp; 9. In euery part of the foreſignifying there are three branches: the ſeuerall &amp; expreſſe calling of S.

And albeit, the expres calling of S. Iohn, be vſed onely in foure of the ſignes, yet the ſame is alſo to be vnderſtood in the reſt that follow. The author of theſe foreſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying is the Lambe, as that word of the Father, made the mediator, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſeales of the booke. The inſtruments are the Angels in moſt of the viſions, who expound the ſigne, &amp; the words therof. Now this firſt verſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth an expres calling of S.

Now this ſpace is to be accounted from the end of that thouſand yeares mentioned chapter 20. 3. and that is, from the Popedome of that Gregorie the ſeuenth, a moſt monſtrous Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who before was called Hildebrandus Senenſis: for this man being made altogether of impietie and wickedneſſe, as a ſlaue of the deuill, whom he ſerued, was the moſt wicked firebrand of the world he excommunicated the Emperour Henry the fourth: went about by all maner of trecherie to ſet vp and put downe Empires and Kingdomes, as liked himſelfe: and doubted not to ſet Rodolph the Swedon ouer the Empire in ſteed of Henrie before named, ſending vnto him a crowne with this verſe annexed vnto it, <hi>Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodolpho,</hi> that is, The Rocke to Peter gaue the crowne, and Peter Rodolph doth renowne. Finally, he ſo finely beſtirred him ſelfe in his affaires, as he miſerably ſet all Chriſtendome on fire, &amp; conueyed ouer vnto his ſucceſſours the burning brand of the ſame; who enraged with like ambition, neuer ceaſed to nouriſh that flame, and to in kindle it more &amp; more: whereby Cities, Common weales, and whole kingdomes ſet together by the eares amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt themſelues, by moſt expert cutthroates, came to ruine, whiles they miſerably wounded one another. This terme of an hundred and 50. yeares, taketh end in the time of Gregorie the ninth, or <hi>Hugolinus Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnienſis</hi> (as he was before called) who cauſed to be compiled by one Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond his chapleine and confeſſour, the body of the Decretals, and by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Kings and Princes, to be publiſhed in the Chriſtian world, and eſtabliſhed for a law.
