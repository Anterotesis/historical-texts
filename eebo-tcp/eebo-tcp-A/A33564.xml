            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the year of our Lord, 1677, I published Mr. <hi>Cocker's</hi> Vulgar <hi>Arithmetick;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in gave an account of the speedy publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Decimal, Logarithmical, and Algebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Arithmetick; but other extraordinary occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences intervening, occasioned its not seeing the light before this time:</p>
            <p>By the Vulgar part, the Ingenious Learner may be qualified with so much of that most necessary Art of Arithmetick as is sufficient for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of business in the greatest concerns of Trade and Commerce; And for those Ingenious Souls, whose active fancies lead them to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scrutiny into the study of the Arts Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical was this Treatise composed, which will fairly lead them by the hand, without any other Guide or Company, into the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those most sublime speculations, an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance entailed only upon the ingenious, and industrious sons of Art.</p>
            <p>The Method throughout the whole is plain, perspicuous, and clear, and I hope will prove sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
<pb facs="tcp:51833:4"/>
to those who shall seriously apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Rules, Precepts, and Examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained</p>
            <p>The use of Decimals (in the solution of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiors Arithmetical, and such Geometrical as are necessary in the mensuration of the most usual planes and solids) is as plainly laid down as the Author or my self could possibly contrive it, and particularly in all the varieties of Interest both Simple and Compound, with Tables, and Rules for the Calculation thereof, according to the Method of several Famous Authors (who have bestowed much pains in the management there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,) and especially of that most famous, and no less laborious Mathematician of our Age and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. <hi>Iohn Kersey,</hi> whose memory deserves highly to be honoured by all the Professors of this Science.</p>
            <p>The Genesis or Fabrick of the Logarithmes, and their use in Arithmetick is laid down after a different but more intelligible manner than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath been used by other Authors, and I hope the studious Reader will receive that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein which our Author earnestly aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, or himself can expect.</p>
            <p>And as for the Algebraical part I think there is nothing therein expressed that is superfluous, nor any thing omitted that could be thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to render it plain, perspicuous, and clear; so that what other Authors treating upon this subject have left intricate, and difficult to be understood is here made obvious (by clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration) to the meanest Capacity; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Courteous Reader, if thou intendest to be a proficient in the Mathematicks, begin chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, proceed gradually, and with resolution; and

               <l>Numerick Truth in its abstracted sense,</l>
               <l>Derives its spring from an Eternal Fount,</l>

               <l>The Universal World it does comprise,</l>
               <l>It no beginning had, nor ever dies.</l>

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WHAT Arithmetick, and the Subject thereof, <hi>(viz.</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) is, I have largely defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the First Chapter of my Vulgar Arithmetick, in which Treatise I have applyed the species of Numeration to the various Rules of Vulgar Arithmetick, both in Integers, and Fractions; for the solution of various Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Questions solvable thereby, by such plain and easie Rules as many years experience in the practice thereof had made me capable of, and which I hope might render it Intelligible, and serviceable to the meanest Capacity.</p>
                  <p>And in this I shall shew you the use of Decimal Fractions in all the Rules of Arithmetick, but Principally in the solving Questions of Interest
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51833:10"/>
and Rebate, according to several Rates of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, both Simple and Compound, with the true Valuation of Leases and Annuities, either present or in Reversion, and likewise their use in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating of Tables for that purpose, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In Decimal Fractions we suppose the unite or Integer to be divided into ten equal parts, and each of those tenth parts are again divided into ten other equal parts, so that then the Unit or Integer will be divided into 100 equal parts, and then again each of those hundred parts is supposed to be divided into 10 other equal parts, so that then the Unit or Integer will be divided into 1000 equal parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so by Decimating the first and subdecimating the second we proceed <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. And hence it is evident that a Decimal Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is alwayes either so many tenths, or it is so many tenths of 1/10, or 'tis so many tenths of 1/10 of 1/10, or so many tenths of 1/10 of 1/10 of 1/10, &amp;c. which compound Decimal Fraction being Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as is taught in the 6 Rule of the 19 Chapter of my Vulgar Arithmetick, will give its equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent simple Decimal Fraction; As for Example, 8/10 of 1/10 of 1/10 is .008 that is 8/1000 and hence it follows that always a Decimal Fraction hath for its Denominator an unite with a Cypher, or else Cyphers annexed to it on the right hand, <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 10, or 100, or 1000, or 10000, or 100000, &amp;c. <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IIII. In Decimal Fractions the Denominator is never express'd, but may at first sight be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the Number of places contained in the Numerator; the Denominator being alwayes an unite with as many Cyphers annexed to it, as there are real places in the Numerator; as 8 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Decimal is 8/10, <hi>viz.</hi> its Denominator is an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51833:10"/>
unite with one Cypher annexed to it, and 85/100 is thus written .85 and 146/1000 thus written .146; But if the Numerator of a Decimal Fraction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not of so many places as there are Cyphers in the Denominator, then such defect is supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by prefixing so many Cyphers before the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merator, <hi>(viz.)</hi> on the left hand as there are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deficient; as for example, 8/100 if it were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down thus, (.8) then it would be but 8/10, but by praefixing a Cypher before it thus (.08) it is 8/100 and 8/1000 is thus expressed (.008) and 25/1000 is thus written (.025) and 25/10000 thus (.0025) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. A Decimal Fraction being written without its Denominator, is known from a whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by having a point or prick prefixed before it thus; .25 is 25/100 but if it had been expressed without a point thus (25) it would have signified so many unites: The same is to be observed in mixt Numbers, for 2916/100 being written Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, will stand thus (29.16) and 4825/1000 thus, (48.025) and 4828/10000 thus, (48.0028) and the like of any others.</p>
                  <p>But some Authors distinguish Decimals from whole Numbers, by prefixing a virgula, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular line before the Decimal, (whether it be alone, or joyned with a whole Number) thus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is 2916/100, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others express the same Decimal Fraction and mixt Numbers thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others with a point over the place of Units in the whole Number; and then the former Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and mixt number will be thus written; <hi>viz.</hi> 08, 0025, 2916 the like of others: And some Authors again put points over all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51833:11"/>
or figures in a Decimal Fraction thus: 8, 025, 2916, 48025, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but being written according to the first Direction, I conceive they may be most fit for Calculation.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. As whole Numbers do increase their value in a decuple proportion, by annexing a Cypher or Figure to the place of Units, so by prefixing a Cypher or Figure on the left hand of a Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, so as actually to take place in the Decimal, its value is decreased in a subdecuple proportion, so the Number 4, by annexing a Figure or Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to it; it is increased from 4 to 40, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if 4 had been a Decimal, <hi>viz.</hi> 4. and if there had been o prefixed before it on the left hand, its value had been decreased from 4/10 to 4/100 or .04, and by prefixing 5, it is .54; and still by prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Figures or Cyphers, its value will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in the same Ratio <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>

                  <p n="7">VII. And as Cyphers being prefixed before a whole Number, <hi>(viz.)</hi> on the left hand thereof) do neither increase or decrease its value; (for 4, and 04, and 004 being Integers, do still retain one and the same value;) So a Decimal, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Cypher, or Cyphers annexed to the Right hand thereof, have not their value either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, or Decreased.</p>
                  <p>Whence it is evident, that all Decimal Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be Reduced to an equal Denomination at first sight; for suppose .15, and .068, and .73465 were Decimals given to be Reduced to one Denomination; In this case I consider that the Denominator for the given Decimal consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the most places is 100000, and .15 and .068 whose Denominators are 100 and 1000 may be reduced to Decimals of the same value, having

likewise 100000 for their Denominator, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing so many Cyphers on the Right hand of the Numerators, as (according to the 4 Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition foregoing) may make each of them to have 100000 for a Denominator, so .15 will be .15000, and .068 will be .06800.</p>

In the foregoing Table is given a mixt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Integers and Decimals; the Integers being separated from the Decimals by a point, or prick, according to the fifth definition beforegoing; so that 384375864 signifie so many Integers or Unites, and 823056345 signifie so many parts of Unity, the figure 8 in the first place being so many tenth parts of unitie; and the next figure, <hi>viz.</hi> the figure 2 is so many hundredth parts of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the Decimal Fraction .4378, the figure 4 possesseth the first place, and is 4 primes, or four tenth parts of an unite, and 3 the second fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is called 3 seconds, or three hundredth parts of an unite, and 7 the third figure is called se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thirds, or seven thousandth parts of an unite, and 8 the fourth figure is called eight fourths, or eight ten thousandth parts of an unite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence it appeareth that every place in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal Fraction being considered a part by it self, without any respect to the rest, will of it self make a particular Decimal Fraction; so in the last mentioned Decimal Fraction, <hi>viz.</hi> 4378, each place being considered by it self, will make these following Decimal Fractions, <hi>viz..</hi> 4.03.007 and .0008, or 4/10, 3/100, 7/1000, and 8/10000; which Fractions being added together, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of Addition of Decimals here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after delivered in the third Chapter, their sum will be .4378, which is the given Decimal of which they are composed.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. A Decimal Fraction is expressed by some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, by Primes, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if this Decimal .748 were to be expressed, they say it is seven primes, four Seconds, and eight thirds:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51833:12"/>
Others there are which express it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred forty eight thirds, but the most approved way to express or read a Decimal Fraction, is according to the method of reading a vulgar Fraction, and to give it the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Figure in the last place of the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and then the Decimal .748 will be thus read, <hi>viz.</hi> seven hundred forty eight thousandths, and .036 is thus read, thirty six thousandths, and so of any other. This Chapter being well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, all the parts of Numeration, <hi>viz.</hi> Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division of Decimals will prove very easie.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. VVHen in any Arithmetical Operation your work is so mingled with vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Fractions, as to render it tedious, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; the best remedy you can have, is to reduce your vulgar Fraction or Fractions into a Decimal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51833:13"/>
or Decimals, which having done the work, will be as easie in every Respect, as if you had to do with nothing but whole Numbers, which you may effect by the following Proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> As the Denominator of the given vulgar Fraction, is to its Numerator,</p>
                     <p>So is an Unite, with so many Cyphers as you intend your Decimal shall have places, To the Decimal Required.</p>
                     <p>So if the Fraction to be Reduced were ¾, and you would reduce it to a decimal consisting of 4 places, I say, the Proportion is</p>
                     <p>As 4 (the Denominator of the given Fraction.)</p>
                     <p>Is to 3 (its Numerator.)</p>
                     <p>So is 10000 (the denominator of the decimal required.)</p>
                     <p>To .7500 (the Decimal required.)</p>
                     <p>So that I conclude ¾ will be reduced to its equivalent decimal .7500, or .75; for Cyphers on the Right hand of a decimal do neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease nor diminish its value, by the seventh defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the First Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Now according to the foresaid proportion, it is evident, that if to the Numerator of any Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction given to be Reduced to a decimal, you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ex as many Cyphers as you intend its equivalent decimal shall have places, and then divide it by its denominator, the Quote will be the decimal required.</p>
                     <p>So let there (again) be given ¾ to be Reduced (as before) to a decimal of 4 places, in order thereunto I annex 4 Cyphers to the Numerator 3, and it makes 30000, which I divide by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator 4, and it Quotes .7500, or .75, for the decimal equivalent to the vulgar Fraction ¾.</p>
                     <p>Note that all vulgar Fractions cannot be Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51833:13"/>
to decimals, having exactly the same value, although they may come infinitely near, and the more places that you make your decimal to consist of, so much the nearer doth it come to the truth, but 4 or 5 places is exact enough for most opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so if it be required to reduce the vulgar Fraction 9/11 to a decimal of 4 places, it will be found to be .818<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> which is not exact, but yet it wanteth not 1/10000 part of an unit of the truth, and if you make it .8182, it will be somewhat more than the truth.</p>
                     <p>Again if you annex 5 Cyphers to the Numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and so make the decimal consist of 5 places, it will then be .81818, yet it will want of the truth, but not so much as when it had but 4 places, for now it will not want 1/100000 part of an unite of the exact truth, and if you make it to be .81819, it will then exceed the truth. Thus by increasing the number of places in the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, you may come infinitely near the truth, but never find a decimal exactly equivalent in many cases.</p>
                     <p>Note also, that if after you have Reduced your vulgar Fraction to a decimal, according to the foregoing Rule, there be not as many places in the decimal, as you annexed Cyphers to the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merator of the given vulgar Fraction, then you are to supply such defect by prefixing so many Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers on the left hand of the significant Figures, as there are places wanting, according to the fourth Rule of the First Chapter.</p>
                     <p>So if 11/941 were given to be Reduced to a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of any number of places, as suppose 6; in order to it, I annex 6 Cyphers to the Numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor 11, and it makes 11000000, for a dividend, which divided by 941, it quotes 11689, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51833:14"/>
consisteth but of 5 places, but it should have 6 places, wherefore to make it compleat, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix a Cypher before it, and it makes .011689 for the true decimal Required; and if it had been required to consist of 4 places, then I annex 4 Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to the numerator, yet after division is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there will be but 3 places in the Quotient, <hi>viz.</hi> 116, therefore to make it consist of 4 pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I prefix a Cypher before it, and it makes .0116 for the decimal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ought. Again let there be given 23/5642 to be Reduced to a decimal of (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) 5 places it will be found to be .00407; and 14/64837 will be reduced to .000215</p>

Hence it is evident that the known parts of Money, Weight, Measure, Time, and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be Reduced to decimal Fractions of the same value, or infinitely near it, for if (in Money) a Pound Sterling be an Integer, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is less than a Pound, is either a part or parts of the same; and when you know what part or parts thereof it is, you may reduce it to a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of the same value, by the first Rule of this Chapter; so if you would know what is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal of a Pound Sterling equal to 7 Shillings; consider that 7 <hi>s.</hi> is 7/20 of a Pound, and by the said Rule, the decimal answering thereto is .35 <hi>l.</hi> And if I would know the decimal equal to 3 <hi>d.</hi> I consider that 3 <hi>d.</hi> is 3/12 of 1/20 of a Pound, or 3/240 of a Pound, and the decimal equivalent thereto,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51833:14"/>
will be found (by the said Rule) to be .0 125; likewise if there were given 7 <hi>s .3 d</hi> to find the decimal equal thereunto: First, I consider, that 7 <hi>s .3 d.</hi> is 87 pence, which is 87/240 of a pound, and the decimal equal thereto will be found to be .3625 <hi>l.</hi>

                     <p>In like manner if it were required to find the decimal of a Pound Troy weight equivalent to 6 <hi>oz.−12 pw.</hi> I first find that 6 <hi>oz.−12 pw.</hi> make 132 <hi>pwts.</hi> which is 132/240 of a pound Troy weight, and the decimal equivalent thereunto, will be found to be .55 by the said first Rule of this Chapter.

                     <p n="3">III. When you would find the value of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal Fraction in the known parts of Coyn, Weight, Measure, Time, Motion, or the like, observe the following</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>RULE</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Multiply the given Decimal by the Number of parts in the next inferiour denomination that are equal to an Integer in the same denomination with the given decimal, and see how many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are in the product, more than were in the said given decimal; and cut so many off from the left hand with a dash of your pen, and those
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51833:15"/>
Figures so cut off, are the value of the said de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal in the next inferiour denomination to it, and the Figures (if there be any) Remaining, are the decimal of an Integer in the said denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may be Reduced as low as you please by the same Rule; as in the following Example.</p>
                     <p>Let it be required to find the value of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal of a pound sterling, <hi>viz.</hi> 7635.</p>
                     <p>First, I multiply the given decimal by 20, and the product is 152700 which is of 6 places, and the given decimal is but of 4 places, wherefore I cut off 2 Figures at the left hand, <hi>viz.</hi> 15. which is so many shillings, now when the said <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 15 is Cut off from the rest, there are yet remaining 2700, which I multiply by 12 to find the value thereof in pence, and the product is 32400, which consisting of 5 places, I cut off one Figure, <hi>(viz.</hi> 3) from the left hand, which is so many Pence; so that I conclude the value of the given deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal to be 15 <hi>s.−03 d.</hi> and the remaining Figures, <hi>viz.</hi> 2400 are the decimal parts of a peny, which because they do not amount to the value of a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I do not Reduce any lower, see the work in the Margent.</p>
                     <p>So if .6847 <hi>l.</hi> be given, and it be required to find its value, if you work as is before directed, you will find it to be 13 <hi>s.−08 d.−1.312 quarters.</hi> And 374 <hi>l.</hi> being so Reduced, you will find it to make 7 <hi>s.−05 d.−3.040 quarters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In like manner, if it were required to Reduce this decimal of a pound Troy weight, <hi>viz. .84576 l.</hi> into known parts; First, I multiply it by 12, and it produceth 1014912, from which I cut off the two first Figures to the left hand,

                        <hi>(viz.</hi> 10.) for Ounces, and the Remaining Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which are 14912 do I multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>0, and the product is 298240, <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap> from which I cut off the first Figure, <hi>viz.</hi> 2, which is two peny weight, and 98240 remaineth, which I mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply by 24, and the product is 2357760, which is 23.57760 grains; so that I conclude the value of the given Decimal .84576 pound Troy weight to be 10 <hi>oz.−02 pw.−23 gr.</hi> .57760; the same is to be observed in finding the value of any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal whatsoever, whether of Coin, Weight, Measure, Time, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I might here have added Tables of Reduction, shewing the decimal Fractions of any of the parts of Money, Weight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as divers Authors have already done; but (because they are (though useful) seldom made use of, and partly by reason of the ease in finding the equivalent decimal of any Fraction whatsoever, according to the Rules herein delivered) I shall forbear it.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. There is a briefer way of discovering the value of a decimal of a Pound sterling, <hi>viz.</hi> The Figure which standeth in the first place of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal, <hi>(viz.</hi> in the place of primes) being dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, gives you the number of shillings; then let the Figure possessing the second place of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal, <hi>(viz.</hi> the place of seconds) be esteemed so many tens, and the Figure in the third place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count so many units, which said te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51833:16"/>
shillings and farthings are the value of the given decimal; but if the Figure in the second place be 5, or else exceed 5, then reckon one shilling for that, and for the excess above 5, esteem eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unit 10, as before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example 1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the value of .7365 <hi>l?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Figure 7 (standing in the place of primes) being doubled, gives 14, which is so many shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and the Figure in the second place, (which is 3) being accounted so many tens is 30, and the Figure in the third place <hi>(viz.</hi> 6) being esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed units, and annexed to the tens beforesaid, makes 36, which being lessened by 1, makes 35 farthings, which is <hi>8d.</hi> ¾, so is <hi>14s.−08d.</hi> ¾ the value of the given Decimal .7365 <hi>l.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the value of .8896 <hi>l?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first Figure (8) being doubled, makes 16; and because the next Figure is above 5, I add 1 to 16, which makes 17 shillings: Then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the second Figure above 5 being 3, I esteem it so many Tens, and the Figure (9) in the third place being units, makes 39; which lessened by 1, makes 38 Farthings, which is <hi>9d.</hi> ½, so is <hi>17s.−9d.</hi> ½, the value of the given decimal .8896. And after the same manner may the value of any decimal of a pound sterling, be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at first sight without loss of a farthing.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. THE work of Addition of Decimal Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is in every respect the very same with that of whole Numbers of one Denomination in common Arithmetick, respect being had to the right ordering or placing of the decimals requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be added, which that you may understand, observe this </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>General Rule,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. When two or more decimals are given to be added together, you are so to dispose of them one under the other, as that all the Figures on the left hand may stand in order one under the other, that is to say, primes under primes, or tenth under tenths, (whether they be Cyphers or significant Figures) and seconds or hundredths, under seconds or hundredths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> observing the same order if they consist some of them of never so many places, and others of never so few.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let there be given these following Decimals to be added together, <hi>viz.</hi> .00746, and .0832, and .62 and .8: First, I dispose of them in order to the work, as you see in the <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Margent, where you see the lowermost Figure 8, which is primes, is placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 6, 0 and 0, which are likewise primes, and the Figure 2 in 62 being in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51833:17"/>
in the place of seconds is placed under 8 and 0 which are likewise seconds, or hundredths, and the Figure 3 in the place of thirds, or thousandths is placed under 7, which is also so many thirds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The same order is to be observed in placing of the decimals of mixt Numbers to be added, as suppose there were given these following mixt Numbers to be added together, <hi>viz.</hi> 168.3572, and 36.864, and 7.42. and .6: Now in order to the finding out their sum, I dispose of them in order one under the other as followeth. Where you may observe that the whole Numbers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or Integral parts of the given mixt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are placed one under the other, as is directed in Addition of whole Numbers, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect at all had to the decimals annexed to them, and the decimals are placed under each other, according to the Directions given in the last Rule, without any respect had to the Integers, properly belonging to them.</p>

                  <p n="3">III. Having placed your given Decimals in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, according to this Rule, draw a line under them, as in Addition of whole Numbers, under which line you are to place their sum; Then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in your work in every respect, as in Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Integers, beginning at the right hand, and so proceeding through the Decimals without any regard to them as Decimals, but as if they were all whole Numbers: As for example, let us take the Decimals given in the first example of the last
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51833:17"/>
Rule foregoing; And first I put down 6 under the line, because there is no other figure or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to add to it, then I proceed to the next, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 2 and 4 make 6, which I also set down in order under the line, then I <gap reason="math">

                     </gap> say 3 and 7 make 10, so I set down 0, and carry 1 to the next, saying 1 that carry, and 2, and 8, make 11, for which I set down 1, and carry 1 to the next, saying, 1 that I carry and 8, and 6, make 15, which I put in its place under the line, because it is the last; and because the figure 5 standeth under the place of primes, I put a point before it, that is to say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1 and 5, and the work is finished; the number 1 being an integer, and the rest a decimal, whereby I find the sum to be 1.51066, that is 1 integer, and .51066 parts of an integer.</p>
                  <p>After the same manner if the mixt numbers in the second example of the foregoing Rule were given to be added, their sum will be found to be 213.2412, that is 213 integers and .2412 deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal parts of an integer, as you may see by the following work.</p>

                  <p>Let it be required to Subtract the Decimal .634 from the Decimal .728; In order to the work I put them one under the other, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51833:18"/>

                     </gap> were given to be subtracted from the mixt number 76.123.

                  <p>When the Decimal given to be Subtracted do not consist of an equal number of places, such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect must be supplyed by annexing Cyphers, or supposing as many Cyphers to be annexed (as are wanting) on the Right hand, and then the work will be as in the former Examples.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore cut off so many figures from the right hand of the product for decimals, and the figure or figures Remaining on the left hand (if there be any) are Integers, as in the following Example.</p>
                  <p>Let it be Required to Multiply 34.82 by 7.26, it matters not which you make the Multiplicand, or the Multiplyar, but I take 7.26 for the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyar, because it hath fewest places, and put it in order under 34.82, as if they were both whole numbers, and having finished the work of Multiplication I find the product to be 2527932 as you may see by the following work.</p>

                  <p>A Third Example shall be of 2 Decimal Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one being given to be multiplyed by the other, as, let there be given .63478 to be Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed by .8264, having disposed of the given numbers according to order, and finished the work of Multiplication as is before directed, I find the product to Amount to 524582192, which being done, to find the true value thereof, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that there are 9 decimal places in both the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51833:20"/>
Factors, <hi>viz.</hi> 5 in the Multiplicand and 4 in the Multiplyar; wherefore I note out 9 places in the product for a decimal Fraction, and so I find the true value of the product to be .524582192, as by the following operation appeareth.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The like is to be understood in any of the like Cases whatsoever.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. If it so happen (as oftentimes it may) that after your Multiplication is finished, the figures in the product do not consist of so many places as there are decimal figures in the Multiplicand and Multiplyar, such defect must be supplyed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing as many Cyphers before it towards the left hand, as it wanteth places, and then mark such product with the said prefixed Cyphers, for a decimal Fraction and the true product Required; as in the following Example.</p>
                  <p>Let it be Required to Multiply .0476 by .0642, after the Multiplication is finished, I find the product to be 305692, consisting but of 6 places, but the Number of Decimal places in the Multiplicand and Multiplyar is 8, wherefore to make the product to consist of 8 places, I prefix 2 Cyphers before it, and then the true product will be .00305592; the work followeth,</p>

                  <p>In like manner if .376523 were given to be Multiplyed by .1346, you will find the product to be 506799958 consisting of 9 places, but there are 10 Decimal places in both the given Factors; wherefore the product must be increased to 10 places by prefixing a Cypher which will make it .0506799958, as by the following work.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Division of Decimal Fractions.</head>
                  <p>HAving gone through Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication, (The operation being (as you see) in every Respect the very same as in whole Numbers) we come now to Division; and although in Decimals, (as well as in whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) Division may seem somewhat difficult to the young Practitioner, yet we shall endeavour to render it as plain and easie as possible may be.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The operation in Division of Decimals is in every respect the same with that of whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, therefore the difficulty in Division of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimals lyeth not in the operation, but in finding out the value of the Quotient after the work of Division is ended, a general Rule for finding of which shall be given by and by.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is necessary many times to annex a cypher or cyphers to the Dividend, whether it be a whole Number, or a mixt Number, or a Decimal Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for many times the Divisor consisteth of more places then the Dividend, and in that case there must be a competent Number of Cyphers annexed to the Dividend, as, suppose it were required to divide 73.564 by 46.24897, here you cannot conveniently proceed in the work till you have annexed Cyphers to the Dividend, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the number of places in the decimal part thereof, and you may annex as many as you please,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51833:22"/>
for by the 7 Rule of the first Chapter, Cyphers annexed to a Decimal Fraction do neither Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor diminish its value.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. When a question to be wrought by Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of decimals is proposed, consider whether there are as many decimal figures in the dividend, as there are in the divisor; if there be any want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, make them full as many, or rather more by annexing Cyphers thereto According to the Rule foregoing, but in some Cases there must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be more, for when there is an equal number of decimal places in the dividend, and in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor, and a division can be made, then the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent will infallibly be a whole Number without any Fraction, except what is in the Remainder.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. In Multiplication of Decimal Fractions, the product containeth as many Decimal figures as there are decimal places in the Multiplicand and Multiplier, and in Division if you multiply the Quotient by the divisor the product will be equal to the dividend, upon which consideration the true value of the Quotient of any division may infallibly be known by this</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>General Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the work of Division is ended, consider how many decimal places are in the dividend more then there are in the divisor, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny soever the excess is, let so many in the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent be separated from the Rest for a Decimal. But if there are not so many figures in the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as the said excess is, such defect must be supplyed, by prefixing as many Cyphers on the left hand, putting a point before them, as hath been Taught already; then shall such Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51833:22"/>
as aforesaid, be the true value of the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent sought.</p>
                  <p>I shall explain this Rule by Examples of the several Cases that may happen in the division of Decimals, which are 9, as followeth.</p>

Now to find out the value of the Quotient by the General Rule before-going, I consider that there are no decimals in the divisor, but there are 4 in the dividend, and consequently by the said Rule there must be 4 decimal places noted out in the Quotient by setting a point before them, and then the true value of the Quotient will be found to be 13.0799.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let there be given 48 to be divided by 43796, you cannot here make any work till you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Cyphers to the Dividend, because the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor is bigger than the dividend and therefore annex as many as you think convenient, suppose 6, and having finished the work of Division you will find the Quotient to be 1095, now to find out its true value, consider that there are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal places in the divisor, but there are 6, in the dividend, therefore there must be 6 decimal places in the Quotient, but the Quotient as yet possesseth but 4 places, therefore to make them up 6 according to the said general Rule, I prefix two Cyphers before the other figures, on the left hand of the same, so as they may take place in the decimal by putting a point before them, so will the true Quotient be .001095, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

it, (or more at pleasure) and finished the work of division as in whole numbers, I find the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be 695, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Now to find out the true value of this Quotient I consider according to the General Rule, that there are but two Decimal places in the Divisor, and 6 in the dividend, therefore (the excess being 4) there must be 4 decimal places in the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but there are but three places, wherefore I make them up 4, by prefixing a Cypher before them, according to the latter part of the said General Rule.</p>

                     <p>There is a Table whose length is 18.75 Feet and its Breadth 3.5 Feet, I demand its content in Feet?</p>
                     <p>To Answer this Question, I take 18.75 feet (the length of it) and multiply it by 3.5 feet (the breadth of it) and the product is 65.625 feet, which is the Content of the Table, as was Required. See the work</p>

                     <p>Here by the way take notice that although amongst Artificers, the two foot Rule is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally divided each foot into 12 Inches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet for him that is at any time employed in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Measuring, it would be most necessary for him to have his two foot Rule, each foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 10 equal parts, and each of those parts divided again into 10 other equal parts, so would the whole foot be divided into 100 equal parts, and thereby would it be made fit to take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of any thing whatsoever, in feet, and decimal parts of a foot, and thereby the Content of any thing may be found as exactly if not more exactly and near, then if the foot were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Inches, quarters and half quarters,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51833:33"/>
and thereby many times would there by much labour and paines avoided, which the Artist is Content to undergo through the want of such Decimal division of his Rule, as we will shew in the solving of the former proposition, after the vulgar way. The question is</p>
                     <p>There is a Table whose length is 18 foot 9 inches, and its breadth 3 foot 6 inches, now I demand its content in feet?</p>
                     <p>Now, before I can find its content, I must find its length and breadth in inches, and then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the inches of the length by the inches of the breadth, and then the product will be 9450 which is its Content in square inches, and to find its Content in feet I must divide the inches by 144 (the number of square inches in a foot) and the Quotient is the Content in feet: See the work following.</p>

                     <p>But how tedious a work it is to answer it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Vulgar way, compared with the decimal way I leave the Judicious Reader to judge, and much more tedious would it have been if there had been either halfs or quarters of inches either in the length or breadth, or both, but the work would still have been the same in the Decimal way, that is, in every Respect as easie.</p>
                     <p>After the same manner is found out the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the true Geometrical Square, which is a figure fitly Represented by an exact square Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, that is, having its length and breadth both equal.</p>

                     <p>A Right angled Triangle is a plain figure hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 3 sides and 3 Angles as the figure B, C, D, in the margent, two of which sides <hi>viz.</hi> BC, and CD, are perpendicular to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now if from the top of the perpendicular at D, there be a line drawn parallel to the base

B, C, as is the Prickt line A, D, and from the end of the Base at B, there be drawn the prickt line BA parallel to the perpendicular till it meet the line AD in A, then will there be made the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram, or long square A, B, C, D, of which the Triangle B, C, D, is half, the Diagonal B, D, dividing the whole paralelogram into 2 equal parts.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Now it is plain from the first proposition, that if you multiply the side B, C, by the side C, D, then the product will be the Content of the whole parallelogram A, B, C, D, and then the half of that Content will be the Content of the given Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle B, C, D. Or if you take half CD, which is C, F, and half of BA, which is B, E, and draw the line E, F, then will E, F, divide the parallelogram A, B, C, D, into two equal paralle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lograms, and either of them is equal to the given Triangle B, C, D, now if by the first propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I can find the Content of the paralelogram E, B, C, F, I find also the Content of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle B, C, D, because they are equal, whence it comes to pass that if you multiply the base by half the perpendicular, or the perpendicular by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51833:34"/>
half the base of a Rectangular Triangle (which is all one) the product will be the true Content thereof.</p>
                     <p>Example.</p>
                     <p>In the former Triangle the base B, C, is 18.28 Feet, and the perpendicular C, D, is 12.26 Feet, I demand its Content in Feet?</p>
                     <p>Here I first find the Content of the whole Parallelogram, by multiplying the sides toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the product is 224.1128 Feet, and the half of that product, is the Content of the Triangle B, C, D, which is 112.0564 Feet. See the following work:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Content would have been the same, if I had multiplyed the one side by half the other, which is indeed the shortest way, and most practical; See the work:</p>

When the Root of any square Number is Required it being lesser than 100, and yet is not exactly a single square, expressed in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet above, then you are to take the Root of that single square Number expressed in the said Tablet, which (being less) is nearest to the given square; As if it were 74 whose Root is required I find that 81 (the square of 9) is too much, and 64 (the square of 8) is too little, but yet it is the nearest square Number that is lesser than 74, and therefore I take 8 to be the square Root of 74, but yet it is plain that 8 is too little for the Root of 74. And to find out the Fractional part of this Root, you shall be plainly taught by and by.</p>

VI. A compound square number is that which hath above 9 for its Root.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The Root of a single square Number may be discovered at the first sight, but the extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a compound square Number is more tedious and difficult, its Root consisting of two places, at the least, and the square it self, of 100 at the least.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. When a compound square number is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and it is required to have its square Root ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, before you can proceed to the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your square number must be prepared, by pointing it at every second figure, beginning at the place of Units.</p>
                  <p>As, Suppose you were to extract the square Root of 2304, first I put a point over 4 (it standing in the place of Units) and then passing over the second place (or place of Tens) which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I put a point over the figure standing in the third place, (or <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> place of Hundreds) which is 3, and the preparative work is done, as you may see in the Margent. Now if there had been more places in the given number, then I must have put a point over the Figure standing in the fifth place, and another over that in the seventh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here note, that as many points as you put over the given square Number, so many Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures there will be in the Root, that is, the Root will consist of so many places.</p>
                  <p>So if there were given the <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> number 33016516, to have its square Root extracted, after I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51833:46"/>
have pointed it according to the Direction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, it will stand as in the Margent, and because the points that are put over it are in number 4, I conclude the Root it self will consist of 4 places, or figures.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. When you have thus prepared your num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then draw a crooked-line on the Right-hand of your number, behind which to place your Root, as you do for a Quotient in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>Note that when your number is prepared for Operation, as in the 8 Rule, the numbers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between point and point, may not unfitly be termed Squares, and in the ensuing work, we shall so call them, as in the foresaid number 33016516, being pointed as before, I call 33 the first square, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>As if the number 676, were given, when it is pointed for the work according to Direction, and as you see in the <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Margent, I account 6 for the first square, and 76, for the second.</p>
                  <p>These things being understood, we shall lay down those general Rules requisite for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the work it self.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. When your number is prepared, find out
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51833:47"/>
the square Root of the first square, according to the 5 Rule foregoing, and place that Root be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the said crooked line: as</p>
                  <p>Let it be Required to extract the square Root of the said number 2304, here the first square number is 23, and (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <gap reason="math">

                     </gap> to the said 5 Rule) its Root is 4, which I place behind the crooked line as you see in the Margent.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Then square the said Root, and place its square which is 16 under the said first square 23, and having drawn a line under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, subtract the said square 16, <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> from 23, and place the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is 7 underneath the said line as you may perceive by the work in the Margent:</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Then to the said Remainder bring down the Figures of the next square and annex them thereto on the Right-hand, so that they may make one intire number, which (for distinctions sake) we shall call the Resolvend.</p>
                  <p>As in this Example to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 7, I bring down the next square 04, and annex it thereto, and it maketh 704 for a Resolvend, as you may see in the Margent.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. Always let the whole Resolvend (except the last figure on the Right hand) be esteemed a Dividend, on the left hand of which draw a Crooked line before which to place a Divisor, as in Division.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:51833:47"/>
So in this example, the <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Resolvend 704 is to be made a Dividend, all but the last place which is 4, so that the Dividend is 70, before which I draw a crooked line, as you see in the Margent.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. Let the Quotient expressing the Root (or part of the Root sought) be doubled, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by 2, and that double or product shall be a Divisor, and must be placed on the left hand of the Resolvend, before the said crooked line.</p>
                  <p>So in our Example, the <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> number 4 which was put for part of the Root being doubled makes 8, which I put before the Resolvend for a Divisor, as it appears in the Margent.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. Then (according to the Rule of Division in whole numbers) seek how often the said Divisor is contained in the said Dividend, and put the answer down in the Quotient, and also on the Right hand of the Divisor.</p>
                  <p>As in our Example I seek <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> how often the Divisor 8 is contained in the Dividend 70, which I find to be 8 times, therefore I put 8 in the Quotient for part of the Root, and also on the Right hand of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor. See the work in the Margent.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:51833:48"/>
XVI. Then by the figure last put for part of the Root, multiply the said Divisor, together with the figure that you annexed to it (account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them both as one intire number) and place the product underneath the said Resolvend, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a line under it, and then subtract it out of the said Resolvend, placing the Remainder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the line.</p>
                  <p>As in our Example, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="math">

                     </gap> placed 8 in the Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and also on the Right-hand of the Divisor, then in the place of the Divisor, there stands 88, which I multiply by 8, the number last put in the Quotient, and the product is 704, which I place in order under the Resolvend 704, and having drawn a line underneath, I subtract the said product 704, from the Resolvend 704, and there remaineth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, so is the work finished, and I find the square Root of 2304 to be 48. See the work in the Margent.</p>
                  <p>Here note that if at any time when you have multiplyed the number standing in the place of the Divisor, by the figure last placed in the Quotient, or Root (as is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1. Note.</note> in the last Rule) if the product be greater than the Resolvend, then conclude the worke to be erroneous, to correct which put a lesser figure in the Root, and proceed as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed.</p>
                  <p>Note also that the work of the 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, Rules must be repeated as often as

                  <p>These things will appear plain and easie in the working of one or two more Examples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example 2.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let it be Required to extract the square Root of 33016516.</p>
                  <p>Here in order to the work, I first prepare my number by distinguishing it into squares, by point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it according to the 8 Rule foregoing and thereby I find that 33, is the first square, and (according to the 10 Rule) I take the square Root of 33, which is 5, and place it for the first figure of the Root, then (according to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Rule) I square the Root (5) and it makes 25, which I place under the said first square number 33, and subtract it therefrom, and the remainder (8) I place below the line, as in the following work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">

                  </p>
                  <p>Then (according to the twelfth Rule) <hi>I</hi> annex to the said remainder (8) the next square (01)
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51833:49"/>
and it makes 801 for a Resolvend, then must 80 (according to the thirteenth Rule) be my divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, and (according to the fourteenth Rule) I double the number (5) in the Root, and it makes 10 for a Divisor, and thereby I divide the said dividend (80) and I find that it Quotes 7, which (according to the fifteenth Rule) I put in the place of the Root after 5, and likewise before the Divisor (10) so that in the place of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor instead of 10, there is now 107.</p>
                  <p>Then (according to the sixteenth Rule) I multiply the said 107, by 7, (the figure last pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Root) and the product is 749, which I place orderly under the said Resolvend, and subtract it therefrom, and the remainder is 52 which <hi>I</hi> put below the line, as in the following work.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>I</hi> repeat the same work over again, in finding the next figure of the Root, as <hi>I</hi> did in finding the last, <hi>viz.</hi> to the remainder (52) (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the twelfth Rule) <hi>I</hi> bring down, and thereto annex the next (third) square (65) and it makes 5265 for a new resolvend, then (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thirteenth Rule) is 526 a new divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, and (according to the fourteenth Rule) <hi>I</hi> take the Root (57) and double it for, a new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51833:49"/>
and it makes 114, which <hi>I</hi> place before the resolvend (5265.)</p>
                  <p>Then (according to the fifteenth Rule) <hi>I</hi> seek how often the divisor (114) is contained in the dividend, (526) and <hi>I</hi> find it will bear 4, which <hi>I</hi> place in the Root orderly, and also on the right hand of the divisor, (114) and then there will be in the place of the divisor, the number 1144, which (according to the sixteenth Rule) <hi>I</hi> multiply by the figure (4) last put in the Root, and the product is 4576, which <hi>I</hi> place orderly under the resolvend (5265) and subtract it therefrom, and the remainder is 689 which <hi>I</hi> place under the line, as is before directed. See the whole work as followeth.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>I</hi> again repeat the work of the 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 Rules of this Chapter for finding the next figure of the Root, <hi>viz.</hi> first <hi>I</hi> bring down (16) the next square number, and annex it to the remainder 689, (according to the twelfth Rule) and it makes 68916, for a new resolvend, of which (by the thirteenth Rule) 6891 is a new Dividend then (according to the fourteenth

Rule) <hi>I</hi> double the Root, and it makes 1148 for a divisor, which I place on the left side the resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend, and then seek how often it is contained in the said dividend (6891) and the answer is 6, which <hi>I</hi> place for part of the Root (in order) and also on the right hand of the said Divisor, so that in the place of the divisor 1148, will then stand the number 11486, which (by the sixteenth Rule) <hi>I</hi> multiply by 6, (the figure last placed in the Root, and the product is 11486, which <hi>I</hi> place in order under the resolvend, and subtract it therefrom, and the remainder is o, and so the work is finished, whereby <hi>I</hi> find the square Root of 33016516, to be 5746, as by the whole operation appeareth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Observe</hi> 1. That the work contained in the 7, 8 and 9 Rules for finding out the first figure of the Root, is not again to be repeated, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole work of Extraction, although the Root consist of never so many places, but the work of all the Rules following is to be repeated as often as a new figure is put in the root.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observe</hi> 2. For every particular Cube in the number given, distinguished by the points, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the first) there is to be found out a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvend, by annexing the next cube to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51833:61"/>
(according to the <hi>10th.</hi> Rule) and as often as there is a resolvend, so often must there be found a new Divisor (by the 11, 12 and 13 Rules) and as often as there is found a new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor so often must there be found a new Subtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend (according to the 15, 16, 17, and 18 Rule before-going.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observe</hi> 3. When the Subtrahend chanceth to be greater than the resolvend, then you may conclude there is an error in your work, which must be corrected by putting a lesser figure in the Root.</p>

                  <p>Then, to the said remainder 21, do <hi>I</hi> bring down, and thereto annex the next cube, which

                  <p>Then according to the <hi>14th.</hi> Rule <hi>I</hi> seek how often the said Divisor 279 is contained in 2162 the Dividend, and I find the answer to be 6, which I place for the second figure in the Root, then do I in the next place go about to find out a subtrahend, and in order thereunto first (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fifteenth Rule of this Chapter) <hi>I</hi> cube the figure (6) last placed in the root, and it maketh 216, which <hi>I</hi> place under the Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend in such order (as is directed in the said fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Rule) that the place of Units of the one may stand under the place of Units of the other; Then (according to the <hi>16th.</hi> Rule of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>I</hi> square the figure <hi>(viz.</hi> 6) last placed in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51833:62"/>
the root which makes 36, and then multiply it by (9) the said triple root, and the product is 324 which <hi>I</hi> place under (216) the said cube of 6, in such order as is directed in the said <hi>16th.</hi> Rule. Then do <hi>I</hi> multiply the said Triple square <hi>(viz.</hi> 27) by the figure (6) last placed in the root, and it produceth 162, which <hi>I</hi> place under the last product (324) in such manner as is directed in the <hi>17th.</hi> Rule. Then <hi>I</hi> add these 3 several numbers together in the same order as they stand, and their Sum is 19656 for a Subtrahend, which subtracted out of (21627) the Resolvend, the remainder is 1971, as you may see by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work.</p>

                     <p>In the Triangle ABC, the Base AB is 48, and the perpendicular BC is 36, now I demand the length of the Hypothenuse AC.</p>
                     <p>To find out <figure/> an answer to this, first, I square the base AB, (48) which is 2304, then square the Perpendicular (36) and its square is 1296, the sum of which two squares is 3600, which is equal to the Square of the Hypothenuse AC, therefore the square Root of 3600 will give the length of AC, which is 60.</p>

                     <p>THere is a Tower about which there is a Moat that is 48 foot wide, and a scaleing Ladder that is 60 Foot long, will reach from the outside of the Moat, to the top of a Wall, that is within the said Moat, now I demand the height of the said Wall above the Water?</p>

                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:51833:71"/>
Let the Base AB in the foregoing Triangle be the breadth of the Moat, and let the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenuse AC be the scaling. Ladder, then is the perpendicular BC the height of the Wall above the Water. Now it is plain that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Square of AC is equal to the sum of the squares of AB and BC) if from the square of AC which is 3600 you subtract the square of AB which is 2304, there will remain 1296, which is the square of CB, therefore I extract the square Root of 1296, and find it to be 36, which is the height of the said Wall above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as was required.</p>
                     <p>By the help of this Proposition may be found the true perpendicular height of a Cone, or of a Pyramid; for, in a Cone, if you square the slant height, (which is the length of a line drawn from its vertical point, to the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of its base) and from the square of that, subtract the square of the semidiameter of its base, there will remain the square of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular height of that Cone.</p>
                     <p>Also, In a Pyramid, if from the square of the slant height of it, you subtract the square of that line which being drawn from the Centre of its base, shall touch the end of the said slant line, (whether they meet at an Angle or not) the remainder will be the square of the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular height of that Pyramid, and its square Root will give the height it self.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. Concerning Simple Interest.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. VVHen Money pertaining, or belonging to one person is in the hands, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, or keeping, or is lent to another, and the Debtor payeth or alloweth to the Creditor, a certain sum in Consideration of forbearance for a certain time, such consideration for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance is called Interest, loane, or use money; and the money so lent, and forborne is called the principal.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Interest is either Simple, or Compound.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. When for a sum of money lent there is loane, or interest allowed, and the same is not paid when it becomes due, and if such Interest doth not then become a part of the Principal, it is called Simple Interest.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV, In the taking of Interest for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance or forbearance of Money, respect must be had to the rate limited by Act of Parliament, which Act now in force, forbiddeth, or restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all persons whatsoever, from taking more than 6 <hi>l.</hi> for the Interest of an 100 <hi>l.</hi> for a year, and according to the same proportion for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or a lesser sum, not confining the lender or borrower to the space of one year, no more than
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51833:77"/>
it confineth him or them to the limitation of the sum to be lent, or borrowed, but that the sum may be either more or less than 100 <hi>l,</hi> and may continue in the hands of the Debtor, either a longer, or a shorter time than one year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Lender and Borrower do agree, and oblige each other; Now for any time grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than one year, the rate or proportion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is by Act of Parliament limited, but the Act doth not say what part of 6 <hi>l.</hi> shall be the interest of an 100 <hi>l.</hi> for half a year, a quarter of a year, a month, a day, or for any time les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than one year, and in this case several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists do differ in their opinions, some would have the true proportional interest for any time less than a year to be discovered by continual mean proportionals; as suppose it were required to know the interest of 100 <hi>l.</hi> for half a year at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> they would have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to be reckoned after the Rule of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound interest, and so <hi>3l.</hi> is not the interest of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> for half a year, but is too much: But say they, to find out the true interest thereof, you are to find a mean proportional between 100, and 106, and that made less by 100, will give you the interest of 100 <hi>l.</hi> for half a year, and so by extracting of Roots they find out the interest for any time less than one year, but this is sufficiently laborious and painful if it be done without the help of Logarithms; but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this work to the 12 power for a Moneth, or to the 52 for a Weak, is very tedious, and to the 365 power for one Day is scarcely possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be effected by natural Numbers; but cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and dayly practice tell us that the interest of Money for any time less than one year ought
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51833:77"/>
to be computed according to the Rules of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Interest, and so 3 <hi>l.</hi> is the undoubted interest of 100 <hi>l.</hi> for 6 moneths, and 30 shillings is the interest of 100 <hi>l.</hi> for a quarter of a year; but here note by the way that by 6 moneths is not meant 6 times 4 weeks, or 6 times 28 dayes, but by six moneths, or half a year is to be understood the half of 365 dayes, and a quarter of a year is ¼ of 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>5 dayes, and by 1 moneth is understood 1/12 of 365 dayes, so that a moneth consisteth of 305/12 dayes.</p>
                  <p>Upon the foresaid custom of computing the interest of money for time less than one year, this following Analogie seems to be assumed for a safe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide</hi> Sect. 6 of the 5 chap of Mr. <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> Appendix to <hi>Wing.</hi> Arith.</note> of the statute (and which is indeed the ground, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it self of Simple Interest) <hi>viz.</hi> That such proportion as 365 dayes (or one year) hath to the interest of any sum for a year, such proportion hath any part of one year, or any number of dayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to the interest of the same sum, for that time propounded. And this (as was said before) is the whole ground work, and very foundation of the manner of computing of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Interest.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Rebate, or Discount, is, when there is an allowance of so much <hi>per Cent.</hi> for money paid before it be due, and <note place="margin">Of <hi>Rebate,</hi> what it is.</note> as the increase of money at interest is found out by continual proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Arithmetical or Geometrical increasing, so is the Rebate or discount of Money found out by continual proportionals decreasing Arithmetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Geometrically, that is according as the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51833:78"/>
is, either after Simple or Compound In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; Now the nature of Rebate or discount is thus; When there is a sum of Money, (suppose 100 <hi>l.)</hi> to become due at the end of a certain time to come, <hi>(viz.</hi> at the end of 12 Moneths;) and it is agreed upon by the Debtor and Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that there shall be made present payment of the whole Debt, and it is likewise agreed that in consideration of this present payment, that the Creditor shall allow the Debtor after the rate of 6 <hi>per cent. per annum:</hi> Now upon this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Creditor ought to receive so much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as being put out at interest for the same time it was paid before 'twas due, and at the same rate of interest, that the discount was reckoned at, then would it amount or be increased to the sum that was first due.</p>
                  <p>The manner of working Questions in Rebate at Simple Interest shall be shewn in the ninth Rule of this Chapter, and of working Questions in Rebate at Compound Interest shall be shewen in the Fourth Rule of the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. When the interest of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> for a year is known, the interest of any other sum, for the same time, is also found out, by one single rule of direct proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Interest of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> for a year by the statute is <hi>6l,</hi> I demand what is the interest of 75 <hi>l.</hi> for the same time, and at the same Rate of Interest? The proportion is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if you would have the Answer to produce both principal and interest, then make the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51833:78"/>
number to be the sum of the given princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and interest, and the fourth proportional will answer your desire. Thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. When the Interest of 100 for a year is given, and the interest of any other sum of pounds, shillings, and pence is required for a year, the answer may be easily found after the practical method delivered in the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>Let it be required to find the interest of <hi>148l.−13s.</hi> 04. for one year after the rate of 6 <hi>per cent. per annum,</hi> simple interest?</p>
                  <p>First, I place the given Numbers according to the Direction given for the Rule of 3, which will then stand thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is evident that if I multiply <hi>148l.−13s−04d.</hi> (which is the third num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) by 6 (which is the second number) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the product by 100 (which is the first num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) the Quotient will be the answer; Therefore I proceed thus, <hi>viz</hi> first I multiply the pence by 6, which makes 24 pence, or two shillings, therefore I set down o under the pence, and carry 2 to the next, then I go to the <hi>13s.</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 6 times 13 is 78, and 2 that I carryed is 80 <hi>s.</hi> which is 4 <hi>l.</hi> therefore I set down o under the shillings, and carry 4 to the pounds, then I proceed, saying 6 times 8 is 48, and 4 that I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51833:79"/>
carry is 52, then I set down 2, and carry 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeding thus till the work be finished, and then will the product be <hi>890l.−00s.−00d,</hi> which product should be divided by 100 (the first number) but it being an Unite with two Cyphers, I cut off two figures from the right hand of the pounds, with a dash of the pen, and the figures on the left hand of the said dash, are so many pounds, and those on the right hand of it, are the Decimal parts of a pound, whose value may be found out by the 3 R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>le of the 2 Chap. But remember, that if there be any shillings or pence, in the product you are to add them to their respective products in your Reduction.</p>
                  <p>The work of the foregoing Example is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">

                  </p>
                  <p>So that by the work I find the interest of 148 <hi>l.−13s.−4d.</hi> for one year after the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per An.</hi> to be <hi>8l.−18s.−04d−3.2qu.</hi>

Another Example may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> I demand the Interest of <hi>368l. 15s.−3d.</hi> for one year, at 6 <hi>per Cent. per An.</hi> Answer <hi>22l.−02s.−6d.</hi> as by the work following.</p>

                  <p n="8">VIII. The Interest of <hi>100l.</hi> being known for a year, or 365 dayes, the interest of any other sum may be known for any other time, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of dayes, more or less than a year, by two single Rules of 3 Direct, <hi>viz.</hi> First, find out what is the interest of the given sum, for one year, or 365 dayes, according to the last Rule, then having found out that, you may (by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther single Rule of 3 Direct) find out its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest for any other time more or less.</p>

                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:51833:80"/>
First, I find what is the Interest of <hi>322l.</hi> for a year by the following proportion,</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus having found the Interest of <hi>322l.</hi> for a year to be <hi>19.32l.</hi> at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> by the following proportion, I find out its interest for 6 years, to be <hi>115l.−18s.−04¾d.</hi> and that added to the principal, makes <hi>437l.−18s.−04¾d.</hi> for the sum due to the Creditor at the end of the said time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here take notice that the second number in this last proportion, must always be only the interest of the sum proposed, and not the sum
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51833:80"/>
of the principal and interest, as in the second proportion under the sixth Rule.</p>
                  <p>After the same manner is the interest of <hi>1l.</hi> (at the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> or any other rate of interest,) discovered for a day, by the help of which the interest of any sum whatsoever may be discovered for any number of dayes as shall be shown by and by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that by the foregoing proportions I have found that the interest of <hi>1l.</hi> at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum</hi> for a day is <hi>.0001643835l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you would know the interest of any other sum for any number of dayes more or less than 365, you may do it by help of the said number after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Multiply the sum whose interest is required by the said number, and that product will give you the interest of the said sum for one day, then multiply that product by the number of dayes given, and the last product will give you the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the said sum for the number of dayes in the Question. Take the following Question for an example, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is the interest of <hi>568l.</hi> for 213 dayes after the Rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Having finished the work as you see, I find the answer to be 19.8877 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which upon sight I discover to be <hi>19l.−17s−09d.</hi> by the brief way of valluing a Decimal Fraction of Coyne laid down in the 4 Rule of the 2 Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-going.</p>
                  <p>But when the interest of any sum of Money is required for any number of dayes as aforesaid, at any other rate of interest then at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> the foresaid number will not then serve for the work, but you are to find out par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular multiplyars for the several Rates of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest as is before directed.

When the present worth of a sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney due at the end of any time to come is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Rebate being allowed at any rate of Simple Interest, it may be found out by the following method; <hi>viz.</hi> First, Find out the Interest of <hi>100l.</hi> for the time that the Rebate is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for, and at the same rate of interest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, then make the sum of an 100 pound, and its interest for the proposed time, to be the first number in the Rule of 3, and <hi>100l.</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond number, and the given sum whose present worth is required, let be the third number, and the fourth number in a direct proportion shall answer the question, as in the following Example, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What present Money will satisfie a debt of <hi>100l.</hi> that is due at the end of a year yet to come, discount, or Rebate being allowed at the Rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to the foregoing Directions, I state the numbers as followeth, and the fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional

number or answer to the question is 94.33962 <hi>l.</hi>=94 <hi>l.−06s.</hi>−09 ½<hi>d fere.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The reason of the said Analogy will appear if you consider, that there ought to be so much ready money paid, that if it were put out to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest at the same rate of Int. that Rebate was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and for the same time, the same would then be augmented to the sum that was at first due, as in the last question, there is given 100 <hi>l.</hi> which is due at the end of 12 moneths, now I say, that there ought to be so much money paid down to satisfie this debt, as being put out to interest at 6 <hi>perCent.</hi> for 12 moneths, would then be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to 100 <hi>l.</hi> which is the sum first due, and again it is as evident that if there were 106 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of 12 moneths, or a year, and present payment is agreed upon, allowing Rebate at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> that then there ought to be paid the sum of 100 <hi>l,</hi> in full discharge of the said debt of 106 <hi>l.</hi> for if when I have received the said sum of 100 <hi>l,</hi> I put it out to interest for one year at the rate of 6 <hi>per. Cent.</hi> it will then be increased to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>06 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore to solve the said question, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion here used is no more than if <hi>I</hi> should say, If 106 <hi>l.</hi> be decreased to 100 <hi>l.</hi> what will 100 <hi>l.</hi> be decreased to? The answer is, to <hi>94l.−6s.−9d.</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, and for proof, if yon will seek what that sum will be increased to at the end of 12 moneths, at the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> you will find it to be <hi>100l.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Example 2.</hi>

                  <p>How much present money will satisfie a debt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51833:82"/>
of <hi>82l.−15s.</hi> due at the end of 126 dayes, yet to come allowing Rebate after the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, I find the interest of <hi>100l.</hi> at the same rate of interest for 126 dayes, by the following proportion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then do I add <hi>2.0712l.</hi> (the interest of <hi>100l.)</hi> to 100 <hi>l.</hi> and the sum is 102.0712 which I make the first number in the Rule of 3, and <hi>100l.</hi> the second, and <hi>82.75l.</hi> (the sum given to be Reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the third number, and the fourth number in a direct proportion is the answer to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, see the work as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that by the work it appears that <hi>82l.−15s.</hi> due at the end of 126 dayes yet to come, will be satisfied with the present payment of <hi>81l.−01s.−04¾d.</hi> Rebate be allowed after the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per An.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The proof of the Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Find out (by the eighth Rule foregoing) how much the present money that is paid upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, will amount to being put out to interest for the same time, and at the same Rate of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest that Rebate was allowed for, and if the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount be equal to the sum that was due at the end
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51833:83"/>
of that time, then you may conclude the work to be rightly performed, otherwise not.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the foregoing Question it was found that 81.0708 <hi>l.</hi> being paid presently would satisfie a debt of 82.75 due at the end of 126 dayes to come, and to prove it, let us see whether 81.0708 being put out to interest for 126 dayes at the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to 82.75 <hi>l.</hi> (the sum which was said to be due at the end of 126 dayes to come) which I do by these two proportions following according to the Eighth Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>So you see that I have found the interest of 81.0708 for 126 dayes to be 1.6791 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which added to the principal 81.0708 the sum is 82.7499 which by the brief way of valuing the Decimal of a pound sterling is 82 <hi>l.−15s.</hi> and indeed it doth not want 1/10 part a farthing of the exact sum, which is occasioned by the defective Decimal wherefore I conclude the work to be rightly performed.</p>
                  <p>Upon the foregoing ninth Rule is grounded the manner of calculating the ensuing Table of Multiplyars, which sheweth in Decimal parts of a pound, the present worth of a pound sterling due at the end of any number of years to come,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51833:83"/>
not exceeding 30, Simple interest being Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at 6 <hi>per Cent. per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first number in the Table being found out by this following proportion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>106l.</hi> is to <hi>100l,</hi> so is 1 <hi>l.</hi> to .943396, and the second number in the Table being the present worth of 1 <hi>l</hi> due at the end of two years to come, is thus found out, <hi>viz.</hi> First I consider that 12 <hi>l.</hi> is the simple interest of <hi>100l,</hi> for 2 years, which added to 100 <hi>l.</hi> makes 112 <hi>l.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, as 112 <hi>l.</hi> is to 100 <hi>l.</hi> so is <hi>1l.</hi> to .892857 <hi>l.</hi> which is the present worth of <hi>1l.</hi> due at the end of 2 years to come.</p>
                  <p>The several proportions and operations for the whole Calculation being as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>And after the same manner are all the numbers in the following Table Calculated; which being well understood, the way of calculating most of the ensuing Tables will easily be obtained; and its use you will find immediately after the Table it self.</p>

                     <p>It is evident (by the ninth Rule foregoing)
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51833:84"/>
that if any sum be paid with an allowance of Rebate, you are to make 100 <hi>l.</hi> with its interest (for the same time you Rebate for) both in one sum, to be the first number in the Rule of 3, 100 the second, and the sum to be rebated the third, then will the fourth proportional be the answer; and the same may be wrought by any other number and its interest, as well as by 100 <hi>l.</hi> and its interest <hi>mutatis mutandis;</hi> Now in the Table before-going there is expressed in Decimal parts of a pound, the present worth of 1 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of any number of years to come under 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is to say, if you take the money signified by those Decimals, and put it out to interest at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Interest for so many years as are expressed in the Collum of years against the said Decimal, then will that sum at the end of the said Term be augmented to 1 <hi>l,</hi> wherefore if you have any sum whatsoever to be Rebated for any number of years within the limits of the Table, make 1 <hi>l.</hi> the first number in the Rule of 3, and the Decimal in the Table against the number of years to be Rebated for, make that the second, and the sum whose present worth is required the third number, so will the fourth proportional be the Answer. But (because the first number (being Unity) neither multiplyeth nor divideth) if you take the number in the Table, correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the number of years for which you would reckon Rebate, and thereby multiply the sum whose present worth is required, the product will give you the Answer.</p>

                     <p>There is a sum of money, <hi>viz.</hi> 560 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of 8 years to come, but the Debtor and Creditor agree that present payment shall be made, and the Debtor to be allowed Rebate after the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Simple Interest.

                     <p>First (the Rebate being to be reckoned for 8 years) I look for 8 in the Collum of years, and just against it on the Right hand, I fiud .675675 which I multiply by 560 (the sum whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent worth is required,) and the product is 378.378, which (by the brief way of valuing the fraction of a pound sterling) I find at first sight to be 378 <hi>l.=07s.−06<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the first year, and is forborne the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years; all which interests being added together, and their sum added to the sum of each years income, the sum will exhibit the total sum, due at the end of the said six years, which you may perceive by the following work to be 690 <hi>l.</hi> which is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the foregoing Question.</p>

                     <p>There is an Annuity of 134 <hi>l.−10s.−6d.</hi> all forborne to the end of 4 years; I demand how much is due to the Creditor at the end of the said Term, Simple Interest being allowed after the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Facit <hi>586l.−10s.−07d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To answer this Question, First, I look for 4 years, in the Collum of years, and the number against it is 4.36 which is the amount of 1 <hi>l.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity for 4 years; therefore having turned the 1 <hi>s.−6d.</hi> (in the given annuity) into a Decimal (which is .525) I say by the Rule of 3 thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="math">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus by the work I find the answer to be 58.529 <hi>l.</hi> the value of which Decimal by the brief way of valuing a Decimal laid down in the 4th Rule of the 2d Chapter, I find to be <hi>580l. 10s. 7d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is plain that in solving Questions by this Table, that (the first number in the Rule of 3 being unite) if you multiply the given Annuity
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51833:88"/>
by the proper Tabular Number, that then the product will be the answer.</p>

                     <p n="11">XI. When an Annuity or yearly Income, for a certain number of years to come, is to be sold for ready Money, and the seller is to allow the Buyer Rebate at <note place="margin">The Rebate of Annuities at Simple Interest</note> Simple Interest for his present payment, then in this case the buyer ought to pay so much present money for each yearly payment, as being put out at Simple Interest for so many years as it is Rebated for, it would then amount to one yearly payment, and the sum of all those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent worths will be the present worth of the Annuity required, the Rule will appear very plain by the following Example.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is evident that if we find out the present worth of 100 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of the first year, and also the present worth of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of the second year, and the present worth of 100 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of the third year, and likewise the present worth of 100 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of the fourth, fifth, and sixth years, and add all these present worths together, their sum will be the present worth of the given Annuity; which several present worths are found out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ninth Rule, by the several propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that you see by the foregoing proportions, the present worth of 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue six years, allowing Rebate at 6 <hi>per Cent. per

                     <p>As, suppose there were a Lease of 20 shillings <hi>per annum</hi> to continue 6 years, to be sold for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent money, allowing the buyer Rebate at 6 <hi>per Cent. per annum</hi> Simple Interest. I desire to know how much is its present worth? To answer this, I look in the Collume of years for 6, and in the next Collume on the right hand just against 6 you have 4.99468 5 <hi>l.=4 l.−19 s.−10 ¾ d.</hi> which is the answer to the Question. And by the help of this Table may the present worth of any Annuity to continue any number of years under 31 be found out, allowing Rebate at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Simple Interest, by one single Rule of 3 Direct, according to the manner of solving the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing question, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <hi>Quest. 1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a Lease of 18 years yet to come, of the yearly value of 130 <hi>l.</hi> to be sold for ready Money, and the purchaser is to be allowed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate after the rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Interest, now I demand how much is the present worth of this Lease?</p>
                     <p>Facit 1553 <hi>l.−10 s.−10 ¾ d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, I look in the Table for 18 years, and over against it on the right hand I find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>1.950341 which is the present worth of 1 pound annuity to continue 18 years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore by the Rule of 3 Direct, I say</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that by the work you find the answer to be 1553.544 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> or 1553 <hi>l.−10 s.−10 ¾ d.</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near, which said answer is nothing else but the product of the Tabular number, (<hi>11.950341l.)</hi> multiplyed by the given annuity (130 <hi>l.)</hi> For it is evident, that if the present worth of 1 pound annuity to continue 18 years be 11.950341 <hi>l.</hi> then the present worth of 130 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> to continue the same number of years (and Rebate being allowed at the same Rate <hi>per Cent. per an.</hi> for the one as for the other) must be 130 times as much. But when Rebate is to be allowed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any other rate then 6 <hi>per Cent. per annum,</hi> then the foregoing Table will not at all be useful, but you must have recourse to a Table calculated for the same rate of interest, which you may easily perform at leisure by the foregoing Rules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest. 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What Annuity to continue 18 years will 1553.5443 30 purchase, allowing the Buyer Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Interest at 6 <hi>per Cent. per annum?</hi>
                     </p>

This Question is but the converse of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and may be thus Resolved, <hi>viz.</hi> Táke the Tabular number corresponding to 18 years, which is 11.950341 by which divide the given purchase Money, and the Quotient will give you the annuity that it will purchase, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that by the work I find it will purchase an Annuity of <hi>130l.</hi> to continue 18 years.</p>
                     <p>The reason of the work is plain, for if the Tabular number correspondent to 18 years be the present worth of 1 <hi>l.</hi> Annuity to continue 18 years to come, then it is certain that so much money as is expressed by that Tabular number, will purchase an Annuity of 1 <hi>l.</hi> to continue 18 years: And consequently we may find by help of the said Table what annuity any other sum of money will purchase, to continue any number of years not exceeding 30, by a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Rule of 3 Direct, as in the last Question, the proportion is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>I might have made Tables for other Rates of Interest, but Simple Interest being seldom allowed in the purchasing or valuing of Leases and Annuities, (they being generally purchased at Compound Interest, or Interest upon Interest) makes me forbear, and indeed at Simple Interest a Lease is over-valued.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. WHat hath been said in the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I judge sufficient for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Nature and use of Simple Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and that being well understood, the nature of Compound Interest will not seem difficult to the studious Learner, and the better he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of Simple Interest, so much the easier will he come to the knowledge of the nature, and use of Compound Interest.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Compound Interest is, when a sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is put out to interest, and the interest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of becoming due is still continued in the hands of the Debtor, so as to become part of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, Interest being reckoned for it from the time it becometh due, for which reason it is called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest upon Interest: And as Simple Interest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth by a series of Arithmetical proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals continued; so doth Compound interest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by a rank or series of continual Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical proportionals. For when a sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is put out to interest at any Rate <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> (as suppose 100 <hi>l.</hi> to be put out to receive at the end of one year 6 <hi>l.</hi> for its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest) it is evident that if the interest (being 6 <hi>l.)</hi> be continued in the hands of the Debtor, there will be at the end of the second year the increase
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51833:92"/>
of 106 <hi>l.</hi> which is 112.36 <hi>l.</hi> and at the third years end there will be the increase of 112.36 <hi>l.</hi> so that every number proceedeth from that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before it, after the same Rate or Reason as 100 proceedeth from 100, as you see follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <p>So that by the Augmentation of 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 4 years, you have this rank of Geometrical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals continued <hi>viz.</hi> 100, 106, 112.36, 119.1016. and 126.247696 which is in number 5, <hi>viz.</hi> more by one than is the number of years, the last of which is the amount of 100 <hi>l.</hi> at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for 4 years reckoning Compound In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, or Interest upon Interest, and each of these proportionals proceedeth from that going before it as 106 proceedeth from 100, that is to say, every of the said proportionals, is in such proportion to that which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it as 106 is to 100, or as 100 is to 106, so is any one of them, to that which followeth it, or if you take any 3 of them which are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced together, there is this proportion between them, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <head>The use of the foregoing TABLE.</head>
                     <p>In the first Collum of the Table under the Title years, are expressed the number of years from 1 to 30, and in the second Collum under the figure 5, and against every respective year are expressed the increase of 1 <hi>l.</hi> being put out at 5 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Compound Interest.</p>
                     <p>In the third Collume, under the number 6 is expressed the yearly increase of 1 <hi>l.</hi> being put out at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Compound Int.

                     <p>All which numbers in the said Table are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyars, for the producing of the amount or Increase of any other Sum being put out at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound interest, at any rate of Interest, and for any number of years therein expressed, as will appear by the following Examples.</p>

                     <p>I demand the full amount of 365 <hi>l.</hi> being put

                     </p>
                     <p>Here because the sum proposed is put out at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and for 9 years, <hi>I</hi> look in the Collume of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which is the third Collum of the Table under the figure 6, and just against 9 in the Collum of years, <hi>I</hi> find 1.68947 which is the increase of 1 <hi>l.</hi> being forborne the same time, and at the same Rate of Interest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the Rule of 3 <hi>I</hi> say</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that by the work <hi>I</hi> find that if the sum of 365 <hi>l.</hi> be all forborne to the end of 9 years, and interest be computed for the same at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum</hi> Compound Interest, it will then be increased to 616.65655 which is 616 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 1 ½<hi>d.</hi>

First, turn the 16 <hi>s.</hi>−8 <hi>d.</hi> into the Decimal of a pound by the 2d Rule of the 2d Chapter fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, and you will find it to be .8333, so that the given sum is 128.8333, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to answer the Question, <hi>I</hi> look into the foregoing Table, and in the Collum of 7 <hi>per Cent:</hi> and just against 15 years I find 2.75903 which is the uttermost increase of 1 <hi>l.</hi> for 15 years at 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Compound Interest, by which if you multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the given sum, the Product will be the answer to the Question, as by the following work will plainly appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="math">

                     </p>
                     <p>By the foregoing work the answer is found to be 355.4549, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>=355 <hi>l.</hi>−09 <hi>s.</hi>−01 <hi>d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if any sum be put out at Compound Int. for moneths, or dayes over and above the given number of years, then the work will be somewhat different from the former; for first you must find out the amount of the given sum, for the given number of years, and then by the 8th Rule of the foregoing Chapter find out the Interest of that amount for the odd time, being either moneths or dayes under a year, and that Int. being added to the foresaid amount, that sum
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51833:97"/>
will be the answer to the Question; This is so obvious that it needeth no Example.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. When a sum of Money due at the end of any number of years to come is to be satisfied with present mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <note place="margin">Of Rebate or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at Compound Interest.</note> allowing Rebate at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Interest, there must be found a Rank or series of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual proportionals, more in number by one than the number of years for which the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is proposed, of which rank or series of proportionals, the sum to be satisfied by present payment must be the first, and the second must decrease from that after the same rate or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as 100 decreaseth from the sum of 100 added to its interest for one year, after the Rate of interest propounded; that is to say, as 100 proceedeth from 106, or 108 if the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest be 6 or 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and after the same Rate, or Reason must the third decrease from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the fourth from third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a Question is stated for the Rebate of Money at Compound Interest, it is solvable by as many single Rules of 3, as the number of years for which the sum proposed is to be Reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and it is nothing else but the inverse of the third Rule of this Chapter, as may be proved by the working of the following Question, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the said Rule, where it is proved that 350 <hi>l.</hi> being forborne in the Debtors hands for 5 years at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Compound Interest, it will then be increased to 468.3800121<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>; now let the said Question be inverted thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a sum of Money, <hi>viz.</hi> 468.38001216 due at the end of 5 years to come, now I demand
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51833:97"/>
how much present Money will satisfie the said Debt, Rebate being allowed after the Rate of 6 <hi>per Cent. per annum,</hi> Compound Interest?</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>I</hi> say, as 106 is to 100, so is the sum due at the end of 5 years, <hi>viz.</hi> 468.38001216, to 441.867936, which is the sum due at the fourth years end, and so is the sum due at the fourth years end, to the sum due at the third years end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by the work appeareth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="math">

                     </p>
                     <p>So that by the foregoing work you see that if 468.38001216 <hi>l.</hi> be due at the end of 5 years to come, and is to be satisfied by the payment of present money, Rebate being allowed at 6 <hi>per Cent. per annum,</hi> Compound Interest, 350 <hi>l.</hi> is the sum required.</p>

if you will find out the present worth of a sum by the First Table, you must then make those Tabular Numbers Divisors; The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof is plain, for the First Table shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the increase of <hi>1l.</hi> for 30 years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they may likewise serve to shew what sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney due at the end of any number of years to come under 31 (allowing Rebate according to the rates of Interest therein mentioned) <hi>1l.</hi> present money will satisfie. Now to Resolve Questions in Rebate by this Table, look in the Collum of the proposed Interest, or Rebate, and against the proposed number of years is the Tabular number for your work, which must be according to the following proportion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Tabular Number so found,</p>

                     <p>To make this a little more plain, I shall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the first Question in the Use of the second Table, by the help of the first Table only, which is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>The solving of Questions concerning Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at Compound Interest, will not be any thing different in their operation, from the manner of solving a Question concerning a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle sum of money put out for years at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Interest, by the third Rule before-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                     <p>And upon this Rule is grounded the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the following Table, which sheweth what 1 <hi>l.</hi> annuity (being forborne to the end of any number of years to come, not exceeding 30) will be increased to Compound Interest, being computed after any of the Rates mentioned at the head of the Table.</p>
                     <p>But considering that as an Annuity increaseth yearly at Compound Interest, the sum due at each years end, is the sum of a series of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual proportionals equal in number to the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payments, and that the first number is the annual payment its self, therefore may a Table to shew the Annual increase of 1 <hi>l.</hi> Annuity with great ease be made from the First Table, shewing the yearly increase of 1 <hi>l.</hi> at Compound Interest, as will plainly appear by what followeth.</p>
                     <p>Let us pitch upon making the Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> in the third Table? Look in the first Table, and you will find the Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to have for its first number 1.06, and the second number 1.12360 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to make the Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the third Table pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus, for the first number in the said third Table put 1, or 1.00000, and for the second number in the third Table, take the sum of the first number in the Third Table (which is 1.00000,) and the first number in the first Table (which is 1.06) and that makes 2.06 for
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51833:105"/>
the said second number; then add the second number in the Third Table, to the second in the first, and their sum is the third number in the third Table; then add the said third number to the third number in the first Table, and their sum is the fourth number in the third Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after this manner proceed till you have made all the numbers in the said Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> And after the same method are the rest of the Collums made, (the first number in each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1. or 1.00000) <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here note, that the numbers in the said first Table ought to be continued to more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than are there expressed, to prevent the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that else may be found in the third Table, by adding of defective Decimals. The use of the said Table is shewn immediately after the same.</p>

                     <p>There is an Annuity of <hi>34l.−8s.</hi> payable by yearly payments, forborne unto the end of Twelve years; Now, I demand how much is due at the end of the said Term, Compound Interest being allowed at 6 <hi>per Cent. per Annum?</hi> Facit <hi>580l.−6s.−6d.</hi> and somewhat more as will appear by the following operation.</p>
                     <p>The increase of the said Annuity being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> I look in the Collum which hath the number 6 placed at the head of it, and against the number 12 in the Collum of years I find the number 16.86994 which sheweth that if <hi>1l.</hi> Annuity be forborne to the end of 12 years, and there be allowed Compound Interest at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> it will then be increased to <hi>16.86994=16l.−17s.−04½d.</hi> therefore I say by the Rule of Proportion.</p>

Facit 402.424=40 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 05 ¾ <hi>d.</hi> which is thus found out by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Table, <hi>viz.</hi> look in the said Table, in the Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and against 12 in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum of years, you have this number, <hi>viz.</hi> 8.38384 which is the present worth of 1 <hi>l.</hi> Annuity to continue twelve years, Rebate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore by the Rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, I say,</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that I find the answer to be 402.42432, which is found by multiplying the said Tabular number by 48, as you see by the work.</p>
                     <p>Otherwise find a principal which may bear such proportion to the given Annuity (that is to be Rebated) as 100 beareth to the Rate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest allowed in the Rebate. Then find the present worth of this principal so found, by the Directions given in the use of the second Table of this Chapter, then subtract the said present worth from the principal found as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the remainder will be the present worth of the given Annuity, Rebate being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as proposed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the present worth of an Annuity of 50 <hi>l.</hi> to continue 3 years, allowing Rebate at 8 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Compound Interest?</p>
                     <p>First, I find a principal that shall be to the given number 50 as 100 is to 8 which I find to be 625 <hi>l.</hi> by the following proportion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="math">

                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:51833:112"/>
Then by the second Table I find the present worth of 625 <hi>l.</hi> which is 496.145 <hi>l.</hi> which I subtract from the said principal 625 <hi>l.</hi> and there remaineth 128.855 <hi>l.=128 l.−17 s.−1¼d. fere.</hi> which is the present worth of 50 <hi>l. per annum</hi> to continue 3 years, Rebate being allowed at 8 <hi>per Cent. per annum,</hi> Compound Interest.</p>
                     <p>Moreover by the numbers in the foregoing fourth Table, you may at first sight discover how many years purchase any Lease to continue any number of years, not exceeding 30, is worth in ready money, Compound Int. being Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on both sides at any of the Rates mentioned at the head of the Table.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose there were a Lease issuing out of Lands to continue 16 years to be sold for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy money, allowing Rebate at 8 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> Compound Interest, I demand how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years purchase the said Lease is worth?</p>
                     <p>Look in the Table 4, in the Collum of 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and against 16 years you will find 8.85136 which sheweth that it is worth 8.85136 years purchase which is somewhat above 8 years, and 3 Quarters; But if the said Lease had been of Houses, and 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> were thought a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient allowance for the same, then you will find it to be worth 7.82371 years purchase which is 7 years, and above 3 quarters purchase.</p>

                     <p>As the present worth of the supposed Annuity,</p>
                     <p>Is to the said Annuity,</p>
                     <p>So is the sum propounded,</p>
                     <p>To the Annuity required.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, Suppose an Annuity at pleasure, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for 4 years, as suppose 150 <hi>l.</hi> then do <hi>I</hi> find by the eighth Rule of this Chapter the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent worth of the said Annuity to be 519.76584 <hi>l.</hi> therefore by the Rule of proportion <hi>I</hi> say</p>

                     <head>The Construction of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing TABLE V.</head>
                     <p>Upon the Reason of the foregoing Rule is grounded the Calculation of the following Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the purchasing of Annuities; and it may somewhat more readily be calculated thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is evident by the construction of the first Table of this Chapter, that 1 <hi>l.</hi> present is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to 1.06 <hi>l.</hi> due at the end of a year to come; therefore is 1.06 the first number in the Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of the following Table; because 1 <hi>l.</hi> will purchase 1.06 <hi>l.</hi> Then it is also evident by the fourth Table that the present worth of 1 <hi>l. Annuity</hi> to continue two years at the same rate is 1.83339, &amp;c. that is, 1.83339, &amp;c. will purchase a Lease of 1 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to continue two years, Compound Interest, being allowed at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> therefore by the Rule of 3 Direct, <hi>I</hi> say,</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>By which I find that 1 <hi>l.</hi> ready money will buy a Lease of .54543 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to continue 2 years, therefore it is the second number in the following Table. Likewise by the fourth Table <hi>I</hi> find that 2.67301 is the present worth of 1 <hi>l.</hi> Annuity to continue 3 years at the same rate of Interest, wherefore by the Rule of proportion <hi>I</hi> say,</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="math">

Whereby I find that 1 <hi>l.</hi> will purchase an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of .37411, to continue 3 years. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Interest being allowed at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore .37411 is the third number in the said Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Whereby it is evident that if you divide 1, or Unite by the several numbers in the said Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the fourth Table, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, the several Quotients will give you the numbers successively, for the Collum of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the fifth Table; And after the same manner are all the numbers in the other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums of the said fifth Table found out (except the first number of each Collum, which must be the same with the first numbers in each Collum of the first Table) <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is absolutely necessary that the numbers in the said fourth Table, be continued to more places than are there expressed, to prevent the errors that otherwise will arise, by dividing by defective Decimals.</p>

an Estate being to come into his hands at the end of 10 years; <hi>B</hi> is willing to forbear it all till then, and to be allowed Compound Interest at 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for his forbearance; <hi>I</hi> demand how much will be due to <hi>B</hi> at the 10 years end?</p>
                     <p>This Question is solved by help of the third and first Tables; for first 100 <hi>l.</hi> is to be paid in the nature of Annuity for 6 years; therefore by the third Table <hi>I</hi> find the amount of an Annuity of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to continue 6 years at 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which is 733.592 <hi>l.</hi> and will be due at the expiration of 6 years, and then is that sum to be forborne to the end of 10 years, which is 4 years after the 6 years; which being a single sum, its amount is found by the first Table to be 998.037 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> which is the Answer to the Question.</p>

A Gentleman hath 1000 <hi>l.</hi> which he would lay out to purchase an Annuity of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid by yearly payments; Now the Question is, how many years must the said An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity continue, Compound Interest being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both sides at 8 <hi>per Cent. per Annum?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, Divide 1000 by 100, and the Quotient will be 10, which sheweth that the Buyer giveth 10 years purchase for the said Annuity.</p>
                     <p>Then in the Fourth Table, and in the Collum of 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> look for the number 10, which cannot be exactly found, but the nearest to it and less than it, is 9.81814 which is placed against
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51833:118"/>
20 years, and the nearest to it greater than it is, is 10.01681, therefore I conclude that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity must continue above 20 years, but not 21 years, and to find out how much it must continue more than 20 years, I work thus, <hi>viz.</hi> First, <hi>I</hi> find the Difference between the said Tabular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers 10.01681 and 9.81814, which is .19867. Then I find the difference between the lesser of the said Tabular Numbers, <hi>viz.</hi> 9.81814 and 10, the Number that I would find in the Table, which is .18186, then by the Rule of proportion I say</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Which is as much as to say, as the greater Difference .19867 is to one year, so is the lesser Difference to .9153 parts of a year, which is 47 weeks, and 5 dayes, therefore the number of years sought in the Question is 20 years, 47 weeks, and 5 dayes.</p>

                     <p>To Answer this, First, <hi>I</hi> divide 960 by 100, and the Quotient is 9.6 which sheweth how many years purchase it was worth; Then because the Lease was to continue 18 years, I look in the fourth Table in the Collum of years for 18, and carry my eye exactly in the line against it, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the said Quotient 9.6 which I cannot find exactly, but the next (lesser) number to it, is, 9.37188 in the Collum of 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and the next (bigger) number to it is 10.05908, in the Collum of 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> wherefore I conclude that the Rate of Interest implyed is between 7 and 8
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51833:118"/>
                        <hi>per Cent.</hi> and to know how much it is more than 7, <hi>I</hi> do thus, Take the Difference between the two said Tabular numbers which you will find to be 68720 also subtract (9.6) the said Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, from 10.05908 (the greater Tabular number, and the remainder is .45908, Then by the Rule of Proportion, <hi>I</hi> say,</p>

                     <p>That is to say, As the Difference between the two Tabular numbers is to the lesser Remainder, so is 1 <hi>l.</hi> the Difference between 7 and 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to .668 the proportional part to be added to 7 <hi>l.</hi> which is 13 <hi>s.−04<gap reason="math">

                     <p>This Question is to be solved by the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, thus <hi>viz.</hi> Take any two Numbers in the Collum of years, which together will make up 40, and then take the Tabular numbers in the

Collum of 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which stand against those two numbers, and multiply them together, and then multiply that product by 80 <hi>l.</hi> the given sum, and the last product will be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                     <p>As suppose you take 30 and 10, or 21 and 19, or 31 and 9, or 25 and 15 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we will pitch upon 30 and 10, and the Tabular number against 30 in the Collum of 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is 4.32194, and against 10 is 1.62889 which two numbers being multiplyed, produce 7.03996, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the amount of 1 <hi>l.</hi> for 40 years at 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> then <hi>I</hi> multiply 7.03996, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by 80 <hi>l.</hi> and the product is 563.197 <hi>l. &amp;c. = 563 l.−03 s.−11½ d. fere.</hi>

                     <p>The Answer would have been the same, if we had pitched upon any other two numbers to have made up 40.

                  <head>The meaning of such Characters as are used in the Ensuing Treatise.</head>
                  <p>+ IS the sign of Addition, and is as much as to say <hi>plus,</hi> signifying that the Numbers or Quantities between which it is placed, are to be added together as 4+7 signifyeth that 4 and 7 are to be added together.</p>
                  <p>− Is the sign of subtraction, and as much as to say <hi>minus,</hi> signifying that the Number which followeth it is to be Subtracted out of the Number which precedeth it, as 8−5 signifieth that 5 is to be Subtracted from 8.</p>
                  <p>× Is the sign of Multiplication, and signifyeth that the Numbers between which it is placed, are to be Multiplyed together, as 6×8 signifieth that 6 and 8 are to be Multiplyed together.</p>
                  <p>= Is a sign of Equality, and signifieth that the Numbers or Magnitudes between which it is placed, are equal as 3+6=7+2 signifyeth that 3 and 6 are equal to 7 and 2: Likewise 18−6=4+8=12 and 4×7=28 &amp;c.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51833:123"/>
the Respective number against which it is placed. So in the Collume B. the number 4, is the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of 16 in the Collume A, and in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume C the number 10 is the Logarithme of 16 in the Collume A, and in the Collume D, 29 is the Logarithme of 256 in the Collum A, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Numbers in the said Collums B, C, D, E, are Logarithmes of the Respective Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Collum A, so they may be Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmes of any other Rank, or series of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Geometrical proportion.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. If four numbers are Arithmetical proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onals, either Continued, or Discontinued, the sum of the meanes, is equal to the sum of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames.</p>
                  <p>Let us choose 8, 10, 12, 14, in the Collume C. I say that the sum of the Extreames, 8 and 14, are equal to the sum of the two means, 10, and 12. For, 8 + 14=10 + 12=22. Or if they are discontinued as, 10, 12, 22, 24, in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum C; for 10 + 24 = 12 + 22=34. The like of any other, this being a peculiar property of all Numbers that are Arithmetically propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. If four Numbers are in Geometrical proportion, either continued, or discontinued, the product arising from the Multiplication of the two extreams, is equal to the product of the two means.</p>
                  <p>So 4, 8, 16, 32, in the Collum of A are Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical proportionals continued, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Extreams 4 and 32, is equal to the product of the means, 8, and 16, for, 4 × 32 = 8 × 16 = 128.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:51833:123"/>
Also, 4, 8, 64, 128 are Geometrical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals discontinued, and the product of 4 and 128, the extreams, is equal to the product of 8 and 64 the two means, for 4×128 = 8 × 64 = 512.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that what Geometrical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals performe by Multiplication, the same will the Logarithmes (being Arithmetical proportionals) performe by Addition.</p>
                  <p>Let there be given four Geometrical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals in the Collum A, <hi>viz.</hi> 8, 16, 128, and 256, and let their Logarithmes be 8, 10, 16, and 18 in the Collum C; I say, that as 8 × 256, the product of the extreams is equal to 16 × 128 the product of the means, so is 8 + 18 the sum of the Logarithmes of the extreams is equal to 10 + 16 the sum of the Logarithmes of the means. Therefore,</p>
                  <p>If 3 Numbers are given to find a fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional, it may be found by Addition and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of their Logarithmes, (for, as in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Numbers if you multiply the second and third together, and divide their product by the first, the Quote will be the fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional number so) if you add the Logarithmes of the second and third together, and from their sum subtract the Logarithms of the first, the remainder will be the logarithme of the fourth proportional number.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let there be given 2, 16. and 64, and let it be required to find a fourth proportional num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereto, which is 512.</p>

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:51833:124"/>
The Logarithmes of the given numbers are 3, 12, and 18, Now if you add 12 and 18 toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which are the Logarithmes of the second and third) their sum is 30, (which is the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of 1024, the product of the second and third) and if from 30 the said sum of the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmes, you substract, 3, (the logarithme of the first) there will remain 27, which is the loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of the 512 the fourth proportional num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber sought for.</p>

III. Any number whatsoever being given, how to make the Logarithme thereof.</p>
                  <p>When it is required to make the Logarithme of any number, extract so many continual means between the given number and 1, until the mean which cometh nearest 1, may be a mixt number less than 2, and so near 1, that it may have 7 Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers placed before the significant Figures of its Numerator, which being done, you may easily find out the Logarithme of that continual mean, by help of the foregoing Table; and then by dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and redoubling the logarithme of the said continual mean, as many times as you found continual means by extraction, so shall you at last have the logarithme of the given number.</p>
                  <p>You may make the Logarithme of any number whatsoever by this and the last Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us pitch upon the number 2, and make its Logarithme.</p>
                  <p>To do which, annex to the number 2 a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Cyphers, <hi>viz.</hi> 28, and extract the Square Root thereof, which you will find to be 1.41421356237<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>09 for the first continual mean, to which said mean annex 14 Cyphers more, and extract the Square Root thereof, and so proceed, by annexing of Cyphers and extracting of Roots, till the nearest mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional number to 1, may have seven Cyphers placed before the significant Figures of its Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, which after 23 several Extractions you
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51833:127"/>
will find to be 1.00000008262958.</p>
                  <p>Then to find out the logarithme of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual mean, say by the Rule of 3 Direct.</p>
                  <p>As the significant Figures of the Twenty fifth mean proportional in the foregoing Table, <hi>viz.</hi> 6862238.</p>
                  <p>Is to its respective Logarithme, 29802322.</p>
                  <p>So are the significant Figures of the last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual mean found between 1 and 2, <hi>viz.</hi> 8262958.</p>
                  <p>To its Respective Logarithme 35885571.</p>
                  <p>Now if you prefix before the Logarithme last found 8 Cyphers, it will be 0000000035885571, which being doubled and redoubled 23 times, (because there were 23 continual means found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1 and two) there will at last be produced 0.30102998797568, which is the logarithme of the number 2, which was Required, but because we intend the Table of logarithmes to consist but of 7 places, and because 2 nines follow the sixth place therefore make the figure 2 to be 3 and so shall the logarithme of 2 be 0.301030 cancelling the following Figures as superfluous.</p>
                  <p>The Logarithme of 2 being found, you may easily find the logarithmes of 4, 5, 8, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Artificial Multiplication and Division, which is by adding and subtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of logarithmes; for if you take the loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of 2 out of the logarithme of 10, there will remain the logarithme of 5 and the loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of 2 Doubled gives you the logarithme of 4, then add the logarithme of 4 to the logarithme of 2, and you have the logarithme of 8, and to the logarithme of 8 add the logarithme of 2, and it gives you the logarithme of 16, and the loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of 5 added to the logarithme of 4, gives he logarimthe of 20, and the logarithme of 5
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51833:127"/>
doubled, gives the Logarithme of 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place you are to get the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmes of 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="1">1. BY the third Section of the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book it is evident, that if you add the Logarithmes of two numbers together, the Sum will be the Logarithme of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51833:133"/>
And by the first and fourth Sections of the 9th Chapter of my Decimal Arithmetick, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that any number multiplyed by it self, produceth its Square, wherefore if you double (or multiply by 2) the logarithme of any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it will produce the logarithme of its Square, which if duly considered you will find that to Square, Cube, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any number, is nothing else but to multiply the Logarithme of the given number by the Index of the Power you would raise it to, <hi>viz.</hi> If you would find the Square of any number, multiply the logarithme thereof by 2, so shall the product thereof be the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of its Square; and if you would find the Cube of any number, multiply its logarithme by 3, and the product thereof will be the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of its Cube; and if you would find the Biquadrate of any number, multiply its Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme by 4, and it will produce the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme of its Biquadrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Example.</p>
                  <p>Let it be required to find the Square of 12</p>

                  <p>Which being multiplyed by 2, produceth 3.9462556, which is the logarithme of 8836, which is the Square of 94.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But if the characteristick of the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme be negative, that is, if the given num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whose Square, Cube, Biquadrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you would find be a Decimal Fraction, observe, that in multiplying the next figure to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristick the ten, or tens to be borne in mind are affirmative, and are to be deducted out of the Product of the negative characteristicks.</p>

                  <head>ALGEBRAICAL DEFINITIONS</head>
                  <head>CHAP. I. Concerning the construction of Cossick Powers, and the way of expressing them by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, together with the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of all such Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters or Marks as are used in the ensuing Treatise.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE Analytical Art generally called Algebra, is that by which, when a Problem, or hard Question is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, we assume the Quantity
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51833:151"/>
or Number sought, as if it were really known; and, with this assumed Quantity, and the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or Quantities given, we proceed by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Consequences, until the Quantity first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed is found to be equal to some quantity or quantities really known, and is therefore it self also known.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Algebra is either Numeral, or Literal.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Numeral Algebra is so called, because all the given Quantities in any Question are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Natural Numbers, and the number or quantity sought is solely represented by some Letter or Character taken at the pleasure of the Artist.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Literal Algebra is so called, because when a question is resolved after this method, the known or given quantities as well as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, are all expressed by Letters of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, or some other Convenient Marks or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and this is also called Specious Algebra; and when a question is resolved after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at the end of the operation, there is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Canon, directing how the question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; or any other of the like nature may be solved, and therefore is Literal Algebra, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more excellent than Numeral Algebra, for that produceth not a Canon without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary difficulty, because the numbers first given are by Arithmetical operations so interwoven and confounded, that it may seem a task too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the most ingenious Artist to trace out their footsteps.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:51833:151"/>
V. The Doctrine of Algebra consists in the knowledge of certain quantities called Cossick Powers, which we shall immediately explain.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. In a series, or rank of Geometrical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals continued, proceeding from Unity, or one, whether they be ascending, or descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all the Numbers or Terms except the first (which is supposed to be unity) are called Cossick Numbers, or Powers, as for Example, in this Rank of continual proportionals, <hi>viz. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, &amp;c.</hi> the second Term (2) is called the Root or first Power, the third term (4) is called the Square or second power, the fourth term (8) is called the Cube, or third Power; the fifth (16) is called the Biquadrate, or fourth Power; 32 is the fifth Power, 64 is the sixth Power, 128 is the seventh Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner if you take a Rank of Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proportionals continued, and descending from unity, <hi>viz. 1, ½, ¼, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, &amp;c.</hi> or 1, 1/3, 1/9, 1/27, 1/81, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or 1, ¼, 1/16, 1/64, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The second term is called the Root or first Power, the third term is called the second power, the fourth term is called the third Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Whence it is evident that the Square or Second Power is generated by the Multiplication of the Root or first Power into it self, and the Cube or third power is generated by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the second Power by the Root, or by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying the Root 3 times into it self, and the Biquadrate or fourth power is produced by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of the third power by the Root, or by multiplying the Root 4 times into it self, and the fifth Power is produced by multiplying the fourth Power by the Root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:51833:152"/>
If you take 2 for a Root, and multiply it by its self, it produceth 4 for the Square or second power of the Root 2: Again, multiply 4 by the Root 2, and it produceth 8 for the third Power, or Cube of the Root 2: Again, if you multiply the Cube 8 by the Root 2, it produceth the fourth Power, or Biquadrate of the Root 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner if 3 were proposed for a Root, it being multiplyed by it self, produceth 9 for the Square, or Second Power of 3, and 9 being multiplyed by the Root 3, produceth 27 for the Cube, or third Power of the Root 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And also if ½ be proposed for a Root, and it be multiplyed by it self, it produceth ¼ for the Square or second power of (the Root) ¼, and ¼ (the Square) being multiplyed by (the Root) ½, it produceth 1/8 for the Cube, or third Power of (the Root) ½ <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence it is evident that the 4, 6 or 7 powers of any Roots may be found out, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect at all had to the intermediate Powers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Root and the power required; as suppose there were given the Root 3, and it were required to find the fifth power of it. I take 3, and set it down 5 times in order thus, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, and multiply them all into each other, according to the rule of continual mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, and the last product (which is 243) is the fifth power of the Root 3, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>Again, let it be required to find the fourth power of 5, I take 5, and set it down 4 times thus, 5, 5, 5, 5, then do I multiply them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and find the last product to be 625,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51833:152"/>
which is the fourth power (of the given Root) as was required. The like may be observed in the finding of any other power of any other given Root.</p>
                  <p n="7">VIII. If there be a series of Geometrical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals continued, and against each power there be placed numbers orderly representing the number or degree of distance of each power from the Root, such numbers are called the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices or exponents of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, because they shew how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten  the Root is involved into it self for the production of such a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as in the Rank, or Scale of Algebraical powers placed in the margent, proceeding from the root 2, to the tenth power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is 1024, under which is written the word powers, and then against each particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, on the left hand thereof, is expressed Index, or Exponent of that Power, shewing how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Root is involved or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed into it self to produce that Power: As for Example, against the number 64, is placed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 6, which sheweth that 64 is the sixth power of its Root, or that its Root is multiplyed 6 times into it self to produce the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 64. The like is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of any other.<table>

                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise if any two or more Indices, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51833:153"/>
be added together, their sum will be an exponent shewing what power will be produced by the multiplication of those Powers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those Exponents or Indices which you add together; As in the foregoing Table let it be required to find out what power of the Root 2 will be produced by multiplying 128 (its seventh power) by 8 (its third power,) in order to which I take 3 and 7, the respective Indices of the given powers, and add them together, and their sum is 10, which sheweth that the third power, and the seventh power of any Number, or Root, being multiplyed together, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the tenth power of that Root; so in our example 128 being multiplyed by 8, produceth 1024, which is the tenth power of the Root 2.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, the Indices 3 and 5 being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together, make 8 for a new Exponent, which sheweth that 32 and 8 (the powers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to those Exponents) being multiplyed together, will produce the eighth power, <hi>viz.</hi> 256, as appears by the said Table, the like of any other.</p>
                  <p>So that you see that the addition of Indices answers to the multiplication of their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent powers.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner will the subtraction of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, or Exponents, answer to the Division of their correspondent powers, observing always to make the power corresponding the subtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend (or Index to be subtracted) to be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:51833:153"/>
IX. When a Question is propounded, and its solution is to be searched out by the Algebraick Art, the number or magnitude sought is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called a Root, and it must be represented or signified by some Character or Symbol, as must be also all the powers proceeding from the said Root according to the tenure of the Question, in order to which there may be taken some let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Alphabet at the pleasure and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Artist, as <hi>a, b, c,</hi> or <hi>d, &amp;c.</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the said Root, but to avoid confusion in the operation, by the commixture of known with unknown Quantities, our Modern Analysts have been accustomed to assume vowels to represent unknown Quantities, and to put Consonants to signifie known or given quantities.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. If for the number or quantity sought there be put or assumed the Vowel <hi>a,</hi> then its Square will be <hi>aa,</hi> that is, <hi>a</hi> being multiplyed by it self, produceth <hi>aa,</hi> that is <hi>a</hi> squared, or the square of <hi>a,</hi> for <hi>a</hi> time <hi>a</hi> is <hi>aa,</hi> and the Cube or third power raised from the Root <hi>a,</hi> is <hi>aaa,</hi> that is, <hi>a</hi> times <hi>aa,</hi> is <hi>aaa,</hi> and the fourth power accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly is <hi>aaaa,</hi> and after the same manner may any higher power of <hi>a</hi> be signified:</p>
                  <p>In like manner if for the quantity or number sought there be assumed, the letter <hi>e,</hi> then shall the Square raised therefrom be <hi>ee,</hi> and the third power <hi>eee,</hi> and the fourth power <hi>eeee,</hi> and the fifth power <hi>eeeee, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also if <hi>b,</hi> or any other Consonant, be put for a given or known Quantity, then its Square will be <hi>bb,</hi> its Cube <hi>bbb,</hi> and its biquadrate <hi>bbbb, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:51833:154"/>
But by some Analysts the powers of <hi>a,</hi> or any other letter, Vowel, or Consonant, are expressed by placing the Index or Exponent of the power in a small Character, just after the Symbol, even with the head thereof, <hi>viz. a, a<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, a<hi rend="sup">3</hi>, a, &amp;c.</hi> signifie the Root <hi>a,</hi> its Square, its Cube, and its Biquadrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may be further exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the following Table.</p>

XI. The numbers made use of in solving of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebraical Questions, are either absolute Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or Numbers prefixt.</p>
                  <p>Absolute numbers are those which are disjunct from any kind of Magnitude or Quantity, either known or (unknown) required, but stand simply of themselves, without having Relation to any thing else, as 5, 10, 20, 100, ¾, and ½ are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led absolute Numbers.</p>
                  <p>Numbers prefixt are such as are immediately prefixed to some letter or letters, signifying an Algebraical quantity, either known, or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, such as are <hi>2a, 4a, 10a, 100a,</hi> ½<hi>a,</hi> ¾<hi>a, 3aa, 5bbb, 3a<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, 5b<hi rend="sup">3</hi>;</hi> which numbers so prefixed, shew how often the quantity to which they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, is to be taken, as <hi>4a</hi> signifieth that <hi>a</hi> is to be taken 4 times, and <hi>5bbb,</hi> or <hi>5b<hi rend="sup">3</hi>,</hi> signifieth that the Cube or third power of <hi>b</hi> is to be taken 5 Times, ½<hi>a</hi> is half of <hi>a,</hi> and <hi>2/3b</hi> is two thirds of <hi>b;</hi> The like is to be understood of any other. And,</p>
                  <p>Note, that when you have any Algebraical Quantity, or Letter, or Character, not having any number prefixed to it, then 1, or unity must be imagined to be prefixed, as <hi>a,</hi> or <hi>1a, b,</hi> or <hi>1b, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="12">XII. As in Vulgar and Decimal Arithmetick, so in Algebraical Arithmetick, the operations are performed either by Absolute Numbers, or by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabetical characters, in all the fundamental rules, <hi>viz.</hi> Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the Extraction of Roots: And note that</p>
                  <p>Where it is required to performe the work by absolute numbers, that the operation is in every respect the same as in Common Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51833:155"/>
But where it is performed by Alphabeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Letters, there is an absolute necessity of using some Characters, to signifie the Operation, an explanation of which Characters take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. This Character (+) is a sign of affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or Addition, when it is placed between two quantities, signifying that the 2 numbers or quantities between which it is placed, are to be added together, and is as much as to say <hi>plus,</hi> as 3+6 signifieth the sum of 3 and 6, and is as much as to say 3 <hi>plus</hi> 6, or 3 more 6, which is 9, and 4+7+9 signifieth the sum of 4, 7, and 9, which is 20; so <hi>a+b+c</hi> signifieth the sum of <hi>a, b,</hi> and <hi>c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here note, that when there is no Mark, or Character before any Letter or quantity, then is it Affirmative, and the Mark (+) is supposed to stand before it; as <hi>a,</hi> is <hi>+a,</hi> or <hi>+1a,</hi> and <hi>b</hi> is <hi>+b,</hi> or <hi>+1b,</hi> and <hi>bcd</hi> is <hi>+bcd</hi> the like of others.</p>

                  <p>So−7 is a feigned number less than nothing by 7, <hi>viz.</hi> as the height of the Sun above the Horizon may be affirmed to be 7 <hi>deg.</hi> or +7 <hi>deg.</hi> so when it is depressed 7 degrees below the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, its height may be said to be−7 <hi>deg.</hi> that is, 7 <hi>deg.</hi> less than nothing.</p>
                  <p>But when the said sign or Character is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced between two Numbers or Quantities, it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that the number or quantity which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51833:156"/>
it, is to be subtracted out of some Number or Quantity going before it, as 12−8 signifieth that 8 is to be subtracted out of 12, or it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the excess of 12 above 8, or the Difference between 12 and 8, which is 4, so <hi>a−b</hi> signifieth the excess of <hi>a</hi> above <hi>b,</hi> and it is as much as to say <hi>(a</hi> less <hi>b,)</hi> so <hi>a+b−c</hi> signifieth that <hi>c</hi> is to be subtracted from the sum of <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">XV. This Character (×) is the sign of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and signifieth that the Numbers or Quantities between which it is placed, are to be multiplyed together, as 4×5 signifieth the product of 4 and 5, which is 20; so 3×5×8 signifieth the product of the continual multiplication of 3, 5, and 8, <hi>viz.</hi> 120.</p>
                  <p>Likewise <hi>b×c</hi> signifieth the product of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of <hi>b</hi> by <hi>c,</hi> and <hi>b×c×d</hi> signifieth the product made by the continual multiplication of <hi>b, c,</hi> and <hi>d,</hi> into each other.</p>
                  <p>But for the most part Analysts signifie the multiplication of literal Quantities by setting the letters together like letters in a word, as <hi>ab</hi> is the same with <hi>a×b,</hi> and <hi>abc</hi> is the same with <hi>a×b×c</hi> and this indeed is to be preferred before the other as most convenient and fittest for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. IN Multiplication of Algebraical Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there are always two quantities gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to find out a third.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The two quantities given are called the Factors, and the third quantity invented, or found by the said Factors, is called the Product, Fact, or Rectangle.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. When the given Factors are single quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities alike, or unlike, if they have not natural numbers prefixed to them, the fact is discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at first sight, and is performed by joyning both the quantities together in one, without any Character between them, like letters in a word.</p>
                  <p>But special regard must be had to the signs of the given quantities, in all kinds of Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

whether by Simple or Compound Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. and whether with, or without numbers prefixed to them; the nature of the product wholly depending thereupon, <hi>viz.</hi> If the signs of the quantities to be multiplyed together be alike, that is, both + or both −, then the sign of the product or fact will be +, but if they be of different kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the one +, and the other −, then the sign of the product will be −, as you will find by the several Examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here because both the Factors are signed with +, therefore the sign of the product is +.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, if the given Factors had been <hi>−a</hi> and <hi>−b</hi> the product would have been <hi>(ab</hi> or <hi>ba)</hi> the same as before, because the signs of the Factors are both alike, <hi>viz.</hi> both −.</p>
                  <p>But if the given Factors had been <hi>+a</hi> and <hi>−b,</hi> or <hi>−a</hi> and <hi>+b</hi> then the product or fact would have been <hi>−ba</hi> or <hi>−ab,</hi> because the signs of the Factors are unlike <hi>viz.</hi> the one + and the other −, observe the like in all cases whatsoever.</p>

                  <p>But if the Factors had been <hi>−abc</hi> by <hi>+cd,</hi> or <hi>+abc</hi> by <hi>−cd,</hi> then the Fact would have been <hi>−abccd,</hi> because the signs of the Factors are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. IN Division Algebraical (as in Division in Common Arithmetick) there are two Quantities given to find out a third; which Quantity sought is called the Quote, or Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; and of the Quantities given, that which is to be divided, is called the Dividend, and the Quantity by which it is to be divided, is called the Divisor?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. When it is required to divide one number or quantity by another, if you place the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend for the Numerator, and the Divisor for the Denominator of a Fraction, that Fraction so composed is equal to the Quotient that would
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:51833:170"/>
arise by the real Division of the one by the other.</p>
                  <p>For if it were required to divide 4 by 5, the quotient would be 4/5, or if it were required to divide 12 by 7, the <hi>Quotient</hi> would be <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The reason of which is the ground of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral part of Division in Algebra; for when one quantity is to be divided by another, set the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity that is Dividend for the Numerator of a Fraction, and the quantity that is the Divisor set for the Denominator.</p>
                  <p>So if it were required to divide the quantity <hi>b</hi> by the quantity <hi>a,</hi> I would place them thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which signifieth the Quotient of <hi>b</hi> divided by <hi>a.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner if it were required to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide <hi>abe</hi> by <hi>cd,</hi> the Quotient would be <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And if <hi>5ac</hi> were to be divided by <hi>3cd,</hi> the Quotient would be <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And if <hi>bed</hi> were to be divided by 7, the Quotient would be <gap reason="math">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>The same is to be observed in Division of Compound Algebraick Integers, for if it were required to divide <hi>a+b</hi> by <hi>c,</hi> the Quotient would be <gap reason="math">

                  <p>In the foregoing Example, First, I divide <hi>ba</hi> (the first member of the Dividend) by <hi>a</hi> the first quantity or member of the Divisor, and there ariseth <hi>a</hi> in the <hi>Quotient,</hi> which is <hi>+a,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the signs of the <hi>Dividend</hi> and <hi>Divisor</hi> are +) and thereby I multiply the <hi>Divisor a+d.</hi> and the <hi>Product</hi> is <hi>ba+bd,</hi> which I place under the two first members of the <hi>Dividend</hi> as you see in the work, and subtract it therefrom, and the remainder is 0, to which I bring down the two next quantities, <hi>viz. +ca+cd.</hi>

                  <p>If the quantities or members of the <hi>Dividend</hi> of the foregoing Example are not placed in the same order that is there expressed the, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the operation will be the same, as you may see by the following work.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. How to Extract the Root of a Square formed from a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomial, and how by having any two of the Members of such a Square given to find out the third.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. A Binomial is a quantity consisting of two names or parts, as <hi>a+b,</hi> or <hi>a−b, aa+ee, b+d, &amp;c.</hi> And when a Square is formed from such a Root, it will consist of three mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or parts, <hi>viz.</hi> two Affirmative Squares of the parts of which the Binomial is composed, and the double Rectangle of those parts, which double Rectangle is sometimes affirmative, and sometimes negative, <hi>viz.</hi> Affirmative, when the parts of the Binomial are both affirmative, or both negative, that is, when they are both sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with +, or both with −; and negative, when one of the parts of the Binomial Root is signed with +, and the other with −.</p>
                  <p>So if <hi>a+b</hi> were given for a Root, its Square would be <hi>aa+2ab+bb</hi> which is composed of <hi>(aa</hi> and <hi>bb)</hi> the Squares of the parts of which the Root is composed, and of (<hi>2ab)</hi> the double
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51833:203"/>
Product, or Rectangle made by the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said parts <hi>(a</hi> and <hi>b)</hi> one by the other. See the work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>So if it were required to find the Square of the Binomial <hi>a−b,</hi> or <hi>b−a</hi> it (being multiplyed by it self) would be <hi>aa−2ab+bb,</hi> which is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of <hi>(aa</hi> and <hi>bb)</hi> the sum of the Squares of the parts, and their double Rectangle, as before, but (<hi>2ab)</hi> the Double Rectangle of the parts is signed with −, so that the Squares of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of any two numbers or quantities is equal to the sum of the Squares of the said quantities or numbers made less by their double Rectangle. As by the work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>So if the Number 10 were divided into 8 and 2, <hi>viz.</hi> 8+2, its Square would be 64+32+4 = 10×10=100. And the Square of 8−2 is 64−32+4=6×6=36 for 8−2=6 and 6×6=36.</p>

Note, That a Binomial Root having one of its parts signed with −, is by some Authors cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Residual Root, as <hi>a−b,</hi> and <hi>c−d &amp;c.</hi> are Residuals.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. From what hath been said concerning the Square of a Binomial, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> be inferred this</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theorem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Compound quantity consisting of 3 mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereof two are Squares of different names, with the sign+prefixed to them, and the third is the double Rectangle of the Roots of those Squares, having also the sign+prefixed to it, then shall the Square Root of such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound quantity be the sum of the Square Roots of the said two simple Squares; but if the said double Rectangle hath the sign − prefixed to it, the Square Root of the said Compound quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, shall be the difference of the said Roots.</p>
                  <p>So the Square Root of <hi>aa+2ab+bb</hi> will be found to be <hi>a+b,</hi> for the Square Root of <hi>aa</hi> is <hi>a,</hi> and the Square Root of <hi>bb</hi> is <hi>b,</hi> which two Roots added together, give <hi>a+b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also the Square Root of <hi>aa+8a</hi>+16 will be found to be <hi>a</hi>+4, the 2 Squares in the given quantity are <hi>aa</hi> and 16, and <hi>8a</hi> is the double product of <hi>(a</hi> and 4) the said Roots being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed the one by the other.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the Square Root of <hi>aa−2ab+bb</hi> is <hi>a−b,</hi> or <hi>b−a,</hi> not <hi>a+b,</hi> because the double Rectangle (<hi>2ab)</hi> is signed with −.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore the Square Root of <hi>9aa+12ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>+4bb</hi> is <hi>3a+2b:</hi> The two Square quantities in the said Compound Square are <hi>9aa,</hi> and <hi>4bb,</hi>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:51833:204"/>
whose Roots are <hi>3a</hi> and <hi>2b,</hi> and <hi>12bb</hi> is the double Product of <hi>3a</hi> and <hi>2b</hi> being multiplyed together.</p>
                  <p>And the Square Root of <hi>aa−20a</hi>+100 is <hi>a−10,</hi> for the two Squares in this Compound Square Quantity are <hi>aa</hi> and 100, whose Square Roots are <hi>a</hi> and 10, and <hi>20a</hi> is the double rectangle of 10 and <hi>a</hi> they being multiplyed together.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing Theorem being well understood will be of excellent use in the Resolution of Questions, producing Quadratick Equations, as you will find by the Questions contained in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. When it is required to extract the square Root of a quantity whose Root cannot be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extracted, then prefix the radical sign to it, which shall represent its Square Root. So the Square Root of <hi>bc</hi> is <gap reason="math">

                     </gap>, or <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the Square Root of <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is thus represented, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. From a due consideration of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Theorem, a way is discovered how by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any two of the members of a Square for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from a binomial Root, the third member may be found out. For,</p>
                  <p>When two Affirmative Square Quantities are given for two of the members of a Square for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from a binomial Root, then take the Roots of those two Squares and multiply them the one by the other, and double the Product, so shall that Product doubled be the third member, which being annexed to the two given Squares, either by +, or −, it will make an exact Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Square, whose Root shall be a Binomial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:51833:204"/>
So if <hi>aa+bb</hi> were given for two of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Square, first, I find their Roots to be <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> which being multiplyed the one by the other, produce <hi>ab,</hi> and that Product being doubled gives <hi>2ab,</hi> for the middle Term of the Compound Square Quantity to make it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat square, the Root whereof is a Binomial, <hi>viz. aa+2ab+bb,</hi> if the said double product be joyned to the said sum of the Squares by the sign −, it will give the Compound Square Quantity <hi>aa−2ab+bb</hi> whose Root is <hi>a−b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also if <hi>25aa+16bb</hi> were given for two of the members of a Square, whose Root is a Binomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The said Square being compleated, will be <hi>25aa+40ab+16bb,</hi> or <hi>25aa−40ab+16bb,</hi> whose Root is either <hi>5a+4b,</hi> or <hi>5a−4b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. When the two given members of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Square Quantity, whose Root is a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomial, are the double product or rectangle, and one of the two affirmative squares, divide half the said double product by the Root of the given square, and square the Quotient, so shall that square be the third member sought, which being joyned to the two given Quantities with the sign +, it will give you a compleat square having for its root a Binomial.</p>
                  <p>As for Example. Let <hi>aa+2ba</hi> be proposed for 2 of the members of a square, whose Root is a Binomial: First, I take half of (<hi>2ba)</hi> the said double product and it is <hi>ba,</hi> which being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>(a)</hi> the Root of <hi>(aa)</hi> the given Square, the Quotient is <hi>b,</hi> whose square is <hi>bb</hi> for the third member sought.</p>
                  <p>Again, Let <hi>25aa+40a</hi> be the two proposed terms of such a square, whose Root is a Binomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:51833:205"/>
and let it be required to find the other square which shall make it a compleat square, raised from a Binomial Root; in order to which, first, I take half (<hi>40a)</hi> the double Product, <hi>viz. 20a,</hi> and divide it by the Root of (<hi>25aa)</hi> the given square, which is <hi>5a,</hi> and the Quotient is 4, which being squared, gives 16 for the third member required, which being joyned to the rest, gives <hi>25aa+40a</hi>+16 for the square com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. When the two given members of a square raised from a Binomial Root, are such that one of them is a square affirmative without any Number or Quantity prefixed to it, and the other is the Root of the said square multiplyed by some other Quantity, then is that other Quantity by Artists called the Coefficient, and if you square half the said coefficient, or, (which is all one) take ¼ of the square of the coefficient, that shall be the third member required, which being joyned to the two given quantities by the sign +, it will give you a compleat square raised from a Binomial Root.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> Let the two given members of a square be <hi>aa+2ba,</hi> and let it be required to find out the third member. Here the coefficient is <hi>2b,</hi> half of which is <hi>b,</hi> which being squared, gives <hi>bb</hi> for the third member which was sought, so is the square compleated <hi>aa+2ab+bb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, if the two given members of a square were <hi>aa+ba,</hi> and it were required to find out the third member.</p>
                  <p>Here the coefficient is <hi>b,</hi> half of which is ½<hi>b,</hi> or <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for the member

sought. Also let the two given members of a square be <hi>aa+8a,</hi> and let it be required to find out the third member. Here the coefficient is 8, half of which is 4, whose square is 16, for the third member required, so is <hi>aa+8a</hi>+16, a compleat square, whose Root is <hi>a</hi>+4.</p>
                  <p>Again, if the two given members of a square be <hi>aa−ca,</hi> and the third is required; First, I take half the coefficient <hi>c, viz. ½c,</hi> and then square it, and it gives ¼<hi>cc,</hi> or <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for the member sought, and so is the square compleated <hi>aa−ca+¼cc,</hi> whose Root is <hi>a−½c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, if it were required to make <hi>aa+3ba</hi> a compleat square, take half the coeffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (<hi>3b)</hi> which is <hi>3/2b,</hi> or <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whose square is <hi>9/4bb,</hi> or <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which being joyned to the two gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Terms with the sign +, it gives <hi>aa+3ba+ 9/4bb,</hi> whose Root is <hi>a+3/2b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Rule is to be observed for the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of half the coefficient when it is a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>As for Example. Let the two members of a square raised from a Binomial given be <hi>aa</hi>+ <gap reason="math">

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. Algebraical Questions Resolved by various Positions.</head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Kersey</hi> in the Twelfth Chapter of the second Book of his Elements of Algebra, hath laid down Rules for the solution of Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Algebraically by various Positions; assuming a peculiar letter to represent every one of the Quantities sought, <hi>viz. a</hi> for one unknown Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, <hi>e</hi> for another, and <hi>y</hi> for a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the performance of the work he hath laid down 3 Rules which are as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RULE 1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When many Quantities are sought in a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, let them be represented by various let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and let the tenor of the Question be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by Equations, which done by Transposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion find what any single letter in the first equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is equal to; Then wheresoever that Letter is found in the other equations, instead thereof, take what it is found equal to, so will that letter quite vanish out of the following Equations; Then by Transposition set a second letter alone in one of those equations out of which the first letter was cancelled and poceed as before, so at
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:51833:232"/>
length one of the letters will be made known' by help of which the rest will be easily discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RULE 2.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the same Quantity, (suppose <hi>a)</hi> is found in two several Equations, and equal numbers are prefixed to those Quantities, then if their signs be both + or both −, subtract the lesser Equation from the greater, but if the signs be one +, and the other −, then add those two Equations together, so will the said Quantity <hi>a</hi> quite vanish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RULE 3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the same Quantity, (suppose <hi>a)</hi> is found in two several Equations, but the numbers prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to those equal Quantities are unequal, those two Equations may be reduced to two others which shall have equal numbers prefixed to the said Quantity <hi>a</hi> thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Multiply all the Quantities in the first Equation by the number prefixed to <hi>a</hi> in the second equation; and also mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply all the quantities in the second Equation by the number prefixed to the same quantity <hi>a</hi> in the first Equation, so by such alternate mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication two new equations will be produced, wherein the numbers prefixed to the said quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity <hi>a</hi> will be equal to one another, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the second Rule, and expel the same quantity out of the Rest of the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; proceed in like manner with a second Quantity, until at length some one Quantity, be made known; by which all the rest may be

found out. The three foregoing Rules will be exercised in the Resolution of the following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</p>
