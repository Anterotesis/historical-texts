            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Authors I. Purpose, II. Reasons and
III. Prognosticks of this Book.</head>
            <p>I. IT is none of the business of this Book
to single out any one Party in the
world, &amp; to tell you by Application how far
they are under the guilt of Schism: I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the <hi>Cause,</hi> and leave each person to
make application to himself. It is SIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE
CATHOLICK CHRISTIANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY
which I plead for, and the <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> which are its Ligaments
and Essential parts. And it is a SECT as
a SECT, and a FACTION as a faction,
and not this or that <hi>Sect</hi> or Faction, which I
detect and blame. Yet I doubt not but as
in the same City there are the <hi>wise</hi> and the
<hi>foolish,</hi> the <hi>sound</hi> and the <hi>sick,</hi> and in the
same Army there are <hi>valiant</hi> men, and
Cowards, so in the same Churches there
are Christians of various degrees of <hi>Wisdom,
Integrity</hi> and <hi>strength:</hi> And all men should
earnestly desire to be of the <hi>wisest,</hi> the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest</hi>
and the most <hi>fruitful</hi> sort, and not of
<pb facs="tcp:59262:3"/>
the more <hi>erroneous, impure,</hi> or <hi>scandalous</hi>
and unprofitable. And if the <hi>sick</hi> will make
themselves a <hi>Party,</hi> and call the <hi>sound,</hi> the
<hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>verse Party,</hi> I will endeavour to be one
of a <hi>Party</hi> in that sense; and to <hi>obey</hi> God as
exactly as I am able, and to <hi>worship</hi> him as
<hi>spiritually</hi> and <hi>holily</hi> as I can, and to Love
him with all my <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> and
<hi>Strength,</hi> and lament that I can reach no
higher, and do no more: And if any will
call this by the name of Heresie or Schism,
they shall see that I can avoid Heresie and
Schism at as dear a rate, as enduring the
Name and Imputation of that which I
avoid. It is not the Name of a Schismatick
that I am writing against, but the <hi>Thing,</hi> by
whatever <hi>Name</hi> it is called. It is UNITY,
LOVE and PEACE which I am pleading
for: And it is DIVISIONS, HATRED
and CONTENTION which I plead
against: And it is the <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> of men
which I detect, who betray <hi>Love, Unity</hi> and
<hi>Peace</hi> by a <hi>Iudas</hi> kiss; and will nor, or dare
not openly renounce them, and defie them,
but kill them with dissembling kindness:
who cry them up, while they tread them
down and <hi>follow peace</hi> with all men, that
are not of their <hi>party,</hi> as the Dog followeth
the Hare, to tear it in pieces and destroy
it: Who fight for LOVE by making o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:59262:3"/>
seem <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>unlovely;</hi> By evil sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misings,
proud under valuing the worth of
others, busie and groundless censuring of
men, whose case they know not; aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frailties; stigmatizing the persons, the
actions, the worship and religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of dissenters, with such odious ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
names, and Characters, as their pride
and faction do suggest; And all this to
strengthen the interest of their <hi>side</hi> and
<hi>party,</hi> and to make themselves and their
consenters to seem <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others seem <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>bad:</hi> Though
they thereby proclaim themselves to be so
much the worst, by how much they are
most void of <hi>Love.</hi> They are all for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
but it is only on their narrow factions
terms; They are for <hi>Peace;</hi> but it is not
of the whole <hi>street,</hi> but of <hi>their house</hi> alone;
or not of the whole <hi>City,</hi> but of their <hi>street</hi>
alone; or not of the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but
of their <hi>City</hi> alone. O what a blessed thing
were <hi>peace,</hi> if all would derive it from <hi>their
Wills,</hi> and terminate it in their <hi>interest;</hi> and
they might be the <hi>Center</hi> of <hi>Unity</hi> to the
world! that is, that they might be <hi>Gods</hi> or
<hi>Christs!</hi> such excellent Architects are they
that they can build Christs house by pulling
it in pieces; and such excellent Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
that they will heal Christs body by
<pb facs="tcp:59262:4"/>
separating the members, and can make as
many <hi>Bodies</hi> as there are separated parts.</p>
            <p>2. Nor is it any or much of the business
of this book, to speak to those that I think
are deepliest guilty of the Schisms of the
Christian world: For they are out of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and will not read or regard my writings.
It is the <hi>Roman</hi> Head and Center of Unity
which hath done most to divide the
Church. And it is the contending of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the Supremacy
which hath made the greatest Schisms that
the Christian world hath known: And the
<hi>Regiment</hi> of such Lords must be answerable
to their <hi>Power,</hi> and Greatness; and the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
terms of Christian Unity left us by
Christ and his Apostles, must be turned into
a Religion large as the Decrees of all the
Councels, and (say half of them) and the
Popes Decretals also. And that there may
be no way out of this wilderness, but the
<hi>Confessors present will,</hi> you must not in all
these so much as distinguish <hi>fundamentals</hi>
from the rest; but so much <hi>material belief</hi>
is <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> as each mans oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
and helps obliged him to receive;
that is; The faith which is necessary to
Salvation (materially or objectively) is as
various as the number of persons in the
world; To one more is necessary, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:59262:4"/>
less, to some none at all of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith). And you must suppose that the
Priest is well acquainted with the internal
capacity of every mans Soul, and with all
the instructions, opportunities, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of his whole life, and can tell what
measure of belief he hath, and whether it
be proportionable to his helps; and so can
tell him whether he be capable of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though neither Pope nor Councel
have given any Standard by which to
judge. And though no man can be assured
of his own Salvation; and though another
man could not be saved by the faith that
saveth <hi>him.</hi> So much are we mistaken to
think that it is the Pope that hath the Keys
of Heaven, when it is every Priest, who is
the onely judge of the measures of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
faith. These new made multiplyed
Articles of Religion, these Additions to
Christianity, this proud Church-tyranny,
I doubt not is the great cause of Schism in
the world: And when I have had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to write against it, I have born my
testimony against it, as is yet legible. But
it is not that sort of men that I am here
most to speak to: but to them that profess
to be more teachable and willing to know
the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59262:5"/>
3. And yet I add though this Book be
written principally to save the darker sort of
honest Christians, from the sin and misery
of Church divisions, I write it not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
for them to read; For I know their
prejudice, weakness and incapacity, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned:
But I write it to remember
the Teachers of the Churches, what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
they have to Preach and strengthen,
and what principles to confute and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
if ever they mean to save the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from this state of sin, and the Churches
from the sad effects. And if Ministers neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the faithful discharge of so great and
necessary a duty, let them remember that
they were warned, if they find themselves
overwhelmed in the ruines.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>Reasons</hi> moving me to this work
are these.</p>
            <p>First, It is my calling to help to save
people from their sins; and Church divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is a heap of sins.</p>
            <p>2. The more I love them that I hope are
tender Conscienced, and dare not sin, when
they are convinced of it, the more I am
bound to endeavour their conviction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
who hath said, <hi>Thou shalt not hate
thy Brother in thy heart, thou shalt in any wise
rebuke thy Neighbour, and not suffer sin upon
him.</hi> Lev. 19. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59262:5"/>
3. LOVE is not an appurtenance of my
Religion, but my Religion it self. <hi>God is
Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth
in God, and God in him:</hi> (who can speak a
higher word of any thing in all the world?)
Love is the end of faith, and faith is but the
Bellows to kindle Love: Love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of all the Law; the end of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
the nature and mark of Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
the divine nature; the sum of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Lord; the proper note by which
to know, what is the man, and what his
state, and how far any of his other acts are
acceptable unto God: without which if we
had all knowledge and belief, all gifts of
utterance and highest profession, we were
but as sounding Brass, and as a tinkling
Cymbal. And if all our goods were given
to the poor, and our bodies to the fire, it
would profit nothing. Love is our foretast
of Heaven, and the perfection of it is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it self, even the state and work of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and of Saints in glory. And he that is
angry with me, for calling men to Love, is
angry for calling them to <hi>Holiness</hi> to God
and <hi>Heaven. Holiness</hi> which is against <hi>Love</hi>
is a contradiction: It is a deceitful <hi>Name,</hi>
which Satan putteth upon <hi>unholiness.</hi> All
Church principles which are against Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<hi>Love,</hi> are against <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi>

he loveth God, and hateth his Brother is a

said, <hi>The wisdom from above is first pure, then

               </gap>. 14. No necessity can justifie such
a division: <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to God, are
but two names for one thing. <hi>Love to God</hi>
and to <hi>man,</hi> are like <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> that are
separated no way but by death. <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Peaceableness,</hi> differ but as <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning:</hi>
Love may be without <hi>Passive Peace</hi>
(from others to us,) but never without <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Peace</hi> (from us to others.)</p>
            <p>4. I have had so great opportunity in my
time, to see the working of the mysterie of
iniquity, against Christian Love, and to see
in what manner Christs House and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is edified by divisions, that if I be
ignorant after such sad experience, I must
be utterly unexcusable, and of a seared
Conscience, and a heart that seemeth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
to perdition. God knoweth how
hardly sin is known in its secret root, till
men have tasted the bitterness of the fruit:
<pb facs="tcp:59262:7"/>
Therefore he hath permitted the <hi>two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams</hi>
to shew themselves openly to the
world in the effects: And <hi>one</hi> must be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and hated and avoided, as well as the
<hi>other.</hi> I thought once that all that talk
against <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Sects,</hi> did but vent their
malice against the best Christians, under
those names: But since then I have seen
what Love-killing principles have done!
I have long stood by while Churches have
been divided, and sub-divided; one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the division labouring to make
the other contemptible and odious; and
this called, the <hi>Preaching of truth, and the
purer worshiping of God:</hi> I have seen this
grow up to the height of <hi>Ranters</hi> in horrid
Blasphemies, and then of <hi>Quakers,</hi> in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful
pride and surliness; and into the
way of <hi>Seekers,</hi> that were to seek for a
Ministry, a Church, a Scripture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
a Christ. I have many a time
heard it break out into more horrid revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the best Ministry and Godliest peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than ever I heard from the most
malignant Drunkard: I have lived to see
it put to the Question in that which they
called, the <hi>little Parliament,</hi> whether all
the Ministers of the Parishes of <hi>England</hi>
should be put down at once. When <hi>Love</hi>
was first killed in their own breasts, by these
<pb facs="tcp:59262:8"/>
same principles, which I here detect, I have
seen how confidently the killing of the
King, the Rebellious demolishing of the
Government of the Land, the killing of
many Thousands of their Brethren, the
turnings and overturnings of all kinds of
Rule, even that which they themselves set
up, have been committed, and justified,
and prophanely fathered upon God. These
with much more such fruits of Love-killing
principles, and divisions I have seen. And
I have seen what fierce, censorious, proud,
unchristian tempers they have caused or
signified; In a word, I have long seen that
<hi>envious wisdom</hi> (whatever it pretend) <hi>is not
from above, but is earthly sensual and devilish;</hi>
and that <hi>where envy and strife is</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Religious precedency of wisdom
there is <hi>confusion and every evil work,</hi> Jam. 3.
15, 16. And if after so long, so sad, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
experience, you would have me
still to be tender of the brood of Hell, I
mean these <hi>Love<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>destroying wayes,</hi> and to
shew any countenance to that which really
hath done all this, you would have me as
blind as the <hi>Sod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mites,</hi> and as obdurate as
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
never to learn the will of God, or
to regard either good or evil in the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59262:8"/>
5. The same sins are continued in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance. The same <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
is still keeping open our divisions:
And if after such warnings, as the world
scarce ever had the like, we shall be still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent;
if we shall sin our selves into suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
and sin in our suffering as we did
before, even the very same sin of <hi>Divisions</hi>
which brought us to it; how heinous is
our Crime, and how dreadful the Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
of our greater ruine; And how guilty
are those Ministers of the blood of Souls,
that will not tell men of the sin and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>6. I know that <hi>Dividing Principles</hi> and
<hi>Dispositions,</hi> do tend directly to the ruine
and damnation of those in whom they do
prevail. That which killeth <hi>Love,</hi> killeth
all grace and holiness, and killeth Souls:
That which quencheth Love, quencheth
the Spirit (a thousand fold more then the
restraining of our gifts of utterance doth:)
That which banisheth Love, banisheth
God. That which is against <hi>Love</hi> is against
the design of Christ in our Redemption,
and therefore may well be called Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian:
And if the Roman <hi>Kingdom</hi> (for
so it is rather to be called than <hi>a Church)</hi>
had not such <hi>Moral</hi> marks of Antichristia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
(which Dr. <hi>More</hi> hath notably opened
<pb facs="tcp:59262:9"/>
in his Mysterie of iniquity;) If they were
not the Engineers for the <hi>Division</hi> of the
Christian world; by a false <hi>Center,</hi> and by
impossible terms of Unity, and by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of <hi>tearing dividing impositions;</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them were not found the blood of
the Saints and the Martyrs of Jesus, I
should in charity, fear to suspect them of
Antichristianity, notwithstanding all the
Prophetical passages which seem otherwise
to point them out; because I should still
suspect my understanding of those Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
when the Law of <hi>Loving my neighb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur
as my self,</hi> is plain to all.</p>
            <p>They are dangerously mistaken that
think that Satan hath but one way to mens
damnation. There are as many wayes to
Hell, as there be to the extinguishing of
<hi>Love.</hi> And all tendeth unto this, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
tendeth to hide or deny the <hi>Loveliness,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Goodness,</hi> of them whom I must
Love: much more that which represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them as <hi>odious.</hi> And there are many
pretenses and wayes to make my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
seem unlovely to me: One doth it as
effectually by unjust or unproved accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>ungodliness,</hi> or saying, Their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is Antichristian, formal, ridiculous,
vain; as another doth by unjust and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
accusations of Schism, Disobedience
<pb facs="tcp:59262:9"/>
or Sedition. And they that love Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
may be tempted to cast off their love
of their Neighbours, yea of the truly
Godly, when they once believe that they
are ungodly. And the white Devil is a
Love-killer as well as the black. He is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
mortal an enemy to Love, who back biteth
another, and saith, he is Prophane, or he
is an empty formalist, or he is a lukewarm
temporizing complying manpleaser] as he
that saith [He is a pievish factious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.]
I am sure he was no Malignant, nor
intended to gird at Godliness, nor to grieve
good men, who told us that it is Satans
way to transform himself into an Angel of
Light (that is, one that pretendeth to
make higher motions for Light and for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
strictness, than Christ himself doth;)
and that his Ministers are sent forth by him
as <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Righteousness, 2 Cor.</hi> 11.
14, 15, 16. who will seem more Righteous,
than the Preachers of truth. Satan will
pretend to any sort of strictness, by which
he can but mortifie Love. If you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
any such strictness of opinions, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
in Church orders, or strictness in
worship, as will but help to <hi>kill mens love,</hi>
and set the Churches in divisions, Satan
will be your helper, and will be the strictest
and exactest of you all: He will reprove
<pb facs="tcp:59262:10"/>
Christ as a Sabbath breaker, and as a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous
person, and a Wine-bibber, and a
friend (or Companion) of Publicans and
Sinners, and as an enemy to <hi>Caesar</hi> too.
We are not altogether <hi>ignorant of his wiles,</hi>
as young unexperienced Christians are.

it hath a worse Original than you suspect.
It is one of the greatest reasons which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me hate Romish Church tyranny, and
Religious cruelties against dissenters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as they come from want of Love, so I
am sure that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end to destroy the Love
of those on whom they are inflicted, and to
do more hurt to their Souls than to their
Bodies. The Devil is not so silly an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler
as to fish with the bare Hook; nor such
a Fool as when he would damn men, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
them openly to be damned; nor
when he would kill mens Love, to intreat
them plainly, not to Love but hate their
<pb facs="tcp:59262:10"/>
neighbours: But he doth it by making you
believe that there is just and necessary cause
for it; and that it is your duty, and that
you should be lukewarm in the cause of
God, of truth, of Godliness, if you did
not do it: that so you may go on without
scruple, and do so again, and not repent.
Even they that killed Christs Apostles, did
it as a <hi>duty,</hi> and a part of the service of
God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 2. And <hi>Paul</hi> himself did
once think <hi>verily that he ought to do many
things</hi> which he did, against the <hi>Name</hi> and
Cause and Servants of Jesus, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 9.
And as he did, so he was done by; and as
he measured to others, it was measured to
him again; For they that <hi>bound themselves
in an Oath</hi> to <hi>kill him</hi> did deeply interesse
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> in the cruelty. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, it is Apostacy to fall from Love:
your souls dye, when Love dyeth. The
opinions, the Church Principles, the side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the Practises, which destroy your
<hi>love,</hi> destroy your <hi>graces</hi> and your <hi>souls.</hi>
You <hi>dye</hi> while you have a name to <hi>live,</hi> and
think that you grow apace in Religion.
Therefore better understand the Tempter,
and when backbiters are deriding or vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your neighbours, take it to signifie in
plain English [I pray you love not these
men, but hate them.] And I have told
<pb facs="tcp:59262:11"/>
you in this Treatise, that when one saith
unjustly <hi>[Kill them, banish them]</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saith <hi>[Have no Communion with them]</hi>
it is too often the same inward affection
which both express, but in various wayes:
They are agreed in the assumption, that
their neighbour is <hi>unlovely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when Love is dead, and yet Religion
seemeth to survive and to be increased by
it, it is lamentable to think what a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
scandalous, hypocritical Religion
that will be, and how odious and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to God. To preach without
Love, and to hear without Love, and to
pray without Love, and to communicate
without Love, to any that differ from your
Sect, O what a loathsome Sacrifice is it, to
the God of Love? If we must leave our
guift at the Altar, till we are reconciled to
one offended brother, what a gift is theirs,
who are unreconciled to almost all the
Churches of Christ? or to multitudes of
their Brethren, because they are not of their
way? yea, that make their Communion,
the very badge and means of their uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
and divisions? Sirs, these are not
matters of indifferency, nor to be indulged
by any faithful Pastor of the Church.</p>
            <p>7. And I know that these principles are
as mortal to the <hi>Churches,</hi> as they are to
<pb facs="tcp:59262:11"/>
               <hi>Souls.</hi> And that if ever the Churches have
peace, prosperity or healing, it must be by
the means of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the <hi>principles</hi> which would destory
them. One thinketh that it must be by a
Spanish Inquisition, and by forcing or kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dissenters; And another thinketh
it must be by Excommunicating them all,
and making them odious, and making their
own party seem thereby to be better than
theirs. But I <hi>know</hi> that it must be by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<hi>Love,</hi> or it will never be. I <hi>know it,</hi>
and whoever is angry with me for it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but know it. When the Papists
had murdered so many hundred thousands
of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who would
have thought, but they had done their
work? When the <hi>French</hi> Massacre had
murdered 30000 or 40000, and dispatcht
the Leaders of the <hi>Protestant</hi> party, who
would have thought that they had but
strengthened them? When the Duke
<hi>D' Alva</hi> had done so much to drwon the
Belgick Protestants in blood, he little
thought that he was but fortifying them.
Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Bishops little thought that
their English Bonfires were but to light
men to see the mischief of their cause; and
like the firing of a Beacon to call all the
Land to take them for the Enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb facs="tcp:59262:12"/>
and that the case would have been
so quickly altered. When the Irish had
murdered two hundred thousand, they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thought that they had but excited the
Survivers to a terrible revenge. I will come
no nearer, but you may easily do it your
selves. <hi>If we bite and devour one another,
we shall be devoured one of another,</hi> Gal. 5. 15.
The question is, but who shall be <hi>devoured
first,</hi> and who reserved for the second
course. <hi>If any man have an ear to hear let
him hear: He that leadeth into captivity shall
go into captivity: He that killeth with the
Sword, must be killed with the Sword: Here
is the Patience</hi> and <hi>Faith of the Saints.</hi>
Rev. 13. 9. 10. God Ruleth the world
still when he worketh not miracles! Have
we not seen a proud Victorious Army dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
without a drop of blood? and have
we not seen that God approveth not of
proud self-exaltation, and violating the
Sacred power of our Governours, and
usurping their places of Authority: Hath
not the drunken world had yet experience
enough to teach them, that the Church of
God is not to be built up or repaired, by
their tumultuous quarrellings and frayes.</p>
            <p>How long Lord, must thy Church and
Cause, be in the hands of unexperienced
furious fools, who know not what Holiness
<pb facs="tcp:59262:12"/>
or Healing is, but think that victory over
mens Bodies, must be the cure of their
Souls, and that hurting them is the way to
win their Love! or that a Church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
of <hi>Bodies</hi> alone while <hi>Souls</hi> are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or no parts! who will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Rulers of thy Flock in despite
of thee and of thy Cause and Servants,
without thy call or approbation, and think
that the work of a Soldier, is the work of a
<hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Physician!</hi> whose cures are all
by amputation; and whose piety consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in flying from each other, and esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and using their Brethren as their foes;
who scatter thy flocks on all the mountains,
when Christ hath prayed that they may all
be one!</p>
            <p>Perhaps, Reader, thou art one of them
that thinketh, that the settlement and
happiness of the Church, must be won like
a game at foot-ball; and therefore scruplest
not to toss it in the dirt, and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to strive with and strike up the heels
of all that are against thee, (so that peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
passengers cannot safely come near your
game or pass the streets.) But when you
have got the Ball, have you done the work?
Are you still so ignorant as not to know,
how uncertain still you are to keep it, and
that one spurn can take it from you? And

suppose you could secure all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
are the Churches healed ever the
more? Mens <hi>hearts</hi> must be conquered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this healing work is done. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle saith that <hi>we are more than
Conquerours,</hi> when we are killed all the <hi>day
long</hi> and <hi>accountea</hi> as Sheep to the <hi>slaughter,</hi>
Rom. 8. 34, 35. that is, it is more gain and
honour to our selves, to suffer in faith and
patience by our enemies, than to conquer
them in the field; And it is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
also unto them, and tendeth to a more
desirable conquest of them: Because when
Conquerors do but exasperate them; and
if we hurt their bodies, we harden them the
more against our cause, and against the
means of their own Salvation, our patient
Martyrdom and suffering by them, may
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end at last to open their eyes, and turn
their hearts, and save their souls, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Goodness</hi> and the
<hi>Power</hi> of Christ, and of his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
This is the meaning of being more
than Conquerours. The <hi>Irish</hi> are conquered
by us, but not converted: The <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>English</hi> were conquered by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> but
their <hi>hearts</hi> were not conquered, nor their
Religion changed by him. They that think
that if they could get and keep the upper
ground, and have Dissenters bodies and
<pb facs="tcp:59262:14"/>
estates at their will, they could soon settle
the Church in Unity and Concord, do tell
all the world, how ignorant they are of the
nature of Christianity, and of the fear of
God, and of the <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
of the Church: Either <hi>you</hi> would give
up your <hi>own judgments</hi> and <hi>Consciences,</hi> or
<hi>practice</hi> your selves to the will of men, if
you were in their power, or not. If <hi>you
would not,</hi> why should you think that <hi>others</hi>
will? If you would, you do but tell the
world, that you are Atheists, and have
neither a God, nor Conscience, nor Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But it is not evidence enough of your
folly, to say in your hearts there is no God,
and to fear them that can but kill the body,
more than Him that can punish both body
and soul in hell; but you must also shew
that you know neither God nor Man, by
thinking that all others are Atheists also,
and judging of them by your selves; as if
they set their <hi>Souls</hi> and their everlasting
hopes, at as base a price as you do yours.
I tell you again that a Battel or a Foot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ball
skuffle will not settle, the discomposed and
divided Churches; unless you think that
a heap of Carkasses slain in the field, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
the quietness, and concord which you
desire: The <hi>Soul</hi> is the man, and <hi>Love</hi> is
the Christian Life, and the true Cement of
<pb facs="tcp:59262:15"/>
the Churches unity; And Love must cause
Love, as fire causeth fire; And hurtful
wrath doth most powerfully quench it, and
hath these fifteen hundred years, (but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
these thirteen hundred) been the
wolvish Scatterer of the flocks of Christ:
And must that be now the way to build it,
which hath so long been the way to pull it
down. It is <hi>Love</hi> that must be our Union,
and Love that must cause it, or we shall
never have the Union of a Christian
Church. By this shall all men know that
you are Christs Disciples, if you have Love
one to another. If you believe not this, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to believe in Jesus Christ, who
doth affirm it.</p>
            <p>I confess I am so far guilty of superstition
my self, that if I had been one of the
Changers of our ancient Government, I
should have been somewhat the more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for his <hi>Name sake</hi> to the beheading of
<hi>Christopher Love,</hi> lest it should be an ill
<hi>Omen</hi> both to Church and State, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the <hi>Actors</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>8. Another of the Motives of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is, because I know that times of
most temptation, are times of greatest
danger, and commonly of greatest sin.
And all faithful Pastors must know what
are the special Temptations of the Time
<pb facs="tcp:59262:15"/>
and Place which they live in. When had
we ever greater Temptations to Love-kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
principles and practices than now, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the times of the miserable Wars?
I need not name them to you. The harder
it is for men to Love them that hate them,
that censure them unjustly, that revile
them, and reproach them, and make them
odious, or that hurt them, the more cause
have Ministers and all Christians to set a
double watch upon their Love; Lest before
they are aware, a <hi>flaming</hi> and consuming
zeal, do tell others that <hi>they know not what
manner of Spirit they are of,</hi> Luk. 9. 55.</p>
            <p>9. Yea it is not only a time of great
Temptation to this sin, but of <hi>common guilt:</hi>
They are multitudes that are overtaken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
with this sin. Is not the Land in a
continual <hi>heart war?</hi> Are there not parties
against parties, and cause against cause, and
heart-risings, and passions, and censurings
of Dissenters, to say no worse? And is it
not time to bring water when we see the
flames?</p>
            <p>10. And I perceive <hi>few know</hi> so heinous
a sin to be any <hi>sin at all;</hi> But all factions and
parties are still justifying their Love-killing
wayes, and reproaching those whom they
have wronged; As if when they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
withdrawn their Love from them, it
<pb facs="tcp:59262:16"/>
were no crime to take away next, their
good names, and all that they have but
power to take away. And when they have
cast their brethren out of their <hi>estimation</hi>
and <hi>affection,</hi> they think it a piece of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
zeal or justice, to cast them ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of Christian communion, and if they could
out of the Land and of the world. And
shall Ministers stand by, and see men take
such <hi>sin</hi> for <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>serve God</hi> by abusing
his <hi>Servants,</hi> and look for a <hi>reward</hi> for <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding</hi>
and <hi>pulling down</hi> his Church, and
never tell them what they are doing.</p>
            <p>11. And the old Non-conformists who
wrote so much against separation, were
neither <hi>blind</hi> nor <hi>temporizers.</hi> They saw the
danger on that side. Even <hi>Brightman</hi> on
<hi>Rev.</hi> that writeth against the Prelacy and
Ceremonies, severely reprehendeth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists.
Read but the writings of Mr. <hi>Iohn
Paget,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hildersham,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi>
and many such others against the separatists
of those times, and you may learn that our
Light is not <hi>greater,</hi> but <hi>less</hi> than theirs, and
that we see not further into that cause than
they did; and that change of times doth
not change the truth; nor will warrant us
to change our Religion, unless we will make
our Religion subject, to the wills and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
<pb facs="tcp:59262:16"/>
of men, and change it as oft as the
times shall change.</p>
            <p>12. Lastly, if your <hi>friends</hi> tell you not of
your <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>errours</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> those whom
you account your <hi>enemies</hi> will do it in
<hi>wrath.</hi> And though all sober Christians
should learn by the keenest rebukes of their
Adversaries, yet passion and prejudice ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it so difficult, that it usually hardeneth
men more in their sin: And this is another
thing, which causeth me the more to abhor
division, and to long for the reconciling of
the minds of all dissenting Christians; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
while they take each other for adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
nothing that is written or said by any
is like to do the Adversaries any good. Nay
I must confess when I see an adversary tell
men of their sin, especially with furious
spleen and wrath, mixing together words
and swords, I am greatly afraid, lest by that
temptation, Satan will draw the reproved to
impenitency, and greatly harden them in
their sin, and make them glory in that as a
virtue, which such a person doth so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
            <p>But if you will neither hear of your sin
nor duty by adversaries nor friends, by fair
speeches nor by foul, you fasten the guilt
upon your selves. Remember I pray you,
that I am not kindling fires, nor drawing
<pb facs="tcp:59262:17"/>
Swords against you, nor stirring up any to do
you hurt, but only perswading all dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to love one another, and to forbear but
all that is contrary to love. And if such an
exhortation and advice seem injurious or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
to you, the Lord have mercy on
your Souls.</p>
            <p>III. And now without a spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy;
I will foretel what entertainment
this Paper must expect.</p>
            <p>1. Some on the one side will say, It is
sharper and rounder dealing than all this,
that must cure the Schismes in the Church:
And if you would heal our Divisions, why
do you not conform you self, but stand
out as one of the party that divideth?</p>
            <p>2. Some on the other side will say, that
it is an unseasonable time, when so much
anger is breaking forth against those that we
account <hi>Dividers,</hi> to mention their faults,
and so to stir up more. I will give these
men no other answer, than to bid them read
the last part of this Book; or else do not
talk till they know of what.</p>
            <p>3. And some will say that I am doing
that which will prove a hurt to my self and
others. For if I should draw the People to
Communion with the Conformists, there
would little compassion be shewed to the
Ministers that cannot conform. But sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish
<pb facs="tcp:59262:17"/>
wisdome must be shut out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
when we are consulting about the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Churches, and the good of Souls.
And indeed there is little danger of this
consequence, as long as the people are far
more averse to Communion or Concord
with the Parish-Churches, than the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming
Ministers are. But suppose it
prove true, should we not do good to Souls,
and save men from sin, and heal divisions, at
the dearest rate? What though it cost us
more than is here mentioned; The reviving
of decayed Love, and the closure of any of
the Churches wounds, is a recompence
worth our liberties and lives.</p>
            <p>4. And those that are most guilty of the
Love-killing principles here detected, and
are most eminent in <hi>self-conceited ignorance,</hi>
will do by me and by this book, according
to their Principles, and as they use to do by
others. Before they have soberly read it
over, they will carry about the Sectarian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of it from hand to hand; And when
one hath said it, the rest will affirm it, that
[I have clawed with one party, and have gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at the other, and have sought to make
them odious by bringing them under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Separation, and of censuring and
avoiding the ungodly; and that being luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm
my self, and a complyer with sin, I
<pb facs="tcp:59262:18"/>
would have all others do so too: And that
these Reconcilers are neither flesh nor fish,
and attempt impossibilities, even to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
Light and darkness, Christ and Belial;
And that for the sake of Peace we would
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell the Truth, and would let in Church-corruptions
out of an over-eager desire of
Agreement: And when they have all done,
neither party will regard them, but they
shall fare worse than any others; and will
lose both sides, whilest they are for neither.]
I know it is the nature of the disease which
I am curing, to send forth such breath and
scents as these; And I intend not to bestow
a word to answer them.</p>
            <p>5. And some of the wise and sober Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
who mark more the inconveniences
of one side, than of the other, and look more
to <hi>outward occurrences,</hi> than to the <hi>Rule,</hi> and
to the inward state of Souls; especially
such as have not seen, the times and things
that I have seen, will think that though all
this be true, it is unseasonable, and may give
advantage to such as love not Reformation.
And to them I shall return this answer.
1. That if we stay seven years more for a
seasonable time, to oppose the radical sin of
uncharitableness, we may be in our graves,
and the sinners in their graves, and the sin
may be multiplied and rooted past all hope
<pb facs="tcp:59262:18"/>
of remedy. And why may you not as well
stay seven years more, for a seasonable time,
to Preach down all other sins as well as this?
Is this the least malignant, or least dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
sin? 2. There was never a more sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
time to tell men of their sin, than
when the temptation to it is the greatest;
when it is most growing and multiplying
among us; When God hath been so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously
dishonoured by it; when the world
doth ring of it; when many Volumes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them for it; And when the sensual
and ungodly are hardened by it in their
scorn of godliness, to the apparent peril of
their damnation: yea more, to turn our
complaints from our Law-givers upon our
selves. It is <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and it is <hi>Dividing</hi>
principles and practices, that have silenced
so many Ministers, and brought us into all
the confusions and calamities which we see
and undergo.</p>
            <p>6. But there are many sincere and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Ministers, who knowing this which
I say to be true, will be the more excited by
it to lead the younger and passionate sort of
Religious people, into the wayes of Love
and peace, and to save them from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
here detected, and perswade them to
the practise of these Directions. And for
the use of these I write this Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59262:19"/>
And yet, to end as I began, I must add
these notices, for your right understanding
of it.</p>
            <p>1. That this is not my first attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this work; but the progress of what I
have been upon these three and twenty
years. About fifteen or sixteen years ago,
I preacht on the third Chapter of Saint
<hi>Iames,</hi> in a larger and a closer manner on this
Subject, than here I write: because the
times then called me to it.</p>
            <p>2. I perswade no Christian to justifie or
own the sins or the least defects of any
Church, Minister or People, in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or in their lives, though I perswade you
to Communion with the Churches, persons
and worship-actions, which have many
faults: (For on Earth there is no person,
Church, or Worship faultless, and without
corruption.) I justifie not the faults of my
own daily Prayers, and yet I never pray
without them.</p>
            <p>3. I am not perswading Ministers to any
unwise and unseasonable Preaching, against
the dividing Principles of the weak, when
the necessities of the Auditory more require
other Doctrine; (Much less to exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
railings and invectives; And least of all
to wrathful violence). But only with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in season and with Love and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb facs="tcp:59262:19"/>
to lead men into the truth: If even
with Infidels and Hereticks, <hi>the Servant of
the Lord must not strive, but be gentle to all
men; apt to teach; patient, in meekness instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
those that oppose themselves, if God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
will give them repentance to the
acknowledging of the truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24, 25.
How much more must the Children of
Gods family be used with Love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But if the fierceness of any contradict
what I say, I only add, that it is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
person that speaketh it, but
one who through the mercy of God, hath
long kept a numerous flock in Love and
unity and peace by such like means; and
hath seen the lamentable effects of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
way.</p>
            <p>4. While I say so much in this Treatise
against the <hi>rash censuring of others,</hi> I give
you not the rule for mens censuring of
<hi>themselves:</hi> They know more by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
They may search into the depth of
their hearts and intentions, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do. They are allowed to be more
suspicious &amp; censorious of themselves, than
of any others: It more concerneth them:
And they have more to do with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and may be bolder with themselves.
We judg others in order to visible Church-Communion
by visible and publick evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb facs="tcp:59262:20"/>
But in order to their preparation for
the judgment of God, we must direct
them to judge themselves according to the
truth in the inward parts.</p>
            <p>5. While I draw you to peace and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
towards others, I desire not to
quench the least degree of Christian zeal.
Nay I endeavour to kill that which would
kill it. The <hi>purified peculiar people of the
Redeemer ane zealous,</hi> but <hi>of what?</hi> not
to consume and destroy one another, nor
to hate and flye from one another; nor to
vilifie and backbite one another; but they
are <hi>zealous of good works:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> will
tell you what are <hi>good works,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23.
<hi>Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:</hi> Be
zealous in Loving all Christians as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and all men as men: Be zealous for
<hi>Peace: If it be possible, as much as in you
lyeth, live peaceably with all men,</hi> Rom. 12. 18.
Be zealously patient, gentle, good, meek,
temperate. And the works of the flesh are
<hi>hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife,
sedition, heresies:</hi> A zeal for these is <hi>earthly
sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish,</hi> as <hi>Iames</hi> telleth you.
And remember that the word which is
translated there <hi>[Envy]</hi> is <hi>[Zeal]</hi> in the
Original: But our translators were afraid,
lest the prophane would have mistaken it,
<pb facs="tcp:59262:20"/>
if they had translated it <hi>[Zeal]</hi> ver. 16.
<hi>where zeal and strife is</hi> (that is, a <hi>striving</hi>
contentious zeal) <hi>there is confusion and every
evil work.]</hi> If you believe this, how dare
you blame me for writing to save you from
<hi>confusion and every evil work?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. I will conclude with the repetition of
one thing delivered in this Treatise; that
among all the rest, two separating dividing
principles will never give peace to the
Church where they prevail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The one is;
the confounding mens <hi>Title</hi> to <hi>visible
Church Membership</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> with
their Title to Justification and Salvation.
The other is, the <hi>Imposing of new terms and
titles</hi> of Visible membership and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and rejecting the sufficiency of the
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erms</hi> and <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Christs appointment.</hi> Christ
hath solemnly and purposely made the
<hi>Baptismal Covenanting with him,</hi> to be the
<hi>terms</hi> and <hi>title</hi> to Church membership and
Communion; And the <hi>owning</hi> of this <hi>same
Covenant</hi> is the sufficient Title of the
adult. And the Imposers that come after,
and require another kind of evidence of
Conversion, or Sanctification than this,
do confound the Church, and enflame the
people, and leave no certain way of tryal,
but make as various <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>titles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as there
are various degrees of wisdome and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb facs="tcp:59262:21"/>
and various opinions, in the Pastors
(yea in all the people to whom they allow
the judgement of such Causes) in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches. In this point, the sober
Anabaptists seem to come nearer the truth
than they.</p>
            <p>I add no more, but Christs conclusion,
that a house or Kingdom divided against it
self cannot stand; The Book it self was
written near two years ago; but this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
<hi>Feb.</hi> 2. 1669.</p>

            <head>AN
ABSTRACT
OF THE
DIRECTIONS.</head>
            <p>1. FOrget not the difference between the younger
sort of Christians, and the Elder. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril
of the Church from young Christians.</p>
            <p>2. Observe the secret workings of spiritual pride, and
how deep rooted and odious a sin it is, and what special
temptations to it, the younger and emptier sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have.</p>
            <p>3. Overvalue not the Common gift of utterance,
nor a high profession, as if grace were appropriated to
such alone, who are to be called Professors.</p>
            <p>4. Affect not to be made en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lnent and conspicuous in
holiness, by standing at a further distance from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Christians, than God would have you.</p>
            <p>5. Understand the true difference between the Church
as Visible and as Regenerate or mystical; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
qualifications of the Members. What Scandals
were in the primitive Churches, in Scripture times.</p>
            <p>6. Understand well the different Conditions and
terms of Communion with the Church as mystical and
as visible, and the different priviledges of the members:
that you may not presume to impose any Conditions
<pb facs="tcp:59262:22"/>
which God hath not imposed, nor unjustly grudge at
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> essence of those that are not sincere.</p>
            <p>7. Get time and sleep apprehensions of the necessity
and reasons of Christian Vnity and Concord; and of
the sin and misery of divisions and discord: what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith herein.</p>
            <p>8. When any thing needeth amendment in the
Church, the best Christians must be the forwardest to
Reform, and the backwardest to divide on that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>9. Forget <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the great difference betweene the

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and the Godlyes
separating from the Church it self, because the wicked
are not cast out. The first is a great duty: the second
usually a great sin. <hi>Luthers</hi> case.</p>
            <p>10. Expect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not that any one lawfully received into
the Church by Baptism, should be cast out of it, or denyed
the priviledges of the Church, but according to the
rules of Christian discipline, by the power of the Keys;
that is, for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stinate impenitency in a gross on scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
sin, upon proof, and after sufficient private and
publick admonition.</p>
            <p>11. Understand what the Power of the Keys is, and
what the Pastors office is; as they are the Governours
of the Church, entrusted by Christ with the power of
admission and rejection: that so you may know how far
you are to rest in the Pastors judgment, and may not
usurp any part of their office to your selves.</p>
            <p>12. Study well Christs gracious nature and office;
and his great readiness to receive the weakest that come
to him; that so you may desire a Church discipline
agreeable to the Gospel.</p>
            <p>13. Yet lest you run into the worse extream, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
still that the destroying of sin, and the sanctifying
<pb facs="tcp:59262:22"/>
of man to God, was the work of our Redeemer: And
that Holiness and Peace must go together: And that
our own Church-order and discipline, must be subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to the inward spirituality and prosperity of the
Church-regenerate; And no such favour must be
shewed to sinners as favoureth sin, and hindereth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</p>
            <p>14. Though your Governours are the Iudges, what
persons shall be of your publick-Church-Communion;
yet it is you that must judge who are fit or unfit for your
private familiarity.</p>
            <p>15. Vnderstand how much it hath pleased God to
lay all mens happiness or misery upon their own choice:
And seek not to alter this order of God.</p>
            <p>16. Though the profession of Christianity which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titleth
men to Church-Communion, must be credible;
yet remember that there are various degrees of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:
And that every Profession which is not proved
false, is credible in such a degree as must be accepted by
the Church.</p>
            <p>17. Know how far it is that either Grace or Gifts
are necessary to a Minister, that you may give to both
their due.</p>
            <p>18. Vnderstand well the necessity of your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with all the Universal Church, and wherein it
consisteth; and how far it is to be preferred before your
Communion with any particular Church.</p>
            <p>19. Engage not your selves too far in any divided
Sect, and espouse not the interest of any party of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to the neglect or injury of the universal Church,
and the Christian Cause.</p>
            <p>20. Be very suspicious of your Religious passions, and
carefully distinguish between a sound and sinful zeal;
least you father your sin on the Spirit of God, and
<pb facs="tcp:59262:23"/>
think you please him more when you most offend
him.</p>
            <p>21. Lend not a patient ear to backbiters; nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
believe the most religious people, when they speak ill
of others.</p>
            <p>22. Make not your selves judges of other mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
much less of their state, before you have a Call;
or before you have sufficient knowledge of the person and
of the Case.</p>
            <p>23. Mistake not the nature of the sin of Scandal, as
if it were the bare displeasing of another: when it is the
laying of a stumbling-block or occasion of sinning before
another.</p>
            <p>24. Make Conscience of Scandalizing one party as
well as another: and those most, who are most in danger
by your offence.</p>
            <p>25. Be not over tender of your reputation with any
sort of men on earth: nor too impatient of their displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
censures or contempt. But live above them.</p>
            <p>26. Use not your selves (needlesly) to the familiar
company of that sort of Christians, who use to censure
them that are more sober, Catholick and charitable than
themselves: Unless you be as much or more, with the
soberer sort, who will shew you the sin and mischief of
Love-killing principles and divisions.</p>
            <p>27. Take heed of misjudging of the answers of your
prayers, and of taking those things to be from God,
which are but the effects of your prejudice, passion or
weakness of understanding.</p>
            <p>28. Do not too much reverence the revelations, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses
or most confident opinions of any others upon the
account of their sincerity or holiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but try all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously

29. Take heed least the trouble of your own disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doubting minds, do become a snare, to draw you
to some un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>outh way of Cure; and so make the fancy of
some new opinion, sect or practice, to seem your reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and give you ease; and soperswade you that it is
the certain truth.</p>
            <p>30 Keep in the rank of a humble disciple or Learner
in Christs Church, till you are fit and called to be Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
your selves,</p>
            <p>31. Grow up in the great substantial practical truths
and duties; and grow downwards in the roots of a clearer
belief of the Word of God, and the life to come: And
neither begin too soon with doubtful opinions, nor ever
lay too much upon them.</p>
            <p>32. Lay not a greater stress upon your different words
and manner of prayer, than God hath laid: And
take heed of scorning, reproaching or slighting, the
words and manner of other mens worship, when it is
such as God accepteth from the sincere. Where the Case
about forms of prayer is handled.</p>
            <p>33. When you are sure that other mens way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is sinful; yet make it not any other, or greater sin,
than indeed it is; and speak not evil of so much in it as
is good: And slander not God as a hater or rejecter of
all mens Services which are mixt with infirmities; or
as a partial hater of the infirmities of others, and not
yours.</p>
            <p>34. Think not that all is unlawfully obeyed which is
unlawfully commanded.</p>
            <p>35. Think not that you are guilty of all the faults of
other mens worship with whom you joyn; no not of the
Ministers or Congregations: Nor that you are bound to
seperate from all the worship which is faultily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
For then there must be no Church-Communion
<pb facs="tcp:59262:24"/>
upon Earth. Where is more about extemporary prayer
and imposed forms.</p>
            <p>36. Yet know what Pastors and Church-Communion
you may joyn with, and what not: And think not that
I am perswading you to make no difference.</p>
            <p>37. In your judging of Discipline, reformation, and
any means of the Churches good; be sure your eye be
upon the true <hi>End;</hi> and upon the particular Rule; and
not on either of them alone. Take not that for a means
which is either contrary to the Word of God; or is in

            <p>38. Neglect not any truth of God; much less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it, or deny it. But yet do not take it for your
duty to publish all, which you judge to be truth; nor a
sin to silence many lesser truths, when the Churches
peace and welfare doth require it.</p>
            <p>39. Know which are the Great duties of a Christian
life, and wherein the nature of true Religion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist:
And then pretend not any lesser duty, against
these greater; though the least when it is indeed a duty,
is not to be denyed or neglected.</p>
            <p>40. Labour for a sound judgement to know good
from evil, least you trouble your selves and others by
mistakes: Forsake not the guidance of a judicious
Teacher, nor the Company of the agreeing generality of
the Godly.</p>
            <p>41. Let not the bare fervour of a Preacher, or the
loudness of his voice, or affectionate utterance, draw
you too far to admire or follow him, without a proportion
of solid understanding and judiciousness.</p>
            <p>43. Your belief of the <hi>necessary Articles of faith,</hi>
must be made your <hi>own,</hi> and not taken meerly on the
Authority of any. And in all points of belief or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which are necessary to Salvation, you must ever
<pb facs="tcp:59262:24"/>
keep company with the <hi>Universal Church:</hi> For it were
not the <hi>Church;</hi> if it erred in those. And in matters
of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> the <hi>major vote</hi> must be your
guide. In matters of humane obedience your Governours
must be your guides. And in matters of <hi>high</hi> and <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
speculation,</hi> the judgment of one man of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
understanding, is to be preferred before the
Rulers, and the major Vote.</p>
            <p>43. Reject not a good cause, because it is owned by
some bad men: And own not a bad cause for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Patrons of it. Iudge not of the Cause by the
persons, when you should judg of the persons by the Cause.</p>
            <p>44. Yea, take the bad examples of religious men, to
be one of your most perillous temptations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labour to discover what are the special sins of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
in the age you live in, that you may be specially
fortified against them.</p>
            <p>45. Desire the highest degree of holiness, and to be free
from the Corruptions of the times: But affect not to be odd
and singular from ordinary Christians in lawful things.</p>
            <p>46. When you have to do only with stigmatized
scandalous ones, to vindicate the honour of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
from their Scandal, go as far from them as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
you can: But with the Common sort of Sinners,
whose Conversion you are bound to seek, go not as far
from them as you can; but purposely study to come as
near them as lawfully you may, that you may have the
better advantage to win them to the truth.</p>
            <p>47. Whenever you are avoiding any error forget not
that there is a contrary extream to be avoided, of
which you are not our of danger.</p>
            <p>48. Think more; and talk more, of your faults and
failings against others; especially against Princes,
Magistrates and Pastors, than of their faults and
failings against you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59262:25"/>
49. Take notice of all the good in others which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth;
and talk rather of that behind their backs,
than of their faults.</p>
            <p>50. Study the duty of instructing and exhorting,
more than of reproof and finding fault.</p>
            <p>51. The more you suffer by Rulers or any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, the
more be watchful, lest you be tempted to dishonour them;
or to withdraw or abate the Love which is their due.</p>
            <p>52. Make Conscience of heart-revenge, and tongue-revenge,
as well as of hand-revenge.</p>
            <p>53. When you are exasperated by the hurt which
you feel from Magistrates, remember also the Good
which the Church receiveth by them.</p>
            <p>54. Learn to suffer by good people, and by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
and not only by ungodly people, or by Magistrates.</p>
            <p>55. When you complain of <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in others; take heed lest the same inward vice
work in you, by <hi>Church cruelties,</hi> and <hi>dimning
censures,</hi> against them or others. Persecution and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
often have the same Cause.</p>
            <p>56. Keep still in your eye, the State of all Christs
Churches upon earth; that you may know what a people
they are through the world, whom Christ hath Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with: and may not ignorantly separate from almost
all the Church of Christ, while you think that you sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
but from those about you. Queres about separation.</p>
            <p>57. Yet ler not any here cheat you by the bare namees
and titles of Unity, to the papal usurping head of the
Church: nor must you dream of any Head and Center
of Unity to the universal Church, but Christ himself.</p>
            <p>58. Take heed of superstition, indiser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Formality in the next age hath made a Religion of it:
<pb facs="tcp:59262:25"/>
And then the zealous, who first invented it, have
turned most against it, for the sake of the last owners;
And thus the world hath turned round. Instances lay'd
down of the superstition of Religions people in this age.</p>
            <p>59. If through the fault of either side, or both,
you cannot meet together in the same assemblies; yet
keep that Unity in faith, love and practice, which all
neighbour Churches should maintain; And use not
your different assemblies to rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling, and destroying
Love and Peace.</p>
            <p>60. When the Love-killing spirit, either cruel or
dividing, is abroad among Christians; be not idle, nor
discouraged Spectators; nor betray the Churches peace
by lazy wishes, But make it a great part of your labour
and Religion, to revive Love and Peace, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
their contraries. And let no censures or contempt
of any party take you off: But account it as comfortable
to be a <hi>Martyr</hi> for <hi>Love &amp; Peace</hi> by <hi>blind Zealots</hi>
or <hi>proud Usurpers,</hi> as <hi>for the saith</hi> by <hi>Infidels</hi> or
<hi>Heathens:</hi> And take the pleasing of God (whoever is
displeased) for your full reward.</p>

            <head>The Additional Directions to the Pastors.</head>
            <p>1. Let it be our first care to know and do our own
duty: And when we see the peoples weakness and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
let us first examine and judge our selves, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reform our own neglects. Ministers are the
Cause of most divisions.</p>
            <p>2. It is needful to the peoples Edification and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
that their Pastors much excel them, in knowledge
and utterance, and also in prudence, holiness, and
heavenly mindedness: that the reverence of their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and persons may be preserved; and the people
taught by their Examples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59262:26"/>
3. Inculcate still the necessary conjunction of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Peace; and of the Love of God and Man:
And that Love is their Holiness it self, and the sum of
their Religion; the End of faith, and the fulfilling of
the Law. And that as Love to God uniteth us to Him;
so Love to man must unite us to each other. And that all
doctrine and practices which are against Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are against God, against Christ, against the Spirit,
against the Church, and against Mankind.</p>
            <p>4. If others shew their weakness by unwarrantable
singularities or divisions, shew not your greater weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by impatience, and uncharitable censures or
usage of them: especially when self-interest provoketh you.</p>
            <p>5. Distinguish between them that separate from the
Universal Church, or from all the Orthodox and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
parts of it; and those who only turn from the
Ministery of some one person or sort of persons, without
refusing Communion with the rest.</p>
            <p>6. Distinguish between them who deny the Being of
the Ministry and Church from which they separate:
and those who remove only for their own Edification, as
from a worse or weaker Ministry, &amp; a Church less pure.</p>
            <p>7. Distinguish between those who hold it simply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to have Communion with you: and those who only
hold it unlawful to prefer your assemblies before such as
they think to be more pure.</p>
            <p>8. Remember Christs interest in the weakest of his
Servants; and do nothing against them which Christ
will not take well.</p>
            <p>9. Distinguish between weakness of Gifts and of
Graces: and remember that many who are weaker in
the understanding of Church-orders, may yet be stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in grace than you.</p>
            <p>10. Think on the <hi>Common Calamity</hi> of mankind:
<pb facs="tcp:59262:26"/>
what strange <hi>disparity</hi> there is in mens understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and will be: And how the Church here is a
Hospital of diseased souls; of whom none are perfectly
healed in this life.</p>
            <p>11. Distinguish still between those truths and duties,
which are or are not of <hi>necessity:</hi> and between the
<hi>tolerable</hi> and the <hi>intolerable</hi> errors. And never
think of a <hi>Common Unity</hi> and Concord, but upon the
terms of <hi>necessary points;</hi> and of the <hi>primitive sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity;</hi>
and the <hi>forbearance</hi> of <hi>dissenters</hi> in <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
differences.</p>
            <p>12. Remember that the Pestoral Government is a
work of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> And what <hi>these</hi> cannot do,
<hi>we</hi> cannot do. Our great study therefore must be first to
<hi>know more</hi> and to <hi>Love more</hi> than the <hi>people;</hi> and
then to convince them by cogent evidence of truth; and
to cause the <hi>warmth</hi> of our <hi>Love</hi> to be <hi>felt</hi> by them, in
all the parts of our ministration and converse: As the
warmth of the Mothers milk is needful to the good nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
of the Child. The History of Martin.</p>
            <p>13. When you see many evils which Love and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
will leave uncured; yet do not reject this way,
till you have found one that will better do the work, and
with fewer inconveniences.</p>
            <p>14. When you reprove those weak Christians, who
are subject to errors, disorders and divisions; reflect
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any disgrace upon piety it self: but be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to proclaim the honour of Godliness, and true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
strictness, lest the ungodly take occasion to
despise it, by hearing of the faults of such as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the zealousest professors of it.</p>
            <p>15. Discourage not the people from so much of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
exercises, in their families, and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as is meet for them in their private st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59262:27"/>
16. Be not wanting in abilities, watchfulness and
diligence, to resist Seducers by the evidence of truth;
that there may be no need of other weapons: And quench
the sparks among the people, before they break out into
flames.</p>
            <p>17. Be not strange to the poet ones of your flocks;
but impartial to all; and the servants of all: Mind
not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.</p>
            <p>18. Spend and be spent for your peoples good, Do all
the good that you are able for their bodies, as well as for
their souls. And think nothing that you have too dear
to win them, that they may see that you are truely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to them; and that their welfare is your chiefest care.</p>
            <p>19. Keep up the reverence of the ancient and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
sort of Christians; and teach the younger what
honour they owe to them that are their Elders in age and
grace: For whilest the Elder who are usually sober
and peaceable, are duly reverenced, the heat of rash
and giddy youth, will be the better kept in order.</p>
            <p>20. Neither neglect your interest in the Religious
persons of your charge, lest you lose your power to do
them good; Nor yet be so tender of it, as to depart
from sober principles or wayes to please them: Make
them not your Rulers; nor follow them into any exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies,
to get their love, or to escape any of their censures.</p>
            <p>21. Let not the Pastors contend among themselves:
especially through envy against any whom the people
most esteem. A reproof of ignorant, pievish, backbiting,
quarrelsome Ministers.</p>
            <p>22. Study our great pattern of Love and tenderness,
meekness and patience: and all those texts which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
these virtues; till they are digested into a <hi>nature</hi>
in you, that healing virtue may go from you, as wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

FOR
VVeak Christians,
How they may escape the troubling, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and endangering of the Church by
their Errours in Doctrine, Worship, and
Church-Communion.</head>
            <p>IF we had never been warned by the History
of the Sacred Scripture, or of the former
Ages of the Church, yet our experience in
this present Age is enough to tell both us and
our Posterity, how great perturbations, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
may come to the Church of Christ, by the
miscarriages of the more zealous Professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion!
and how great a hinderance such may
prove to the prosperity of the Gospel; to the
Love and Unity of Christians; to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and holy order of the Congregations, and
to all those good ends which are desired by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
How great a dishonour they may prove
to the <hi>Christian name,</hi> and what occasions of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
the wicked in their contempt of <hi>Godliness,</hi>
to their everlasting ruine, and the sufferings of
Believers.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59262:28"/>
Therefore seeing the peace and welfare of the
Church, is much more valuable, than the peace
and welfare of an individual soul, as I have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
you how to escape your <hi>own disturbance</hi> and
<hi>undoing,</hi> so I think it as necessary to direct you,
how to escape being the Plagues and disturbers of
the Church, and the instruments of Satan in resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the Gospel, and destroying others. And you
should be the more willing to hear me in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
because by hurting others you hurt your selves,
and by wronging the Church of God, you cross
your own desires and ends (if you are Christians
indeed;) and by doing good to others, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the cause of Godliness and Christianity,
you do good to your selves and further your own
Cosolation and Salvation.</p>

               <p>FIrst, observe this General direction; see that
<hi>you forget not the great difference between Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

those at full age; between the weak and the strong in

not for nothing that the Spirit of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

1, 2. 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 6. 1 Iohn</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. There

both good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi> Novices must not be made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the Church. It is not for nothing that the
<hi>Younger</hi> are so often commanded reverence and
submission to the <hi>Elder;</hi> and that the Pastors and
Governors of the Church, are usually called by
the name of <hi>Elders;</hi> because it was supposed that
the <hi>elder sort</hi> were the most experienced and wise,
and therefore Pastors and Rulers were to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of them. And why is it that children must
so much honour their fathers and mothers, and
must be governed by them? It is not meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
generation giveth the Parents a propriety in
their children: For God would not have <hi>folly</hi> to
be the governour of <hi>wisdom,</hi> upon pretense of
such propriety: But it is also because that it must
ordinarily be supposed that Infants are ignorant,
and Parents have understanding, and are fit to be
their Teachers, as having had <hi>longer time and helps</hi>
to learn, and more <hi>experience</hi> to make their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
clear and firm. If the young and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
were ordinarily as wise as the aged or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
why are not children made governors of
their Parents, or at least commanded to instruct
and teach them, as ordinarily as Parents must do
their children? The Lord Jesus himself would
be subject to his mother and reputed father in his
Child-hood. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 51. Can there be a livelier
conviction of the arrogancy of those novices,
who proudly sleight the judgments of their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as presuming groundlesly that they are wiser
than they? Yea Christ would not enter upon his
publick Ministry or Office, till he was <hi>about thirty
years</hi> of age. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23. He is blind that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth

Condemnation of the pride of those that run with

vilisie the judgments of the aged, who differ from
their conceits, before they understand the things
in which they are so confident. It was thought a
good answer, in <hi>Iohn 9. 21. [He is of age, ask
him:]</hi> But they that are <hi>under age</hi> now think their
words to be the wisest, because they are the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

is the character of a truculent people <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 50.
that <hi>they regard not the person of the old:</hi> that is,
They reverence not their age. How many vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
commands are there in <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs
to the younger sort, to hearken to the counsel of
their Parents? The contrary was the ruine of
<hi>Eli's</hi> sons; and the shame of <hi>Samuels,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 1,
5. Was <hi>Rehoboam</hi> unwise in forsaking the counsel
of the aged, and harkning to the young and rash?
And are those people wise that in the Mysteries of
Salvation, will prefer the vehement passions of
a novice, before the well-setled judgment of the
experienced aged Ministers? I know that the old
are too oft ignorant, and that wisdom doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
increase with age: But I know withall, that
Children are never fit to be the Teachers of the
Church; And that old men <hi>may be foolish,</hi> but too
young men are never wise enough for so high a
work. We are not now considering, what <hi>may</hi>
fall out rarely as a wonder, but what is ordinarily
to be expected.</p>

Most of the Churches confusions and divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ons,
have been caused by the younger sort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
Who are in the heat of their zeal, and the
infancy of understanding: Who have <hi>affection</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make them drive on, but have not <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
enough to know the way. None are so
fierce and rash in condemning the things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which they understand not, and in raising
clamours against all that are wiser and soberer
than they. If they once take a thing to be a sin
which is no sin, or a duty which is no duty, there
is no person, no Minister, no Magistrate, who
hath age, or wisdom or piety enough, to save them
from the injuries of juvenile temerity, if they do
not think and speak and do according to their
green and raw conceits.</p>
               <p>Remember therefore to be always sensible of
the great disadvantages of youth, and to preserve
that reverence for experienced age, which God in
<hi>nature</hi> as well as in Scripture hath made their due.
If <hi>time</hi> &amp; <hi>labour</hi> were not necessary to maturity of
knowledge, why do you not trust another with
your health, as well as a studyed experienced Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
and with your Estates, as well as a studyed
Lawyer? And why do no Sea-men trust any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to govern the ship, as well as an experienced
Pilot? Do you not see that all men ordinarily
are best, at that which by long study they have
made their profession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know those that I have now to do with will
say, that</hi> Divinity is not learnt by labour and mens
teaching, as other Sciences and Arts are; but by the
teaching of the spirit of God: and therefore the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
may have as much of it as the eldest.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is some <hi>truth</hi> and some <hi>falshood,</hi>
and much <hi>confusion,</hi> in this objection. It is <hi>true</hi>
that the saving knowledge of Divinity, must be
taught by the Spirit of God: But it is false that
<hi>labour</hi> and <hi>humane teaching</hi> are not the means which
must be used by them, who will have the teaching
of the spirit. And the objection confoundeth,
1. The <hi>spirits teaching</hi> us by <hi>inditing the Scripture,</hi>
with the <hi>spirits teaching</hi> us the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
2 And it confoundeth the <hi>common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of Divinity, with the <hi>saving knowledge</hi> of it.
No man commeth to a <hi>common knowledge,</hi> fit for a
Teacher of others, without the <hi>spirits</hi> teaching us
by the <hi>Scripture:</hi> For that was the first part of the
<hi>spirits</hi> teaching us, to inspire the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
to deliver a <hi>teaching, Word</hi> to the Church,
by <hi>which</hi> we might <hi>all be taught of God</hi> through all
generations. But many men have excellent <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
knowledge,</hi> by this word, and by the <hi>common</hi>
help of the spirit, without that <hi>special</hi> help which
begetteth saving knowledge. Many prophesied
and workt miracles in Christs name, who had no
<hi>saving</hi> knowledge of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. And
<hi>Paul rejoyced</hi> that <hi>Christ was preached,</hi> even by them
that did it of <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>envy, to add affliction to his
bonds:</hi> Phil. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>saving</hi> knowledge
must have a <hi>special</hi> help of grace; And they which
had but <hi>Solomons</hi> knowledge, may by the spirit
<hi>have saving</hi> knowledge in a <hi>little time,</hi> by bringing
it to the heart, and making it clear, and lively and
effectual. But that may be a means of saving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which saveth not the man that hath it.
And all knowledge requireth <hi>time</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> to
obtain it, though the Spirit giveth it, and though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59262:30"/>
it may be sanctifyed to us in a little time.</p>
               <p>1. Consider I pray you, why else it is, that God
hath so multiplied commands, to dig for it as for
Silver, and search for it as a hidden treasure: to
cry for Knowledge and lift up our voice for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
to wait at the posts of wisdoms
doors: to search the Scriptures and meditate in
them day and night: Is not this such study and
labour as men use, to get understanding in other
kind of professions? Are not these the plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God? and are they not their deceivers
who contradict them.</p>
               <p>2. Is it not a blaspheming of Gods spirit, to
make it the Patron of mens sloth and idleness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretense of magnifying grace? When so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Texts command us diligence, and slothfulness
is so great a sin? And none are so forward to
preach as these same men that cry down mens
teaching.</p>
               <p>3. Why hath God setled a Teaching Office in
his Church, and commandeth all to attend and
hear and learn; if we are taught by the Spirit
without mans help? Why were the Apostles sent
out into all the world? And why are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to teach all Nations, and to teach the
Church all that Christ commanded them? and
why doth he promise to be with them to the end
of the world? but that this is the way of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
teaching, to teach those first who are our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
teachers, and then to help us to understand
them? And those are taught of God, who are
taught by those who are sent of God to be their
teachers, and have the inward concurrence of his
grace.</p>

4. Advise with the experience of all the world
who was the man that ever you knew able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
one Chapter in the Bible, by the inward
teaching of the Spirit alone without any labour of
his own, or help from others, by voice or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
Where dwelleth that man who by meer
inspiration, can turn one Chapter out of Hebrew
or Greek into the vulgar tongue? The first part
of our preaching or publishing the Scriptures is by
Translating them into a language which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
When <hi>Ezra</hi> in his Pulpit of wood, did read
the Law and give the sense, the meaning is, that he
read it in the ancient Hebrew tongue in which
it was written, and turned it into the language
which the Jews then used (who were grown much
strangers to their ancient speech.) Where is the
man that can solidly unfold any Doctrine of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
which he never read or heard of, or can
teach that truth, and defend that Religion, which
he was never taught by man? He is a stranger in
the world who seeth not, that as in Law and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
and other professions, though some are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
even when they are old, yet commonly all
men are wisest and ablest in their own profession,
and those know most, who having natural capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

hardest studies, the Spirit assisting them by his

               </p>
               <p>1 <hi>Pride</hi> of our <hi>understandings,</hi> worketh thus:
First, a man that was formerly in darkness, is
much affected with the new-come light, and
perceiveth that he knoweth much more than he
did before: And then he groweth to a carnal
and corrupt estimation of it, valuing it more as
<hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>pleased</hi> with it, than as it is sanctified
by it: Delighting in <hi>knowledge</hi> for it self, more
than for the purity, Love and heavenliness
which it should effect. Then he looketh about
him on the ignorant sort of people, who know
not what he knoweth, and seeth how far
they are below him: And he thinketh with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
what a difference hath God made between
<hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Them:</hi> And because <hi>Thankfulness</hi> is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he observeth not how <hi>Pride</hi> doth twist it self
with it, and creep in under the protection of its
name: And how Thankfulness and Pride have
the same expressions, and both of them say, <hi>I
thank thee O Father that thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to
babes: I thank thee O God that I am not as other
men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as
this Publican, Luk.</hi> 18. 11. And then he is so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with the things which he knoweth, that
he perceiveth not what knowledge yet he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And the deep <hi>affection</hi> which his knowledge
worketh in him, or the tickling <hi>pleasure</hi> which he
hath in knowing, joyned with this <hi>ignorance</hi> of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59262:32"/>
his <hi>ignorance</hi> in other things, doth make him
over-confident of all his apprehensions, as if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing which he imagineth were an absolute
certainty: And so he wanteth that humble sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of his own understanding, which a true
acquaintance with his ignorance would have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in him: And thus he groweth to <hi>over-value</hi>
all his own conceivings; and to under-value all
the opinions and reasonings of others, which are
contrary to his own: And thence he proceeds to
corrupt his Religion with such mis-apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and his rash unsuspected understanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
one errour first, and then <hi>that</hi> lets in
many more; till he have espoused a <hi>self-chosen
frame</hi> of doctrine, instead of the sacred truths of
God, and method of the Gospel: And from hence
he proceedeth to choose his Religious exercises
also, according to these mis-apprehensions: These
make him <hi>Duties</hi> which are no <hi>Duties,</hi> and <hi>sins</hi>
which are no <hi>sins:</hi> And thus he calleth <hi>evil, good,</hi>
and <hi>good, evil;</hi> and <hi>putteth darkness for light, and
light for darkness; bitter for sweet, and sweet for bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
And having made him a Religion of his own,
he confidently thinketh that it is of God: And
next he valueth all men that he hath to do with
according as they are <hi>nearer</hi> or <hi>farther off,</hi> from
this which he accounteth the way of God: He
chooseth his <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>party</hi> whom he will joyn
with, by the test of this Religion which his pride
hath chosen: He zealously declaimeth against the
opposers of his way, as against the adversaries of
truth and Godliness, and consequently of God
himself. He prayeth up his opinions, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them up, and contendeth for them; and

prayeth and preacheth and disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

party that is for them, and to weaken that which
is against them: And thus he divideth the kingdom
and family of Christ; He destroyeth first, the Love
of his brother and neighbour in himself, and then
laboureth to destroy it in all others, by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against those that are not of his way, with
contempt and obloquy to represent them as an

                     </gap>lovely</hi> sort of men: And if the interest of his
cause and party do require it, perhaps he will
next destroy their persons: And yet all this is
done in zeal of God, and as an acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to him: And they think all are Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who are of their own opinion and way. And
thus PRIDE insensibly, while they perceive
it not at all, doth choke their Opinions, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
their Parties, and make their Duties and
their sins, and rule their judgments, affections
and their actions; which is all but the same thing,
which the Scripture in one word calleth HERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SY.
And all that I have said, you may find
said in other words in the third Chapter of
<hi>Iames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there are two things which greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
this sin: The one is a conceit that all their
apprehensions are the <hi>Spirits dictat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> or the effect
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59262:33"/>
of its illumination. And the works and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the spirit, are not to be contradicted, or
suspected, but to be honoured. Therefore they
think that it is a resisting of the spirit, to resist
their judgment: And they are perswaded that
their apprehensions are caused by the spirit, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they had no such thing whilest
they lived in wickedness, but it came in either
with their change or shortly after: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they think that the same light which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them their sinful state, doth shew them also
all these principles: And partly because they find
themselves as <hi>deeply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffected</hi> with these misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
as with other which are sound and right;
therefore they are confident that they come from
the same spirit: And specially when these thoughts
come in upon the reading of the Scripture, or
in meditation, or after earnest prayer to God,
to teach them by his spirit and lead them into the
truth, and not to suffer them to err; and when
they find that they have good ends and meanings,
and a desire to know the truth; all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them that it is the spirit from whom their
thoughts proceed; when yet it may be no such
thing.</p>
               <p>And another much greater and commoner
cause of this <hi>self-conceitedness</hi> is this: All mens
understandings are naturally imperfect: Our
knowledge about <hi>Natural</hi> things is small and
dark, much more about things supernatural: The
wisest must say, <hi>We know but in part:</hi> And the
variety of mens degrees of knowledge, joyned
with the difference of their educations, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and fore-going thoughts, doth make as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59262:34"/>
great a diversity of understandings as of complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And yet it is very hard to any man, to have
a sufficient diffidence and suspicion of his mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
mind. For what a man <hi>knoweth,</hi> he <hi>knoweth</hi>
that he <hi>knoweth.</hi> But no man that erreth doth
know that he erreth: For that is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If I knew that I erred in judgment, I must
know that the thing is otherwise than I judged it
to be: which is impossible to the same under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
at the same time: For then <hi>judging</hi> were
no <hi>judging</hi> as being contrary to knowledge:
When I see such a difficulty about a point, as to
pass <hi>no judgment</hi> at all, but remain in meer sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
then I can easily perceive that I am igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it: But when I pass any judgment, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive that my judgment is false, except
it be in the cure of it, and by the same light which
changeth it: when I err, I can never know that I
err, but <hi>in sensu diviso,</hi> when I cease my error:
when I know that I erred, I so err no longer.
And because every thing which appeareth to us,
doth appear in some kind of light or other, and
appeareth in some form, and as clothed with some
qualities, the understanding therefore presently
hath some thought or other of it: If we take any
notice of it, we shall have some kind of conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and opinion of it: And few things in the
world do appear to us in such equal diverse
shapes, as to leave the understanding wholly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious,
whether it be this or that. Though of
that which hath <hi>no appearance</hi> at all, I am wholly
ignorant, and have no conception. And when
one part of a thing is seen, and many other parts
of it are unseen, we are all apt to conceive of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59262:34"/>
the whole according to the part which we see, and
not allow a just suspension or suspicion for all the
parts which are unseen. That which I see, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me as a thing seen: But that which <hi>I see not,</hi>
is <hi>nothing</hi> to me, and therefore affecteth me not
at all. That part which <hi>I</hi> know, <hi>I</hi> know <hi>that it
is,</hi> &amp; so far, <hi>what it is:</hi> It is in my mind &amp; memory:
But that part which I know not, I know not <hi>that it
is,</hi> or know not <hi>what it is:</hi> so that seeing <hi>one part</hi>
of things, and not seeing <hi>another,</hi> (yea perhaps
<hi>many</hi> others,) doth not only cause our error in
judging of them, but also maketh it very hard, to
question or distrust our judgments: For we must
not be <hi>Scepticks</hi> and doubt of <hi>all things:</hi> Nor must
we deny belief to so much as is revealed to us:
And therefore however at the present we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
things, just such we are usually confident
that they are. And in this difficulty all error and
the lamentable consequences of it do come in.</p>
               <p>But what shall a man do in so hard a streight?
Why this every humble man must do. He must
tread safely, and proceed warily, and try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and try the doctrines offered him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and this by all the means which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him for that use. He must not strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the light; but he must take heed of taking
darkness for light, or hearkening to the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
when he transformeth himself into an angel
of light: (which is not unusual) what cometh
with evidence of truth must be received as truth,
and held fast, and not again let go; however
sometimes it may have a second and third tryal.
And when you see any truth, remember that it
is still with a defective sight, and that you see
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59262:35"/>
but in part: And therefore allow a freedome
in your understandings, to receive the rest. You
are <hi>certain</hi> that you see <hi>not all</hi> that is to be seen,
of any Doctrine or Science, any more than of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
creature: And you are uncertain what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the unknown parts, would have upon that
part which you know, or what alteration it would
make upon your apprehension, if you saw them
altogether in their connexion. Therefore be sure
that in your most confident apprehensions, you
never forget that there is still much more <hi>unknown</hi>
to you than you yet know. And this will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a humility and modesty in your understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and a capacity and fitness to receive more
knowledge: When the forgetting of this, will
make you proud and arrogant and presumptuous,
and like the fool that <hi>rageth</hi> and <hi>is confident,</hi> even
in your ignorance and shame; and will shut up
your minds against that knowledg which you want.</p>
               <p>But especially if you know that your advantages
for knowledge have been less than other mens:
that you are young, or that it is but a few years
since you entred upon the study of the Scriptures,
or that you have not any stronger natural parts
than other men; or that you have not had that
measure of Learning which might further your
knowledge of the holy Scriptures; but that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that differ from you have had much more
of all these helps and means than you; common
reason here commandeth you to be modest, and
not over-confident in your own opinion, nor too
much to slight the judgements of such others.</p>
               <p>Especially if those that differ from you, be not
only more Learned, but as truly conscionable as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59262:35"/>
you, and as like to be unfeigned lovers of truth,
and have prayed more, and meditated more, and
have had more religious experiences than your
selves: And yet more, if they are the <hi>greater
number</hi> of the <hi>godly</hi> that differ from you, and you
are singular in your conceits; in this case rash
confidence in your own opinions, is too palpable
a sign of a religious pride.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But the Learnedst men are not always the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
in the matters of Religion.</hi> Answ. Many men
are Learned in the Languages and Sciences, who
are not Learned in the Scriptures; because they
applyed not their stud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es that way. And many
men are Learned in the Scriptures, and the Sacred
tongues, who yet live in sin, though they are able
to teach the truth for others. But those that well
understand the Scriptures, without Learning the
Languages which they are written in, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of those times and Countreys, or without
much reading and long study both of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themselves, and the writings of them that
better understand them, are so few, so very few, if
any at all, that if you will pretend to be one of
them, you had need of some miracle or something
like a miracle, to make your selves or others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
that you are not deceived. See what I
have said of this at large, in my <hi>Unreasonableness of
Infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The greater number are not always in the
right; therefore why should my singularity discourage
me?</hi> Answ. The greater number through the
<hi>world</hi> are not in the right about Christiany, for
they are not Christians. And the greater number
of vulgar Christians be not in the right perhaps
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59262:36"/>
in many points of Learning, and Scholastick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
because they are not Learned in such
controversies. But all Godly men and Christians
are in the right in all points <hi>essential</hi> to <hi>Godliness</hi>
and <hi>Christianity:</hi> And therefore they are in the
certain way of life. And if in any <hi>integral</hi> or <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental</hi>
point, you think that you are wiser than
the greater part, of men as Learned and as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as your self, you must give very good proof of it
to your self and others, before it is to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
I know that in all ages, God giveth some
few men more excellent <hi>natural</hi> parts, than others:
and he engageth some in deeper and more labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
studies than others: and he blesseth some
mens studies more than others: and therefore there
are still <hi>some few</hi> who know more, than the rest of
the Countrey or of mankind: and it were well
for the rest if they knew these and would learn of
them: But these are such as come to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by <hi>hard and laborious studies and meditation,</hi>
though also by the <hi>spirit</hi> blessing their endeavours:
And they are such as <hi>give proof</hi> of the knowledge
which they pretend to: And they are such as <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy</hi>
their knowledge to preserve the <hi>peace</hi> and
<hi>concord</hi> of believers, and do not proudly make a
stir with it, to set up their own names, though
thereby they set the world on fire.</p>
               <p>Make therefore no more of these vain defences
of your Pride: Let no man think of himself and
his own understanding above what is meet. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you not to deny any truth which indeed
you know, nor to doubt of any thing which is
made truly <hi>certain</hi> to you. But value not your
understandings above their worth, and fix not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59262:36"/>
too rashly upon your first apprehensions; and go
not away with a passionate confidence, in your
poor, raw, untryed and defective conceptions.
But remember that you know but little, and must
have time and labour to grow up to the rest. <hi>Be
not wise in your own conceits.</hi> Rom. 12. 16. &amp; 11.
25. Prov. 26. 5. &amp; 28. 11. And this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the sin of the <hi>slothful,</hi> that never were at
that pains for knowledge, by which it must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
The <hi>sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than
seven men that can render a reason,</hi> Prov. 26. 16.
You little think when you are conceited of your
knowledge, that you are further from wisdom than
a fool. Prov. 26. 12. <hi>Seest thou a man wise in his
own conceit? There is more hope of a fool, than of him.
Be not wise in thy own eyes,</hi> Prov. 3. 3. <hi>Wo to them that
are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own
sight.</hi> Isa. 5. 21. <hi>Be not righteous overmuch, neither
make thy self over-wise: why shouldst thou destroy thy
self?</hi> The self-conceited must become <hi>fools</hi> in
their own esteem, if ever they will be wise, as the
worldly wise must own that which is folly in the
judgment of the world, if ever <hi>they</hi> will be wise:
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>2. And there is a <hi>Religious Pride</hi> of <hi>Goodness,</hi> as
well as of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which must yet more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be avoided, as being yet worse than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as the thing abused is much better. And this
worketh as subtilly and secretly as the former. It
may not only consist with <hi>many complaints</hi> and
<hi>confessions</hi> of <hi>sinfulness, weakness</hi> and <hi>unworthyness,</hi>
but even with <hi>doubts of sincerity</hi> and so much <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedness</hi>
as seemeth to draw near to desparation.
It is an ordinary thing to hear the same persons
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59262:37"/>
talk in a complaining, doubting and almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
manner of speech, and yet to have <hi>high
expectations</hi> of <hi>respect</hi> from others, and to be most
<hi>proudly impatient</hi> of the least <hi>undervaluing</hi> or <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi>
Yea <hi>Pride</hi> will make an <hi>advantage to it self,</hi>
of all these <hi>humble confessions and complaints:</hi> And
it is an old observation, that many are proud of
their <hi>humility:</hi> For though it be true that <hi>Austin</hi>
saith, that <hi>Grace is a thing which no man can use

is not grace:) Yet <hi>objectively</hi> all Grace may be
abused, that is, a man may make it the object of
his Pride, and the occasion of many other
sins.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Religious Pride</hi> of <hi>Goodness,</hi> doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
work under the pretext of <hi>Thankfullness</hi> to
God for his grace, and <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Holyness:</hi> But it
may be known by this, that it always tendeth to
lift us up, and to the diminishing of Love to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
and to the contempt of the weak, and the
censuring of our brethren, and the division and
disturbance of the Church of God. They are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
effects which this Pride produceth, in
the Church and all Societies where it cometh. It

their Pastors, and turneth compassion of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

weaknesses into a sowr contempt: It setteth
a man in his own conceit, so near to God, that he
looketh down on other men, as earthly animals in
comparison of himself. It maketh new terms of
Church-Communion, and teacheth men to make
narrower the door of the Church, than God hath

And to think that the Church is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

are so fit as they, to be the Reformers of the
Church and of the world.</p>
               <p>I intreat those who are in danger of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
sin, to think with themselves. 1. What a
heynous crime and folly it is for one that but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was a child of the Devil, and a sink of sin, to be
proud so quickly of their goodness: And for one
that so lately was groaning and weeping with a
broken heart for a sinful life, to be already puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up with the conceits of godlyness. And for one
who daily maketh confession to God, of a sinful
heart, and a faulty life, and of great unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to contradict all this by an over-valuing of his
own piety; And how incongruous it is for one,
who professeth to hope for justification by free
grace &amp; mercy only, &amp; to have nothing of his own
but what's defiled, and who abhorreth the Doctrine
of merit, and talketh so much of our emptyness
and insufficiency, to be yet puffed up with the
conceit of his spirituality and worth. And what
an odious self-con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>radiction it is, to make your
self like the Devil in pride, because you think you
are like God in holiness.</p>
               <p>2. And consider, that the more you are proud
of your <hi>Goodness,</hi> the less you have to be proud of:
If this sin be predominant, it is certain that you
have no saving grace at all: And what an odious
thing and miserable case is it, to be proud of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness,
when you are unholy; and to be damned
both for <hi>want</hi> of it, and for being <hi>proud</hi> of it:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59262:38"/>
That a man should be proud of that, for want of
which he must suffer the fire of Hell! But if your
pride be not predominant, yet it is certain that in
what measure soever you have that vice, in that
measure you are destitute of grace: For true
grace and pride are as contrary as life and
death.</p>
               <p>3. And study well the meaning of all these
Scriptures (For you shall not say that I mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
them to you.) Why was it that Christ
mentioneth the Parable of the Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

bad as others, and the other thinking himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to look up to heaven. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10, 11.
&amp;c. Why did he give us the parable of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
who confesseth that he was unworthy to be
called a Son; and of his elder brother who swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with envy at his entertainment? Why was it
that Christ seemed not strict enough to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
in keeping the Sabbath, nor in his Diet, nor
in his Company, but they called him a glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
person and a wine-bibber, and a friend of
Publicans and sinners? Was it not because <hi>their
Pride</hi> and superstition made them think too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their own religiousness? and to make sins
and duties which God never made, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the innocent for want of this humane reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giousness?

and seriously of spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

the difference of their guifts and speech from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
made me think confidently that the one

had nothing almost of God at all: Till ere

and another fell to the foulest <hi>heresie;</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to disturb the Churches peace by turbulent

shall be said to be <hi>no professor,</hi> and so to be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>Mistake me not: I know that though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
may be without sincerity, yet sincerity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without some profession, when there is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to make it: And I know that Grace is
a vital principle, and like fire which will work
and seek a vent if you would restrain it: And
that Gifts of utterance are great mercies of God
for the Edification of the Church. But here lyeth
your unhappy errour in this case. 1. You take
the <hi>common profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> to be <hi>no profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
at all, because there is wanting a profession of
<hi>greater zeal</hi> and forwardness. When as the <hi>common
sort</hi> of people in this Land, do profess to stand to
their baptismal Covenant, in which they own the
essential parts of Godliness and Christianity, and
all that is of absolute necessity to Salvation. He
that truly understandeth the baptismal Covenant,
and Consenteth to it, doth perform all which is
necessary to a state of grace: If he profess this,
he professeth, both true faith and repentance, and
sanctification and mortification, and all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make a man a Christian. How then
can you say that these are no <hi>Professors?</hi> I tell you
(except a few Apostates) the common sort of
people in this Land are Professors of true faith
and godliness! Whether they are <hi>true Professors</hi>
without dissembling is another question; but they
are <hi>professors</hi> of the <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59262:40"/>
If you say, that Their ignorance and ungodly
lives doth shew that they either understand not
the baptismal Covenant, or Consent not to it.
I answer, Mark well what you say your selves:
For this doth but shew that they are <hi>Hypocrites:</hi>
You cannot say then that they are <hi>no Professors,</hi>
but that they are <hi>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sembling professors.</hi> They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the truth, they do not truly and uprightly
profess it. I tell you, all the common sort of the
people in <hi>England,</hi> are either Saints or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:
see how I have moved this to them in my
Treatise called <hi>The formal Hypocrite.</hi> They all
profess enough to save them if they sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
it. He that is baptized and professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Christian, and yet is a drunkard, a swearer,
a fornicator, or such like, is certainly an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
as going against his own profession: The
very Creed, Lords Prayer and Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have enough to condemn him as an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.
And will you now come in, and justifie
these men from their <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> by saying that they
are no <hi>Professors?</hi> If they were no Professors, they
could be no <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but meer Atheists or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
I know that those are the <hi>highest</hi> sort of
<hi>Hypocrites,</hi> who counterfeit the highest zeal and
piety, by the highest profession: But this is but a
difference in <hi>degree.</hi> Who ever professeth to be a
Christian, professeth true Repentance, faith and
holiness, and is an Hypocrite if he be not a Saint.</p>
               <p>And then Consider, that if you would exclude
any of these from the Communion of the Church,
it must not be because they are <hi>no professors,</hi> but
because they are hypocrites, ignorant or scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous?
And if so, then no man must be shut out,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59262:40"/>
but upon <hi>sufficient proof:</hi> An unproved hypocrite
or sinner, is <hi>no hypocrite</hi> or <hi>sinner</hi> in the judgment
of the Church: and therefore Hypocrites are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a great part of the visible Church. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Church-Communion would be founded on
meer injustice and tyranny, if men shall be called
Ignorant, Scandalous and Hypocrites without
proof. And therefore to exclude baptized profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
by whole Parishes or Multitudes, without
bringing proof against each person one by one, is
quite to over-turn Christs rules and order, and
Church Constitutions and all Church justice. I
confess it is the thing which I have long lamented
(and often written of especially in my Treatise of
<hi>Confirmation)</hi> that those who are baptized in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
are not called to a more explicite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
profession of the Covenant then made,
and have not a more solemn transition into the
number of adult Communicants: And we are
not out of hope that this may at last be brought to
pass. But in the mean time, the <hi>same persons</hi>
though <hi>less regularly</hi> do make <hi>profession</hi> of the same
thing both at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> and in their <hi>publick
worship,</hi> and in their common <hi>claim</hi> to the faith and
honour of Christianity, so that all such must be

vilisie Religion, by over-hasty accusing of higher

seem sufficient in the things of God; yet God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59262:41"/>
would have me bear witness to this truth to cure
some mens contrary extream: that as this age as
is said, doth need no proof, how heinously <hi>high
professors</hi> may miscarry; so in the place where I
exercised my Ministry, I found some give me a
satisfying evidence in their last sickness, that they
had long lived a truly godly life, who were never
noted by their Neighbours, for any extraordinary
zeal at all. If you ask me, How can it stand with
grace to be so much hid? I answer, They made the
<hi>common profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity:</hi> they usually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the publick worship: they lived blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
in their places: but they were of silent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
dispositions, and were inferiours who by
their superiours were restrained from <hi>private
meetings</hi> and some converse with more zealous
persons which they desired. And for ought you
know there may be very many such; who must
not be rejected as <hi>no professors,</hi> nor without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
accusation and proof: unless you would be
used in the like kind your selves.</p>

               <p>IT is the loathsome scab of the Romish Church
that they who will be taken for <hi>Religious,</hi> must
go into a Monastery of Fryars and Nans, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate

themselves from the rest of Christians, as
worldly secular people: that so their <hi>Religion</hi>
may be a <hi>noted thing,</hi> &amp; they may be set up in their
singularity, as publike spectacles, for the world
to admire: Though perhaps they come thither
but under the gripes of Conscience, to expiate
the guilt of whoredome, murder, or some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
sins, which the contemned seculars ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
committed. And it is somewhat easie to
proud corrupted nature to enter into a life of
greater self-denial, than most Monasticks are put
upon, when by it they shall be thus separated
from the rest of mankind, as a people of more
admired holiness. To set our selves up in a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
society, as persons whom the world must
account more Religious than the common sort
of Christians, hath so much oftentation in it,
as is a great allurement to Pride. For many a
one who perceiveth how childish a thing it is, to
set out ones self to be observed for <hi>fine cloathes,</hi>
or for bodily <hi>comeliness,</hi> or for <hi>high entertainments,
curiosities,</hi> houses, lands or such vanities, doth
yet think that it is an excellent thing, to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by men, especially by the wisest and the
best, as a person of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and
<hi>Goodness.</hi> And indeed it is the truest and the
highest Honour to be <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good:</hi> And it is
exceeding natural to man to desire honour: And
it is lawful to have a due and moderate sense and
regard to our honour: And all this being so,
how easie is it for Pride to take this advantage,
and to go a little farther, while we think that we
go but this far, and keep within our bounds.</p>
               <p>And the root of the errour lyeth in <hi>Atheism,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59262:42"/>
Self-fishness,</hi> and <hi>Carnality.</hi> By the first, we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the <hi>Honouring</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which should be our
utmost aim, and to which all our <hi>own Honour</hi>
should be purely referred, as a means: By the
second, we <hi>Idolize</hi> our <hi>selves,</hi> and are sunk into,
and centered in our <hi>selves,</hi> and seek that honour
to our <hi>selves,</hi> which we should wholly refer to
God alone. And by the third, we over-value
<hi>Man</hi> and his esteem, and live upon the thoughts
and breath of mortals, and seek the honour which
is given by one to another more than the honour
which is of God: Whereas we should make it
our grand care and study, to be pleasing to our
Maker, which is the highest honour, and lawful
and necessary to be sought; and should be more
indifferent as to the esteem and thoughts of man,
as being no further regardable, than it conduceth
to our divine and ultimate end.</p>
               <p>And when Pride hath thus turned the eye of
the soul, from God, to our <hi>selves,</hi> and to the
<hi>Creature,</hi> it is a <hi>working sin,</hi> and will be alwayes
seeking to fetch in fewel for its self to feed on,
and to find out wayes to make our selves conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and observed in the world: And to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
our selves into distinct societies, that the
<hi>world may see</hi> we are <hi>above Communion</hi> with the
colder duller sort of Christians, is one of the
most notable means to this self-exalting end.</p>
               <p>And many Christians that are more humble do
yet so much mis-understand the Scripture prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Communion, that they think they
should corrupt the Church, and sin against God,
if they stood not in a <hi>separated state</hi> from those of
the colder sort. And this is caused much, by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59262:42"/>
taking those Scriptutes to speak of all cold and
carnal Christians, which speak only of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and Infidel world. And this cometh to
pass by the happiness of their <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>breeding:</hi>
because they are born and bred where there are
almost none, but professed Christians, and
they see not the swarms of Heathens that worship
idols and creatures, or of the Infidels who scorn
and persecute the Christian name, therefore they
live as if there were no such persons. They know
that the world and the <hi>Church</hi> comprehend all
mankind; and that the <hi>Church</hi> is gathered out of
the <hi>World:</hi> And because they <hi>see</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> but
see not the <hi>world,</hi> out of which it is gathered;
therefore they are looking for the <hi>world</hi> in the
<hi>Church,</hi> and think that the commoner sort of
Christians are the <hi>World;</hi> and the better and
more zealous sort only are the <hi>Church,</hi> which
therefore must be gathered out of the <hi>World:</hi>
And so they gather the <hi>Church</hi> out of the <hi>Church,</hi>
while they think that they gather it out of the
<hi>World.</hi> And all this is because they know no
more than they see, or at least are affected with
no more; but live as if <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Europe</hi> were
all the world. One years abode in <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>
might cure this errour.</p>
               <p>In 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 12, 13, &amp;c.</hi> the Apostle forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Christians to marry with Infidels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>light hath no communion with darkness, nor
righteousness with unrighteousness, nor Christ with
Belial.</hi> And therefore inferreth, that he that
<hi>believeth hath no part with an Infidel, nor the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God any any agreement with Idols.</hi> And for
this he citeth the words of the Prophet, <hi>Come
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59262:43"/>
out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch
not the unclean thing.</hi> All these words which the
Apostle so plainly speaketh only against marrying
with Infidels and Idolaters, and having commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them, either <hi>intimately</hi> or in their <hi>sin,</hi>
are by abundance of ignorant Professors abused,
as if they had commanded us to separate from the
colder and common sort of Christians, and to
<hi>come out</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> whereof they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
What profaning of Gods word is this?
and how gross and palpable a contradicting of its
plain expressions? It was a Church of such mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christians as our Churches do consist of, to
which the Apostle wrote those words; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he commandeth them to separate from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy
with <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> (yet so as when
they are once married to them, to continue in
it); therefore these men say, that one part
of the Church is called to come forth and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the rest.</p>
               <p>And with the like abuse they apply the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>[Come out of Babylon]</hi> to them that have
no communion with <hi>Babylon;</hi> And when <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
uncharitableness,</hi> and <hi>passion,</hi> have taught
them to call Christs Churches <hi>Babylon,</hi> they add
sin to sin, the sin of separation to the sin of slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and reproach; and abuse the Text according

to our private fancies: We are not the

the Rule, and see there of what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the Visible Church hath been constituted in
all ages of the world till now. In the first Church
in <hi>Adams</hi> family, a <hi>Cain,</hi> was the first born
member, and so continued, till he was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
for the murder of his brother. In a
Church of eight persons who were saved out of
all the world, the Father and Pastor was overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with gross drunkenness, and one of his sons
was a cursed <hi>Cham.</hi> In a Church of six persons
saved from the wickedness of <hi>Sodom,</hi> two of them
<hi>(Lot</hi>'s sons in law) perished in the flames among
the unbelievers: a third was turned into a pillar
of salt: the Father and Pastor was drunk two
nights together, after the sight of such a terrible
miracle, and after so strange a deliverance to
himself: and committed incest twice in his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness:
The two that remained (his daughters)
caused his drunkenness purposely and committed
incest with him. In the Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
there was an <hi>Ishmael:</hi> And in the Church
in <hi>Isaacs</hi> family there was an <hi>Esau:</hi> and even
<hi>Rebeka</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> guilty of deceitful equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> denied their wives
to save themselves in their unbelief. In <hi>Iacob</hi>'s
family was a <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who murdered
multitudes under a pretense of Religion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the cover of false deceit: And almost all his
sons moved with envy, sold their brother <hi>Ioseph</hi>
for a slave; and some were hardly kept from
murdering him: And his daughter <hi>Dinah</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59262:44"/>
by desiring to see the company and fashions
of the world. In the Church of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in
the Wilderness, after all the miracles which they
had seen, and the mercies they had received, so
great were their sins of unbelief and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and lust, and whoredomes, and idolatry, and
disobedience, that but two of them that came out
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were permitted to enter the promised
land: In the times of the Judges they so oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
their idolatry, besides all their other sins,
that they spent a great part of all those ages in
captivity for it. And when the villanies of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah</hi>
had imitated the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and ravished a
woman to death, the Tribe of the <hi>Benjamites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it by a war, and that in three battels, till
fourty thousand of the innocent <hi>Israelites</hi> were
slain, and twenty five thousand of the <hi>Benjamites.</hi>
Look through all the Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the <hi>Kings,</hi>
and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> from the sad
story of the sons of <hi>Eli</hi> and of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to all the
wicked Kings that followed, who kept up odious
Idolatry (even <hi>Solomon</hi> himself) and scarce two
or three of the best did put down the high places:
And when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was zealous to reform, the
hearts of the subjects were not prepared, but
derided or abused the Messengers whom he sent
about, to call the people home to God: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi>'s
wickedness is scarcely to be parallel'd:
And when God sent his Prophets to call them to
repentance, they mocked his Messengers, and

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59262:45"/>

to sin, by setting up Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and
<hi>Beth-el,</hi> and making Priests of the vilest of the
people, and forsaking the Temple and the true
worship of God, and the lawful Priests. And
these lawful Priests at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were ravening
Wolves, and greedy Dogs, and careless and cruel
Shepherds: The false Prophets who deceived
the people were most accepted: The people are
accused of cruelty, oppression, whoredom, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
Idolatry, and hatred of those that would
reform them. They were grievous persecutors:
<hi>Which of the Prophets did not your fathers kill and
persecute?</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. Yet this
was the Church of God, and many think his <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visible Church:</hi> And all these twelve Tribes
were not so big as <hi>England,</hi> and were to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all the Earth, no more than one tree to a
large Wood or Forrest.</p>
               <p>But doubtless the Gospel Church was both
more large and pure. Let us therefore take a
view of it: And I beseech you remember, that
what I say is not to make sin less odious, nor the
Church or Godly less esteemed: but to shew
you the frame of the <hi>visible Church</hi> in all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and how it differeth from the <hi>invisible;</hi> lest
you should take on you to be wiser than God, and
to build his house after a better rule than his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and the primitive pattern, and marr all by
being wise in your own conceits, and by being
righteous overmuch. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. And I pray you
forget not, that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> was the
<hi>most pure,</hi> and the <hi>pattern</hi> of those following; and
had <hi>inspired Apostles</hi> to be its <hi>Guides,</hi> and <hi>inspired
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59262:45"/>
Prophets</hi> to be its <hi>Helpers,</hi> and abundance of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
and extraordinary gifts, to <hi>gather</hi> and <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
it; to silence its enemies, and to terrifie and
restrain offenders, and to bring up the Church
to the highest degree of holiness that could be
well expected. And withall, the Members were
not <hi>driven in by force</hi> by Magistrates, nor <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured</hi>
by any <hi>worldly commodities,</hi> but were a
<hi>few Volunteers,</hi> who in a time of persecution,
professed Christ, to their hazard or suffering in
the world. Yet see what they were.</p>
               <p>The faultiness of the Teachers.</p>
               <p>The Apostles before the death of Christ,
though they had so long heard his doctrine, and
seen his miracles, understood not that he must
die for our sins, and be buried, and rise again,
and ascend into Heaven, and there intercede for
us, and rule the Church. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 16. and 10. 6.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 34. and 9. 45. and 24. 43, 44, 45. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
so much perswaded Christ from that suffering
by which the world was to be redeemed, that
Christ speaketh to him as he did to the Devil.
<hi>Matth. 4. Get thee behind me Satan; for thou sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourest
not the things that be of God, but those that be

<hi>for fire from heaven</hi> to destroy the unbelieving
adversaries of the Gospel, and knew not of what
spirit they were. <hi>Iudas</hi> was one that was sent out
to preach the Gospel by Christ himself, (who
knew his heart.) Many that preached and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
and cast out Devils in his name, were
workers of iniquity, whom he never knew with

have been cast out. But these are the uses which I

                     <p>First, before you judge any Church to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Churches, as if their communion in worship

from any as judging communion with them

               <head>DIRECT. VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Understand well the different conditions and
terms of Communion with the Church as
invisible and as visible; and the different
priviledges of the Members; that so you
may not presume to impose any conditions
which God hath not imposed; nor yet to
grudge at the reception of those that are not
sanctified and sincere.</head>
               <p>ALL Christians are agreed that it belongeth
to God only to make the conditions of
Church-communion; and therefore it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to us to invent them, nor to our wit to
censure what God hath done, but to search the
Scripture till we find it out, and then obey it.
This is the great controversie which hath trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Church: When men know not who
should be Members of the Church and who not,
and when they have no certain rule or character
to know whom they must receive, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if confusion and contention be the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and practice of such Churches. And here the
Pastors have torn the Church, by running into
contrary extreams. Some have thought that the
Visible Church must be constituted only of such
persons as satisfie the Pastors and the people of
the truth of their sanctification, by some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
account of their conversion or the work of
grace upon their hearts, in a distincter manner
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59262:51"/>
than the ancient Church required of the baptized:
Wherein being agreed of no certain terms, to
know anothers sanctification by, their Churches
are diversified according to the measure of the
strictness or largeness, censoriousness or charity
of the Pastors &amp; the people; while one thinks that
person to have true grace, whom another thinks to
have done. And so they that will be <hi>most unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
do pretend to the reputation of being the
<hi>most pure;</hi> because they are <hi>most strict:</hi> And multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
are shut out whom Christ would have to be
received, &amp; his <hi>children</hi> are numbred with the <hi>dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other side there is one or two of late
among us, who think that the Church is but
<hi>Christs School,</hi> where he <hi>teacheth the way</hi> to true
Regeneration; and not a <hi>Society of professed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
ones</hi> or <hi>Saints:</hi> And that all who own
Christ as the <hi>Teacher</hi> of the Church, and submit
to the <hi>Government of the Pastors,</hi> and are willing to
learn how to be regenerate, should be baptized,
though they profess not any <hi>special saving faith or
repentance.</hi> And their reasons are, because first, else
all that doubt of their sincerity must <hi>lie,</hi> or be
kept out. Secondly, because that in the Church
of the Jews, the multitude were such as were
<hi>openly ungodly.</hi> And some of the Papists talk also
at this rate, though indeed they are themselves yet
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tterly unresolved in this point.</p>
               <p>What Church soever is constituted according
to either of these <hi>two opinions,</hi> will not be consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
according to the mind of Christ: But yet
with this difference: The first Opinion introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
Church-<hi>tyranny,</hi> and <hi>injustice,</hi> and is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the want of <hi>Christian charity,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59262:51"/>
and tendeth to endless separations and
confusions. But the second opinion inferreth all
these greater mischiefs.</p>
               <p>First, it confoundeth the <hi>Catechumens</hi> with the
<hi>Christians,</hi> and maketh all <hi>Christians</hi> who are but
willing to learn to be Christians. Secondly, it
maketh the Christian Church to consist of such as
<hi>are no Christians:</hi> As that person certainly is not,
who consenteth not that Christ be his Teacher,
Priest and King: For to such a one, he is <hi>no Christ;</hi>
seeing these are the essential parts of his <hi>Mediatory
office.</hi> And the new device of distinguishing <hi>Christs
Apostolike</hi> and <hi>Mediatory offices,</hi> &amp; so the <hi>Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate</hi>
and the <hi>Church regenerate</hi> accordingly, will
not seem to difend this conceit. For as Christ is
not <hi>divided,</hi> so his office for which he is called
<hi>Christ</hi> is but <hi>One,</hi> which entirely is called the office
of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> or <hi>Redeemer,</hi> or <hi>Mediator,</hi> which are all
one: And the essential parts of it are, first his
Priestly, second Teaching and Ruling offices or
works: And this which is called his <hi>Apostleship,</hi> is
but the same which is called his <hi>Teaching</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Office,</hi> and is a part of his <hi>Mediatory</hi> or
<hi>saving Office.</hi> And he is <hi>no Christian,</hi> nor is that
any <hi>Congregated Christian Church,</hi> which profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not to take Christ for his <hi>Mediator</hi> his <hi>Priest</hi>
and <hi>King,</hi> as well as for an <hi>Apostle</hi> a <hi>Prophet</hi> or
<hi>Teacher.</hi> Thirdly, they therefore who hold the
aforesaid doctrine, do introduce a new sort of
Christianity. Fourthly, and a new sort of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
which the Church of Christ never knew to
this day. And therefore they do ingenuously
profess their dissent from our form or words in
Baptism, because we put the baptized to renounce
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59262:52"/>
the flesh the world and the devil, and to use such
covenanting words as must signifie special grace.
But through the great mercy of God, Baptism is
still the same thing in all the Christian Churches
in the world, the Reformed, the <hi>Roman,</hi> the
<hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> yea and the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> too,
for all their seeming reiteration of it. And Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
among them all, is the same now as it hath
been in all Generations, from Christs institution
of it. So that we fully maintain as well as the
<hi>Romans,</hi> that Christianity hath by <hi>this sacred Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
been safely delivered down to us to this
day. What a Christian is, and what Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is, may be most certainly known, by this which
is commonly called our <hi>Christening;</hi> In which the
profession and covenant which maketh men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
is so express and unchanged from age to
age. Therefore these men who would have our
Baptism changed, do speak plainly, but impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently;
as if they were raised in the end of the
world, to reform the Baptism and Christianity
of all ages, and were not only wiser than the
universal Church from Christ till now, but also
at last must make the Church another thing. I
intreat the Reader who would know the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all antiquity about Baptism, as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
saving grace, to read those numerous citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in the Margin of his book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Davenant,</hi> of Baptism. Fifthly, and by
this new doctrine they destroy all that <hi>special
Love</hi> which Church-members or visible Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
as such, should bear to one another. For if
no <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>consent</hi> must necessarily be professed at
Baptism, but that which is <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>ungodly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59262:52"/>
and children</hi> of the devil, then <hi>all Church-members
as only such,</hi> must be taken to be but ungodly, and
no man must love a Church-member as such,
with a special love, as a visible Saint; but only
as one of the hopefuller sort of the ungodly. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and hence it will follow, that either <hi>none</hi> must
make <hi>any profession</hi> of <hi>saving Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi>
(and so all appearance of holiness must be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of the world) or else the Church must
be constituted of two sorts of professions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
<hi>tota specie</hi> distinct from one another;
yea more distinct than Infidels are from their new
sort of Christians. And consequently it must
needs be indeed <hi>two Churches</hi> and not one, <hi>viz.
One Church</hi> of those who take Christ for their
<hi>Teacher only,</hi> and another of those that take him
<hi>entirely as Christ.</hi> Seventhly, and by this rule
the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who confess Christ
to be a <hi>great Teacher,</hi> but deny him to be the <hi>Priest</hi>
and <hi>sacrifice</hi> for sin, may be <hi>baptized,</hi> and taken
for <hi>Christians.</hi> These and many more absurdities
follow upon this new conceit. But I must desire
the Reader who would see more of it, to peruse
my Disputations about <hi>Right to Sacraments,</hi> where
it is handled at large.</p>
               <p>As to their Objections I answer. First, no
man is called to <hi>lie,</hi> nor yet are they <hi>fearful</hi> to be
shut out: For as no man is perfectly acquainted
with his own heart, so no man is to profess a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of it: But if a man speak as he
thinketh upon faithful endeavours to avoid self-deceit,
no more can be expected of him. He
that can say [Though I am not certain that there
is no secret fraud in my heart, yet as far as I can
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59262:53"/>
discern it, I am willing to be a Christian upon
the terms of Gods Covenant, and to take Christ
for my Teacher, Priest and King] must offer
himself, and must be received into the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and as to the Jews case, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the fore-mentioned Disputations, First,
that it was no less than a profession of saving
faith, which was made in the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.
Secondly, that men were then to be
put to death, for almost all those enormous crimes
which we now excommunicate men for: And the
dead are not members of the Church on earth.
Thirdly, that all that in <hi>matter of fact</hi> was found
among them contrary to this, was contrary to
Gods Law: And to argue against the Law from
mans breach of the Law, <hi>a facto contra jus,</hi> is very
bad arguing. Fourthly, that it is farre surer and
clearer reasoning about the Evangelical state and
order of the Church, from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than from
the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> much more than from the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
of that law. Fifthly, but yet all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Churches, as I have cited and
proved them before, do shew us the difference
between the Church as <hi>visibly Congregate,</hi> and as
<hi>Regenerate;</hi> and shew us that the presence of
<hi>scandalous sinners,</hi> will not warrant us to <hi>separate</hi>
or to unchurch the Church. And this may suffice
against that errour.</p>
               <p>The true conditions of admittance into the
Church and state of Christianity are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A true belief in God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, and a Devoting of our selves sincerely to
Him, as our reconciled Father our Saviour, and our
Sanctifier, in a resolved Covenant, or Consent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59262:53"/>
the Devil, the world, and the flesh, <hi>(expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or impliedly) is the whole and the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of our Communion with the Church my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
or the living body of Christ (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
The Church, <hi>in the first and most famous
sense.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If this must be wrought in us before we are in
the mystical Church, then a state of holiness may be
found in such, as are yet out of the body of Christ in the
world: But if this be after our entrance into the Church,
than less may sufficiently qualifie us for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is neither <hi>before</hi> not <hi>after:</hi> but it
is our <hi>change and entrance it self.</hi> To be a <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of the <hi>Church mystical,</hi> and to be a <hi>Christian</hi> is
all one: And this is <hi>Christianity.</hi> If I should say
that the <hi>making a man a Rational free agent, is the
making him a member of the Rational world;</hi> would
you think that this must be either antecedent or
consequent to his change, which is nothing else but
the change it self?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That which maketh a man a member
of the Vniversal Church as Visible, is his Baptism.
Which is, his profession of the same true Faith afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
and consent to the Covenant; or his visible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as
his Reconciled Father, his Saviour and Sanctifier,
by a Vow and Covenant in Baptism.</p>
               <p>Where note that Baptism hath two parts: The
<hi>Covenant</hi> there made and openly declared between
God and Man: And the <hi>Sacramental, obsigning
and investing sign;</hi> which is the <hi>washing in water.</hi>
The <hi>Profession</hi> it self, or <hi>open covenanting with God,</hi>
is the thing statedly necessary to the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59262:54"/>
Christianity:</hi> And the <hi>washing with water,</hi> is
<hi>necessary</hi> as a duty where it may be had, and as a
<hi>means</hi> to the <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> entrance; by which
the <hi>Church</hi> is commonly to judge who are its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
members and who not. As <hi>inward consent</hi>
and <hi>outward profession</hi> of <hi>consent,</hi> and <hi>publike solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,</hi>
are the necessaries to a state of marriage;
the first being as the <hi>soul,</hi> the second as the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and the third as the <hi>wedding garments;</hi> so is
it in this case. So that in short, if you take <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism</hi>
aright for the <hi>Covenant</hi> and the <hi>Sign,</hi> there
is no other entrance into the Visible Church, nor
any other condition necessary to a title to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
But if you take Baptism improperly,
for the <hi>was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing</hi> alone, there is no <hi>title</hi> to such
<hi>washing</hi> necessary but <hi>Professed faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
So that if you require more, or invent and
impose any further conditions, and deny <hi>baptized
professors of Christianity</hi> to be <hi>visible members</hi> of the
Church, you are superstitious devisers of a way
of your own, and makers of <hi>will-worship,</hi> and not
obedient submitters to the way of God.</p>
               <p>Profession then of <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>consent to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
is our <hi>title-condition</hi> to communion with the
Universal Visible Church. This profession must
be solemn, and solemnized under the hand of a
Minister of Christ, who hath the Keyes of the
Church, or Kingdom of heaven; that it may be
satisfactory to the Church, and valid at its barre.
Those that are baptized at age, have present
Right to communion with the adult. Those that
are baptized in Infancy (upon good right) are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to such <hi>Infant-communion</hi> as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of. And at years of discretion, they themselves
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59262:54"/>
must own the Covenant, which their Parents ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them into. The more solemnly this is done
(as it was in baptism) the better it is: But
if it be done but by a professing themselves to
be Christians, and attending Christs ordinances
with his Church, it is valid; unless they forfeit
the credit of their profession, by proved Heresies
or crimes in which they live impenitently.</p>
               <p>But then it must be here observed, what a
<hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> is, which intitleth to
Baptism and Church-communion. And <hi>objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
it must be the <hi>whole Baptismal Covenant</hi> that must
be professed: No less is to be taken as a <hi>profession
of Christianity:</hi> And as <hi>to the Act,</hi> it must be
first, <hi>A signification</hi> of the mind, by <hi>word</hi> or <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
or some intelligible <hi>sign.</hi> Secondly, it must
<hi>seem</hi> to be <hi>understood:</hi> For no man consenteth to
that which he <hi>understandeth not.</hi> But herein any
intelligible sign of a <hi>tollerable understanding</hi> must
be accepted, though we find that the persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are raw and not so distinct and clear
as they ought, nor the expressions ready, orderly or
compt. Thirdly, it must seem to be <hi>serious:</hi> For
that which is apparently dissembled or Iudicrous
is null: Fourthly, It must be <hi>de presenti,</hi> a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
giving</hi> up our selves to Christ, and not <hi>only</hi> a
promise <hi>de futuro,</hi> that we will hereafter take
him for our <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> and not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Fifthly, it must <hi>seem</hi> to be <hi>voluntary,</hi> and
not constrained: for then it is not serious. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it must <hi>seem</hi> to be <hi>deliberate,</hi> and <hi>resolute,</hi> and
<hi>setled,</hi> and not only the effect of a mutable passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This goeth to make it a real <hi>Profession</hi> in the
common sense of all mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59262:55"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But how few among us do so much as seem!
be understanding, serious, and resolved in covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In the <hi>Degree</hi> of these <hi>we all</hi> fall short
of that which is our <hi>duty:</hi> But if you accuse any
of the want of so much as is necessary to an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Profession;</hi> First, you must be sure that
you speak not by <hi>uncharitable surmise</hi> and <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi>
but upon <hi>certain proof</hi> or <hi>knowledge.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that therefore you speak it not at a venture
of <hi>whole Parishes</hi> or <hi>families,</hi> but only of <hi>those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
by <hi>name,</hi> whom you know to be guilty. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that you remember that it is the <hi>Pastors
office</hi> to <hi>judge,</hi> and that you expect not that every
one must give an account of their knowledge <hi>to
you:</hi> And if there be a mis-judging, it is the fault
of the <hi>Pastor,</hi> and not <hi>yours</hi> (of which more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.)
Fourthly, that persons <hi>Baptized</hi> are <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi>
admitted into the Church, and therefore if
they make profession of Christianity, they must
not be put to bring any other proof of their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
but it lies on you to <hi>disprove it,</hi> if you will
have it questioned. And to reject them from
communion without a proved accusation, is <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
and <hi>Lording</hi> it over the Church of God.
These are Gods terms of Church-communion;
And if you will needs have stricter, you must have
none of his making but your own.</p>
               <p>Obj. But all visible Christians and Churches, are
visible Saints and Regenerate; and so are not ours.</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>To be a</hi> Visible Saint, <hi>is to</hi> profess to be
a Saint: <hi>And whosoever doth</hi> profess the Baptismal
Covenant <hi>professeth to be</hi> a Saint. <hi>Conversion,
Regeneration Faith and Repentance, are all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59262:55"/>
contained, into</hi> taking God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, for our Father, Saviour, and Sanctifier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may teach a Parrot to speak those words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Its true: And perhaps to speak any
words which you use your selves: But if you will
thence conclude that words must not be taken as
a <hi>Profession,</hi> you grosly err, or abusively wrangle;
or if you infer thence that your neighbour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
himself no more than a Parrot doth,
you must prove what you say to the <hi>Pastor</hi> of the
Church: For God hath not allowed him to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi>
baptized persons, because you say that
they are ignorant. And if they are willing to learn
it is fitter to teach them than <hi>to excommunicate them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I must lament it, that I have met
with many censorious Professors, who would not
communicate with the Parish Churches, because
the <hi>people</hi> are <hi>ignorant,</hi> who, when I have exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>themselves,</hi> have proved <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>very
substance of Christianity,</hi> so that I have been much
in doubt whether I ought to admit them to the
Lords Table or not. They knew not whether
Christ was <hi>Eternal,</hi> or whether he was <hi>God when
he was on earth,</hi> or whether he be <hi>Man now he is
in heaven;</hi> nor what <hi>Faith</hi> is, or what <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Sanctification</hi> is, nor what the <hi>Covenant</hi> of
grace is; nor what <hi>Baptism</hi> or the <hi>Lords Super</hi>
are; nor could prove the Scripture to be the
word of God, or prove mans soul to be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
but gave false or impertinent answers about
all these: And yet could not joyn with the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And next I desire you here to observe the
<hi>different Priviledges,</hi> as well as the different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59262:56"/>
of <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Invisible</hi> Churchmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership.</p>
               <p>The members of the Church mystical or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
have the pardon of all sin, and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance
with God, and communion with him and
with his Church in the spirit, and are the adopted
children of God, and heirs of everlasting life,
and shall live in heaven with Christ for ever.</p>
               <p>The meer <hi>Visible</hi> Members of the Church, that
are not regenerate by the <hi>spirit</hi> as well as sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
by <hi>water,</hi> have only an <hi>outward Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
with the Saints, and have only the <hi>Bread and
Wine</hi> in the Sacrament, and only a <hi>name to live</hi>
when they are dead. And are these such great
matters that we should envy them to poor sinners
that must have no more? Have <hi>we</hi> the <hi>Kernel,</hi> and
do we envy them the <hi>Shell?</hi> Have we the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
and do we envy them the <hi>flesh,</hi> or <hi>outward signes</hi>
alone?</p>
               <p>Yea consider farther, that it is more for the
sake of the truly faithful, than for their own, that
all Hypocrites have their station and priviledges
in the Church: God maketh use of their <hi>Gifts</hi>
and <hi>Profession</hi> for his elect; to many great servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Church: And is it not then a foolish
ingratitude in us, to murmur at their presence?</p>
               <p>Understand well the conditions and Reasons of
this visible state of membership, and how far it
is below the state of the Regenerate, and it will
turn your separating murmuring into a thankful
acknowledgment of the wisdom of God.</p>

               <p>I have cited so many Texts against division
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59262:60"/>
and for the Unity of the Church and concord of

of them, without expositions or argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should utterly mortifie all inclination to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and hard censures, in all true believers:
yea so many Texts as I am perswaded many that
most need them, will think it tedious to read
them over. And yet I have cause to fear lest
many such will <hi>feel</hi> as little of the <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of them, as if there were no such words in

               <p>Out of all these you may gather, these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the necessity of Unity, and of the evil
of schism or division.</p>
               <p>First, It is <hi>One God, One Head, One Saviour,</hi>
and <hi>One Holy Spirit,</hi> into whose name we are
all baptized. Secondly, It is <hi>One Covenant</hi> which
all in Baptism make with this <hi>One God.</hi> Thirdly,
It is <hi>One Spirit</hi> by which we are all <hi>regenerated,</hi>
and <hi>One new Nature</hi> which is in all the truly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.
Fourthly, It is <hi>One Gospel</hi> or holy word
of God, which is to us all, the seed of our new
birth, the rule of our faith and lives; and the
foundation of our <hi>hope,</hi> and must be our daily me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
and delight, and the food on which the
children of Gods family must all live. Fifthly,
It is <hi>One Body</hi> of Christ, whereof we are all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
As Christ is not divided, so his Body, that
is his Church, both as Mystical, and as Visible,
is but <hi>One;</hi> however the Members and their <hi>Gifts</hi>
and degrees of grace are many. Sixthly, It is
<hi>One way</hi> of Faith and Holiness which all must
walk in. Seventhly, And it is <hi>One end</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59262:61"/>
which we all expect; and in <hi>One Heaven</hi>
that we must meet and live for ever (so many as
are sincere in the faith which we profess): And
in Heaven we shall have one Mind and Heart,
and One employment in the Love and praise of
our Creator and Redeemer, and one felicitating
fruition of his Glory for evermore. Therefore
he that seeth not the necessity of <hi>Unity,</hi> knoweth
not the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Faith,</hi> or true
<hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Unity,</hi> and the <hi>shame</hi>
and <hi>mischiefs</hi> of <hi>Divisions,</hi> may appear to him,
that further considereth the instances which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>First, Our <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> is a sign
of our proportionable <hi>union</hi> with Christ: And
our <hi>separation</hi> from the Church, doth signifie that
we are separated from Christ. He that is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but to the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> is but <hi>visibly</hi> (by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
and Profession) united to Christ: such a
union is spoken of in <hi>Ioh. 15. 2. Every branch in
me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.</hi> He that
is <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>mystical Church,</hi> of the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and spiritual, is united to Christ by <hi>faith</hi> and
by the <hi>spirit:</hi> For his union to Christ is at the
same instant of time, with his union with the
Church: but in order of nature goeth before it.
He that is divided from this <hi>mystical Church,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly (at that time) be a Member of Christ
in the spiritual sense: As the member which is
cut off from the <hi>body,</hi> is also separated from the
Head. And he that himself forsaketh the <hi>Visible
Church</hi> as such, sorsaketh the <hi>mystical Church</hi> and
<hi>Christ</hi> himself. For to forsake the <hi>Visible Church</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59262:61"/>
as such, is to cease to be a <hi>Professor</hi> of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
One may be a Member of the <hi>Visible Church,</hi>
and not of the <hi>spiritual;</hi> but you cannot be a
Member of the <hi>spiritual</hi> Church, if you forsake
and refuse the visible Church as such. For though
a man may be <hi>regenerate by the Spirit,</hi> before he
make an <hi>open profession</hi> or be baptized (and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
baptism in some few cases) yet so he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, if he refuse to be a <hi>Professor.</hi> Its possible
indeed to be a member of the Universal Church,
both as <hi>Mystical,</hi> and as <hi>Visible;</hi> as <hi>spiritual</hi> and
as <hi>professing,</hi> while we have not opportunity to
joyn with any one particular Church, or to <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi>
from some <hi>particular Church,</hi> without <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi>
from the <hi>Universal:</hi> But to separate from
the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> is to separate <hi>from
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then you must understand, that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Visible Church is nothing else, but <hi>all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Christians in the world, as visibly subjected to
Christ as their Head:</hi> And that there is no such
thing in being, as the Papists call the <hi>Catholick</hi>
or <hi>Universal Church;</hi> that is, <hi>the universality of
Christians subjected to one Vicar of Christ as their
Head, either Constitutive or Governing.</hi> Such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Head is an Usurper and no true authorized
Vicar of Christ; And therefore such a <hi>Church as
such,</hi> is nothing but a company of seduced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
following such a traiterous Usurper. And
to separate from the Pope, is not to separate from
Christ or from his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Consider also, that <hi>Union</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an <hi>Accident</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but is part of its
very <hi>essence,</hi> without which it can be <hi>no Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59262:62"/>
and without which we can be <hi>no members</hi> of it.
It is no Kingdome, no City, no family, and so
no Church, which doth not consist of <hi>United</hi>
members: As it is no house which consisteth not
of united parts. And he is no Member which is
not <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>whole.</hi> It is the great course of
mens boldness in dividing ways, that they take
<hi>union</hi> to be but some <hi>laudable accident,</hi> while it
may be had; which yet in some cases we may be
without: and think that <hi>separations</hi> are <hi>tollerable</hi>
faults, even when they are forced to confess them
faults: But they do not consider that <hi>Vnity</hi> is
necessary to the <hi>being</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the
<hi>being</hi> of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ephes.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Remember also that our <hi>Vnion</hi>
is necessary to our <hi>Communion,</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi>
and with <hi>his Church:</hi> and to all the blessings and
benefits of such communion. <hi>Ioh. 15. 4. Abide
in me, and I in you: As the branch cannot bear fruit
of it self, except it abide in the Vine; no more can
ye, except ye abide in me: for without me, ye can do
nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast
forth as a branch, and is withered, and men
gather them, and cast them into the fire, and
they are burned.</hi> And <hi>Col. 2. 19. From the Head
all the body by joynts and bonds having nourishment
ministred and knit together, increaseth with the
increase of God.</hi> The member that is cut off
from the body, hath no life or nourishment
from the head or from the body, but is dead:
He that is out of the Church is without the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
the holy worship, the prayers, and the
discipline of the Church, and is out of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59262:62"/>
way where the spirit doth come; and out
of the Society which Christ is specially related
to: For he is the Saviour of his body; And if
we leave his hospital, we cannot expect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and help of the Physician: Nor will he be
a Pilot to them who forsake his Ship: Nor
a Captain to them who separate from his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
Out of this Ark, there is nothing but a
deluge; and no place of rest or safety for a
soul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Unity</hi> of Christians is their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
<hi>strength:</hi> Their <hi>primary strength</hi> is <hi>Christ</hi>
and the <hi>Spirit of grace</hi> which quickeneth them:
And their <hi>secondary</hi> strength is their <hi>Vnion among
themselves: Separation</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> depriveth men
of the <hi>first;</hi> and <hi>separation</hi> from <hi>one another</hi> depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them of the <hi>second.</hi> An <hi>Army</hi> is stronger
than a <hi>man:</hi> And a <hi>Kingdom</hi> than a <hi>single person:</hi>
A <hi>flame</hi> will burn more strongly than a <hi>spark:</hi> And
the <hi>waves</hi> of the Ocean are more forcible than a
single <hi>drop. A threefold Cord is not easily broken.</hi>
Therefore it is that weak Commonwealths do
seek to strengthen themselves by confederacies
with other States. The Church is likened to an
Army with Banners; both, for their <hi>Numbers,</hi>
their <hi>Concord,</hi> and their <hi>Order.</hi> And therefore
Christ saith that <hi>a Kingdom divided cannot stand.
Union</hi> is the Churches <hi>strength:</hi> And what good
soever they may pretend, <hi>Dividers</hi> are certainly
the weakeners and destroyers of the Church:
And as those means which best corroborate the
body, and fortifie the spirits, do best cure many
particular diseases, which no means would c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re
whilst nature is debilitated: So are the Churches
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59262:63"/>
diseases best cured, by uniting fortifying reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which will be increased by a <hi>dividing</hi> way
of Reformation: <hi>Dividing</hi> is <hi>wounding,</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
is the <hi>closing</hi> of the wound.</p>
               <p>There is no good work but <hi>Satan</hi> is a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to it, when he purposeth to <hi>destroy</hi> it: He
resisteth <hi>Light</hi> as an <hi>Angel of Light;</hi> and his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
hinder <hi>Righteousness,</hi> as pretended <hi>Ministers
of Righteousness:</hi> And he will be a <hi>zealous Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
when he would <hi>hinder Reformation.</hi> And this
is the mark of <hi>Satans way</hi> of Reformation: He
doth it by <hi>by dividing the Churches of Christ,</hi> and
teaching Christians to <hi>avoid each other:</hi> And to
that end he zealously aggravateth the faults of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
party to the rest; that they may have odious
thoughts of one another; and Christian Love
may be turned into aversation: As in the Plague
time every one is afraid of the breath and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of his neighbour, and they that were wont
to assemble and converse with peace and pleasure,
do timerously shun the presence of each other;
because they know that it is an infectious time,
and they are uncertain who is free: even so doth
Satan break the societies and converse of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
by making them believe that every party
hath some dangerous infection, which as they
love their souls, they must avoid.</p>
               <p>And he destroyeth your <hi>Love</hi> to one <hi>another,</hi>
by pretending <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>your selves:</hi> O how careful
will he be for your souls! when the Devil would
undo you, he will do it as your Saviour: And
when his meaning is to save you from Heaven, and
from Christ, and from his saving grace, and from
Union and Communion with his Church, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59262:63"/>
from the impartial Love of one another, he takes
on him that he is saving you only from <hi>sin</hi> and
from <hi>Church-corruptions:</hi> Or rather that it is
<hi>Christ</hi> and not <hi>he</hi> that giveth you counsel: And
he can do much in <hi>imitating Christ,</hi> in the <hi>manner</hi>
of his <hi>suggestions,</hi> to make you believe that it <hi>is
Christ indeed.</hi> Perhaps his counsel shall come in
in the midst of a <hi>fervent prayer,</hi> or presently after
it, to make you believe that it is an undoubted
answer of your prayers: And oft times his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses
are vehement and much affecting, to make
you think that it is something above nature: And
the <hi>pio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s pretence</hi> will much perswade you to think
that sure this can never come from an evil spirit:
But if you had well studied 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 13, 14, 15.
Gal. 1. 8. Luke 9. 55. 1 Ioh. 4. 1, 2. 2 Thes.</hi> 2. 2.
you might be wiser and be saved from this
deceit. I will not recite the words, because
I would have you turn to them, and seriously
study them.</p>
               <p>And in this <hi>dividing work,</hi> the Devil doth as
make-bates do, who first goes to one man and tell
him a tale what such a one said against him, and
what a dangerous person he is, and then go to the
other and say as much of the first to him: So the
Devil saith to the Presbyterian, O take heed of
the Independents! and to the Independents,
Take heed of these Presbyterians; To the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist
he suggesteth, Avoid these Protestants:
Take heed of them, for they Baptize infants: And
to the Protestants he saith, Take heed of these
Anabaptists, for they are against baptizing any till
they come to full age: To one he saith, Away
from that Church, or think not those persons to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59262:64"/>
be religious; for they pray by the book: And to
the other he saith, Take heed of those people, as
whimsical and proud, and brainsick fanaticks; for
they pray <hi>without-book</hi> by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> To one sort
he saith, Take heed of those people, for they wear
a Surplice, or Kneel at the Sacrament, or answer
the Priests in the Responses of the Common-prayer:
To the other he saith, Take heed of
these disobedient, stubborn, selfconceited people
that will sit at the Sacrament, and will not
conform to the orders of the Church. I am not
now minding whose opinion is right or wrong,
among all these parties, or any like them; But
how charitable to your souls the Devil is, when
he would destroy your <hi>charity</hi> and your <hi>souls;</hi> and
how <hi>piously</hi> and <hi>kindly</hi> he would have you <hi>take
heed</hi> when he would lead you to <hi>perdition:</hi> and
how great a <hi>Reformer</hi> he will be, if he may but
do it by <hi>Dividing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be the young unexperienced Schismatick
(of what sect soever) will distast these words, and
think I speak like an adversary to Reformation:
And so the Devil would make him think, of all
other Christians as well as of me, except his party.
But if one should give such counsel for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his own health and bodily comfort, as
the <hi>Dividing</hi> spirit giveth him for the Church and
for his soul, he would quickly understand it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my present sense. If one should come
in kindness to him and bid him, [O take heed of
that mouth and belly; for it getteth nothing, but
devoureth all that the hands do get by labour:
Cut off that hand, for it hath a crooked finger:
Cut off that gouty foot that it may not trouble
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59262:64"/>
the whole body: Rip up those guts which have
such filthy excrements, he would not swell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me if I advised him to suspect such
kindness.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Remember also, that the <hi>Unity</hi> of
Christians is their <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>ease,</hi> as well as their
<hi>strength</hi> and <hi>safety.</hi> Psal. 133. 1. <hi>Behold how good
and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together
in unity!</hi> As the amity and converse with friends
is pleasant, and the concord of families is their
quietness and ease; so is it as to the amity and
concord which is the bond of Church society.
And the <hi>divisions</hi> and <hi>discord</hi> of Christians, is their
mutual <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi> Do you not <hi>feel</hi> your
<hi>minds disturbed</hi> by it: Do you not <hi>see</hi> the <hi>Church
discomposed</hi> by it? The itch of contention, doth
ordinarily make it pleasant for the time, to every
Sect to scratch by zealous wranglings and disputes,
for their several opinions, till the blood be ready
to follow: But the smart and scab doth use to
convince them of their folly. But if they
will go more than <hi>Skin-deep,</hi> they may need a
<hi>Surgeon. Children</hi> will <hi>claw</hi> themselves; but it
is <hi>Madmen</hi> that will <hi>wound</hi> themselves. The
hurt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which we get in the Christian warfare, by
mortifying the flesh, or by the persecution of
the malignant enemy is tenderly healed by the
hand of Christ, and usually furthereth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace. But if we will hurt and wound
and divide our selves, what pity or comfort can
we expect.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Consider also that the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
of Believers is their <hi>Honour,</hi> and their <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>discord</hi> are their <hi>shame:</hi> And consequently
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59262:65"/>
the honour or dishonour of Christ and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and Religion is much concerned in it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
among Christians telleth the world,
that they have a certainty of the faith which they
profess, and that it is powerful and not ineffectual,
and that it is of a healing nature, and tendeth to
the felicity of the world. But Divisions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
among Christians perswade unbelievers,
that there is no <hi>certainty</hi> in their <hi>belief:</hi> or that it
is of a vexatious and destructive tendency; or at
best that all its power is too weak, to overcome
the malignity which it pretendeth to resist;
where did you ever see Christians live in <hi>undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unity, undisturbed peace,</hi> and <hi>unfeigned Love,</hi> but
the very infidels and ungodly round about them,
did reverence both them and their religion for it.
And where did you ever see Christians <hi>divided,
unpeaceable</hi> and bitter against each other, but it
made them and their profession a scorn to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
and ungodly world? and whilst they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and vilifie one another, they teach the wicked
to despise and vilifie them all?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, I may therefore add, that the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of <hi>Believers,</hi> is one of Gods appointed means
for the conversion and salvation of <hi>unbelievers:</hi> And
their <hi>Divisions and discord</hi> are an ordinary means
of hardening men in infidelity and wickedness,
and hindering their love and obedience to the
truth. As a well ordered Army, or a City of
uniform comely building, is a pleasing and
inviting sight to the beholders; when a confused
rout, or a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inous heap, doth breed abhorrence:
even so the very sight of the concordant societies
of Christians, is amiable and alluring to those
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59262:65"/>
without; when their disagreements and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
make them seem odious and vile. As a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
instrument in tune, or a set of musick, delight
the hearer by the pleasing harmony; when one
or more instruments out of tune, or used by a rude
unskilful hand, will weary out the patience of the
hearer; so is it in this case; and the difference
is much greater, between concordant and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concordant
Christians. Who loveth to thrust
himself into a fray? And what wise man had not
rather partake of the friendly converse, than joyn
with drunken men that are fighting in the streets?
Peace and Concord are amiable even to nature;
And you can scarce take a more effectual means,
to win the world to the Love of Holiness, than by
shewing them that Holiness doth make you <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned</hi>
and <hi>fervent</hi> in the Love of one another.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. Nor can you devise how to drive
men more effectually from Christ, and to damn
their souls, than to represent Christians to them
like a company of mad men, that are tearing out
the throats of one another? How can you think
that the unbelievers and ungodly should think
well of them, that all speak so ill of one another?
When the Lutheran flyeth from the Calvinist, and
the Episcopal from the Puritan, and the Protestant
from the Anabaptist, and the Presbyterian from
the Independent, and all the other side implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fly from them, Can you wonder if the Infidel
and the Idolater fly further from you all? Mark
well the words of Christ in his prayer, <hi>Ioh. 17.
20, 21, 22, 23. For them which shall believe on me
by their word, that they all may be one, as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59262:66"/>
in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent
me: And the glory which thou gavest me, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, that they may be one, even as we are one: I
in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect
in one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent
me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these observations are obvious in these
words. 1. That the unity of Christians must be
<hi>universal,</hi> even of all that believe the Gospel of
Christ. 2. That this Union should have some low
resemblance to the Union of the Father and the
Son. 3. That it is Christs great desire and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for his Followers, that they may be one.
4. That their glory is for their Unity. 5. That
their Unity is their perfection. 6. That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Son are the Head or Center of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
7. That this Unity is the great means of
converting the world to the Christian faith, and
convincing Infidels of the truth of Christ, as sent
by God. Open but your eyes and you may see
all these great doctrines in this Prayer of Christs
for his people Unity: O that all the Christian
Churches would try this means for the worlds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version!
(Not on the impossible terms of Popery,
but on the necessary terms proposed by Christ.)</p>
               <p>8. External Unity <hi>and peaceable Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
doth greatly cherish our</hi> Internal unity <hi>of
Love: And Church-divisions do cherish wrath
and malice and all the works of the flesh descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by</hi> Paul, Gal. 5. 21, 22, 23. <hi>I pray you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how he describeth the fleshly and the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
man:</hi> v. 14, 15. For all the Law is fulfilled
in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy self. But if ye bite and devour one another,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59262:66"/>
take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. I say
then, walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts
of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, adultery—enmities
or hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
strife, seditions, <hi>(or as it may be read</hi> Divisions <hi>or</hi>
factions) heresies, envyings, murders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the
fruit of the spirit is Love, joy, peace, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng-suffering,
gentlenss, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:
Against such there is no law. And they that are
Christs have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
lusts. If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the
spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one another, envying one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O but those that I separate from are guilty of
this and that and the other fault.</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>Chap</hi> 6. 1. Brethren, if a man be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a
one, in the spirit of meekness, considering thy self
lest thou also be tempted: <hi>Instead of censorious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and separation,</hi> bear ye one anothers burthen,
and so fulfil the Law of Christ: <hi>which you think
you fulfil by your unwarrantable separations, while
you are but fulfilling your fleshly passions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When once parties are engaged by their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Anti-churches and fierce disputings, the
flesh and satan will be working in them against
all that is <hi>holy, sweet</hi> and <hi>safe.</hi> When united Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are provoking one another to Love and to
good works, and minding each other of their
heavenly cohabitation, and harmonious praise
and are delighting God and man by the melody
of their concord; The contentious zealots in
their separate Anti-churches, are preaching down

Love and preaching up hatred, and making those
that differ from them seem an odious people not
to be communicated with, by aggravating their
different opinions or modes of worship, till they
seem to be no less than Heresie or Idolatry. If

Thats not denied. But whether you should
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59262:68"/>
separate from the Church because they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
This is it which we call you to beware:
Not but that in some cases, a Christian may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
remove from one Church to another that
hath more light and purity, for the edification
of his soul. But before you separate from a faulty
Church, <hi>as such as may not lawfully be communicated
with,</hi> you must look well about you, and be able
to prove that thing which you affirm.</p>
               <p>Many weak Christians marking those Texts
which bid us <hi>avoid a man that is an Heretick,</hi> and
to have <hi>no company</hi> with disorderly walkers, and
not to eat with flagitious persons, do not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
mark their sense, but take them as if they
call'd us to separate from <hi>the Church</hi> with which
these persons do communicate. Whereas if you
mark all the Texts in the Gospel, you shall find,
that all the separation which is commanded in
such cases (besides our separation from the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
or Idolatrous world, or Antichristian and
Heretical confederacies, and no-Churches) is
but one of these two sorts. First, either that <hi>the
Church</hi> cast out the impenitent sinner by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Keyes. Secondly, or that <hi>private men</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
all <hi>private familiarity</hi> with them. And both
these we would promote, and no way hinder.
Thirdly, but that the <hi>private</hi> members should se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the <hi>Church,</hi> because such persons are
not cast out of it, shew me one Text to prove it
if you can.</p>
               <p>Let us here peruse the Texts that speak of our
withdrawing from the wicked. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
written to the whole Church, as obliged
<hi>to put away the incestuous person from among them,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59262:69"/>
and so not to eat with such offenders.</hi> So is that in
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. and that in <hi>Tit. 3. 10. A man that is
an Heretick after the first and second admonition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void:</hi>
Unless it be a Heretick that hath already
separated himself from our communion; And
then it can be put private familiarity which we
are further to avoid. In brief, there is no other
place of Scripture, that I know of, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
any more. I have before shewed that
abundance of Church corruptions, or of scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
members, were then among them, and yet
the Apostle never spake a syllable to any one
Christian, to separate from any one of all those
Churches: Which we cannot imagine that the
Holy Ghost would have wholly omitted, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it had been the will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But then why did <hi>Luther</hi> and the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
separate from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and how
will you justifie them from Schisme?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Its pity that sloth and sortishness, should
keep any Protestant (or Papist either) in such
ignorance, as to need any help to answer so easie
a question at this day! Let not equivocal names
deceive us, and the case is easie. By the word
<hi>Church</hi> the Scripture still meaneth; first, either
the <hi>Universal Church</hi> which is the body or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ alone: Secondly, or <hi>particular
Congregations</hi> associated for personal communion
in Gods worship: But the Pope hath feigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
kind of thing, and called it <hi>The Church:</hi>
That is, <hi>The Vniversality of Christians as headed by
himself, as the constitutive and governing head.</hi>
Whereas, first, God never instituted or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
such a Church, Secondly, nor did ever the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59262:69"/>
Universality of Christians, acknowledge this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping
Head. Shew me in Scripture, or in
Church-History, that either there ever was <hi>de
facto,</hi> or ought to be <hi>de jure,</hi> such a thing in the
world as they call <hi>the Church,</hi> and I profess I will
immediately turn Papist. But if you ask why
we separated from the Papal Church? I answer,
Because, first, it was <hi>no Church of Christ</hi> (as such.)
And secondly, It was a <hi>Church of traiterous combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
against the prerogative of Christ, and
therefore by the Protestants called the Anti-christian
Church. We separated not from <hi>Rome</hi>
either as the <hi>Universal Church</hi> (for that it was
not) nor as <hi>part of the Universal</hi> Church; (for
so we hold communion with those that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in it still) Nor as a true worshipping
<hi>Congregation</hi> (for they consist of many thousand
congregations which we had never local com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with: And as true worshipping congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in <hi>specie,</hi> we still hold communion with
them in mind, so far as they are such indeed:
But in two senses we separate from them:
First, as a <hi>Papal Catholick Church;</hi> because
in that sense they are <hi>no Church of Christ,</hi> but
a pack of rebels: Secondly, as <hi>particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
in specie</hi> which have mixed Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with false doctrine and Idolatrous bread-worship
and other unlawful things, which by
oaths and practise they would force those to be
guilty of, who will communicate with them.
And thus we disown them only as <hi>neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
that never were their <hi>lawful subjects,</hi> but
bear our testimony against <hi>their sin.</hi> And our
forefathers who were members of their Churches,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59262:70"/>
departed to save themselves from their iniquity,
and because they were refused by themselves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they would lie &amp; forswear &amp; be idolaters, and
communicate with them in their sin. Nor would
they then, nor will they to this day admit any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
communion of their particular Churches, as
such, who will not first come in to their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Universal Church, which is no Church, and
worse than none. If this answer seem not plain
and full to you, it is because you understand not
Christian sense and reason.</p>

15, 16. If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go

if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two

away from among your selves that wicked person.</p>
               <p>By all this it is plain that the Church must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
a regular course of justice, with every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that it shall reject: He must first be told <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his fault, and then before two or three;
(unless, at least, the open notoriety make the
private admonition needless) And then it must
be told the Church: And the Church must with
compassion, tenderness and patience, and yet with
the authority of the Lord Jesus and the powerful
evidence of truth, convince him and perswade
him to repent: And he must not be rejected, till
after all this, he obstinately refuse to hear the
Church, that is, to Repent, as they exhort him.</p>
               <p>Note here, that no sin will warrant you to cast
out the sinner, unless it be seconded with Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency:
It is not simply as a drunkard, or a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator
or swearer, that any one is to be rejected:
but as an <hi>impenitent</hi> drunkard, or <hi>fornicator,</hi> or
<hi>swearer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Also that it is not all <hi>impenitency</hi> that will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
their rejection: But only <hi>impenitency after
the Churches admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note also, that no private person may expect,
that any offender be cast out, either because his
sin is known <hi>to him,</hi> or because he is commonly
famed to be guilty, till the thing be <hi>proved</hi> by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

               <p>Yea that the admonition given him must be
proved, as well as the fault which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Yea if all the town do know him to be guilty,
and witness prove that he hath been privately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished,

he may not be rejected till he be
<hi>heard speak for himself,</hi> and till he refuse also the

               <p>This is Christs order, whose <hi>wisdom,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi>
and <hi>authority</hi> are such, as may well cause us to take
his way as best. And yet the ignorance or rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of many professors is such, that they would
have all this order of Christ overturned: And
some of them must have such a drunkard and such
a swearer kept away and rejected, before ever
they admonished them or exhorted them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
or prove that any one else hath done it;
much more before they have told the Church, or
proved that he hath neglected the Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.
And some go so much further, that
they must have all the Churches taken for no
Churches, till they have gathered them a new:
and must have all the Parish at once rejected (till
they have gathered out some few again) without
any such order of proceeding with them, as
Christ appointeth: It may be a thousand shall

But we confess that in gross ignorance,
they may shew themselves uncapable of sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Communion, and may be denied it while
they are learning to know what they do. But
the mercy of God hath made points absolutely
necessary so few, that this may be done in a
short time, if the Persons be willing, and the
Teachers diligent, and sufficiently numerous for
that work. And though it is to be lamented,
that in many great City-Parishes, the Ministers
are not enough to catechize the twentieth part of
the people, yet for the generality of Parishes
through the Land, if Catechizing were used as it
might be, there would not any great numbers be
long kept away for meer ignorance. And he
that is the cause of his Parishes ignorance by

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> True: But he that is a member of the

but mutual consent: And if he have statedly joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a particular Church in ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
Consent hath bin manifested, and he is a
member of that particular Church, and must not
be rejected by it, but in Christs way. And this
is the common case in <hi>England.</hi> The persons
who were baptized in Infancy, were at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Universal Church, and into some
particular Church, &amp; have held communion at age
with both; and have right to that communion till
they are publikely proved to have lost their right.</p>
               <p>And if we had no Churches, but particular
Churches were to be gathered anew, yet he that
is a baptized member of the Universal Church,
and consenteth to communion with that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church in all the ordinances of Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
doth lay a sufficient claim to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and cannot lawfully be refused, unless
he stand justly censured by a Church which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he was in. Yet this we confess, that he
can be no member of that particular Church,
who subjecteth not himself to the <hi>particular Pastors</hi>
of it, and to the <hi>necessary acts</hi> or <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>their

Office</hi> and Ministration: Because he denieth his
own consent.</p>
               <p>11. The sinfulness of unchurching Persons
or Parishes, without Christs way of regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
consisteth in all these following parts. 1. It
is a casting off the Laws of the great Law-giver
of the Church, and so a contempt of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
wisdome and goodness; and a making of our
selves <hi>greater,</hi> or <hi>wiser,</hi> or <hi>hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er</hi> than he. 2. It is
gross <hi>injustice,</hi> to deprive men of so great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
without any sufficient proof of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It is worse than to turn whole Parishes
out of their Houses and Possessions, without any
lawful process or proof; upon rumours or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
affirmations that they are Delinquents. It
is not doing as we would be done by, what if any
should say of you, that you are Heretical and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fundamental Truths? Or what if they should
say of a separated Church, that they are generally
Hereticks or of wicked lives (as the Heathens
did of the ancient Christians) and therefore that
they are <hi>no Church,</hi> nor to be communicated with;
would you not think that they should every one
<hi>personally</hi> be accused, and proof brought against
them, and that they should speak for themselves,
before they were thus condemned? 3. And it is
an aggravated Crime in them, that so much cry
down <hi>Church-tyranny</hi> in others, to be thus notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
guilty of it themselves? what greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, upon the censures and rumours of
suspitious men, without any just proof or lawful
tryal? That it shall be in the power of every one,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59262:73"/>
who hath but uncharitableness enough to think
evil of his neighbours, or to believe reports a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their innocency to cast them out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of God, and to unchristen and unchurch
men arbitrarily at their pleasure? That any man
that is but unconscionable enough to say [They
are all <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>prophane]</hi> shall expect to have
his neighbours excommunicated. 4. It maketh
all Churches to be lubricous and uncertain sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows:
when a censorious person may unchurch
them at his pleasure. What you say of others,
another may say of you; and as justly expect to
be believed. 5. It unavoidably bringeth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
<hi>divisions:</hi> For there is no certain rule of
justice with such persons: and therefore they
know not who are to be received to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and who not: And the same man that one
thinketh is to be rejected and kept out, another
will think is to be received: And who knoweth
which of them is to be obeyed. If one say that a
Parish is a Church, and another say that they are
to be unchurched, who knoweth which of them to
believe. 6. It is a reproach to the Church and
Christian religion, when we tell the world that,
that we have not so much <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> among
us, as Heathens have in their worldly societies.
7. It depriveth the Church of the solace of her
Communion, when the best man is not sure, but a
censorious person may at his pleasure turn him
out as unworthy. 8. It greatly wrongeth Jesus
Christ, who so dearly loveth the weakest of his
flock; and hath purchased their priviledges at so
dear a rate: and whose body is maymed, when
any of his members are cut off: and who taketh
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59262:74"/>
the wrong that is done them as done unto himself.
These are the great virtues of that censorious zeal,
which unchurches Persons or Parishes without
just tryal and proof, upon rumours of fame, or
their own surmises.</p>

members have not the power of <hi>baptizing,</hi> nor
were the Pastors ever appointed to do it, by their
advise, consent or vote. Therefore the private
members have not the power of the Keyes for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
And it is most apparent in the Gospel,
that the Keyes for <hi>admission</hi> and for <hi>exclusion</hi> are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59262:74"/>
given into the same hands, and not one to the
Ministers and another to the Flock: Therefore
the people that have not the first, have not the

of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open
and none shall shut: and he shall shut and none shall

               <p>Read these with judgement, and then believe

is in the People. Shew us what text
doth give them that power? and where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
calleth them to exercise it by Votes? Or
where God requireth ability in them for Church-government?
or where he calleth them to leave
their Callings and attend this work? When those

that the word <hi>[Church]</hi> there signifieth the whole
Congregation (as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Second Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive

hath well shewed) But it is as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
body only. And so the Office is to be
performed only by the Organical part; and not
by any of the rest. When I say to a man <hi>[Hear
me]</hi> I do not mean that he should hear me with
his <hi>eyes,</hi> but only with his <hi>ears:</hi> And when I bid
him <hi>See</hi> or <hi>Read.</hi> I bid him not do it with his <hi>ears</hi>
but with his <hi>eyes.</hi> Nor do the eyes <hi>receive</hi> this
power from the feet or hands, but immediately
from the Head: Though if they were separated
from the body they could not retain it. So if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Kingdome send to <hi>England,</hi> to desire an
Army of Men to help them, they mean the King
only as the <hi>Commander</hi> of them, and the people as
the executors of his Command. So when you

I have said, He speaketh to an organized Church,
which had two parts, and accordingly two works
to do: The <hi>Ruling</hi> part was to <hi>put away the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

were all to <hi>put him away,</hi> by actual <hi>shunning</hi> his

Communion, which is but the obeying of that
sentence. If the King send to a Corporation to
execute any Law, he meaneth not that <hi>all persons</hi>
must do it in the like manner; but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
by Command, and the people by obeying
them, and executing their Commands. If I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

me; I mean not that every part of him shall herein
have the same office; But that he <hi>read</hi> it only
with his <hi>eyes,</hi> and understand it with his <hi>reason,</hi> and
transcribe it with his hand, and travel with his
feet. The Pastors only excommunicate by
Judgement or Sentence; and the people by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
execution of it.</p>

their <hi>neighbour Communion.</hi> And they shall warn
that people to avoid him (by virtue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

by an act of <hi>obedience to God,</hi> and of <hi>self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
As Souldiers must forsake a trayterous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,

               <p>Well! Now let us see what influence this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59262:76"/>
truth should have upon your Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Do you say that your neighbours are not to be
accounted members of the Church, nor to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
with? Who took them into the Church
by Baptism? Was it not a Minister of Christ?
If you say no, you must prove your accusation.
If you grant it, was it not his <hi>Office</hi> so to do?
Hath not God made his Ministers Judges whom
they are to baptize? And afterward also whom
to catechise and instruct and admit to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church? There is no doubt of it.
If then they are admitted by an entrusted Officer,
will you venture to usurp the place, yea and to do
them the wrong to say that they are no members?
Is it any of your trust or work? I pray you mark
what a mercy it is to you, that the Officers and
not the private members are entrusted with this
work. First, if it were <hi>your work,</hi> you must <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
and be able to perform it. Secondly, you
must <hi>watch for it,</hi> and <hi>constantly attend</hi> it. If a
Heretick pervert the Text of Scripture, you must
convince him by your skil in the Originals or in
the sense. How many hundred or thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are there in a Parish to be tried? The worst
of them must have a hearing and just trial at least,
before you can refuse him lawfully: And how
accurately must this difficult work be done, that
the weakest be not denied his right, nor the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
admitted? How long must a sinner be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and exhorted to repentance? And are <hi>you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>willing</hi> to leave all your callings, to do all
this?</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Minister</hi> that doth it, must lay by the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59262:77"/>
business of the world, how think you that you can
do the same without laying by your worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
If <hi>he</hi> must have so many <hi>years learning</hi> and
preparation, can <hi>you</hi> do it <hi>without?</hi> Mistake not,
it is not for <hi>Sermons</hi> only that Ministers need all
their learning and labour; but also for the <hi>disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
and <hi>guidance</hi> of the flocks. Thirdly, and if
it be <hi>your work, you</hi> must be <hi>accountable</hi> for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. And do you not fear such a reckoning?
And if these busie people had their wish, would
they not be in a worse case than the most dumb
and lazy Minister?</p>
               <p>Consider it well, and you will find that you are
not at all bound <hi>to know</hi> what the spiritual state of
any man is, as he is to joyn in Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with you, but upon <hi>your Pastors trust</hi> and
<hi>word.</hi> Whether their understanding be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
at their admittance, you are not any where
called to try: but the Pastor is: And if he have
admitted them, you are to rest in his judgment
(unless you would undertake the office your
selves) whether their profession of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
be serious and credible, you are not
called to try and judge: But if your Pastor have
admitted them, he hath numbred them with the
visible Christians: And it is the <hi>credibility</hi> of the
<hi>Pastor</hi> that you have to consider; and by him you
must judge of the credibility of the professour,
and not immediately by your own trial. Who are
the persons that you shall meet at a Sacrament
or in publike Communion, you are not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to try; And if you never saw them before
or heard them speak, you may perform your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nevertheless: Indeed if as a <hi>neighbour</hi> you are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59262:77"/>
called to instruct or counsel or comfort them; you
must do it: But there may be five thousand in one
Church with you, whose names or faces you are
not bound to know; but to rest in the knowledge
of them to whom the keyes are committed, who
according to their office take them in.</p>

But for all that you must not mend it, by step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
up into the judgement seat your self, and
saying, that you or the rest of the people will
do it better. Some body must be trusted with it.
If you are fittest, offer your self to the office. The
thing that you must do is, to do your best to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Church from so bad a Pastor: Use all
your wisdome and diligence to amend him: And
if you cannot do that, use all your interest to get
him out, and get a better: And if you cannot
do that, deliver your own soul from him, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
to a better, if you are free; But if as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
or children or wives you are under another
Government which restraineth you, be patient,
and use such means as God provideth for you.
This is the true way of your Church-duty, and
not to think that you must have a knowledge of
the Godliness of all that you communicate with;
or that you must refuse communion if the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

repulse them. The outward priviledges of
the visible Church which they come to, they shall
possess. If they will come over to the Church of
the regenerate, they shall be saved. But where
ever they stop it shall be their own doing. Many
came to Christ when he was on earth, whom he
never repulsed, though he was marvelled at and
grudged at for entertaining them. Some came
so far as to own his Name, and did Miracles by it,
that yet did not follow him: whom the Apostles
would have hindered, but Christ reproved them,

his Disciples sometimes repulsed, but so did not
he: when little children were brought to him,
his Disciples rebuked those that brought them, as
thinking them unfit for his reception: but Christ
rebuked them for their forbidding of such guests.
When he eat and drank with publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinners,

               <p>THough God by his grace must change the

long ago, and shall now only say in brief.
First, that no <hi>ungodly man</hi> is <hi>so called</hi> to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
as to <hi>excuse himself</hi> before God for his
usurpation and hypocritical administrations. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,

to the Ministry as that his admin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>valid to the Church,</hi> and the <hi>innocent people</hi> shall not

have the <hi>loss.</hi> Thirdly, no people should <hi>choose</hi>
and <hi>prefer</hi> such an ungodly Minister before a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Fourthly, but they should rather <hi>submit</hi> to
such than have <hi>none,</hi> when a better cannot (by
them) be had. <hi>Iudas</hi> had a <hi>place in the Ministry</hi>
with the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 17. And his ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might be valid to others, though his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
might turn it into sin to himself. And his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
might have been accepted of the people,
though they had known his hypocrisie as Christ
did: But a <hi>sincere Apostle</hi> was to be <hi>preferred</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Gifts,</hi> First the greatest degree is best;
and secondly, God maketh so great use of them,
that many an hypocrite wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h excellent gifts, doth
edifie the Church more than many good men that
are ungifted. Thirdly, but that measure of
Gifts only is necessary to the <hi>Being</hi> of a Minister
without which the <hi>essential parts</hi> of his <hi>office</hi> cannot
be performed.</p>
               <p>Learn therefore to prefer them that have most
grace and guifts; but not to take them for <hi>no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
that want <hi>Grace totally,</hi> or want only a
<hi>greater degree of Gifts.</hi> And marvel not that <hi>Gifts</hi>
are more necessary to the validity of ministration
than Grace is. He may perform the office of a
Minister to the benefit of the Church, that hath
no saving grace at all: so did <hi>Iudas:</hi> so did those

in Christs name, to whom he will yet say,
Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know
you not: For <hi>Grace</hi> is to save him that possesseth

the hypocrite the more profitable to the Church.</p>

God may hear those prayers for you which

               <p>As your <hi>Baptism</hi> maketh you Members of the

the condition of mankind. It is somewhat

their affections as to all the rest, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
their converse in the world: How blindly
do such look on all that is good in those that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from them? How partially do they judge of
the judgements and practises of others? How
small a thing will serve the turn, to excuse the
faults of any of their party? And how small and
common a good seemeth excellent in them? And
how perversly do they aggravate the faults of all
that are against their way? As if every infirmity
were a crime, and had no excuse? yea, they are
oft glad to hear of some miscarriage in them, for
which they may speak against them. And very
readily take up such reports, and are the willing-tongues
of slanderous fame: And in all this their
faction maketh them impenitent: For they
think it tendeth to the disgrace of the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so of their Cause, which they account an
errour; and consequently that God hath use for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59262:89"/>
their malicious Calumnies to his glory.</p>
               <p>What company can you come into of forward
Christians, but they are talking against those of
other parties? (except a few true entire Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who are throughly possessed with the loving
compassionate spirit of their Lord, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the true impression of the Gospel.) And if
you mark the cause you will find it as a <hi>sectarian
spirit,</hi> that prevaileth against the <hi>Catholick spirit</hi>
of <hi>Christianity.</hi> And in no sect more, than in those
that pretend to be the <hi>only Catholicks,</hi> and to do
all this against the Sectaries as such! What
bitter lies do the Popish sects under the name of
Catholicks daily vent not only against <hi>Luther,
Calvin,</hi> and other Reformers, but any that stand
against the peculiar interest of their party. And
they that can get the upper hand-and by worldly
advantages become the domineering sect, do think
that thereby, they are exempted from the name
and number of sectaries; and that all are sectaries
that question their authority, and do not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obey them.</p>
               <p>In all their discourse the stigmatizing of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is an ordinary part! One side reproacheth
the other as Hereticks and Schismaticks; And
the other reproacheth them as hypocrites, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
and pharisaical persecutors: And every
party think that all this is a part of Christian
zeal; and if they did it not they should be guilty
of lukewarmness and neutrality, and consenting
to the sins of others. And thus the Church of
Christ is engaged in a war against it self: And
when all men should know them to be Christs
disciples by loving one another; most men may
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59262:89"/>
perceive that they have too much contrariety to
the Christian nature, by their endeavouring to
make each other odious. And all because instead
of distinguishing the members of the <hi>same Body</hi> by
their several offices and degrees, we are grown to
make <hi>several Bodies</hi> of them, and to set one part
against another. How many a Kingdomes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
from Infidelity hath been hindered? and
how many a faithful Minister silenced or reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched?
and how many excellent Christians slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and vilified? and how many blamless customs,
forms, and practises accused? and how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
aggravated as mortal crimes, by a siding
factious disposition, and to promote the cause and
interest of a Sect. Therefore as you love your
integrity and peace, keep up an impartial uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
love and honour to all Christians as such,
and take heed of a dividing spirit.</p>

               <head type="sub">Be very suspicious of your Religious passions;

               <p>WE are seldome more mistaken in justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves than in our <hi>Passions:</hi> And
when our <hi>Passions</hi> are <hi>Religious</hi> the mistake is both
<hi>most easie</hi> and most <hi>perillous: Easie,</hi> because we are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59262:90"/>
apt to be most confident, and not suspect them,
the matter seeming so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> about which
they are exercised. And <hi>Perilous,</hi> because the
<hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> of the <hi>matter,</hi> doth make the
errour the <hi>greater</hi> and the <hi>worse.</hi> I have shewed
before how easie it is, to think that our <hi>Religious
passions,</hi> are all the works of the spirit of God;
For we are apt to estimate them, by the depth
and earnestness which we feel. But excellent
persons have been here mistaken, as <hi>Iames</hi> and
<hi>Iohn</hi> were. And not only so, but when the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is up, the judgement it self is seldome to be
far trusted; For it inclineth us to err in all things
that concern the present business. Therefore
still remember the difference between <hi>true zeal</hi>
and <hi>false:</hi> And know that he that is upright in the
main, and whose zeal for Christianity is sound,
may yet have much zeal that is unsound with it.</p>
               <p>First, It is an ill sign when your <hi>zeal</hi> is raised
about some <hi>singular opinion</hi> which you have owned,
and not for the <hi>common salvation</hi> and substance of
the Christian faith or practise. Or at least, when
your odd opinion hath a <hi>greater proportion</hi> of your
zeal, than many more plain and necessary truths.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when your zeal is moved by any
<hi>personal interest</hi> of your own: By honour or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour;
By any wrong that is done you, or any
reputation of wisdome or goodness, which lieth
on the cause. Or at least when your <hi>own interest</hi>
hath too large a <hi>proportion</hi> in your zeal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when your zeal is more for the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
of your <hi>party,</hi> than for the Universal Church,
and the common cause of Godliness, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
and can be content that some <hi>detriment</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59262:90"/>
to the <hi>whole,</hi> may further the interest of the
<hi>party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, when your zeal tendeth to <hi>hurt</hi> and
<hi>crueley,</hi> and would have God rather to glorifie his
<hi>Iustice</hi> by some present notable judgement; than
his <hi>Mercy</hi> by patience and forgiving: And when
your secret desire of <hi>fire from heaven,</hi> or some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the adversaries is greater than your
desire and prayer for their conversion. The sure
mark of true zeal is, that it is <hi>zealous Love:</hi> It
maketh you <hi>love your neighbours and enemies</hi> more
<hi>fervently</hi> than others do: But <hi>false zeal:</hi> maketh
you more inclined to their <hi>suffering;</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and <hi>hurt</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is an ill signe when your <hi>zeal</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the proportion of your <hi>understanding:</hi> And
your <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> is as much <hi>less</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens, as your <hi>zeal</hi> is <hi>greater.</hi> True <hi>zeal</hi>
hath some <hi>equality</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is an ill sign when it is a zeal which
is easily kept alive, and hardly restrained: For that
sheweth the slesh and the Devil are too much its
friends. The true zeal of the spirit doth need
the fuel of all holy means, and the bellows of
meditation, and prayer to kindle it: and all is
too little to keep it up in the constancy that we
desire. But carnal zeal will burn of it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such endeavours.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, It is an ill signe when some <hi>sect</hi> or
<hi>false-teacher</hi> was the kindler of it; and not the
sober preaching of the truth.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, And it is an ill sign when it burneth

time, when the love of God, and a heavenly mind
and life decay, The zeal of a sensualist, of a
proud man, of a covetous man, of a self-conceited
empty person, can hardly be thought a spiritual
zeal.</p>
               <p>9. And it is an ill sign w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en it carrieth you
from the <hi>holy rule;</hi> and pretendeth to come from
a spirit which will not be tryed by the Scripture:
Or when it driveth you to use means which God
forbiddeth in his Word: and putteth you upon
ways which the sealed Law and Testimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn:
It cannot be of God, which is against
Gods Word.</p>
               <p>10. Lastly, it is a suspicious sign, when it is
contrary to the judgement, experience and zeal
of the generality of the most wise, experienced,
tryed, sober, godly Christians; and so to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
working of Gods Spirit in other men, who
are as good as you. For Gods Spirit is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it self.</p>
               <p>By all these signs you may easily perceive, how
the dividing zeal of a Sect as a sect, doth differ
from the genuine Christian zeal. The one is a zeal
for some <hi>singular opinion:</hi> The other is a zeal for
<hi>Godliness</hi> and <hi>Christianity.</hi> The one is kindled by
some <hi>interest</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> religious reputation: the
other is kindled by the interest of the <hi>will</hi> and
<hi>glory of God.</hi> The one is for the strengthning of
<hi>a Party:</hi> The other is to increase the <hi>Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,</hi>
and promote the common cause of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:
even when some particular truth or duty
is the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, yet the <hi>general cause</hi> of <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is the <hi>end.</hi> The one is a <hi>burning, hurting zeal,</hi>
even the same which hath made matter for so

many Martyrologies, and frightful Histories, by
inquisitions, torments, prisons, flames, massacre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
and bloody wars: And the same which hath si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
so many faithful Ministers, and disturbed
so many States and Churches: The other is a <hi>zeal
of Love,</hi> which maketh men fervent in <hi>doing good</hi> to
others: The one causeth men to revile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and censure and backbite, and zealously to
make all dissenters seem odious, that the hearers
may abate their love to them. The other mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us value all that is good in others, and to hide
their nakedness, and to make them better, and to
provoke the hearers to love and to good works.
The one tendeth to divisions and sidings and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
and distances from our brethren; and
to feed contentions: The other is a zeal for <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
amity</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> The one is the complexion
of the weak, and childish, the proud, and self-conceited,
the peevish and surly sort of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours:
The other is the zeal of solid knowledge,
and of the prudent, humble, meek and well
grounded sort of Christians. The one is a zeal
which flyeth most outward, against the sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, and can live with pride, and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and selfishness, and sensuality at home: such
<hi>serve not the Lord Iesus, but their own bellies,</hi> Rom.
16. 16, 17. The other beginneth at home, and
consumeth all these vices in the heart; and as
zeal increaseth humility, and meekness, and love,
and self-denyal, and temperance, and heavenly
mindedness increase. The one is easily got and
easily kept, and hardly kept under! O how easie
is it to get and keep a contemptuous, censorious,
backbiting, dividing or persecuting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eal! But
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59262:93"/>
the other is not so much befriended by Satan or
the flesh, and therefore must be preserved by
prayer and meditation, and very great diligence.
How <hi>hard</hi> is it to keep up a <hi>zealous love of God and
Man?</hi> and a fervour in all our heavenly and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
desires? Abate but your <hi>diligence</hi> and this
will presently decay: when the fierce, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hurting, separating and persecuting zeal doth
need no such fuel or labour to maintain it: The
one is kindled by the enflaming censures of some
rash and passionate Preacher, that knoweth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how to <hi>kill Love</hi> than to <hi>cause</hi> it; or by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

one is a zeal which carrieth men <hi>from the Scripture,</hi>
to pretenses of such revelations, and inspirations,
and impulses as have no proof, but the feeling
and fancy of the person: or at least, to abuse the
Word of God, and plead it for that which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth:

and of good ends and meanings. The other still
putteth you upon good, and striveth against evil,
and goeth for tryal of every cause to the Law and
to the testimony. Lastly, the one is a zeal which
pretendeth the spirit, and yet goeth contrary to
the common workings of the spirit, in the most
part of the best and wisest Christians. But the
other is the common vital heat, which animateth

all the body of Christ, and actualeth all his living
members; and keepeth up love and holiness in
the Church; and is the same in all humble hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Christians in the world. It will be of great

sinful. The back-biter (how great or learned

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59262:94"/>
preach down the love of others, and to exhort you
to hate your brother, or to abate your charity to
him. And he that patiently hearkeneth to such,

the most part, men censure and separate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
most, where they are acquainted least, but
go by hear-say, and judge of men by back-biters
mis-reports: And acquaintance and familiarity
usually reconcileth them, and sheweth them their
errour. You think it is a fair excuse for you,
when you either believe or report evil of another,
to say, that you heard it from very honest and
religious, or reverend persons; or you heard it
from many, and confidently uttered. But God

you not know that other men will censure and

censure and backbite others. Is it such a pleasure
to you to imitate the Devil, the great accuser, as
that you will be as much accused your selves, and
as hardly thought of, rather than you will give it
over.</p>
               <p>And see here how sin doth cross it self. Most
of the censorious, are <hi>proud</hi> persons, who think
others much worse than themselves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
speak worse of their common and more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
neighbours, that they may be thought to be
no common nor ignorant persons themselves;
and they are offended with the Pastor of the
Church, for admitting such persons into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with such as they: That so their piety may
be more conspicuous than their neighbours: when
all this while they are but preparing for their own
dishonour; And others will judge as bad of
them. When usually the meek and humble and
merciful Christian who judgeth hardly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and tenderly of all others; is tenderly
and lovingly judged of by all. The Prelatist
saith, [what obstinate persons are these Non-conformists,
They do all to keep the approbation
of their party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] And are they not requited by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them whom they censure, who say [What

number with <hi>things</hi> indifferent.] The Papist
thinks the Protestant a Heretick unworthy to
live on earth and therefore thirsteth for his blood;
And is he not requited by the censures of them
that think that he is but a blood thirsty limb of
Antichrist himself? If he think that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
cannot be saved, because he is not a member
of the Pope, or Roman Church, the Protestant
requiteth him oft times with concluding, that a
Papist cannot go beyond a reprobate, nor a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper
of the Beast be saved. If the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
censure the Presbyterian as a favourer of
looseness and formality, the Presbyterian can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
him, by censuring him to be an enemy to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
government &amp; peace, and a turbulent cause of
all confusion. The same I may say of all other sects:
It is not now my purpose to take part with any
of them, nor to speak against any one of them more
than the rest: But to them tell all of their mistake
in their censorious way, &amp; how certainly they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for the same measure and judgement which
they give to others. <hi>Rom. 14. 4. Who art thou that

We shall all stand before the judgement seat of Christ—
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to

of a <hi>stumbling block</hi> before another, upon which
he may be occasioned to fall into sin; And this is
the <hi>offence</hi> which is called <hi>scandal.</hi> Abundance of

you these two things.</p>
               <p>First, what a wretched person that is. who will
sin against God every time that his brother doth
not humor him? Durst these persons profess this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
with their tongues? Dare you say, Do not
you use such a form of prayer or such a ceremony
for if you do, I will sin against God? What elfe
do you mean, when you blame men for scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59262:97"/>
you? I hope you do not mean that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
must <hi>displease you?</hi> If not, you must know
that this only is true scandal, to <hi>occasion you to sin?</hi>
And is it not a shame that you will sin so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily?</p>
               <p>2. And if bare <hi>displeasing</hi> had been scandal, then
<hi>peevishness</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> would have advanced all
that had them to be the Governours of the world.
For what is it to govern, but to have all others
obliged to fulfil your wills? And if no man must
<hi>displease</hi> you then all must fulfil your wills: And
he is scandalous that is not ruled by you. And if
this were so, the most childish and womanish sort
of Christians, who have the weakest judgement
and the strongest wils, and passions, must rule all
the world: For these are hardliest pleased, and
no man must displease them.</p>
               <p>But I beseech you remember that <hi>scandal</hi> lieth
in <hi>Pleasing</hi> men as well as in <hi>displeasing them,</hi> when
it may harden them in an errour, or tempt them
to any sin: I will instance to you but in two <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi>
acts of <hi>Peter</hi> himself. The first was to
Christ in <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 22, 23. Where he thought
to please Christ and save him from suffering, and
would have had him to spare or favour himself.
And Christ saith, Get thee behind me Satan, thou
art an offence to me: the <hi>Greek</hi> word is, <hi>A scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal:</hi>
that is, Thou wouldst do as satan did, even
tempt me to sin, &amp; neglect the work which I came
into the world about. The other was in <hi>Gal. 2. 12,
13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Where <hi>Peter</hi> did scandalize the <hi>Iews</hi> by <hi>pleasing</hi>
them! For fear of offending the weak Juda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christians, he separated from familiar commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

it had been done in our dayes many would have
been drawn away with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and thought that
<hi>Peter</hi> had not given <hi>scandal</hi> to the <hi>Iewish Christians,</hi>
but only separated for fear of scandalizing them.
Many a time I have the rather gone to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

being a scandal to those same men that called the
going to them a scandal: that is, for fear of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening

I knew that that was not scandal which they

those whom they account to be the <hi>lest:</hi> And the <hi>best</hi>

them to be the worst, or else they know not what

good people! I would ask such a one why call you
those <hi>good people</hi> that are easily drawn to sin against
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59262:98"/>
God? Nay that will sin because I do my duty?
He will say, No, they will not sin, but they will
take it to be <hi>your sin,</hi> and they will be troubled at
it? I must answer him, you talk of <hi>scandal,</hi> and
know not what <hi>scandal is: scandal</hi> is not <hi>troubling
men,</hi> nor making them take <hi>me</hi> for a sinner; but
occasioning <hi>them to sin themselves</hi> by some unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

know what you say, you make the separatists
almost the worst of men, that will sin against God
because another <hi>will not sin:</hi> yea if they would
but sin, because another <hi>sinneth</hi> it were bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
I would ask you therefore, whether you
take not the people of the Parish Churches to be
more than you? and to be <hi>worse</hi> than you? If you
took them not for much <hi>worse</hi> than your selves,
you would not separate from them. And if you
do think them worse, you must think that they
are more in danger of sinning, or being turned

               <p>THe fangs of the censorious are a common
scandal; and as strong a snare or temptation
to some men, as worldly preferments are to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
When we come among men whom we
take for the most Religious, and hear them keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
censure all for hypocrites, or formalists, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
or schismaticks, who are contrary to them
in opinion or practise; at the first we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being carried away as <hi>Barnabas</hi> in dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and to say as they say, or at least comply
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59262:100"/>
with them by our silence and practise, lest we
should be censured by them as others are. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Ministers are greatly in danger of this snare.
For the prophane hate them for their doctrine
and their holy lives; And it is the godly that are
the fruit of their labours, and the satisfaction
which they have for all their sufferings, and the
comfort of their lives: And if these forsake them
and despise them, with whom shall they find any
comfort in the world? Therefore they are very
much in danger of complying too far with their
errours and weaknesses, to keep their interest in
them: And they think it is that they may do them
good. And perhaps this was the case of <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with the weak Judaizing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
For <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us <hi>Rom.</hi> the 14. that it was
the use of the weak (who thought those things to
be duties and sins which were not so) to <hi>judge</hi> the
strong, who knew their liberty: And it was the
custome of the strong to <hi>despise</hi> the weak: Just as
at this day, the mistaken superstitious Christian,
saith, They are prophane that are not against all
that he is against: And those that see his errour say,
what giddy whimsical fanaticks are these? So
was it then; and so it is like to be, till God give
the world a better mind. Many a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
I have known, who have freely confessed to
me, that the censures of peevish self-conceited
Christians, enclined to separation, was a far
stronger temptation to them to forsake or overrun
their own understandings, than all the offers
of honours, or riches could be on the other side.
It is a hard thing, when we have spent our labour
and lives to bring men to Christ, and have got
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59262:100"/>
them into a state of hope and forwardness, to be
shortly after cast off by them as formalists o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
temporizers or any thing that their sick fancies
will call us. But for all this, it is but one of those
trials which God will have his servants undergo:
And both Ministers and private persons must be
above the praise and the dispraise even of self-conceited
Religious persons, before they can be
sit to follow Christ, as tried and firmly setled
men. Stand your ground if you are in the right.
Truth will bear all your charges at the last, and
will defend it self and you: If you <hi>please men</hi>
(whoever they be) contrary to God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
you <hi>are servants of men,</hi> and <hi>verily you
have your reward. Math.</hi> 6. But you are <hi>no longer
the servants of Christ. Gal.</hi> 1. 10. And you will
never be setled, but change as the Moon as the
parties or opinions of the <hi>censurers</hi> change. But
if you stick to the words of truth and soberness,
at last the sober part of the Religious will be
your encouragers, and many of the giddy will
come to you by Repentance, when experience
hath shewed them that which they would not
learn of you. That which is vertiginous will at
last settle its rest on that which is permanent and
firm: As boys when they have made themselves
wheel-sick with turning round, will lay hold on
the next post, to keep them from falling. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

come back with sorrow, or run to the end with

And when you have sinned against God to avoid
their censures, and keep an interest in them, its
two to one, but they will turn on still further and
further, till you are forced to let them go, and you
shall in the end be more censured and despired by

have those that never understood them, tell the
ignorant (that cannot contradict them) how er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
they are, and how they contradict
themselves: and what inconsistencies and absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
they speak: And it all goes down with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
auditors, as if the Speaker were an Oracle;
or at least, knew what he said.</p>
               <p>And to teach you to despair of the hypocrites
reward, let me tell you; that till God make the
world another thing than now it is, there is no
hope that ever the <hi>honester sort</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> or
<hi>Teachers</hi> (much less the dishonester) should ever
come to so high attainments, that the major part
should be truly judicious in judging of deep and
difficult controversies! And that there is as little
hope, that either of them should know how little
they know, till their knowledge in the matter it
self increase; or that ever the world (whether
Christians or Heathens, Pastors or People) should
cease to overvalue their own apprehensions; till
greater Light and study bring them first to <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and lastly to separate the <hi>certainties</hi> from the
<hi>uncertainties,</hi> and to <hi>fasten</hi> upon one, and lay by
the other. But I have been long upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>And it is so in almost all things else. Scarce a day
or hour that I spend, but I must sin or be censured
for it. If I neglect my most publike labours, my
conscience and those at a distance censure me. If
I do not, those at hand who expect all my time
should be spent in private converse with them,
censure me, If my publike duty command me
away, yet he that expected that hour in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
thinks that I disdainfully neglect him;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59262:102"/>
And if I should cast off preaching and writing, it
is almost all one: For that hour which I have been
spending with one, another hath been that while
expecting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and censuring me as sharply for his
frustration.</p>
               <p>If I had a benefit to do or give, which I can give
but to one, ten shall censure me, because they
have it not, when the one that had it is scarcely
thankful. If you would give all that you have to
the poor, when all is given, many that had nothing
will censure you more then those that had it will
be grateful. Expectations with most men are
high, and they understand not your inability:
And mens necessities are many and great; And
every one will say, why I look but for so much;
when all set together is ten times more than you
have to give.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Manner</hi> of our duties, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
will be as sure and many. If I would cure
any hearers of an error, instead of a cure, they
make me know they feel the smart; And that
they came not to be <hi>taught,</hi> but to be <hi>pleased.</hi> (So

to please those on those sides; and then
preach against them all again to please those on

all: (and God and Conscience who are more
than all.) If I speak on one side, I lose the
other. If I meddle with no Controversie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59262:103"/>
I must meddle with no truth: For one or other
controverteth all things; (the Immortality of
the Soul, Christianity and the Deity, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.)</p>
               <p>If in prayer it self I let fall a confession of the
controverted sin, which any are guilty of who
are present, they censure that Confession, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of repentance, are ready to say they will
joyn with such a one no more; And it is the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which must be the sin.</p>
               <p>But if once we have to do against the sin, of
any that are <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Godly,</hi> that <hi>power</hi> or <hi>piety</hi> is
made a patron of the errour; then it may be a
smarting censure indeed, which we may expect:
One crieth out, He is a pestilent fellow, and a
mover of sedition, as they did of <hi>Paul,</hi> though I
hate and preach-against sedition. Another saith,
he is bitter and speaketh against the Godly, when
I spend my self to preach up Godliness.</p>
               <p>But if it be a <hi>party</hi> that is engaged in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
you must expect the censure of all the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And what errour is it that hath not a <hi>party?</hi>
or that hath neither <hi>Greatness</hi> nor <hi>Godliness</hi> for a
refuge?</p>
               <p>If in doctrinal or practical consultations of
great moment you have to do with injudicious
unskilful men, if you contradict their way (be
it never so modestly) you are proud and self-opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ionated,
and must have your own way: If you
follow their mistakes, and contradict them not,
you may wound the Church and Cause of Christ,
and be more generally censured at the last.</p>
               <p>In a word, when such a multitude of things are
matters of <hi>Controversie,</hi> as many may be the matters
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59262:103"/>
of Censure. One will censure me for praying
with a form, or book, and another for praying
without it. One for being too long, and another
for being too short: one for this gesture, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
for that: One for preaching when I am
silenced; another for not preaching more. One
for being too gentle to dissenters, and another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for being too severe: One for being too narrow
in my principles, and communion; and another,
for being too large and universal.</p>
               <p>And if in the sense of the sin and misery of some
Christians Love-killing principles and practises,
I have spent the best of twenty years, in writing,
preaching (while I had leave) conferring and
praying for the Union of Christians and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
peace; I have but made a wedge of my bare
hand, by putting it into the clift; and both sides
have closed upon me to my pain. But I have turned
both parties in the fray, which I endeavoured to
part, against my self; when each side had one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
I had two.</p>
               <p>Nay this is not the worst to be expected: But
moreover I must add, that I was never more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of any thing as a crime, than of that which
I did most against, And even for doing so. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more suspected of Carnal compliance, than
when I exercised the greatest self-denial: Never
more accused of unpeaceableness, than for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
for the Churches peace. Never was I
more accused of Schism, than for striving with
all my power, to have united the Ministers, and
healed the Church, or at least prevented further
divisions. Never more accused of enmity against
the true Discipline of the Church, than when I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59262:104"/>
have done most (and at the dearest rates) to stablish
it, and to prevent its fall.</p>
               <p>In all this I meddle not with my Civil Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
as thinking it meeter patiently to bear,
than to aggravate their censures, though not all
so tolerable as private mens.</p>
               <p>I might give you as many instances of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of common Converse: He that hath much to
do in the world, shall hardly escape the censure
of many. The buyer will say he sells too dear:
The seller will say, he would buy too cheap. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that expecteth a commodity, will cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him that hindereth it, and steps in before
him.</p>
               <p>If I have a friend or kinsman unworthy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
office or preferment, he is nevertheless pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
in his desires and expectations, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unworthy. If I will not speak for him and
further his suit, I am censured as unnatural and
unkind, and turn a friend into an enemy: If I
do speak for him, I am false to my conscience
and the common good; and I must look to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
accordingly by many.</p>
               <p>But I will add no more instances, lest what I
intend for instruction, seem to be but a complaint.
But to what purpose is all this?</p>
               <p>It is to let the Reader know, that man is not

discord, and the father of them, are totally and

               <p>As you would not be used as Hypocrites by
God, and deprived of the true Reward of faith,
O seek not after the hepocrites reward! What is
the applause of mortal man! Can you not bear
the censure of such a shadow? How then would
you suffer martyrdome for Christ? Over-value
not the esteem of High or Low, of the Great or of
the Godly, of the many or of the few. Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
is sufficient to be your reward. See that
<hi>you be Godly,</hi> and then be more indifferent though
you are <hi>thought ungodly.</hi> See that you <hi>be loyal,</hi> and
<hi>peaceable,</hi> and then you may bear it, if you be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the contrary. Abhor all unwarrantable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and then you may bear to be reputed schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.
Study you to be <hi>good,</hi> and not to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted</hi>
good.</p>

And what if I should look further, to histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
fame when I am dead! Away with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of that too, as part of the hypocrites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward!
I confess God usually blesseth the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the just, and sets their names above the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the greatest tyrants, and causeth the names
of the wicked to rot: But this is but a temporal
and uncertain thing. If one write in my praise
to the highest, and another write a Volume of
false reproaches, how shall posterity know
which is true, who knew neither party nor the
cause?</p>
               <p>But yet the nearer reason of all this admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, to let you know that as contention comes
by pride, so over-valuing the esteem and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of men (though Good or Great) is a
dreadful snare, and cause of schismes: For then
you will be stretching your consciences, and using
your wits to please the party whose censures you
must escape: And you will wound the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
be warping to their errours and extreams: And
though by this you may think, that some present
necessity may be satisfied, and some inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
avoided, yet at the long running, the wound
will be found to be increased; and the cure the
harder because of the delay. Converse with all
men as those that must be finally judged by God:
and remember that the Judg is at the door.</p>

Unless you also be as much or
more with the soberer sort, who will shew you
the sin and mischiefs of uncharitableness,
censoriousness, and divisions.</head>
               <p>NOthing is more experienced, than the power
which the converse of chosen familiars hath
upon the minds of the injudicious and unsetled.
Which maketh education and the converse of
our youth, to have so great a hand in choosing
mens opinions and Religion: And is the cause
that Religion is as Languages are, diversified by
the territories or bounds of Countries. They
that are bred among such as use to speak of
dissenters, as odious, as hypocrites, as hereticks,
as schismaticks, as ungodly, as proud fanaticks,
are very like to be possessed themselves with the
same spirit of malice and detraction. The words
of those whom you respect, especially when you
hear them not confuted, will make you believe
that it is so indeed, and that the persons are as
mad or as odious as they make them. And thus,
the Papists think odiously of the Protestants, and
the Lutherans of the Calvinists; and the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
and Anti-Arminians, the Diocesans and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59262:106"/>
the Presbyterians, the Paedobaptists and Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists
of one another: because they converse on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with such as paint them in an odious shape.
And thus if you use only or chiefly to converse
with the <hi>censorious Separatists,</hi> you shall hear so
many invectives against them that are truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and sober, as will make you think that Love
and Peace and Catholick Communion, are some
sinful and mischievous things. Sometimes they
will deride them as ridiculous; and sometimes
they will call them temporizers, formalists, or
luke-warm hypocrites, who will do any thing in
compliance with their own commodities, and for
the saving of their flesh. And sometimes they will
thunder out some terrible threatnings against
them and their way, as heinously sinful. And this
language will form the belief and affections of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Christians, into its own uncharitable
mold; as a necessary part of Christian zeal. As
it was the common way of the success of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
to come into Christian assemblies, and in a
prophetical strain, like men commissioned from
heaven, in the name of the most high God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his judgements against the faithfullest
Pastors and their flocks, and pronounce them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
enemies of the light; and so by the very
terrour of their words, they frightened many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and boys into their sect, before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
at all what it was that they were against or
for: so do the Separatists declaim against the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Parish assemblies and communion, and
of forms of prayer and such like, till they have
frightened the ignorant into their mistaken

do from others, yet I would advise all the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

needlesly to choose the familiar frequent compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>And as the company of fierce self-conceited
dividers, is so very dangerous, so on the contrary,
the company of grave, experienced, sober, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable

is exceeding helpful to settle the minds of
the younger and weaker sort: with them they

be from God, which are but the effects of
your prejudice, passion or weakness of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</head>
               <p>THis is a sin, which I know not whether I may
say is <hi>more common</hi> with many godly persons,
or more <hi>injurious to God,</hi> or more <hi>pittiful</hi> as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>It is so common, that it is hard to meet with
many women and passionate Christians, who are
earnest in prayer, but sometimes they run into
this mistake, and judge ungroundedly of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of their prayers, by such feelings and strong
apprehensions of their own, as never came from
the spirit of God at all.</p>
               <p>And it is a great <hi>wrong</hi> to God, to be made the
author of mans infirmities and errours, and of that
which is contrary to his word.</p>
               <p>And yet it is a very <hi>pitiful</hi> case as to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
because it is usually the sin of persons that
are very upright and honest in the main, and that
are very serious in their prayers to God; and of
such as have naturally such weakness of reason and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59262:107"/>
strength of affection, as that they are less <hi>bleme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
though less <hi>curable</hi> than others are.</p>
               <p>To understand this matter the better, I pray
you consider, that Prayer is not to change Gods
mind; but to make us the meet receivers of his
mercies: And this it doth by exciting and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
those apprehensions and desires, which make
us fit by valuing them to improve them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such principles, dispositions and desiers as
are in us, Prayer doth excite and exercise: And
every man prayeth according to his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
disposition and affection. And that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
and affection, which is most stirred up
and exercised, is most <hi>felt.</hi> And that which is
most <hi>felt,</hi> doth most take us up, and is most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served:
And so we think that it is the impulse of
Gods spirit, and the answer of our prayers,
when it is but the operation of our own spirits,
and the sensible activity of our former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>There are very few that take their impulses
and resolutions, for the spirits answer of their
prayers, but they had before an understanding
most inclined to that opinion, or else a byas up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their affections, bending them that way; or
something in themselves which occasioned the
scales to turn that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But I did bring my mind to a pure impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and prayed to God that he would shew me the
truth, be it what it would be: and that if this were
not right, he would blast it and never suffer it to go on:
And the more I prayed, the more I was confirmed, that
this is the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> All this may be, without any of Gods
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59262:108"/>
approbation of the conclusion which you think is
his answer to your prayers. For whilest you pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that God would turn your mind from it, if it
were not right; yet at that time your judgement
was inclined to it; or your affections at least:
And it is an easier thing to speak impartial words
in prayer than to get an impartial unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
mind. And when you think that your mind
is brought to an impartiality, alas, there may be
many deep roots of prejudice which you observe
not: And there is scarce one of a thousand who
thinketh that he prayeth with a pure impartiality,
but his opinion, disposition, inclination, interest,
or secret affection, doth byas and ponderate his
mind, more to one side than to the other.</p>
               <p>But if you were never so willing to know the
truth, yet there are passions in you, and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
and ignorance and former errours, which
may all do much to hinder you from knowing it,
and may breed many false apprehensions in your
mind; and yet may cherish them with as dear an
espousal and affection, as if they were certainly
from God.</p>
               <p>And moreover, you have been gilty of former
sins: And whether God for any of them, may
leave you to run into mistakes, you know not. Or
whether any present self-conceitedness may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
him to leave you to mistakes.</p>
               <p>But the principal part of my answer is this
God hath no where promised to reveal all his
truth to you, because you desire him so to do. It
is not every prayer of yours, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to hear and grant; but only those which are
agreeable to his will: His will is either his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59262:108"/>
his <hi>Command,</hi> or his <hi>Promise.</hi> Though the
first be not it that is meant in the text, yet it is
certain that your prayers cannot change Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.
The <hi>will</hi> of his command doth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the sense of the text; but it is only a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
which may hence be gathered; that is, that
if your prayers be contrary to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
they are your sins and have no promise of
his grant. But it will not follow that God will
grant all the prayers which are put up in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his laws: But only that you shall be no
loosers by such obedience; but he will give you
that, or something which shall be as good for you.
It may be Gods command that godly children
should pray for the lives of their sick parents;
and that parents pray for the conversion of their
ungodly children, and that we pray for all men:
And yet it doth not follow that we shall have the
very thing which we obediently pray for. But
it is his <hi>Promising will</hi> which is the measure of our
<hi>hope,</hi> as his <hi>Commanding will</hi> is the rule of our <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi>
Whatsoever he hath <hi>promised,</hi> he will
certainly give us. Now God hath no where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in his word, that he will reveal the true
meaning of every text of scripture, to every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
person that asketh it. <hi>Praying</hi> is but one of the
means which God hath appointed you to come to
knowledge. Diligent reading, hearing, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
and counsel of the wisest is another
means. Even to dig for it as for silver, and
to search for it, as for hidden treasure, and to
continue so doing, and wait at the posts of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
doors, that knowledge may come into you
by degrees in time. God hath not promised you
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59262:109"/>
true understanding, upon your prayers alone,
without all the rest of his appointed means:
Nor that you shall attain it by those means, as
soon as you desire and seek it; For then prayer
would be a notable pretense for laziness, and they
that would not be at the labour, of study, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
or conference, might save all their pains,
and go to God and ask wisdome of him and he
would give it them. Even as idle beggars think
without working, to get an alms to maintain
them in their slothfulness. If instead of all our
reading, hearing, and meditation, we could but
<hi>pray,</hi> and so get all the knowledge which other
men study, labour and wait for, it would be
too cheap a way to wisdome. <hi>Solomon</hi> that got
it by prayer extraordinarily, commandeth us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great diligence to get it.</p>
               <p>It is very considerable, not only that Christ
increased in wisdome in his youth, but also that
he would not enter upon his publick Ministery
(as is aforesaid) till he was about thirty years
of age. When it had been more easie for Christ
to have got all knowledge by two or three earnest
prayers, than for any of us.</p>
               <p>Moreover you must pray according to Gods
<hi>will of precept,</hi> not only in the <hi>matter</hi> but in the
manner of your <hi>prayers.</hi> And there may be more
selfishness, and many other corruptions in the
<hi>manner</hi> of them than you discern.</p>
               <p>And there are many things which submissively
you may lawfully pray for, which God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
promised you at all: You may pray for the
life of the sick, and for the conversion and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of all your relations, and of thousands of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59262:109"/>
others which God will not give you. Otherwise
all the relations of every true Christian should
be saved, yea and all his enemies and all the world.</p>
               <p>To apply all this, It may be you are in doubt
whether this or the other be the meaning of such
a text of scripture? Or whether you should joyn
with such a Church, in the use of such preaching
and prayers or not? And when you have prayed
earnestly, you are confirmed for one way and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the other. And perhaps all this is but to
be confirmed in your errour: For first, you came
with a secret prejudice; secondly, or you came
with distempered affections; or with such a <hi>fear</hi>
of going one way rather than the other, that the
very <hi>fear</hi> doth much to cause your apprehensions.
Thirdly, or you come with the gnilt of former
sin. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spirit, and a secret inclination to one side more
than to the other; or some overvaluing of your
own understandings, persons or prayers. Fifthly,
Or you are lazy and presumptuous; and think
God must teach you that in one hour, and at a
wish or prayer, which others better than you
must learn with prayer and twenty years study,
diligence and patience. Sixthly, or you think
God must needs resolve you of that which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

it. And is it to <hi>One Christian,</hi> or <hi>to every

why do not <hi>those some,</hi> condescend to write an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Commentary upon all the Bible, when
they themselves are taught it of God, that so we
may doubt and differ no more?</p>
               <p>But if you say that it is not the meaning of <hi>every
text</hi> that God hath promised to make known to
you when you pray, but of <hi>some few,</hi> how will
you know which <hi>those few</hi> be? And where is the
promise which maketh this difference? Except
only that to all true Christians, he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to reveal so much as is necessary to their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
But if you will pray for more, your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of your success must not go beyond the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
If you will promise to your selves, you
must perform for your selves?</p>
               <p>

that they shall receive it?</p>

you prayer, and then made a <hi>promise</hi> to grant,
what you pray for, according to his <hi>will,</hi> that is,
according to his <hi>command and promise,</hi> and hath
made your <hi>believing</hi> of this <hi>promise,</hi> one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of his fulfilling it to you. So that if you
believe not his power and promise you shall not
have right immediately to the thing promised.
But if you <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> and withall use those
other means with diligence and patience which
God hath appointed you, you shall know in that
measure as is suitable to your state (For God hath

not promised the same measure of <hi>knowledg</hi> to all

a <hi>command</hi> nor <hi>promise</hi> for, your prayer is
sin, and your answer can be nothing but Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
or your own delusion. But if you pray
for that which you have a <hi>command</hi> for, but no
<hi>particular promise,</hi> then you have only the <hi>General
promise</hi> that your prayer shall not be lost, but shall
bring down either the thing you pray for, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else which the wisdome of God seeth to be
best for you and others; and to his ends. And this

unless you try it by <hi>faith</hi> according to the <hi>promise.</hi>
I have nothing now to say of the case of miracles,
but this: If God <hi>promise</hi> a <hi>miracle,</hi> you may <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
it because it is <hi>promised:</hi> If he perform it
without a promise, then either you must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it till it is done, or else your faith must be
a <hi>miracle</hi> also; And then the faith it self is its
own justification. But miracles are now so rare,
that all sober Christians will take heed how they
expect them, or over-hastily believe them; and
especially how they take their <hi>own belief</hi> for a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</hi>
All the talk that some men make of a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
faith,</hi> may be tried by what I have here
said.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the warning which I give you in
this case, is from long and sad experience. I have
known too many very honest hearted Christians,
especially <hi>melancholly</hi> persons and <hi>women,</hi> who
have been in great doubt about the opinions of
the Millenaries, the Separatists, the Anabaptists,
the Seekers, and such like, and after earnest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God, they have been strongly resolved for
the way of errour, and confident by the strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
that it was the spirits answer to their
prayers, and thereupon they have set them into a
course of sin. If you say, How know you that they
were mistaken? I will tell you how. First, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have been resolved contrary to the
word of God. And I know, that Gods spirit did
first make a standing Rule, to try all after-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses
by; And what ever impulse is contrary to
that Rule, is contrary to Gods spirit. The Law
and the testimony are now sealed, and all spirits
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59262:112"/>
to be tried by them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have found their impulses contrary to
one another. One hath been resolved for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
baptism, and another against it: One hath
had a revealation for a prelacy, like the order of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Priests, and another against all
Prelacy.</p>
               <p>One hath been confident of an answer of
prayers for Antinomianism, and another against
it for Arminianism: One for publike Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and another to detest it: And both came
in, in the same way. And Gods spirit is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it self. Thirdly, Because I have seen
abundance of prophesies of things to come,
which people have this way received with the
greatest confidence to prove all false. Fourthly,
Because I have staid till many of the persons have
found by experience that they were deceived, and
have confessed it with lamentation. And fifthly,
because perhaps I know more of the nature of
prejudice, affection, melancholy, feminine weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and self-conceit, and of tempting God in the
way of prayer, and of satans transforming himself
into an Angel of light, than every Reader will
know till they have paid for their learning.</p>

               <head type="sub">Do not too much reverence the impulses or
revelations or most confident opinions of
any others, upon the account of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
or holiness: but try all judiciously
and soberly by the Word of God.</head>
               <p>MAny that have no such impulses themselves,
are yet so much taken with the reverence
of others, that they are very apt to be seduced by
their confidence. When so great a man as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
was deceived by <hi>Montanus</hi> and his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess:
when such a one as <hi>Hacket</hi> could deceive not
only <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi> but abundance
more, some taking him for the Messiah, and some
by his breathing on them thinking that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Holy Ghost! When <hi>David George</hi> in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Munster,</hi> and <hi>Beh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Stiefelius</hi> and so many more pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in <hi>Germany</hi> could deceive so many persons
as they did? When the pretended revelations
of the Ranters first, and the Quakers after could
so marvellously transport many thousand profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
of religion in this land; I think we have fair
warning to take the counsel of St. <hi>Iohn, Believe not
every spirit; but try the spirits whether they be of God.</hi>
It is a pitiful instance of the good old learned
<hi>Commenius,</hi> who so easily believed the prophesies
of <hi>Daubritius</hi> and the rest which he hath publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Yea when he saw the prophesies fail, yet
when he adjured the prophet to speak truth, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59262:113"/>
got him to swear as before the Lord that it was
truth; this seemed enough to confirm his belief
of him: whereas if he had been as well acquainted
with the nature of Melancholy and Historical
passions as many others are, he would have known
that as strange things as that he recordeth of the
man or women, may be done without any Divine
inspirations: and that it is no wonder if that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
swear that his words are true, who is first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
himself before he deceive others. For
a crackt brain'd person to believe his delusions to
be real verities, is little wonder.</p>
               <p>I have many a time my self conversed with
persons of great honesty and piety (though of no
great judgment) who have some of them affirmed
that they had angelical revelations, and some of
them thought that the Spirit of God did bring
this Scripture or that Scripture to their mind in
answer to their prayers; and were so very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that what they affirmed was the certain
truth or voice of God, that I have been stricken
with a reverence to their professions, and with a
fear lest I should resist God in resisting them.
But resolving to take none on earth for the master
of my faith, but to try the Spirits whether they
be of God, by going to the Law and Testimony,
I was constrained to turn my reverence into pity.
For I found that their seeming revelations were
some of them <hi>Scripture-doctrine,</hi> and some of them
<hi>contrary</hi> to the Scripture: As for that which is
already in the Scripture, what need I further reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
for it? Is it not there sufficiently revealed?
Can their words add any authority to the Word
of God? And have I not Gods own Ministers and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59262:114"/>
means to help me to the knowledge of his word?
And as for that which is <hi>contrary</hi> to Scripture, I
am sure that it is contrary to the will of God:
And if an Angel from Heaven should preach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gospel to me, I must hold him accursed:
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7, 8. so that if these persons should have the
appearance &amp; voice of an Angel speaking to them.
I would despise it as well as the words of a mortal
man, if they be against the recorded word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But by what I have seen and heard, I know that
it is a great temptation to some weak Christians
to hear one that is much in prayer, say,</hi> Take heed
what you do: Have no Communion with this sort of
men, nor in this or that way of worship; nor in this or
that opinion; for I am sure it is against the mind of
God: I once thought as you do, but God hath better
made known his mind unto me.</p>
               <p>But saving the due respect to the honesty of
such persons, ask them, How shall I know that
you are in the right? If they say, <hi>I will not reason
the case with you, but I know it to be the mind of God;</hi>
Tell them, that God hath made you reasonable
creatures, and will accept no unreasonable service
of you; and you have but one Master of your
Faith, even Christ: Therefore if they believe that
themselves, which they can give you no reason to
believe, they must be content to keep their belief
to themselves, and not, for shame, perswade any
other to it, without proof! If they say that God
hath revealed it to them, Tell them, that he hath
not revealed it to you, and therefore thats
nothing to you, till they prove their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
revelation: If God reveal it to them but <hi>for
themselves</hi> they must keep it to themselves. If he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59262:114"/>
reveal to them <hi>for others,</hi> he will enable them to
make some proof of their revelations, that others
may be sure that they sin not in believing them.
If they say, that the Scripture is their ground, Tell
them that the Scripture is already revealed to
all; And if indeed what they speak be there, you
are ready to believe it. But if they pervert the
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pture by false interpretation, or abuse it and

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>apply it, none of this is the work of the Spirit
of God.</p>
               <p>If they say that the spirit hath told them the
meaning of the Scripture, say as before, that is not
told for you, which is not proved to you? The
Scripture is written in such words as men use, of
purpose that they might understand it; and is to
be understood by all men that hear it, though
they have no revelation: God hath set Pastors in
his Church to teach it; If therefore revelations
be still necessary to the understanding of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
revelations, then the Scriptures seem to be
in vain; and these last revelations must again
have new revelations to the right understanding of
them also.</p>
               <p>The truth is, it is very ordinary with poor fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
women and melancholy persons, to take all
their deep apprehensions for revelations. And
if a text of Scripture come into their minds, they
say, <hi>This text was brought to my mind, and that text
was set upon my spirit;</hi> As if nothing could bring
a text to their thoughts, but some extraordinary
motion of God? And as if this bringing it to their
mind, would warrant their false exposition of it.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Decry not the necessity of the
ordinary sanctifying work of the spirit, to bless
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59262:115"/>
the Scripture to your true illumination and sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification:

               <p>THis is the pitiful Case of the ignorant, and

fetch true grounded satisfaction from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,

are wiser than himself, as if he knew more than
all the Ministers in the Country. O saith the
deceiving Papist, you will never have setled com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
while you follow these Ministers, and till you
come to us, who are the true Church—Saith the
Anabaptist, you will never be well setled while
you follow these Preachers: They have not the
Spirit, but speak only by the book: Come to us
and be baptized, and you will have peace. And
thus saith the Quaker, the Familist, and other
Sects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59262:116"/>
I have known some that have lived long in
doubts and fears of damnation, who have turned
Anabaptists, and suddenly had comfort: And yet
in a short time they forsook that Sect and
turned to another. I have known those also that
have lived many years in timerous complaints, and
fears of Hell; and they have turned to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,
and suddenly been comforted: And
others have turned Arminians, which is clean
contrary, and been comforted: And others have
but heard of the Doctrine of <hi>perfection in this life,</hi>
and suddenly been past their fears, as if hearing of
perfection had made them perfect: And from
thence they have turned <hi>Familists,</hi> and at last
shew'd their perfection by <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
and meer Apostasie; who yet liv'd very
conscionably and blamelesly, as long as they lived
in their fears and troubles.</p>
               <p>The reason of all this is plain to any judicious
Observer. 1. The persons are ignorant and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had the right knowledge and skilful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of the sound doctrine which at first they
seemed to embrace. And 2. the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and fancy brought them comfort or quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in their change. For they thought before, that
if they had not somewhat extraordinary they could
have no assurance of salvation: And while they
held that sound Doctrine which all about them
held as well as they, and found no <hi>extraordinary</hi>
power of it on their hearts, they perceived no
difference between themselves and others: But
when they had entertained new opinions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into a new Sect, which confidently told
them, that they only were in the right, they had
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59262:116"/>
then <hi>something extraordinary</hi> to trust their souls on.
And the novelty of the matter, and greatness of
the change with the conceited excellency of the
opinions and party, did make them think that they
were now grown very acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>To this may be added, that as a life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath far more opposition from the Devil,
the world and the flesh, than the changing of an
opinion or joyning with a party hath; so it must
be harder to get and keep that comfort which is
got and kept by faith and holiness, than that which
is got by such an easie change.</p>
               <p>We see among us what abundance of persons
can live like beasts in most odious whoredomes,
drunkenness and rage; or like devils in bloody
cruelty against the good, and yet be comforted,
because they are of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
they think is the true Church. As if God sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
men for being of such a side or party! And
why may not Separatists, Anabaptists and others
easily take such kind of comfort?</p>
               <p>O therefore labour for well-grounded faith
and solid knowledge; that you may attain the
true Evangelical comforts, and your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
may not prepare you for deceit? and you
may not be like children toss'd to and fro and
carried up and down with every wind of doctrine
by deceived and deceitful men. Nor may not
have need to go to the devil to be your comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor to steal a little unlawful peace from
parties and opinions, as if there were not enough
to be had in Christ and holiness and eternal
life.</p>

God hath given them no command, but to pray in
faith and fervency, according to the state of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and others, and in such order as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the matter, and in such method as he hath
given them a Rule and Pattern of. But of all
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59262:119"/>
quarrels about <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> he hath never
made any of their particular determinations, no
more than whether I shall preach by the help of
Notes, or study the words, or speak those which
another studied for me.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder how they that believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
came first to make themselves believe, that
God maketh such a matter as they do, of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
words and forms of prayer: That he loveth
only <hi>extemporary</hi> prayer as some think, and hateth
all prescribed forms: Or that he loveth only
<hi>prescribed Forms</hi> as others think, and hateth
all extemporary prayers by habit? Certainly
in Christs time both Liturgies by <hi>forms,</hi> and also
prayers by habit were used? And yet Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
interposed in the Controversie, so as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the one or the other. He condemneth the
Pharisees for making <hi>long prayers</hi> to cover their
<hi>devouring widdows houses,</hi> and for their <hi>praying to be
seen of men:</hi> But whether their prayers were a
<hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>set forme,</hi> or whether they were <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,</hi>
he taketh no notice, as telling us that he
condemned neither! (And its like the Pharisees
long Liturgy, was in many things worse than
ours, though the Psalms were a great part of it:
And yet Christ and his Apostles oft joyned with
them, and never condemned them.)</p>
               <p>Nay as far as I can find, the Pharisees and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jews were not in this so blind and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
as we; nor never made a controversie of it,
nor ever presumed to condemn either Liturgies
or Prayers by habit.</p>
               <p>I shall now pass by their errour who are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
against publike prayers from a habit, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59262:119"/>
spoken of it at large elsewhere when I had
opportunity. I shall now only answer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
extreme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Where hath God given any men power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
and impose forms for others? or commanded others
to obey them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, where ever he hath given any
power to <hi>teach</hi> their <hi>inferiours</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> who cannot
do it in a <hi>better way.</hi> He hath given <hi>Parents</hi> this
power where he hath bid them, <hi>Bring up</hi> their
<hi>Children in the nurture, and admonition of the Lord:</hi>
Is it not by the Law of nature, the Parents duty
to teach their children to pray? And is not the
learning of the <hi>words</hi> first, profitable to their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the sense? May they not teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> or a <hi>Psalm,</hi> though it be a
Form? And why not then <hi>other words</hi> which are
agreeable to their State? And he that taught his
own Disciples a Form and Rule of Prayer, and
telleth us that so <hi>Iohn taught his Disciples,</hi> and saith
to his Apostles, <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I
you;</hi> by making them <hi>Teachers</hi> to his Church, did
allow them to teach either by <hi>forms</hi> or <hi>without,</hi> as
the cause required. All the Scripture is now to
Preachers, a <hi>form of Teaching:</hi> And when we read
a Chapter, we read a <hi>prescribed form of Doctrine:</hi>
And it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

forms of <hi>Baptizing</hi> &amp; <hi>administring</hi> the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you say, that the Apostles had an infallible
spirit, I answer, True: And that proveth that
that their Doctrine was <hi>more infallible</hi> than other
mens: but not that <hi>they only</hi> and not other men
may teach by the way of <hi>forms.</hi> All the Books of
Sermons now written are so many <hi>prescribed words
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59262:120"/>
or forms</hi> of teaching: And if we may use <hi>forms</hi> of
<hi>Teaching</hi> as well as the Apostles, why not also
forms of <hi>praying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you say that the Apostles prescribed the
Church no Liturgy, I answer, That only proveth
that no one is <hi>universally necessary,</hi> nor to be <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
imposed?</hi> but not that therefore no use of
<hi>forms</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> are <hi>lawful;</hi> May we not now use
the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> or pray in some other <hi>Scripture
form?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Apostles compelled none to use
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ and his Apostles assumed not the
civil Sword, and therefore so compelled men to
nothing: But yet their authority bound the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
when Christ said, <hi>when ye pray, say, Our
Father,</hi> &amp;c. he bound them in duty to do as he
bid them, though he forced them not.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, tell me if you can where God
<hi>forbiddeth</hi> you to use good and lawful words in
prayer, meerly because the Magistrate or Pastor
bids you use them. Is this the meaning of all the
Precepts of honouring and obeying your Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
[Do nothing which they bid you do, though
otherwise lawful.] O strange exposition of the
Fifth Commandment? If you command your
Child to learn a Catechism or Form of Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his meat, or for other times, will you teach
him to say Father or Mother, it had been lawful
for me to use this Form, if neither you nor any
body had bid me; But because you bid me, now it
is unlawful. O whither will not partiality lead
men!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But though it be lawful to impose forms on
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59262:120"/>
children, yet not upon aged Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Aged persons have too many of them
as much need of such forms as children. Age
maketh not the difference: We are fain to teach
many aged persons <hi>forms of Catechism</hi> as well
as children; Why not therefore forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is not lawful to impose forms publikely
on whole Congregations of Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> All sects in the world do it. I never
heard any Separatist or Anabaptist or any other
publike Minister, but he <hi>imposed a form</hi> of prayer
upon all the Congregation. He is void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense that thinketh that his extemporary
prayer is not as truly a <hi>form</hi> to all the people, as
if it had been written in a book. The <hi>order</hi> and
<hi>words</hi> are not of your <hi>own invention,</hi> but invented
by <hi>another</hi> to your hand; and <hi>imposed</hi> upon you
to use: For I hope you come together to <hi>pray,</hi>
and not to <hi>hear a prayer</hi> only. But the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is, First, that one <hi>imposeth</hi> every day a <hi>new
form</hi> on you, and the other imposeth every day
the same: Secondly, And that one telleth you
not what words you shall pray in, before you
hear them; and the other writeth them down for
you to know before hand. For my part I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
why written or unwritten, long-premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or suddenly expressed prayers should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for unlawful. But however do not think the
difference to lie where it doth not: For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to the <hi>people,</hi> they are both <hi>formes,</hi> and both
<hi>imposed,</hi> though not <hi>imposed</hi> by the same persons
and authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But at least you have no proof for imposing

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> First, I know no man that questioneth but
some form of prayer and praise were imposed by
God himself, on the <hi>Iewish Ministers;</hi> And <hi>one</hi>
was taught by Christ to his Apostles: And a <hi>form</hi>
of <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and of <hi>Baptism</hi> and the
<hi>Lords supper</hi> is imposed on all the Ministers of
the Church. And <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 17. a form of prayer
is taught the Priests: Secondly, But we are not
now pleading for the needless imposing of any
forms, nor the causless restraint of extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
prayers. I have fully born my testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that in due season: But many things are
lawfully and necessarily obeyed, which are not
lawfully commanded, as I shall shew you more
anon. I could heartily wish that we could say
that all Ministers (of any party) were such as
were wholly above the <hi>need</hi> of forms. Or at
least such whose own composures were better for
for the Church, than any that could be offered
them by others (If it were not a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)</p>
               <p>But all that I now expect from the Objectors
is, that they tell me or themselves, what proof
they have that it is a sin for a <hi>Minister only</hi> to use
an <hi>imposed form,</hi> when <hi>all the Congregation</hi> else
may use it? Answer this well before you go.</p>
               <p>And I pray let all the people note here, that
it <hi>is not,</hi> nor <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>denied,</hi> but that a form
(even a new one every day) may be lawfully be
<hi>imposed upon all them;</hi> and that the question is only
of the <hi>Ministers</hi> use of imposed forms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But our Ministers do not impose their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Do you think that there is no imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but by force? Your Pastor is your guide in
the worship of God; and God hath imposed it
on you to to follow him, and joyn with him in
lawful prayer. And what the <hi>words shall be,</hi> and
what the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>order</hi> chosen for that time
time the Speaker <hi>chooseth</hi> for you! And so he,
bindeth you by his Ministerial authority (which
is a true and lawful imposing) though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
you not by the sword or force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But Christ hath given gifts to all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and commanded them to use them. And
they use them not when they use imposed formes:
Therefore we must not obey men against Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt but all that are lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
have such gifts as are necessary to the <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
works</hi> of their office. But the <hi>degrees</hi> of
their gifts have very great variety, as <hi>Paul</hi> fully
sheweth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and oft elsewhere.</p>
               <p>And the necessary <hi>gift</hi> for hearty acceptable
prayer, is <hi>true Desire</hi> excited by the spirit of
supplication, which sometime venteth it self
but by <hi>sighes</hi> and <hi>groans, Rom.</hi> 8. 16, 26.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Ministerial gift</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> is <hi>Knowledge</hi>
and <hi>Utterance;</hi> by which a Minister may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to express the desires and wants of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
unto God: which includeth <hi>memory</hi> in some
degree. Even as <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Utterance</hi> are his
<hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>preaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And some have <hi>more Knowledge</hi> and <hi>worser Vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance;</hi>
And some have <hi>better Vtterance</hi> and <hi>less
Knowledge;</hi> And some through want of <hi>memory</hi>
are defective in both.</p>

The lowest rank of lawful Ministers, may be
so defective in their <hi>own gifts,</hi> both of <hi>Knowledge,
Memory</hi> and <hi>Utterance,</hi> as to have need of the

them.</p>
               <p>As a Minister who hath <hi>tollerable Gifts</hi> for <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

may yet need the writings of other men

their <hi>words;</hi> so that though he have <hi>Gifts,</hi> yet
being <hi>weak,</hi> he may use the gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of others. I
have been counselled since I was silenced, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Sermons my self, and give them in writing
to some weak Minister, that hath an excellent
Voice and utterance, and to let him preach them.
And really if I had not known that such have good
books enough at hand for such a use, I think I
should have done it: And who can prove that
this had been his sin? And yet this was a using
of another mans gifts instead of his own. And I
have heard men that are much against Parish
Churches and Liturgies wish that some unlearned
men of good utterance, might read some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Sermon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>books to the people, in ignorant
places that can get no better: And who can prove
the reading of a Homily unlawful.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Christ hath given to <hi>all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
such gifts as are suitable to <hi>their places,</hi> as
well as to <hi>Ministers</hi> such gifts as are suitable to
<hi>theirs,</hi> And the place of a Master of a family
requireth the gift of Catechising and instructing
the family? And they are as truly obliged to use
<hi>their gifts,</hi> as Ministers are <hi>theirs.</hi> And yet who
doubteth but it is lawful for Parents to teach
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59262:122"/>
and catechize their children, by such books and
forms of Catechisms as are composed by the gifts
of abler men?</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Prayer</hi> is the duty of every one,
and specially of the heads of families: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every true Christian hath gifts procured by
Christ, for so much as is his duty. And he is
bound to use his gifts. And yet those gifts are so
low in <hi>many,</hi> that I fear not to call that man ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively
an enemy to families, souls and prayer,
who forbiddeth <hi>all such,</hi> to use such forms of
prayer as are composed by the gifts of others.</p>
               <p>The famousest Divines in the Church of God,
even <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, Melancthon, Calvin, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
Sibbs,</hi> and abundance of Nonconformists
of greatest name in <hi>England,</hi> did ordinarily use
a form of prayer of their own, before their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in the Pulpit, and some of them in their
families too. Now these men did it not through
idleness or through temporizing, but because
some of them found it best for the people, to
have oft the same words: and some of them
found such a weakness of memory, that they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it the best improvement of their own gifts.
Now besides the <hi>first composure</hi> of these prayers,
(which perhaps was done 20 years before) none
of these men did use their own gifts, any mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
than if they had used a form composed by another.
For the memory &amp; utterance is the same of both.</p>
               <p>These all were famous worthy men, whom no
wise man judgeth to be insufficient for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
for want of gifts. But if such as these may
so many years forbear the exercise of their gift of
extemporary prayer, much more may far weaker
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59262:123"/>
Ministers do it. Abundance of young Ministers
are trained up under aged experienced Divines,
what if one of these should sometimes make use
of the same words of prayer, which the aged
Minister used the day before, as finding them
fitter than any that he could devise himself. Must
he forbear to <hi>do better,</hi> because he cannot do so
well, by the use of his own gifts alone?</p>
               <p>And in some Ordinances as Baptism and the
Lords supper, &amp;c. the same <hi>things</hi> must be daily
prayed for: And he that thinketh he must not
frequently speak the same things, will quite cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Ordinance of Christ. And he that will

                     </gap>gine</hi> that he must have always <hi>new words,</hi> will
at last have <hi>new things,</hi> or worse than nothing. If
then it be meet to use often the <hi>same words,</hi> why
may not a weak Minister use the <hi>better words</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when he hath none meerly of his own that
are so fit?</p>
               <p>Nay is it not the <hi>Duty</hi> of such to do it? Every
man is bound to do Gods service in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that he can: (Cursed be the <hi>deceiver that hath
a better in his flock, and bringeth that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt)</hi>
But to utter prayers and praise to God,
in a full, methodicall and congruous manner,
and in words suitable to the Majesty of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, is <hi>better</hi> (to the people and to the

And that may be more defective than your own
invention could reach to, which yet may be more
desirable for other advantages. As if all the
Churches for some good ends, should agree to
to use one mode or method or form, (as now we
do in singing Psalms) the benefit of that concord
might do more to the Churches service than my
singular better form or words could do. And if
the lawful Rulers commanded me that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I could somewhat exceed my self, I should
do much in obedience to their command: Or if
the people had a greater <hi>averseness</hi> or <hi>unfitness</hi> for
my more congruous words than for others more
fective, I should take that for the best food or
physick, which is most agreeable to the stomack
and disease. But especially if I am restrained
from the publick preaching of the Gospel, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of any of my Ministry, unless I will use a more
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59262:124"/>
disordered or defective form, I shall take it for
my duty then to use it. Because it is more to
the Churches edification.</p>
               <p>In a word, God hath bound all his Ministers
to use all their gifts to the Churches greatest
edification: But to use a more <hi>defective form,</hi> with
liberty to use my <hi>best gifts also,</hi> and to exercise my
Ministry <hi>publickly to all,</hi> is more to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>edification,</hi> than to use my <hi>own gifts</hi>
only a <hi>few days</hi> in a <hi>corner,</hi> and then to lie in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and use them no more. Though no man must
of <hi>choise prefer</hi> the less congruous before the
more congruous, when he is free; (which I
confess is a sin) yet it is a <hi>duty</hi> to prefer a <hi>less
congruous</hi> order before <hi>none,</hi> or before a better
for a day, with a restraint of that and all our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
hereafter.</p>
               <p>For my part I have often truly professed, that I
look at many Liturgies which I have read as I do
at the prayers of some honest men, who use little
method, nor very meet words and often toss Gods
name through weakness; who put that last which
should be first, &amp; that first which <hi>should</hi> be last, but
yet the <hi>matter</hi> is honest &amp; good. I would not <hi>prefer</hi>
such a man in a <hi>Congregation,</hi> before an abler man,
who will speak more composedly &amp; agreeable to
the matter: But yet I would not be so peevish, as
utterly to refuse to joyn with such a one. But as
God doth not reject his prayers notwithstanding
all his weakness, no more would I. And I had
rather have such prayers, than none at all.</p>
               <p>O that men would discern what is the true
worth of prayer? and how little God is taken
with the Oratory of them, in comparison of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59262:124"/>
faith and love and desire which is the soul of
prayer. And O that men would lay no greater
stress on their <hi>peculiar modes and words</hi> than God
doth; and condemn no mens prayers further than
they are condemned by God; nor separate from
any further then God rejecteth them or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
our separation.</p>
               <p>I cannot forbear telling you the aggravation of
this kind of sin. It seemeth to me akind of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against God. As if you would make the
world believe that God is so much for your <hi>mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>
and <hi>words,</hi> that he overlooketh all the desires of the
Spirit; and all his promises, and all mens interest in
Christ, and forgetteth all his love to his people: so
that Christ shal not intercede for them, or shal not
prevail, unless they pray to God in the <hi>words</hi> and
<hi>mode</hi> which you have fancied to be best, whether
with a Book or without, in <hi>these</hi> words or in <hi>those.</hi>
Me thinks you are renewing the old controversie,
whether in this Mount or at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> men ought
to worship? and knew not that the time is come
that God will neither accept men for worshipping
at this Mount or at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> here or there, with
a book or without book; but the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
whom he chooseth, do worship him as a
Spirit, in Spirit and in truth, as well with Forms
as without them.</p>
               <p>And yet some are more wicked than barely to
<hi>condemn</hi> their brethrens prayers, because they be
not cloathed just as their own. They will also
<hi>break jests and scorns</hi> at them, and take this for the
ingenuity of their piety. Like men of several
Countreys who th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Coats. So many do by the cloathing of other
mens devotions. Some scorn at <hi>extemporary</hi>
prayers, and some scorn at <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Liturgies:</hi>
And the Litany they call <hi>conjuring,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponses
they take for a formal jocular playing
with holy things; when in all these, the humble
heavenly Christian, is lifting up his soul to God.</p>
               <p>By this petulant carnal kind of zeal, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                  </hi> the <hi>Common prayer,</hi> and deride them that

heard some Separatists that lookt in at the Church

               <p>It is a dangerous thing to scorn and jest at any

I desire the Reader to peruse a judicious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in answer to one of this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
As much as he and I have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

our concenting admonition to you should
so much the rather be accepted in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And what pitiful arguments have they to prove
this charge of</hi> Idolatry? False worship of the true
God is idolatry as well as worshipping a false God:
But such is the Liturgy: Ergo—</p>
               <p>This is all that these rash preachers must trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Church, and seduce men into a hating
factious zeal with. But what mean these men
by <hi>false worship?</hi> Do they mean <hi>worship contrary</hi>
to <hi>Gods word?</hi> That is, which is <hi>sinful?</hi> And do
they mean <hi>All such sinful worship or some only?</hi> If
they mean <hi>all such sinful</hi> worship, than <hi>these words</hi>
of theirs are <hi>Idolatry;</hi> For they are part of their
<hi>preaching,</hi> which is part of <hi>Gods worship,</hi> in their
own sense: And it is <hi>false doctrine,</hi> and tendeth
to mens perdition. And so they and all false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

turn <hi>all</hi> sins in worship into <hi>one:</hi> It is <hi>all Idolatry.</hi>

prove you that the faults of the Liturgy are not

call <hi>false</hi> in the <hi>matter?</hi> Suppose it were so? When
an Antinomian, an Anabaptist, a Separatist, or
any one that erreth doth drop some of his errours
in his prayers, (as I think none will deny that they
use to do) must we needs believe that his prayer
is <hi>Idolatry</hi> therefore, as being <hi>false worship?</hi> And
is it unlawful to joyn with such? Then we shall
have more separation than you yet plead for, or
practise your selves. No two men in the world

idolatry forbidden in the Second Commandment:
It is not <hi>all false worship,</hi> but <hi>one sort of false worship,</hi>
which is idolatry: what else that Commandment
forbiddeth, is neither called <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor can so

prayers have so much false doctrine in them, or
false fire of carnal passions and uncharitableness,
as maketh it a much harder question, whether it
be lawful to joyn with such as he is, while he
abhorreth so much to joyn with others. All that
know me know that it is not my own case and

               <p>Secondly, When the profession which we make
by our Church-commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on is publikely declared
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59262:130"/>
to be another thing, totally distinct from this,
no man may justly interpret it to be this which is
quite different: But it is another thing which we
profess by our Church-communion; That is, I
profess my self only to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> in my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
when I enter into the Church, and in my
daily communion with it: And I profess to be a
member of a Christian Society, and to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them in Faith and Love and in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
God according to his word: And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ess
subjection to the particular Pastors of that
Church, as Christian Pastors, who are to teach
the people that word of God, and guide them in
worship and discipline according to that word.
This is every mans profession in his Church-communion
and no more; unless he make some
some further particular expression of more, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
sect useth to do, in professing the opinions
of their party. Why then should any lyar charge
me to make a profession which I never made, when
my profession in my Christian communion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by Christ himself who instituted it? And
why should I turn lyar against my self, and say
that my presence is a profession of that consent
which I never made the least profession of?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The wording of the publike prayers,
is the Pastors work and none of mine: It is part
of his office, as the wording and methodizing of
his Sermons is: And if he do it well the praise
is not mine but his: And if he do it ill the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise
is not mine but his. Why should any hold
me guilty of another mans fault, which I neither
can help, nor belongeth to any office of mine to
help, any further than to admonish him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59262:131"/>
Fourthly, I do not profess an approbation and
consent to all the faults of <hi>my own</hi> secret or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
prayers: Much less to another mans, who
is not in my power. I have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sorders, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and incongruities and other faults in all my
prayers; And if my very <hi>speaking</hi> and <hi>committing</hi>
them signifie not my <hi>approbation</hi> of them, how
much less is it signified where it is not I but <hi>another
man</hi> that speaketh and committeth them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And as I have said, This opinion would
make it unlawful to joyn with <hi>any</hi> Pastor or
Church <hi>on earth,</hi> because no <hi>sin</hi> must be <hi>approved</hi>
of and <hi>consented</hi> to: and every one mixeth sin
with their prayers.</p>
               <p>Obj. But (say those <hi>on the one extream)</hi> if I
joyn with one that is known to be a Separatist, an
Anabaptist, an Antinomian, an Arminian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his
own profession doth before hand bid me to expect not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the manner but the matter of his prayer be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, it is granted that no man may
in his choise, prefer an erring person or mode of
worship before a better. Secondly, But when
the question is not, whom you should <hi>prefer</hi> but
whom you may <hi>joyn with,</hi> it is not <hi>his</hi> errours <hi>that</hi>
are <hi>yours,</hi> nor his profession that is <hi>yours.</hi> I come
to joyn with him as a <hi>Christian Pastor</hi> whose office
is to preach the Gospel: And while men are the
agents I know that all that they do will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aulty: And it is not <hi>my knowing</hi> their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aults that makes them <hi>mine,</hi> but rather may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
me from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But for ought I know he may put here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
or blasphemy into his prayers, when I know
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59262:131"/>
not what he will say, before I hear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> For ought <hi>you know your Physician,</hi> or
<hi>your Cook,</hi> may give you poison, and your Nurse
may poison your child: But though that should
make you careful whom you trust, yet somebody
must be trusted for all that. You go not upon
certainty in any case where man is to be trusted,
but upon <hi>probability.</hi> Men are not to be distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their own profession, if they be lawfully
called to it, by cautelous and able triers, till they
have forfeited their trust: And as he would not
mend the matter who should make a Law, that
no Physician shall give any medicine but one and
the same to all in such diseases, and that fetcht
from the Kings Apothecary; And no Cook shall
sell any meat but what is drest by the Kings
Cooks; for fear lest they should poison men;
so he that would say, No Pastor shall preach
or pray but in prescribed words, lest he should
speak heresie or blasphemy, would but destroy
the Pastoral office, for fear lest it should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused.</p>
               <p>But here you have no great temptation to this
errour; Because though a man may poison your
bodies against your wills, yet no one can poyson
your souls but by your own consent. If he speak
words of heresie or blasphemie, if you disown
them in your minds, and consent not to them,
they are none of yours, nor can do you hurt:
They may be your temptation and your grief, but
they are not your sin.</p>
               <p>And yet I shall tell you in the next direction,
how far they are to be avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>(say those on the other extream)</hi>

When I know before hand by their Common-Prayer-Book,
what their errour in worship is, and yet joyn
in it, do I not seem to approve it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Do not barely <hi>affirm,</hi> but <hi>prove,</hi> that
all <hi>fore-known<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>faults</hi> of the Pastors words in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are <hi>mine,</hi> if I separate not: How doth fore-knowing
them make them mine. Take heed
that thus you make not God the greatest sinner
and the worst being in all the world.</p>
               <p>For God <hi>fore-knoweth</hi> all mens sins; and God
is <hi>present</hi> when they commit them; and he giveth
them all that life and time and strength and breath,
by which they do them: and he hath communion
with all the prayers of the faithful in the world,
what faults soever be in the <hi>words</hi> or <hi>forms:</hi> he
doth not reject them for any such failings. Will
you say therefore that God <hi>approveth</hi> or <hi>consenteth</hi>
to all these sins?</p>
               <p>I know before hand (as is said before) that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man will sin that prayeth (either by defect
of desire, love, faith or fervency, or by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thoughts, or disordered words, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And
I know that every erroneous person (commonly)
doth use to put his errours into his prayers and
preaching. But how doth all this make it mine?
I am bound to hold communion with all Gods
people on earth as I have occasion; not <hi>as</hi> they
are <hi>sinners,</hi> but as they are <hi>Saints:</hi> And I come
as to the Communion of Saints: And though
both they and I do bring our sins to that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and I fore-know them; yet <hi>I</hi> lament both
theirs and mine; and so far am <hi>I</hi> from consenting
to them, that they are my grief, and <hi>I</hi> beg forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
both for them and me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59262:133"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you said that it belonged to the Pastors
office to word his own Sermons and Prayers: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prescribed forms destroy the Pastors office: And I
may not consent to such usurpations by tyrannical
men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, the Pastor is the mouth of God to
the people, &amp; of the people to God: And he doth
word his own Sermons and Prayers; or else his
voice could not conduct you. But if he that is
conscious of his own infirmity, do take the help
of others in wording them, that doth not destroy
his office, but help him in the exercise of it. If
a weak Minister learn a prayer out of the writings
of some abler Divine and use it in the Pulpit, this
is no destroying of his office.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and if they that fear the effect of
Ministers weakness shall force them to use the
words of others, the speaker still maketh them
his <hi>own words</hi> before you joyn with him. And if
it did hinder the <hi>free exercise</hi> of all his office, it
doth not <hi>destroy</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But he doth it voluntarily, whereas the
weakness of conceived prayer is involuntary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is with more probability said, that a
man is <hi>involuntary,</hi> in doing that which another
compelleth him to do, than that which no man
but himself only is the author of: It is said to
him that readeth the Liturgy [Do this, or <hi>nothing]</hi>
But no body saith to an erring, weak, confused
Minister, <hi>[Put in your errours into your prayers, or
pray disorderly or you shall be punished.]</hi> Every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratist,
Anabaptist and Antinomian doth <hi>too wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi>
put his errours into his prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Liturgy is imposed on the ablest
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59262:134"/>
as well as on the weakest Ministers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Whether it be well or ill imposed, is
none of the question now in hand: No nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be lawfully used by the Speaker: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>you</hi> may lawfully <hi>joyn</hi> in it. And however it
be imposed, till the Minister consent to use it,
you shall not be put to joyn with him in it.
And when he doth consent, he maketh it his
own words, and (for reasons which seem good
to him) he doth choose those expressions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than others: (Even because he must use
those or none) so that he is still in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of his office; And it is his personal
fault, if it be a fault, to use those words, and
none of yours: Whether he do it willingly as the
best, or do it with a half will as of necessity, or
whether there be tyranny in the imposing them
or not; you are not guilty of any of this, by
joyning with a Christian Church that useth
them.</p>

            <div n="36" type="direction">
               <head>DIRECT. XXXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Yet know what Pastors you may own, and what
not, and what Church-communion you may
remove from or forbear: And think not that
I am perswading you to make no difference.</head>
               <p>THis is a point that I have more largely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
elsewhere, and can give you now but
these brief hints, lest <hi>I</hi> be too tedious.</p>
               <p>First, He that is not <hi>at all able</hi> to do the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59262:134"/>
works of the Ministry, that is, to teach the
people the Christian faith, and a holy life, and to
pray and praise God with them, and administer
the Sacraments, and in some measure oversee the
manners of the flock, is no Minister, nor to be
owned: For he wanteth the essential qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
As an illiterate man can be no Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
nor he a Physician, a Pilot, an Architect,
who is utterly ignorant of their work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he that preacheth Heresie, that is,
denieth any essential point of Christianity or
Godliness, after the first and second admonition
is to be avoided.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he that in his application, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to disgrace a Godly life, and to disswade the
people from it, on false pretenses, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them to a life of wickedness, is a traytor to
Christ, and not to be owned in the Ministery.
In a word, <hi>Any one whose Ministery is such, as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to destruction more than to edification and to do
more harm then good.</hi> But then remember, that it
is not partiality and passion that must here be
judge: Nor is every one an opposer of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
who opposeth the errours of a party, or the
faults or follies of godly men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Pastor or Church who will not
let you have communion with them, unless you
will say or subscribe some falshood, or commit
any sin of wilful choice, doth drive you from their
communion by their unlawful terms; and it is
not you that are the Separatists, but they.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When you are to choose what Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or Church you will statedly have your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
communion with, you should not prefer a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59262:135"/>
less reformed Church or a less worthy Pastor,
or one that is erroneous, before a better, but
choose that which is most to your true edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If you live under a worse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed
Church, or unprofitable Minister, if
necessity hinder not, you may remove your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to a better.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, and where Churches are near and
there is no great hurt or disorder will follow it,
you may joyn with another Church without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
your dwelling: But this you may not
do, when the hurt to the publick is like to be
greater than the good to you.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, and you must not conclude that the
more faulty Church and Minister <hi>may not lawfully
be communicated with</hi> though for your benefit you
choose a better, for this is the true crime of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
separation.</p>
               <p>But surely a mans soul is so precious, that
all men should prefer the greatest helps for their
salvation before the less; and think no just means
too dear to purchase them.</p>

               <head type="sub">In your judging of Discipline, Reformation,
and any means of the Churches good, be sure
your Eye be both upon the true End, and
upon the particular Rule, and not on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them alone: Take not that for a
means, which is either contrary to the word
of God, or is in its nature destructive of the
End.</head>
               <p>THere are great miscarriages come for want
of the true observation of this rule. First,
If a thing seem to you very <hi>needful</hi> to a good <hi>end,</hi>
and yet the <hi>word be against it,</hi> avoid it: For God
knoweth better than we, what means is fittest,
and what he will bless. As for instance, some
think, that many self-devised ways of worship,
contrary to <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 21, 23. would be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Church: And some think that stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with the sword as <hi>Peter</hi> did, is the way to
rescue Christ or the Gospel: But both are bad,
because the Scripture is against them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and if you think that the Scripture
commandeth you this or that positive means, if
Nature and true Reason assure you that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the End, and is like to do much more harm
than good, be assured that you mistake that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For first, God telleth us in general that the
<hi>means as such</hi> are <hi>for the End,</hi> and therefore are
<hi>no means</hi> when they are <hi>against it!</hi> The Ministery
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59262:136"/>
is for edification and not for destruction. The
Sabbath is for man and not man for the Sabbath.
Secondly, God hath told us, that no positive du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is a duty at all times. To pray when I should
be saving my neighbours life, is a sin and not a
duty, though we are commanded to pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.
So is it to be preaching; or hearing on
the Lords day, when I should be quenching a
fire in the town, or doing necessary works of
mercy: Wherefore the Disciples Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was justified by Christ; and he giveth us all
a charge to learn what this meaneth, I will have
mercy and not sacrifice; which must needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
I prefer mercy before sacrifice and would
have no sacrifice which hindereth mercy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if a Sermon were to be preached so unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
or in such unsuitable circumstances, as
that according to Gods ordinary way of working,
it were like to do more hurt than good; it were
no duty at that time. Discipline is an Ordinance
of Christ: But if sound reason tell me, that if I
publickly call this man to Repentance, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
him, it is like to do much hurt
to the Church and no good to him, it would be
at that time no duty but a sin. As Physick must
be forborn where the Disease will but be exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by it. Therefore Christ boundeth our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
preaching and reproof, with a <hi>[Shake off the

                     </gap>kest to be the success,</hi> the wisdome of Christ, and
not that of the flesh only, requireth us to take it
for no duty. This is to be observed by them that
think that Admonitions, and excommunications,

and exclusion from the Sacrament, must be used
in all places and at all times alike, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

will tempt God by presuming that he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
either bless or at least justifie, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
and imprudent actions, as if they were
a duty at all times. To be either against the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or against the <hi>End,</hi> is a certain proof
that an action is no duty, because no means.</p>

it or deny it: For lying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Sacred truth is always sinful: But
yet do not take it for your duty to publish
all which you judge to be truth, nor a sin
to silence many lesser truths, when the
Churches peace and welfare doth require
it.</head>
               <p>TO speak or subscribe against any truth, is
not to be done on any pretense whatsoever:
For lying is a sin at all times. But it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

is to be silenced for peace. Truth is not to be
sold for carnal prosperity, but it is to be forborn
for spiritual advantage, and true necessity.</p>
               <p>First, if the publishing of all truths were at

               <p>Thirdly, while you are preaching that opinion

not as great a sin to omit them as the lesser.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Mercy is to be preferred before sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
What if the present uttering some truth
would cost many thousand mens lives? Were not
that an untimely and unmerciful word? And is
it not as bad if (but accidentally) it tend to the

were easie to instance in unseasonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
words of truth spoken to Princes, which
have raised persecutions of long continuance, and
ruined Churches, silenced Ministers, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the death of multitudes of men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And where is there any word of God
which commandeth us to speak all that we know,
and which forbiddeth us to forbear the utterance
of any one truth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And for the most part those men, who

understandings precious, and do vend some raw
undigested notions, vain janglings or errors, under
the name of that truth which must by no means
be concealed, though the vending of it tend to

               <p>IT is pity that any wise and judicious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

in any good men, too much of their fervour
should be meerly affected, and seem to be what
it is not; or at least be raised by a selfish desire
to advance our selves in the hearers thoughts, and
to exercise our parts upon their affections. But
it is most pitiful that the Church hath any hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites

our cold expressions, that we believe not our
selves, when we set forth the great inestimable
things of the life to come. But yet it grieveth
my very soul to think, what pitiful, raw, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

And I durst not tell them of his great insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

it is an easie matter before we are aware, to fall

This is best, because the best and strictest people

persons are apt to reject it, because it is
owned by men so bad. But if Truth be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of their King and Countrey, or of their
Ancestors in which they were brought up; or if
their reputation or peace of conscience lie upon
it; or if the defence of it shew their wit or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or if they can take an advantage by it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
better men, who erre in that one point: It

               <p>For instance; If any Sect should rise in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who should deny Christ, or the Scripture,
or the Resurrection, or the Life to come, or the
Lords day (for all that they cannot keep it holy,
yet) the worser sort of the people would all rise
up against such errours. Shall we therefore think
that the people are in the wrong? So if any better
persons deny <hi>Infant Baptisme,</hi> or the use of the

would be all against them; and yet be in the

               <p>And yet how many do take a form of prayer or
Liturgy to be unlawful, meerly because the most
of the worser sort are for it! As a Pharisee
can gratifie his hypocrisie by <hi>long Prayers,</hi> which

in things indifferent; and yet presently
desired to get disciples to take their names, and

in hope to seek the saving of their souls, till they
prove as dogs and swine to their exhorters. It is
a common question whether we should go as far

them as we may. And it is very great ignorance
to say either the one of the other, without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
of wicked men! Seeing our duty lyeth the
clean contrary way, towards one sort of them and
towards another.</p>
               <p>And there is much difference also to be made
of the <hi>matter</hi> in which our joyning with them, or
going from them doth consist. For there are
some things which though they are no sin, yet
are so like sin, that our doing them is most like
to be a snare, and to hinder mens repentance, and
not to further it: And in this we must not come
too near them. But there are other things in
which our going too far from them is like to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their repentance.</p>
               <p>The injudicious zeal of many young Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
doth often carry them into this extream.
Any fashion of apparel which the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
use, they will avoid as far as modesty will
permit them. And any lawfull recreation which
they use, they will fly the further from because
they use it: And they think it a scandal, to shoot
or bowl or use any such game which bad men use.
And any form or <hi>manner</hi> of speech which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in it self they think they must avoid because
such use it. But especially any way of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God, or any controvertible opinion in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which is owned by bad men, they flye as
far from as they can; By which means all this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is committed.</p>
               <p>First, Their own faith and practise is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
For many an errour is taken up, by going
too far from other mens faults. Many a one tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59262:145"/>
Pelagian, by flying indiscreetly from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianism.
And many a one turneth Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian
by avoiding Pelagianism. Many a one
turneth Papist to shew his detestation of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of sects: And many a one turneth to the
giddiest sects, to avoid the things which are held
and practised by the Papists; and are so zealous
in avoiding the Papists ceremonies and forms and
holidays too far, that at last they renounce their
Ordination and their Baptism, and some at last
deny the Scriptures, the Creed, and the Christ,
which the Papists own. Many a one turneth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratist
and Anabaptist and Quaker, to get far
enough from Bishops and Liturgies: And many
a one is ready to over-run his consideration, and
abuse his conscience in the extent of his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with all impositions, through the indignation
or contempt against the unreasonable humours of
the Sectaries. And thus mens <hi>own</hi> judgement and
practise is depraved, while they think more <hi>from
whence</hi> to go, than whither.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you lose your advantage of doing
good to those you flye from: And therein diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the will of God, and have a hand in the loss
of the souls of men: <hi>Paul</hi> became a Jew to the
Jews, and all things to all men to save some.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19, 20, 21, 22. I pray you mark his
words: It had been no strange thing, if he had
become <hi>wise</hi> to gain the <hi>foolish,</hi> and shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>strong</hi> to win the <hi>weak,</hi> &amp;c. But to become a
<hi>Iew</hi> (as when he circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his head because he had a vow, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and to
be as under the Law to them that are under
Law; and as without Law to them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59262:146"/>
Law; and to become as <hi>weak</hi> to them that
are <hi>weak,</hi> to gain the weak, and to be <hi>made all
things to all men, to save some,</hi> this is far from the
religion of the Separatists. What abundance of
things do many now blame, and censure others
for as temporizers, which they have nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
(that may be called <hi>Reason)</hi> but only that
their neighbours use them? If a man stand up at
the profession of the Belief; or if he stand up when
the Psalms and Hymns of Praise to God are utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they say, he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ormeth to the gestures
of the Congregation: and make that his dispraise
which is his praise. And what! Is not <hi>standing</hi>
a fit gesture to profess our Faith in? and a fit ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to <hi>praise God</hi> in? Or is it praise-worthy to
be <hi>odd</hi> and <hi>singular</hi> in the Church? and not to do
as the rest of the Church doth? <hi>Austin</hi> professed
his resolution, in all such gestures and lawful
orders to do as the Church doth where he is:
And <hi>Paul</hi> would have us with one <hi>mouth</hi> as well
as with <hi>one mind</hi> to glorifie God. I entreat these
men to mark whether it was Christ or the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
that came nearest to their way, and whom
they now imitate? Was it for going too far from
sinners that the Pharisees did censure Christ? Or
was it not for eating and drinking with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
and sinners (though he did it not to harden
them in their sin, but as a Physician conversing
with the sick to heal them) was it not for Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking
and not being strict enough in such
mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers, that they were offended with Christ and
his disciples? The case is plain: But corrupted
nature more favoureth the <hi>separating</hi> zeal of the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> than the <hi>Loving winning</hi> zeal of <hi>Christ;</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:59262:146"/>
And will easilier suffer us to be imitators of the
Pharisees than of Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This going too far from those whom
we should win, doth not only lose our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to do them good, but greatly tendeth to
harden them in all their prejudices against a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
life; and to hinder their conversion and to
undo their souls. When they hear and see us
place any of our Religion, in avoiding a lawful
recreation, or a lawful use of words, or a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
fashion of apparel, or a lawful gesture or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
in Gods worship, they will judge of
the rest of our Religion by that part: And this
is one thing that hath hardened thousands (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the rich who are enclined to excesses)
in a scornful contempt of strictness in Religion,
under the name of Puritans and Bigots and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
and such like: They think they are but an
ignorant humorous sort of people, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
mad with a pride of their singularity in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
And think that when you tell them of a
Conversion, you would have them become such
whimsical fanaticks: And that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Religion and yours is but, whether
such a form of prayer, or such a gesture, or such
a fashion of apparel, or such musick or other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
be lawful, or unlawful; In which they
are confident that they are in the right? And
what greater cruelty can you shew to souls, than
thus to harden them in their sin and misery? Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
do such persons think, how many be in Hell,
through these scandals and snares which they have
set before them? And yet they take on them,
that is because they would not encourage men in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59262:147"/>
sin, that they thus flye from them. When they
do their worst to make all the world believe that
strict religiousness, is but the whimsie of a gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
sort of people, who are almost out of their
wits with pride. And what greater injury can
men do to Christ and to Religion than this? To
make it the scorn and contempt of the world?</p>
               <p>I know they will say that <hi>Religion was ever scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the wicked, and ever will be?</hi> But if it be
<hi>scorned</hi> for its genuine nature, its heavenly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
purity and goodness, this is the disgrace
only of them that scorn it: Or if they malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and causelesly call <hi>wisedome, folly,</hi> or call <hi>good,</hi>
evil, this will redound to the speakers shame,
where true Reason hath but leave to work. But
if you will therefore do as the Jews did, and
cloath Christ in a fools Coat, and put a Reed in
his hand for a Scepter, to expose him to the
laughter and scorn of the beholders, it is you that
will be found his deriders and crucifiers! If <hi>you
blind-fold him,</hi> and others smite him, and say,
Read who smote thee; his buffetting will prove
to be caused by <hi>you:</hi> If you will <hi>paint a saint</hi> in
the garb of a <hi>mad man,</hi> the countries hatred and
abuse of saints will be imputed unto you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, yea I may add, that you are the great
cause of the <hi>persecutions</hi> of the <hi>godly,</hi> and of the
damnation of the persecutors. While godly
people appear in their own likeness, in wisdome
and love and humility and meekness and sobriety,
the world doth usually bear <hi>some</hi> reverence to <hi>them,</hi>
though it hate them. But when you have made
men believe that those that call themselves <hi>Godly
people,</hi> are but a company of superstitious Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59262:147"/>
that cry, <hi>Touch not, tast not, handle not;</hi>
or a sort of melancholly humorists, who must sit
because their neighbours stand, or must go out
of the way, because their neighbours go in it;
This maketh them justifie all their cruelties, to
you and others, and think persecution to be their
duty: and to say that, the <hi>whip is for the fools back,
and wanton children must be made wise by the rod;</hi>
and that it is no wrong to a mad man to lie in
Bedlam.</p>
               <p>If you say, that <hi>Godliness hath been alwayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I answer, But if you are the <hi>causers</hi> of it,
though it must needs be that scandal or offence
come, yet wo to him by whom it cometh. <hi>Math.
18. 7. Luk.</hi> 17. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>The way of heavenly wisdome is pure, but
peaceable and gentle and easie to be entreated:
The way that Christ and his Apostles have led us,
is to draw as near to sinners as we can, by Love
and all the offices of Love, neither following
them in any sin, nor flying from them in any thing
that is <hi>lawful;</hi> that they may be convinced that it
is not <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>disdain</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> but true <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
and <hi>Gods command,</hi> which maketh us differ
from them as we do. And that we may not be

of Courtiers and Nobility, and Gentry?
especially of Ministers; And not only of the
scandalous that are guilty indeed, but of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
that are not of their way; whose <hi>faults</hi> they
rather <hi>make</hi> than <hi>find?</hi> But how seldome do you
hear them tell any how bad they are themselves?
(unless it be in formality to seem humble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
yea, how impatient are they with any other
that find fault with them? It would be much more
acceptable to God and wise men, to hear you
talk of your own infirmities, than of the Rulers
or Ministers, or Neighbours? The one is a work
of Repentance; and the other of detraction and
backbiting. The one is a work which you are
commanded by God (to judge your selves, and
confess your faults one to another:) But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a work which you have seldomer a call
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59262:151"/>
from God to do. One rendeth to your pardon;
the other to your guilt: Therefore if you fall into
the company of backbiters, that are dishonouring
their Rulers or their Pastors, or telling how bad
their neighbours are; labour to purifie these
stinking waters, or turn the stream: say to them,
[O friends how bad are we our selves! what pride
is in our hearts! what ignorance in our minds!
so wanting are we even in the lowest grace, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
that we have scarce enough to make us
take patiently, such censures as now we are giving
out upon others? so <hi>selfish</hi> as dishonoureth our
profession with the brand of <hi>contractedness,</hi> and
<hi>partiality;</hi> so weak that all our <hi>duties</hi> are liable to
greater censures than we can bear: And our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
graces weaker than our outward duties. Of
such ungoverned thoughts, that <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>tumult</hi>
instead of <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>fruitful improvement,</hi> are the
dayly temper and employment of our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
so passionate, impatient, and corrupt, that
we are a trouble to our selves and others, and a
dishonour to the Gospel, and a hinderance to the
conversion of those whom our holy exemplary
lives should win to God: so strange to Heaven,
as if we had never well believed it: And to say
all in one, so empty of Love to our dear Redeemer
and the God of Love, that our Hearts lie vacant
to entertain the love of worldly vanities; and
draw back from the serious thoughts of God,
which should be our daily work and pleasure; and
flie from the face of Death, as if we should be
worst, when we are nearest to our God. And
when we are our selves no better, should we not
rather complain of the sore that is so near us?
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59262:151"/>
and marvel that our neighbours vilifie not us,
and that the Church doth not judge us unworthy
of its Communion! Nature teacheth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth
all men, to be more sensible of their
own diseases, than of their neighbours; and to
complain of them most as loving themselves best:
Is it then because you love your neighbours better
than your selves, that you speak more of their
faults and infirmities than of your own? If not,
take heed lest it prove not to be the voice of love!
and then I need not tell you how bad it signifieth!
God is Love, and he that dwelleth in love dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in God, and God in him. The Devil is the
<hi>Love-killer:</hi> And what way can you imagine so
powerful to <hi>kill love</hi> to any others, as to make
men think them to be very <hi>bad?</hi> Doth any man
<hi>love evil</hi> that <hi>knoweth</hi> it to be evil? certainly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these speakings evil of others, are <hi>love-killing</hi>
words (though to his face to make him know
himself, they might be medicinal:) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are the service of the <hi>love-killing</hi>

               <p>To vilifie all these gifts in others, savoureth of
a malignant contempt of the gifts of the Spirit of

               <p>But if you would when you talk of others

be more in commendation of all the good,
which indeed is in them. 1. You would shew
your selves much liker to God who is Love, and
unliker to Satan the accuser. 2. You would

shew an honest impartial ingenuity, which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
virtue where ever it is found. 3. You

who dare not proudly contemn your brethren.
4. You would shew more love to God himself,
when you love all of God whensoever you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

mercies undervalued. 5. You would increase
the grace of love to others, in your selves, by the
daily exercise of it; when backbiting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
will increase the malignity from which
they spring. 6. You would increase <hi>Love</hi> also
in the <hi>hearers;</hi> which is the fulfilling of the Law;
when detraction will breed or increase malice.
7. You will do much to the winning and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them whom you commend, if they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.
For when they are told that you speak
lovingly of them behind their backs, it will much
reconcile them to your persons, and consequently
prepare them to hearken to the counsel which
they need. But when they are told that you did
backbite them, it will fill them with hatred of
you, and violent prejudice against your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel

               <p>Yet mistake me not: It is none of my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this while, that you should speak any <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
in commendation of others; nor make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
believe, that a careless carnal sort of persons,
are as good as those that are careful of their souls,
or that their way is sufficient for salvation; Nor
to commend ungodly men in such a manner, as

When as this later is much more usually a duty

him not so much, and yet is the greater part of
our duty to him; as the positives of Religion are
before the negatives. Exhortation (rightly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
is the plain direct expression of Love, and
an earnest desire of anothers good: When Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof

               <p>And I must say, that I find many surly proud

Exhortation: Their pride and self-conceitedness

remember that all the wickedness of these Priests,

suffer much abuse and persecution, sometimes
from Ministers themselves; and to see that it

               <p>Woe to the Land and People that can multiply
sin and cannot Repent! And wo to them that
pretend Repentance, and love to be flattered in
their sin, and cannot endure to be admonished,
but take all the discoveries of their sin to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

I know that Guilt and Impenitency are
touchy and tender, and galled, and querulous, and
such will bestow the time in backbiting their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor,

their sin. But shall I therefore forbear, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
their souls, and betray the Land through

by not admonishing them, <hi>(Lev. 19. 17.)</hi>
when I must shew that I love the looser sort by

a professed Christian, by calling him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

friend to tell me, with convincing evidence,
where it is that I have miscarried, that Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

O save me from the plague of an impenitent
heart, that cannot endure to be told of sin! &amp; from
that ungodly folly, which taketh the shame that
Repentance casteth upon sin, to be cast upon God
and Religion, which bind us to Repentance and
Confession!</p>
               <p>Nay in this place, I am not mentioning things
past, so much to humble you, as necessarily to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you, of the groundlesness of your present
arguings, that you may see the truth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Note also that I lay not any miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
on any whole parties, (Anabaptists or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.)
For I have found that all parties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
indeed have some good, experienced, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
charitable persons, and some self-conceited
and contentious novices, <hi>(1 Tim. 3. 6.)</hi> But I
speak only of the <hi>persons</hi> that were guilty and no
more.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Lastly, remember that while I seem
to compare the faults of one sort of persons, with
anothers, it is none of my intent to <hi>equal</hi> them;
much less to equal the state of the several sorts of
Offenders as to the rest of their lives: But only
to mention so much of the similitude, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessary
to represent things truly and impartially
to your view.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:59262:159"/>
Read on now with these <hi>Memento's</hi> in your
eye: And if after so plain a premonition you will
venture to charge me with that which I disclaim,
do it at your own peril; I stand or fall to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and look for a better reward than
the hypocrites, which is to have the good opinion
of men, be they professours of piety, or profane.
And with me, by Gods grace, it shall hereafter
be accounted a small thing (to the hindering of
my fidelity to Christ and mens souls) to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>And if there should be any Pastors of the
Churches, who instead of concurring, to heal the
flocks of these dividing principles, shall rather
joyn with backbiters, and encourage them in
their misreports and slanders, because it tendeth to
the supposed interest of their party or themselves.
Let them prepare to answer such unfaithfulness to
their consciences which will shortly be awakened,
and to the great Shepherd of the Flock who is at
the door, and who told even the Devils agents,
that a House or Kingdom divided against it self,
cannot stand, but is brought to nought! <hi>Math.

               <p>O the deceitfulness of the heart of man! Little
do many real Separatists, who cry out against the
spirit of persecution, suspect that the <hi>same spirit</hi> is
in them! whence is <hi>persecution,</hi> but from <hi>thinking</hi> ill
of others, &amp; abhorring them, or not loving them?
And do not you do so by those whom you causlesly
separate from? you will say, that <hi>though you think
them not to be true Christians, yet you love them as
men, and wish their good:</hi> And so will <hi>those</hi> say by
you, whom you call your <hi>Persecutors:</hi> Though
they <hi>think</hi> you to be proud and humerous, and
disobedient; yet they say they love you <hi>as men,</hi>
and do but correct you to cure your self-willed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and humour, and to do you good, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the publick peace. They <hi>think you</hi> to be
<hi>bad,</hi> and therefore <hi>imprison</hi> you: you <hi>think</hi> them
to be <hi>bad,</hi> and therefore <hi>avoid Communion</hi> with

               </p>
               <p>I speak not any of this to trample upon those
whom God in justice hath cast down. (A thing
which I so abhorred that I have avoided it to the
great displeasure of others) But if you are of the
mind, either that Gods justice should not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
or justified; or that you should not be
called to repentance; or that you should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
quietly to forget your sin, and die impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently;
or that the nation should forget the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of religious pride and faction, and so lose
the warning which they have had from God at so
dear a rate, and be tempted again into the same sin
and calamity, for fear of offending the ears of
the guilty; I am in all this as far from your minds,
as I was in the acting of these crimes: And can no
more consent to you, than I should have done to
have had all the Israelites murmurings, idolatry
and unbelief; and the sins of <hi>Noah, Lot, David,
Solomon, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. forgotten, and the history of
them never mentioned in the Bible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But (I pray you mark it)</hi> the way of God is to
shame the sinner, how good soever in other respects that
the sin may have the greater shame, and Religion may
not be shamed as if it allowed men to sin, nor God the
Author of Religion be dishonoured; nor others be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59262:162"/>
the warning. <hi>But the way of the devil is,</hi> To
hide or justifie the sin, as if it were for fear of dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
the goodness of the persons that committed it;
that so be may thereby dishonour Religion and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self, and make men believe that it is but a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for any wickedness, <hi>and as consistent with it as
a looser life is; and that he may keep the sinner
from repenting, and blot out the memory of
that warning which should have preserved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages

               <p>Scripture shameth the <hi>Professours</hi> (though a

turneth <hi>Lots</hi> wife into a <hi>Pillar of Salt,</hi> Satan is
willing to seem so tender of the honour of the

God saith to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that when those that

he will be all for the honour of professours.</p>
               <p>But God will make men more tender of <hi>his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and less tender of <hi>our own,</hi> and more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

It is the nature of true Repentance, to cry out
as publickly as we can to all the world, and be
glad to leave it upon record <hi>[It was not God or

Pardon this long excursion on this subject. And
if you cannot bear it, I cannot help that. <hi>I made
not</hi> the <hi>sore,</hi> nor <hi>galled place</hi> which is so <hi>tender.</hi> I
only mind you, in answer to your objection, that
<hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>opinions</hi> will raise <hi>persecutions,</hi> and have
done, even by such as you, yet do not separate
from. I know none of you that separate from
the Anabaptists and Separatists who were the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of these aforesaid persecutions, nor do I
urge you to it. Therefore do but impartially
judge of the sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is one thing to persecute for particular
opinions and interests (as almost all parties have
sometimes done) and another thing to perse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I confess it is, and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two is very great. But I pray you
consider, first, that they are <hi>but few,</hi> perhaps <hi>not
one,</hi> of all that you separate from, that ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
you any way at all: Nor can you prove
that ever they so much as <hi>allowed</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That they whom <hi>you and I do suffer</hi>
by, do not <hi>believe</hi> that they <hi>persecute us for Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
but think that here the case is more defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
than <hi>yours</hi> was. For you had <hi>no just authority
over us:</hi> When the Anabapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sts did pull down
the <hi>Ministers</hi> they pull'd down the <hi>Magistrates</hi>
too; And therefore it was a <hi>perscution of equals,</hi>
without <hi>authority;</hi> But those that <hi>we Ministers</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:59262:163"/>
suffer by now are our <hi>lawful Rulers,</hi> who have
<hi>made Laws</hi> to require us to <hi>subscribe,</hi> and <hi>say</hi> and
<hi>swear</hi> and <hi>do</hi> the things which we do not? And
therefore <hi>they think</hi> that we suffer but for a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
opinion</hi> joyned with disobedience. It is not
<hi>all men</hi> whom they forbid to preach, but <hi>us</hi>
who dissent and do not obey them: It is not
<hi>all men that are godly</hi> whom they <hi>imprison;</hi> but
<hi>those</hi> that meet to worship God in a place and
manner differing from theirs, and forbidden by
them. So that how can you say that this is not
for <hi>differing opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But we forbid not them to hold their own
Church-communion, though we separate from them, we
never denied them the liberty of their consciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Some of your judgement denied many
of them much of that liberty which consisteth in
worshipping of God in their own way, when you
were in power. But suppose they had not, it is
but <hi>another way</hi> of <hi>uncharitableness:</hi> The <hi>vice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed</hi>
seemeth to be the same. For you condemn
them as unfit for <hi>Christian-Communion,</hi> and
therefore you <hi>exclude</hi> them from yours: And you
take their Church-communion among themselves,
to be but a prophanation of holy things: which
maketh them the more impious, and therefore
the more odious: And you tolerate it in them as
you tolerate mens folly and madness, or leprosie
or plague, because you cannot cure it. And I
pray you judge whether there be any more <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Love</hi> in this kind of dealing, than there is in
that which you call persecution? Or at least,
whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her it proceed not from the same uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness?
I suppose you to be spiritual and not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59262:163"/>
carnal persons, at least in profession and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that you are not so tender of the flesh, as to
take its suffering to be any great matter to you,
in comparison of any of the sufferings of the soul.
When you refuse Communion with men, as
judging them unfit for fellowship with the visible
Churches of Christ, you judge them the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
members of the devil, and condemn them to
the loss of the greatest priviledges on earth, and
to be left out with the dogs, with Publicans and
Heathens: Though you think that you have no
more to do your selves in the execution of this
sentence, but to separate from them, yet you
declare that you think that all others should do
the same: So that your tolerating their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
among themselves, is no great signification
of your charity.</p>
               <p>The sum of all that I say to you is this: It is
but one and the same sin in the <hi>Persecutor</hi> and the
<hi>Divider</hi> or <hi>Separatist,</hi> which causeth the <hi>one</hi> to
<hi>smite</hi> their brethren, and the other to <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
them:</hi> the one to cast them into <hi>prisons</hi> as
<hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and the other to cast them <hi>out of
the Church</hi> as <hi>prophane:</hi> the one to account them
<hi>intollerable in the land,</hi> and the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her to account
them <hi>intollerable in the Church:</hi> the one to say.
Away with them they are contumacious; and the
other to say, Away with them they are ungodly.
The inward thoughts of both is the same,
that those whom they <hi>smite</hi> or <hi>separate</hi> from, are
<hi>bad</hi> and <hi>unlovely</hi> and unfit for any better usage.
When <hi>Love</hi> which thinketh no evil till it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated,
and believeth all things which are at all
credible, and hopeth all things which are not
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59262:164"/>
desperate, and covereth sins instead of condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without proof, would equally cure them both.</p>
               <p>And let me yet conclude with this double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
against the carping slanderer who useth
to falsifie mens words. First, That I intend not
in all this any flattery of the ungodly, or making
them better than they are, or forbearing plain
reproof or Church-discipline, nor any unlawful
communion with the wicked, nor countenancing
them in any of their sins, nor neglecting to call
them to repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That while I here name <hi>persecution,</hi>
my purpose is not to mark out any persons or
party above others, or determine who they be
that are the persecutors: But only to detect the
deceitfulness of our hearts when we most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of it; and to shew that wherever that sin is
indeed, it cometh but from the same principle as
sinful separation doth: even from the death of
Love to others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and I add, that though I here aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the persecution of unjust excommunications
or separations, as robbing men of the priviledge
of Christians, yet leaving them the common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of men and subjects; it is none of my
purpose to equal this absolutely with that destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cruelty, which leaveth them neither; and
will not suffer them to enjoy so much liberty, as
Heathens and Infidels may enjoy, or as <hi>Paul</hi> had
under such. <hi>Act. 28. ult.</hi>

Christs Churches upon Earth: that you
may know what a people they are through the
world, whom Christ hath communion with;
and may not be deceived by ignorance, to
separate from allmost all Christs Churches,
while you think that you separate from none,
but the few that are about you.</head>
               <p>THousands of well meaning people live as if
<hi>England</hi> were almost all the world. And
do boldly separate from their Neighbours here,
which they durst not do, if they soberly considered
that almost all the Christian world are worse than
they. But narrow minds who can look but little
further with their <hi>Reason</hi> than with their eye-sight,
do keep out at once both <hi>Truth</hi> and Love. It is a
point that I have often had occasion to repeat, and
yet will not forbear to repeat it here again; It is
but about one sixth part of the known world who
make any profession of Christianity and are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
(besides how much peopled the unknown
part of the world may be, we know not.) Of this
sixth part the Ethiopians, Egyptians, Syrians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,
the Greek Churches, the Muscovites,
and all the Papists, are so great a body, that all
the Protestants, or Reformed Churches are little
more than a sixth part of this sixth: (The Papists
being about a fourth or fifth part; and the other
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59262:165"/>
Christians making up the rest) And of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
Sweden, Denmark, Saxony, and many
other parts of Germany, making up the greatest
part, are such as are called Lutherans! And of
the other half, which are supposed to be more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
there is scarce any of so Reformed lives
as these in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> And among
these, how great a number are they that you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from? If you look to the Papists, their
worship is by the Mass: If you look to the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covians,
they have a Liturgy much more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than ours, and have a few Homilies instead
of preaching? If you look to the Greek Church,
to the Armenians, the Abassines, and all the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
and the Southern Churches, in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
they also worship God by Liturgies, much
more lyable to blame than ours, and have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
preaching among them, besides Homilies;
and the Members of their Churches are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
far more ignorant than the worst of ours, even
than the rudest part of <hi>Wales.</hi> If you look to the
Lutherans, they have Liturgies, and Ceremonies,
and Images in their Churches, though not adored;
and have far worse Preachers, and of worse lives,
and more unprofitable preaching than is usually
found with us; and the people more ignorant
and vicious. If you look to the remnant, called
the <hi>more Reformed Churches,</hi> in <hi>Holland, France,
Helvetia, Germany,</hi> though they have much less of
Liturgy, or Ceremonies, yet are their Church-members
usually as ignorant as ours, and more
addicted to intemperance, and there is no less
scandal in their lives, than among ours. Now
this being the true state of the world, and though

we daily pray that it may be better, yet it is no
better, I would only intreat you but to think of it
as it is, and that to answer me deliberately these
few Questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Do you believe that all baptized
professed Christians. (not denying any essential
part of Christianity) are Christs Universal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Do you not believe that this Church
is only <hi>One;</hi> and that every particular Church,
and every Christian is a part of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Do you not believe that it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in any case whatsoever to separate from it?
And that to separate from the Universal Visible
Church, is visibly to separate from Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Do you not believe that to give a
Bill of Divorce to the Universal Church, or to
many hundred parts of it, or to any one part, and
to declare that they are none of the Church of
Christ, is not great arrogancy, and injury to men,
and unto Christ himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. Dare you say before God, Let me have
no part in any of the prayers of all these Churches
on earth who use a Liturgy as culpable as ours?
because I will have no Communion with them?
Do you set so light by your part in their
prayers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 6. If you travelled or lived in <hi>Abassia,
Armenia, Greece,</hi> or any Christian Country,
(where their worship is not Idolatry nor substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
wicked, nor they force not the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
to any false Oaths, subscriptions or other
actual sin) would you refuse all communion with
them, and all publick worshipping of God? Or
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59262:166"/>
would you not rather joyn with them, than with
no Church at all?</p>

that now all the Christian world are congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
and are calling upon God and praising him,
in the name of one Christ, and in the profession
of one Faith, dare you think of being a Body se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from them all? And can you think that
Christ disowneth them all, save you?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. Can you think it agreeable to the
gracious nature, design and office of Jesus Christ,
to cast off and condemn so many hundred parts of
the Church-universal, and to accept that one part
only which you joyn with? Judge by his actions
and expressions in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. If there were b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t ten persons of your
mind in all the world, would you believe that
God would save none but those ten, or accept the
worship of no more, or that it were lawful
to have communion with none but those ten?
If not, how can you think so in a case so neer
it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. Can you prove that Christ doth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate

you separate from? or that they have no visible
Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for no Churches, and disowneth the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Ministers in the world whom
you disown? or yet that it is safe, to separate
where Christ doth not separate, and to be gone

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, Grace is not visible to you, but
the <hi>Profession</hi> of it only: Therefore your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
must be extended according to <hi>mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
and not according to sincerity which you
know not? when the question is, <hi>who hath grace,

               <p>Secondly, If Christs flock was little when he

if it be <hi>little still</hi> (as it is in comparison of the
world of Heathens, Infidels, and Hypocrites)
will he give them thanks that will make it less,
yea a thousand times less than it is indeed? Hath
he so few? and will you take from him almost all
those few? If you had but a hundred sheep when
your neighbour had a thousand, would you thank
him that would rob you of all save one?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, So far as God hath revealed the
fewness of the saved, we reverence his Counsels,
and believe his word: But if you will make it so

threds of vain and innumerable questions and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
and to crumble it into such invisible

no disagreement among Christians, no not in

judging of things lawful or unlawful, which are

and in hating one another, and all under pretense

mankind be all turned Bedlams, they can never

guilty of so mad a work. But what will you say
if this be the common case, of the far greatest

say further, if after above a thousand years univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
experience of the unhappy success, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
it still as the only way to unity and peace?
Look but about you with opened eyes, and see
whether it be not so.</p>
               <p>Were not he a gracious promoter of Unity in
the world, that would say [Unity is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a thing, that it is meet we should be all of
one complexion, or at least that the world should
speak but one language; and therefore no other
but one should be tolerated] And here how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is it to dilate of the great inconveniences of
many languages: I could write a Volume in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio
of it my self; and all true and evident. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I see hereupon how these Books are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and read, and how those called Learned
men and politicians applaud them, and shake
their heads and gnash their teeth at those that
would have so great a mischief tolerated: And
hereupon they set about the business, and desire
a Law that upon pain of imprisonment and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(I know not whither) no one in the world
shall speak any other language but one. And
now I hope Unity will be promoted indeed;
when all the world is thus engaged in a war to
perfect nature and make men one.</p>
               <p>But me thinks I hear one man that is awake
thus bespeak the promoters of this Concord <hi>[U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Concord</hi> in those points where God hath
made them necessary, cannot be over-valued:
But yet it is visible that there is a marvellous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sity
which nature is delighted in: when of all
faces and of all voices, and of all the sorts of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
and plants; there is so discernable a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59262:169"/>
yea of all the millions of stones in the
field, no two is perfectly like each other. And
where greater Unity is most desirable, it must
first be considered how much of it is possible, or
to be hoped for, and next, what are the proper
means to attain it. For first, the medicining of all
incurable disease, especially with violent Physick,
is not the way to make it better, but to exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it and hasten death, when a palliate and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
might do better. It is very desirable, that
all the Kings subjects were <hi>strong,</hi> and <hi>beautiful</hi>
and ingenuous and Learned; but it is not to be
hoped: But that they may be all <hi>Loyal, and honest</hi>
in their dealing with others, may be well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured.
And secondly, a wrong kind of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
will much more hasten and ascertain
death, than to let the disease alone to nature: It
is desirbale that all the Kings subjects be as is said,
both <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>Learned,</hi> yea and <hi>perfect in honesty</hi>
and <hi>piety</hi> without fault: But if you make a Law
that for the honour of <hi>Vnity,</hi> all that are not
<hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>perfect in vertue</hi> shall be <hi>fined, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned</hi>
or <hi>banished,</hi> the King nor his subjects will
be but little beholden to you for their Unity.
So <hi>one Language</hi> is very desirable to the world:
But first it is not attainable, and secondly a Law
to punish all that speak <hi>another</hi> Language is not
the <hi>way to procure it;</hi> but to set them together by
the ears: You must appoint <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters</hi>
to <hi>teach</hi> them all one language by degrees,
and keep them to their duties, and remove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
and thus stay the time; and what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
this way be attained must not be expected in
this world.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:59262:170"/>
The speech being ended the hearers derided
it, and made a Law for Unity to destroy it, and
set every man on hating and fighting against his
neighbour, to make all one.</p>
               <p>It is very desirable that all Christians were
perfect in <hi>knowledge, gifts</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that there were no different opinions,
nor no different forms or modes of worship; but
that all were equal to the wisest, and to the most
sober, pious, zealous and sincere. But if a Law
be made that none shall be endured in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that are not of this temperament and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the subjects of all Princes may soon be
numbered. Set <hi>`Parents, Schoolmasters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
at work, to make men wiser, and drive them
on to diligence in their duty, and restrain men from
hindering them, and from intollerable wickedness and
sin, and patiently expect the success of this: And
what this will not do expect not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I intreat the Separatists who will think
this doctrine of forbearance gratifieth them, to
observe that I speak all this to them as well as to

there pleadeth for, and not only a forbearance
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59262:170"/>
of <hi>smiting</hi> them with the sword. What a wonder
and what a lamentation is it, that those men that
cry out so much for forbearance to the Magistrate,
should themselves be as rigid and more by
<hi>Church-severities,</hi> and less <hi>forbear</hi> dissenters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a form or ceremony, as to communion,
and yet never see the same sin in themselves,
which they so much complain of.</p>
               <p>And here my principal business is to warn you
of the Papal way of <hi>Vnity:</hi> They are so great
enemies to divisions and sects, that they must have
all the Christian world, united not only in one
<hi>Christ,</hi> by one profession &amp; baptism, but also in one
<hi>mortal Monarch</hi> as his Vicar, that men may know
at the Antipodes when they understand not the
Scripture, or differ in opinions, who to step to
for the ending of their controversies, and to give
them an infallible commentary on the Bible, and
to tell them with whom they must hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
And all their differences may thus have a
speedy dispatch: If it be doubted whether one
in <hi>Abassia</hi> or much further off, be a Heretick, or
an impenitent sinner and to be excommunicated
or not; and the Church where he liveth is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
about it, if the matter be but referred to the
Pope, as the supream Judg, it is but going to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and sending thither all the parties and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
on both sides, and the Pope can decide it
much more judiciously than those that are on the
place and know the persons and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
And all this may be done in three years
time or less, if wind and weather and all things
serve: And if all the persons die by the way, the
controversie is ended: If one part only die, let
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59262:171"/>
the longer liver have the better, and be justified.
Or if the Pope will rather send Governours to
the place to decide the controversie, whether the
next Lords day you shall hold communion with
such a man, or not, and so forward, its like in a few
years time some of them may live to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And if you must still appeal to the Pope
himself for fear lest a Priest be not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
or final Judg (and can do no better than
other folks Priests,) you may after all, have
the liberty of the voyage: And if you cannot in
that age get the case dispatched, yet you must
believe that you have appeared to the only center
of Unity.</p>
               <p>This cheating noise and name of <hi>Vnity,</hi> hath
been the great divider of the Christian world.
And under pretense of suppressing Heresie and
Schism, and bringing a blessed peace and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
amongst all Christians, the Churches have
been set all together by the ears, condemning
and unchurching one another, and millions have
been murthered in the flames, inquisition and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinds of death, and those are Martyrs with

all the Apostles are but the nobler sort of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and none of them the Head. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 27,
28. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in
particular: and God hath set some in the Church, first
Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> &amp;c.
But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (aware of this) hath devised this
shift, that the Pope succeedeth <hi>Peter,</hi> in more
than his Apostle-ship, even his Head-ship: But
when he hath proved <hi>Peter</hi> more than an Apostle,

we should give him more honour, than his

like to procure him. For he that will needs have

                  </gap> as others, do honour those
whom their fore-fathers hated and murthered.
<hi>Math. 23. 29, 30. Wo to you scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites: because ye build the tombs of the Prophets,
and garnish the sepul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hres of the righteous, and say, If
we had been in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not
have been partakers with them in the blood of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
Wherefore ye be witnesses to your selves, that
ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets:
Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.</hi> The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of one generation kill Gods servants, and the
wicked of the next Generation do honour their
names, and celebrate their memorial: The reason
is because, it is the <hi>Life of Godliness,</hi> which the
sinner is troubled with and hateth: And therefore
it is the <hi>living saint</hi> whom he abhorreth. But the
<hi>name</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Godliness</hi> is less troublesome to
him, yea and may be <hi>useful</hi> to make him a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of, to quiet his conscience in his sin: And
therefore the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>dead saints</hi> he can honour,
and the <hi>form</hi> of their worship, and <hi>corps</hi> of piety
he can own. And having become so <hi>Religious,</hi>
both his former enmity to <hi>living holiness;</hi> and his
carnal zeal for his <hi>Image</hi> of Religion, engage him
to make a stir for it; and persecute those that
are not of his way. And when the <hi>zealous</hi> and
devout people of that age see this; they loath that
carkass or Image which the formalist contendeth
for, and many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lye from it with too great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for the persons sake who now esteems it;
forgetting its original, and that it was <hi>such as they,</hi>
that set it up, and were the first inventers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:59262:173"/>
For instance: The most of the persons whom
the Papists now keep holy dayes for, were very
religious godly people: And the zealous Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
people of that age, did think that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of the memories of the Martyrs, was a
great means to invite the infidels to Christianity,
and to encourage the weak to stick to Christ: And
therefore they kept the dayes of their martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in thanksgiving to God, and in honour
of them. The wicked of that age hated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
both the Martyrs and them that honoured
them. In the next age Religion being uppermost
in the world, the wicked did turn Hypocrites, and
keep Holy dayes for the honour of their names
whom their fore-fathers murthered. At last
when it was observed that the Papists who bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the living Saints, were the greatest honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the dead, the most religious people turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
quite to dislike and reject those very dayes,
which their predecessors had set up in thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to God, for the doctrine, example and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of the Martyrs.</p>
               <p>The same all along I may say about the Relicts
of Martyrs, and pilgrimages to their shrines,
which the Religious sort <hi>begun</hi> at first, and <hi>loathe</hi>
at last.</p>
               <p>So also those <hi>forms</hi> of Liturgy which now are
most distasted, were brought in by the most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
religious people at the first: The many short
invocations, versicles and responses which the
people use, were brought in when the souls of
the faithful did abound with zeal, and in holy
servours break out into such expressions, and could
not well endure to be bare auditors, and not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59262:173"/>
to bear their part in the praises of God, and
prayers of the Church. And in time those very
words which signified their raptures, were used
by formal hypocrites without their zeal who first
exprest them; and so being mortified, and made
dead Images and used but by rote, in a senseless
canting among the Papists, and also forced upon
others; it is now become a point of <hi>zeal</hi> to <hi>avoid</hi>
them, and take them as <hi>unlawful,</hi> and it is a great
reason, because they are in the Mass-book:
when the Mass-book received them from the
predecessors of many of <hi>those men</hi> that now refuse
them: But though indeed the highest expressions
of zeal and rapture, are most lothsome when
they are counterfeited and turned into a meer
lifeless form: Yet it is the privation of life
which is the fault of the Image, and not the
thing as in it self. Restore the same spirit to those
words, and they will be as good as they were at
the beginning.</p>
               <p>I might instance in most of the Popish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions,
and shew you, that for the most part, it
was the godliest sort of people of that age, who
at first did either set them up, or that which
did occasion them; and that the hypocrite after
made them his Religion, taking up the form
without the life, and that upon this the godly of
after ages did abhor them.</p>
               <p>But what is my inference from all this? Why
first, I would advise you, to look more to the
<hi>nature</hi> of the things themselves, and less to the
<hi>persons;</hi> and regard the honour of humanity, if
you regard not the honour of Religion; and make
not the Infidel world deride you, while they see
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59262:174"/>
you alter your opinions and practise in meer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to one another; and to take up and lay
down as the two ends of the ballance move, which
must be contrary to each other. Secondly, that
you truly understand what interest such zealous
persons as your selves had in those opinions,
forms and practises at the first, that if you will
avoid them for <hi>some mens</hi> sake, you may think the
better of them for <hi>other</hi> mens: so far as to bring
you to some impartiality. Thirdly that you
suspect that zeal in your selves, which you think
so much miscarried in your ancestors.</p>
               <p>I do not take all that I have mentioned for <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi>
but I shew you the circulation which
<hi>zeal,</hi> and <hi>formality</hi> and <hi>maligni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi> make, both in
things warrantable and unwarrantable.</p>
               <p>But especially take heed of that which is true
<hi>superstition</hi> indeed: By which here I mean, <hi>the
making of any new parts of Religion to our selves, and
fathering them upon God,</hi> who never made them.
Of this there are two sorts, <hi>Positive</hi> and <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi>
When we falsly say, <hi>This is a Duty commanded
by God;</hi> or when we falsly say, <hi>This is a sin forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by God.</hi> Take heed of both. I do not speak here
of <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>not doing</hi> the same things upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account (as humane duties, or meer conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
or the like) but as they are falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, this is properly a <hi>belying</hi> of God, and
that <hi>adding</hi> to his word (whether <hi>precepts</hi> or <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions)</hi>
which he hath so strictly forbidden us.
<hi>Ier. 5. 12. Deut.</hi> 12. 32.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it <hi>debaseth</hi> Religion objectively
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59262:174"/>
considered as mixture of base mettals debaseth
the Kings coyn: To joyn things humane with
things <hi>divine,</hi> and say they are <hi>Divine</hi> when they
are not, is putting of dung into the treasuries of
God. Nothing will be found fit for Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and honour, which is not Divine indeed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it corrupteth Religion in the <hi>minds
of men;</hi> and causeth them to fear where no fear
is, and to be devout erroneously: As if one
should mistake the person of the King, and give
his honour to another who is like him: or should
run into a play-house to do his devotion, and
think that he is in the Church. <hi>Ye worship ye know
not what: we know what we worship, Ioh.</hi> 4. 22.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This <hi>superstition</hi> tendeth to <hi>destroy</hi>
true Religion, by gratifying and increasing aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and opposition; by making it seem an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely
tiresome thing. All that is truly of God
is <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>amiable,</hi> and wisely contrived for
our good: And the enemies of Godliness, have
not a word of solid Reason, to say against it: But
that which is brought in by <hi>corrupters</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed:
And <hi>unnecessary</hi> things become a <hi>burden,
Act.</hi> 15. 28. What a toilsome task doth Popery
contain? of positives and negatives? ceremonies,
and austerities, and useless labours? And then
they that take their pilgrimages, and penances, and
night-risings, and multiplied formalities to be a
<hi>burden,</hi> and hear them called by the name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
do account <hi>Religion it self</hi> a burden, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this to be a part of it: And when Religion
is not <hi>loved</hi> it is <hi>lost.</hi> To make it seem <hi>bad</hi> and
<hi>unlovely,</hi> is the way by which the devil destroyeth
it in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:59262:175"/>
Fifthly, <hi>Superstition</hi> is the great dividing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
which satan useth to cut the Churches of
Christ into Sects and pieces; and consequently
to stir up party against party, to the hating and
persecuting of one another: For while some take
that for Religion which is none; others will see
their errour and avoid it: And thus the division
will lay the foundation of disputes and quarrels,
of enmity and opposition. For who can think
that all the Churches should ever be so blind and
slavish, as to take up that as a part of Religion, and
a divine institution, which was forged by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
spirit of some erroneous person of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated
brain.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Lastly, <hi>Superstition</hi> much displeaseth
God; and maketh us <hi>sinners,</hi> even in that, in which
we think especially to honour him. <hi>Math. 15. 9.
In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandements of men:</hi> Though God in mercy
can distinguish between his own and ours, and
doth not count <hi>the whole</hi> worship to be <hi>in vain,</hi>
where <hi>any degree</hi> of superstition is mixed (For
then most zealous persons were undone;) yet the
<hi>superstitious part</hi> of worship is alwayes <hi>in vain;</hi>
and all the rest is made as vain, where that is the
predominant and denominating part. Thus <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing</hi>
is <hi>undoing,</hi> and thus the superstitious are
(materially) <hi>righteous overmuch.</hi> And not only
much cost and pains is lost, but the soul corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Church divided, Religion debased and
endangered and God displeased, by ignorant
zeal.</p>
               <p>Here note to prevent mistakes; First, that as
God is related to our actions, either as the <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59262:175"/>
commanding,</hi> or as the <hi>final</hi> cause; so there
is a double superstition; One (which is the
greatest as comprehending the other) when that
which God never commanded or forbade, is feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be commanded or forbidden by him: The
other when we feign him <hi>finally</hi> to be <hi>pleased</hi> with
a Religious worship of our own invention, though
we confess it to have no higher an original than
our selves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the <hi>matter</hi> of this later sort of
superstition is either that which God <hi>forbiddeth</hi>
and so is <hi>displeased with;</hi> or that which he hath
made and holdeth <hi>indifferent;</hi> and so is neither
pleased or displeased with, in any moral considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in it self considered. He that of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ereth
God a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>crifice</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> (or things prohibited) or
of a worthless and indifferent thing, and taketh
God to be <hi>pleased</hi> with the later, or <hi>not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
with the former, doth indeed displease him
by either of these conceits. And the <hi>general
prohibition</hi> of not <hi>adding</hi> or <hi>diminishing,</hi> rightly
understood, may notifie things as under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
head.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But it is no superstition to hold a good
thing to be good; a bad thing to be bad; or an
indifferent thing to be indifferent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Nor yet to determine of those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of worship which God hath left to
humane determination; being made necessary <hi>in
genere</hi> by nature or scripture: Nor yet to judge
that God is pleased with such a prudent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is not superstition to do the same
material thing, which another doth superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59262:176"/>
if we have not the same superstitious
conceit of it as he hath. If a Papist should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anoint
the sick, as a Sacrament, and a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
do it as a medicine, the former is snpersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not the later. And so in other things.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whether that indifferent thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
indifferent to our use, which others use to
superstition, is a case which a judicious collation
of circumstances must determine. His supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
use doth not make it simply a sin in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath none of his false conceits and
ends: (else some superstitious persons so abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
meat and drink and cloaths, and all things
in the world might make all things become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to us: or at least deprive us of all our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in things indifferent.)</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If we avoid <hi>anothers uperstition</hi> as to
the <hi>form</hi> or <hi>intention</hi> which maketh it superstition,
and this as a sin, we do well: If we avoid the
<hi>matter</hi> it self which he useth superstitiously, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is by him made <hi>scandalous,</hi> we do our duty,
when it is <hi>scandalous indeed,</hi> &amp; no contrary greater
accident maketh it <hi>our duty.</hi> But if we take it to be
<hi>simply superstition</hi> or <hi>sin,</hi> to do materially the same
action, which a snperstitious person doth, we are
<hi>superstitious</hi> in avoiding his <hi>superstitious</hi> act.</p>
               <p>For instance, a Papist vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iteth the Lady of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi>
as a divine duty: This is superstition: A
Protestant goeth thither upon lawful and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
business: This is no superstition: Another
Protestant who hath no necessary business there,
avoideth it that he may not be <hi>scandalous</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
others to it. This is well done. A Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thinketh it <hi>superstition</hi> or other sin, simply to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59262:176"/>
go thither what ever his <hi>necessity</hi> or <hi>intention</hi> be:
This is superstition: Or a feigning God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that which he forbiddeth not.</p>
               <p>A Papist fasteth on Friday, or avoideth flesh
in Lent as a <hi>Divine duty: superstitiously:</hi> A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
fasteth the same day, because an Act of
Parliament commandeth it, which renounceth
the Papists religious end; Or because his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
prescribeth it as necessary for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is health. This
is not superstition. Another Protestant avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it through necessity for his health: And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Popish Countries avoideth it only as
<hi>scandalous:</hi> Neither of these are superstitious. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
fasteth on a Friday for his own necessity or
conveuience, as a time which he may lawfully
choose. And another fasteth on a Friday; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Master of the family, or the Pastors of
the Church, have appointed a fast on that day.
This is no superstition. A Sectary thinketh that
it is superstition or some other sin to fast the same
day that the Papists do, because the Papists do
it superstitiously. This is superstition (unless
in the case of scandal as aforesaid.)</p>
               <p>The multitudes of superstitions by which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
or <hi>any others,</hi> have corrupted and debased the
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> I shall not n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w digress to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But only touch upon a few instances, of
the <hi>superstitions</hi> of <hi>those godly persons</hi> of <hi>this age,</hi> to
whom I am now writing: To shew them, that it
is the <hi>Religious sort,</hi> that are the common begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of superstition, by <hi>over-doing,</hi> out of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
zeal, or fear of sinning.</p>
               <p>I refer the Reader to <hi>Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on</hi> for full proof.</p>
               <p>But here again I must first crave the patience
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59262:177"/>
of those that love not errour better than informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and desire them not to be too angry with
me for telling them what I confidently hold,
though it diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> from the opinions of many whom
I greatly reverence and honour; while I profess
withall that I do it not in a Magisterial imposing
way, nor as slighting the persons from whom I
differ, but as offering my brethren that Light
which I think needful to their own and to the
Churches cure: And I will thank them if they
will do the like by me, if I be guilty of any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
errour.</p>
               <p>First, the Scripture telleth us of no <hi>Church-Elders</hi>
but what were <hi>ordained;</hi> and of none but
such as were of the same <hi>Office</hi> with the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pastors or Elders: of none that had not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to baptize and administer the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
Nor doth Church-history tell us of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Divine office. But when one Assembly
had many Elders or Pastors, those that were best
gifted for publike Sermons did preach; and the
rest did help to rule the Church, and to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize,
and instruct and visit particular families
and persons, and other parts of the office, as there
was cause. But now we have concluded that there
is a <hi>distinct office</hi> of Ruling-Elders, who need <hi>not
be ordained,</hi> and who have no <hi>power to baptize</hi> or to
administer the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> This I think is <hi>a
superstition:</hi> For we feign God to have made a
<hi>Church-office</hi> which he never made. And though
we must <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>hold Communion</hi> with the
Churches which have this blemish; yet still it
cannot be freed from <hi>superstition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath required nothing but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59262:177"/>
of the Baptismal Covenant,</hi> to prove a mans
title to his enterance and priviledges in the
<hi>universal Church:</hi> And a <hi>consent</hi> to our <hi>Relation</hi>
to the <hi>particular Churches,</hi> to our membership in
<hi>them.</hi> But mistaking-zeal hath accounted this
too loose a way, and hath devised stricter terms:
Many must have other proofs of Godliness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>understanding, voluntary assent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the Baptismal Covenant:</hi> Yea of those that
are in the <hi>universal Church already;</hi> before they
can be admitted to its priviledges, or to a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
Church. And which is worse, they here
give the Church no <hi>certain rule,</hi> instead of
Christs rule, which they cast by: But one man
requireth one account, and another requireth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and the rule and test doth vary as the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or prudence of men do vary. This is a <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi>
which hath already torn the Churches
in pieces, and is going on still to do worse: And
its raised by mistaking-zeal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that none that at the same time or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not entered members of some <hi>particular</hi>
Church, may by <hi>Baptism</hi> be entered into the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Church;</hi> is a <hi>superstition,</hi> which some good
men have taken up.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that he who is a member only of
the <hi>Universal</hi> Church, may not in <hi>transitu</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to communion with <hi>particular Churches,</hi>
unless he bring a Certificate from a <hi>particular
Church</hi> of which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ometime was a Member.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that the Pastor may not lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any member into a particular Church
without the consent of the <hi>Major Vote</hi> of the
people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:59262:178"/>
Sixthly, that a Minister of Christ may not by
<hi>Baptism</hi> receive any into the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> but

there are too many introduced, which
they are as fond of, because they are their own.</p>
               <p>☞As that all the Pastors of the Protestant
Churches abroad, who had only the election of
the people and the ordination of Parochial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,
and not of Diocesan Bishops, are no true
Ministers of Christ, but Lay-men.</p>
               <p>That therefore those Churches are no true
Churches (in a political sense, and as orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized.)</p>
               <p>That therefore their Baptism is unlawful, and
a nullity, and all those nations are no baptized
Christians. (Though the Papists who hold the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of Lay-mens baptizing, do here censure
more easily.)</p>
               <p>That it is not lawful to communicate in such
Churches, and receive the Sacrament of the Lords
supper from such Ministers.</p>
               <p>That those Countries which are baptized by
such, should be rebaptized.</p>
               <p>That those Ministers who are ordained by such,
should be re-ordained.</p>
               <p>That it is unlawful to joyn with those Churches,
where the Minister prayeth only from a <hi>Habit</hi> of
of prayer (called <hi>extemporary)</hi> without a fore-known
form; because they know not but he mayx
put somewhat unlawful into his prayers; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the mind cannot so readily try and approve
and consent to words, which are hastily uttered,
and not known to the hearers before.</p>
               <p>These and abundance other superstitions some
men would introduce on the other side. And by
all such inventions fathered upon God, and made
a part of Religion, the minds of men are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59262:179"/>
and disquieted, and the Churches disturbed
and divided; by departing from primitive sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</p>
               <p>I shall only now propose this to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those of the first sort.</p>
               <p>Whether they are sure that these superstitions
of theirs may not run the round as other supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have done before them? Or some of them
at least? What if the next age should turn them
into a dead formality? And what if the next age
after that should make Laws to enforce them?
And then Godly people first scruple them, and
then flye from them as discerned superstition?
And then the worst men b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> glad of that advantage
to persecute those that would not submit to them?
By this circulation, if the same men who invented
<hi>un-ordained Elders, new and needless Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
&amp;c.</hi> could but live two or 300 years, they
might come to be among the number of those
who cry out of them as <hi>superstitious,</hi> and suffer
persecution because they will not use them.</p>
               <p>Yea there are among you now many things of
a lower nature, which some dare scarce plainly
say, God commandeth or forbiddeth, and yet
they are censorious enough about them: As here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
many were against wearing the hair of any
considerable length; Against wearing cuffs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a day of humiliation: Against dressing meat
or feasting at least, on the Lords day (which is
a day of Thanksgiving of divine institution) and
held, That it is necessary to feast twice at
least, upon a day of Thanksgiving (of mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:)
That a Minister should not life
up his eyes, much less kneel down to signifie his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59262:180"/>
private prayer, when he goeth into the Pulpit.
Nor any other when they enter into the Church:
That no prayer may be used, and no Psalm sung
in our common mixt Assemblies, which have any
expressions, which all both good and bad may
not fitly use as for themselves: That no Minister
may use notes in preaching to help his memory.
That the sacramental bread and wine must not
(say some) or must (say others) be delivered by
the Minister into each mans hand. That no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
but sitting is lawful at the sacrament. That
it is unlawful to wear a Gown in divine worship,
if it be commanded: That it is unlawful to keep
any aniversary day of humiliation or thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of mans appointment: That just such and
such hours for family worship must be observed
by all: Or as others say, that no set times or
number of family prayers are to be observed.
That it is not lawful to preach or hear a sermon
upon a humane holiday. With abundance more
such, (about phrases, and gestures, and fashions
of apparel, and customes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am not at all
now accusing these opinions of superstition, nor

wrong: Much less would I perswade any to
make no conscience how they order these or any
other the smallest circumstances of their <hi>lives:</hi>
Obedience must extend to the smallest parts of
the lawes of God. But I am shewing you the
circular course of many religious people in the
world. Suppose now that the next age should
make strict lawes for every one of your own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
in all these points. And that the Religious
people should then scruple them, because they are
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59262:180"/>
imposed: And that the Rulers then should make
their Lawes more strict, and that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people should take up these opinions, and
all that sort of men that first were zealous for
them, should turn against them, because the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people are for them; and should call them
Popish superstitions, and should suffer impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
rather than conform to them; I pray
you tell me if you fore-saw all this, what is it
you would advise a sober Christian to do, in such
a time and case as that? Would you have the same
men that now are for these opinions, cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and censure all as superstitious who
are for them: and separate from them; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in their sufferings on that account? Why I
tell you that many of the customes and practises
in the Church, which you now thus avoid as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
were brought in at the first thus, by
the most Religious sort of people: And yet it is
now accounted by many, a necessary part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to avoid them: And all because that men
take up their opinions of such matters in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
from the estimation of the persons that are
for them; and avoid those things with prejudice
and scrupulosity, which are liked, or practised or
commanded by those, whom they think ill of, and
take for the adversaries of Religion.</p>

               <p>I. Perhaps you think that such or such a Church-government,
or Forms, or Ceremonies, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable,
and such and such oaths and subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are unlawful, and therefore you cannot
have local communion with the Churches that

that Christ disowneth and rejecteth
them. If they cast out you by imposing any thing
which you think is sin, yet take heed that you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
not them. If there be a difference
between a weak and culpable Christian, and no-Christian,
there is a difference between a weak
and culpable Church, and no-Church; And as
there are innumerable degrees of good or evil,
strength or weakness in particular Christians, so
there is in Churches also.</p>
               <p>You may perhaps find that another Minister
is more profitable to you, and another Churches
principles more pleasing to you, and their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
better in your account: And therefore you
think that you are bound, to choose the best for
your personal Communion. Be it so: There is
yet some modesty in these terms: But do not
therefore conclude that Communion with that
Church which you turn from is <hi>simply unlawful;</hi>
or that <hi>another</hi> may not use it who can have no
better! Or that you your selves should not rather
joyn with that than with <hi>none?</hi> Or that you may
not occasionally sometimes communicate with
them, though your more ordinary communion be
elsewhere. Nor do not disown all <hi>spiritual</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them, though in body you are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
But when ever you pray to God, go to
him as a member of the Universal Church, and
and not of a Sect only: Pray for the whole
Church, and desire a part in the prayers of the
whole. Own them and their worship so far as
Christ owneth them. While you disown their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and failings, yet own their faith, and all
that is sound in their prayers and worship; And
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59262:182"/>
see that you love them as members of Christ, who
if weak are yet Christians, and perhaps in other
respects better than you. (To say nothing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be they or you that are in the right.) You
like not all that is done in the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
much less in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ethiopian:</hi> And
yet I hope you disown not their spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
as Churches though faulty, and as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the same body. But if you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to choose an ordinary communion most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to your self, but you must conclude that such
are no Ministers or no Churches of Christ: their
worship is not accepted by him, it is not lawful
to have communion with them, but rather to
joyn with no Church, than with them; and will
accordingly contemn them and irritate and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
mens minds against them; Be sure that you
prove well what you say, or wonder not if all
wise and sober men do take this for downright o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious

our Communion, let us not too hastily accuse
them of schism: And when we do, let us well
distinguish of schism, and not go further from
them than they have gone from us, and to be
our selves the Schismaticks while we oppose
it.</p>
               <p>There are many cases in which <hi>local separation</hi>
may be lawful. First, As if our callings justly
remove us to another place or Country. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
If our spiritual advantage bind us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

when we are free. Thirdly, if our lawful
Pastors be turned out of the place, and we follow
them, and turn away but from Usurpers. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
If the Pastors turn Hereticks or Wolves.
Fifthly, If the publick good of the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
my removal. Sixthly, If any sin be imposed
on me, and I be refused by the Church unless I
will commit it. In these and some other such
cases a remove is lawful.</p>
               <p>And when it is <hi>not lawful,</hi> yet it may be but

will on neither side dis-oblige them from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

neighbour Churches.</p>
               <p>There is a schism <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and a schism
<hi>in</hi> the Church: There is a schism from <hi>almost all</hi>
the Churches in the world, and a schism from
<hi>some one</hi> or <hi>few</hi> particular Churches. There is a
separation upon <hi>desperate intollerable principles</hi> and

should be forsaken, that they may exercise the

the Emperour to the way of blood and corporal
violence.)</p>
               <p>And the other side will say that you are a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizer,

you separate not as they do; And perhaps
that you are wise in your own eyes, because you
fall in with neither Sect of the extreams: But
these are small things to be undergone for so
great a duty. And he that will not be a peace-maker
upon harder terms than these, I fear will
scarce be meet for the reward. I again repeat
<hi>Iam. 3. 17. The wisdome from above is first pure
and then Peaceable, gentle and easie to be intreated,
full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hypocrisie: and the fruit of righteousness is sown
in peace of them that make peace.</hi>

               <p>Rom. 12. 18. If it be possible, as much as in you ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
live peaceably with all men. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Follow
peace with all men, and holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But is it not as good sit still as labour to no
purpose. What good have ever any peace-makers done
among differing Divines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A grievous charge upon Divines and
Christians: Are they the only Bedlams or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
men in the world? If <hi>Princes</hi> fall out, or if
<hi>neighbours</hi> fall out, arbitrators and peace-makers
labour not alwayes in vain: But I answer you,
It is not in vain: Peace-breakers would have yet
prevailed more and made the Church unhappier
than it is, if some Peace-makers had not hindered
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59262:184"/>
them. The minds of thousands are seasoned with
the Love of Peace, and kept from cruelties and
Schisms, by the wholesome instructions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Peace-makers. And it is worth our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to honour so holy and sweet a thing as Love
and Peace; and to bear our testimony for it in
the world. And Gods promise of reward doth
tell you that you labour not in vain. Is that in vain
which <hi>Heaven</hi> is promised to?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what is it that you would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> do
for Love and Peace, and against the contraries?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>write,</hi> if it be your
calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let the cause of Love and Peace, be
much in your secret and open prayers to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Instruct all that learn of you with
principles of Love and Peace, and labour to plant
them deep in their minds, and make them as
sensible of the evil of the contraries, as they are
of any other sin. Unless Divines and Parents do
take the way to bring up the people, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
under this kind of doctrine, that Love and
peace may become their Religion, the Church is
never like to be recovered.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In all your conference, labour (sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
and prudently) to inculcate these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on the hearers minds, and to bear your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>division.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Put such books into peoples hands as
plead best the cause of Love and Peace. Among
others get men to read these: Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s
Sermon on <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. at <hi>Wansted</hi> before King
<hi>Iames,</hi> Bishop <hi>Hall's</hi> Peace-maker: Mr. <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59262:185"/>
Burroughs</hi> of Heart-divisions; and Mr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingsteet</hi>'s
<hi>Irenicon;</hi> and all Mr. <hi>Duries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Disgrace not your Doctrine by the
badness of your own lives; but be as much more
<hi>Holy</hi> than them as you are more <hi>Peaceable,</hi> that
they may see that it is not a <hi>carnal unholy Peace</hi>
that you desire. But these things belong to the
following Directions.</p>
               <p>Finally, Brethren, farewel, Be perfect; be of good
comfort: Be of one mind: Live in Peace: And the
God of Love and Pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

11. Phil. 4. 9. 1 Thes.</hi> 5. 23. And the God of
Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. <hi>Rom.</hi>
16. 20. Now the God of Peace be with you all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 33.</p>
               <p>Martyrdome for Love and Peace is as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Faith.</p>

DIRECTIONS
TO THE
PASTORS,
HOW TO
Esteem and use Christs Flock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
EVEN
The weak ones and the quarrelsome
Children: And what must be done
by themselves in the first place,
both to prevent and heal
DIVISIONS.</head>
            <p>THe Practise of which, the Author doth
humbly and earnestly beg of them, as with
tears upon his knees, for the sake of Christ, that
purchased the weakest with his blood; for the
sake of those that must live in peace with Christ
for ever; for the sake of those who are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of turning to Popery or contemning Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
through the scandal of our Divisions, to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59262:186"/>
their own damnation: for the sake of these poor
distracted Churches; for the sake of the King,
that he may have the comfort of Governing a
quiet and united people: and for their own sakes,
that they may give up their account with joy, to
the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, and
not with terrour, for the consuming and scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his flock.</p>
            <p>And (that he may both begin and end with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority) the Author humbly beggeth of
them all, that <hi>England</hi> may but <hi>SEE</hi> and
<hi>FEEL,</hi> that the <hi>PASTORS</hi> do <hi>VNDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAND,
BELIEVE, CONSIDER</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEY</hi>
that will of God, which these following
Texts of Scripture do express.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 4. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned,
but he honoureth them, that fear the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 40, 45. Verily I say unto you, in as
much as ye did it not, to one of the least of these
(my Brethren) ye did it not to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 6, 10. But who so shall offend one of these
little ones which believe in me, it were better for
him that a milstone were hanged about his neck,
and that he were drowned in the depth of the
Sea—Take heed that ye Despise not one of these
little ones: for I say unto you, that in Heaven
their Angels do alwayes behold the face of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in heaven. II For the Son of man
is come to save that which was lost.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to
them that are lest.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. For necessity is laid upon me, yea
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59262:186"/>
wo is unto me if I preach not the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20, 24, 28, 33. I have taught you publickly
and from house to house—But none of these things
move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,
so that I might finish my course with joy, and the
ministry which I have received of the Lord Iesus—
Take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed therefore to your selves and to all the
flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you
overseers, to feed the Church of God, which he
hath purchased with his own blood—I have coveted
no mans silver or gold or apparel—</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3. Feed the flock of God which is among
you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint,
but willingly; nor for filthy lucre, but of a ready
mind; neither as being Lords over Gods heritage,
but being ensamples to the flock. And when
the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a
Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 24, 25. And there was a strife among
them, which of them should be accounted the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test:
And he said unto them; The Kings of the
Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that
exercise authority upon them are called Benefactors;
But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among
you let him be as the younger; and he that is chief,
as he that doth serve—I am among you as he that
serveth.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12, 13. Know them which LABOUR
AMONG you, and are over you in the Lord,
and admonish you, and esteem them very highly
in Love, for their WORK sake, and be at peace
among your selves.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Let the Elders that Rule well be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59262:187"/>
worthy of double honour; Especially, they who
labour in the WORD and DOCTRINE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17, 18. Some indeed preach Christ
even of envy &amp; strife, and some also of good will: The

to add affliction to my bonds: What then!
Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretence or
in truth, Christ is preached, and I do therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
yea and will rejoyce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 30, 31. And <hi>Paul</hi> dwelt two whole years
in his own hired house, and received all that came
in unto him; preaching the Kingdome of God, and
teaching those things which concern the Lord Iesus
Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. Him that is weak in the faith
receive ye; but not to doubtful disputations: For
one believeth that he may eat all things: Another
who is weak, eateth herbs: Let not him that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
despise him that eateth not; And let not him
which eateth not judge him that eateth: For God
hath received him: Who art thou that judgest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans servant? To his own Master he stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or falleth: yea he shall be holden up: For God
is able to make him stand. One man esteemeth one
day above another: Another esteemeth every day
alike. Let every man be fully perswaded in his own
mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We then that are
strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,
and not to please our selves: Let every one of us

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ease his neighbour for his good to edification.
For even Christ pleased not himself—Now the
God of Patience, and Consolation grant you to be
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59262:187"/>
like minded one towards another, according to
Christ Iesus: That ye may with one mind and one
mouth glorifie God—Wherefore RECEIVE ye
one another, as Christ also received us to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17, 18, 19, 20. For the Kingdome of
God is not meat and drink, but <hi>Righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sness</hi>
and PEACE and Ioy in the Holy Ghost: For
he that in THESE THINGS serveth
Christ, is <hi>Acceptable to God,</hi> and AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROVED
of MEN. Let us therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after the things which make for PEACE, and
things wherewith one may <hi>Edifie</hi> another—For
meat destroy not the work of God—Happy is he
that condemneth not himself, in the thing which he
alloweth (that is acknowledgeth to be indifferent or
lawful.) And he that doubteth is damned if
he eat.</p>
            <p>The rest, and some of the same again you shall
have in the Conclusion, and I shall not accuse my

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THE Reason why I think it needful, to adjoyn
these few Directions to the Pastors, are: First,
Because I think that the rest will do but little good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. Though the people are more inclined to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
than the Pastors, yet are the Pastors the
greater causes of most of the Divisions in the Church;
And therefore must be the chiefest in the Cure: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the advantage of their parts and place, doth make
them most significant in both: (And their office ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
them to be the most <hi>skilful</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> in the
Cure.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because I should be chargeable with such
partiality as beseemeth not a Minister of Christ; if
I should fall upon the miscrariages of the people only,
and say nothing to my self and brethren, who are as
deeply concerned in the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>Yet I must here premise, that as I have done this
part with greater brevity, so also with submissive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and respect: And that I do not at all intend any
of the Directions following, as a Magisterial Dictator
to those in authority; nor any of the admonitions, as
factious reflections upon superiors or inferiors; or as
pleading for or against any party now among us.</p>
            <p>To the reasons after given for tenderness to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dissenters, though too much inclined to separations,
I shall here only add First, That the general weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
even of the Pastors through most of the Churches
upon earth, should make us rather pity the weakness of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59262:189"/>
the people, than angrily revile them: And to think
of Christs words, Let him that is without sin cast the
first stone. Alas, our preaching, our praying, our
conference, our living, tell all the world too lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>we</hi> are <hi>weak!</hi> How few are there that be not
either <hi>ignorant,</hi> or <hi>injudicious,</hi> or <hi>imprudent,</hi> or
<hi>dull</hi> and <hi>liveless,</hi> or <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>barren,</hi> or of a <hi>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering</hi>
tongue, in our Ministerial work? And in
so high a business, any one of these is a lothsome ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish.
If we are put to defend our Religion, or any
necessary part thereof, how weakly and injudiciously is
it usually done? In a word, Our <hi>great divisions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves, with our <hi>censures</hi> and <hi>usage</hi> of one
another, do tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all the world not only that we are
<hi>weak,</hi> but that too many of us account one another to
be <hi>worse</hi> than <hi>weak,</hi> even <hi>intollerable,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of our sacred office. And shall <hi>we</hi> by our
weakness and faultiness become the peoples scandal, and
tempt them to undue separations; and when we have
done be impatient with their weakness, while we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
our own?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Let us be so impartial as to remember,
how far some have spoken to their sense, who have been
of most veneration in the Church. I instance but in
two: First, The wise and ancient Britain,</hi> Gildas,
<hi>who saith no less, than,</hi> Apparet ergo eum qui
vos sacerdotes sciens ex corde dicit, non esse
eximium Christianum: Sane quod sentio profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram—
O inimici Dei &amp; non sacerdotes! O lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatores

impugnatores, &amp; non Christi ministri!—Sed
quomodo vos aliquid solvetis, ut sit solutum &amp;
in coelis, a coelo ob scelera adempti, &amp; immani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59262:189"/>
peccatorum sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bus compediti? <hi>&amp;c. If the
Author of these words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> Venerable, <hi>account not the
speakers of such like now, to be utterly intollerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is St. <hi>Martin,</hi> whose story out of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius
Severus,</hi> I have afterwards abbreviated. If a
Sainted Bishop most famous for myracles, pretend to
Angelical Revelation for so much as is there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
let us be <hi>charitable</hi> and <hi>patient</hi> to those tender
conscionable Christians, who mistakingly go in such
like wayes.</p>
            <p>I am my self so sensible of the evil and danger of
Dividing separating principles and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayes, that it is
much of my labour to cure them with all! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have written what I have here done, though I am
sure I shall displease the guilty: But <hi>overdoing</hi> and
<hi>illdoing</hi> will prove but <hi>undoing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord give more <hi>Wisdome, Holiness</hi> and
<hi>Love,</hi> to Pastors and people; and open our ears to
healing counsels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before we are incurable!</p>

            <head>Directions to Pastors how to
deal with those weak
Christians who are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Divisions.</head>
            <p>WHen the young and ungrounded sort of
Christians, do by their errors, pride or
passions disturb the Churches peace &amp; orde, it is
the <hi>Pastors</hi> usually that are first and most assaulted
by their abuses, and therefore are most impatient
and exasperated against them: And it were well
if we were so innocent our selves, as that our
consciences need not call us to enquire; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all this be not partly the fruit of our own
miscariages. However seeing that both the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency
of our <hi>grace,</hi> and the nature of our <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
should make us more sensible of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
dangers, and more solicitous of its safety,
than the private members are; I think that the
<hi>chief</hi> part of the <hi>Duty</hi> is incumbent <hi>upon us,</hi> which
must be done in order to the <hi>prevention</hi> of these
maladies, and to the <hi>cure.</hi> And therefore I think
that the principal work of a Director or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
in this case, must be with the Ministers of
Christ themselves; The Churches peace lieth
most upon our hands: And if we miscarry, and
will not understand instruction, nor bear admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
nor do our parts, how little hope will be
left of our tranquility? The body must needs lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
when the Physician is as bad as the disease.</p>

               <p>THat the state of the flocks doth usually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the state of the Pastors, is known by the
experience of all the Churches, in all ages and
places of the world. Where there is a <hi>holy, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
able, diligent, concordant</hi> Ministry, there is
usually a reformed and agreeing people. And
where there is an ignorant, lazy, formal, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and contentious Ministery, there is either a
people divided, or else agreeing in ignorance,
formality and ungodliness. At least if such a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
have been long among them.</p>
               <p>And we need no other proof of this, and of
the chief cause of the peoples divisions and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
than the accusations and charges of the
Ministers against each other. On every side it
is the Pastors of the flocks that are accused, by
those of the adverse party, as the chief offenders.
One side saith, It is you that teach the people er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and put scruples into their minds, and
lead them into contempt of order and authority!
And the other side saith, It is you that proudly
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59262:191"/>
usurp authority which Christ never gave you, and
lord it over Gods heritage, and by your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
lay snares before the people to divide
them, and will not suffer them to unite in their
proper center, and agree in the primitive sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.
And that bring the Ministery into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and contempt by your cruelty and vicious
lives.] And whilest each side is thus accused by
the other, they have all the greater cause to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
themselves: Because it seemeth to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on all hands, that it is the Pastors who are
principally in the fault, though it be not agreed
what the fault is, nor which party of the Pastors
must bear the blame.</p>
               <p>And indeed where are there any sects or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but there are <hi>Ministers</hi> that <hi>head</hi> them,
and that <hi>caused</hi> them at first, and keep them up?
Is it not the Bishops that have caused the long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
between the Greek and Latin Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
Was it not principally a contention for
their interests, which of them should be the
greatest (so little doth C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which have been the grand causes of this woful
schism? And are not the dividing snares, which
cause most of the rest of the schisms of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the meer usurpations, and impositions of
the Roman Prelates? It was the Bishops of each

the Eutychians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the schisms of
the Novatians, Donatists and most others, have
been maintained. And among our selves, most
parties have their <hi>Leaders,</hi> who first made the
<hi>breach,</hi> and still <hi>keep it</hi> open. It is therefore but
reasonable that we all suspect and search our
selves: And perhaps the lot may find out that
<hi>Achan</hi> who is thought most innocent, and <hi>Ionah</hi>
who is not the worst in the ship, may be the man;
and he may be the <hi>Iudas</hi> who is last in asking,
Master is it I? And it is ten to one but the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of every party will be found blame-worthy
in part, though not in equality.</p>
               <p>Besides all that shall be intimated in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Directions, these causes of the peoples
<hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> are so openly manifest in
too many Pastors, that they cannot be concealed
or excused.</p>
               <p>First, There is so much <hi>Ignorance</hi> in many that
they are not able judiciously to edifie the flocks;
nor to teach sound principles in a suitable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and method to their hearers. Who can teach
others that which they never learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Too many are strangers to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom they teach, and know not the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the vulgar, and therefore neither justly
resolve their doubts, nor answer their objections,
nor indeed speak that language which the people
understand. They have been bred from their
childhood in the Universities among Schollars,
and have little conversed with Plow-men and
poor people and ignorant persons, who have
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59262:192"/>
quite other conceptions and expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ons than
schollars have. Their accurate stiles and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couched
words, and elegant phrases, are most of
them like an unknown tongue, to the greatest
number of their auditors. And that which they
use as congruous to the matter, is so incongruous
to their hearers, that its little to their benefit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And some in avoiding this exream,
do fall into the contrary; and never go beyond
the present understanding of the people, and
teach them nothing but what they know already;
And hereby they bring themselves into contempt
entising the hearers to think that their Teachers,
are as ignorant as they, and know no more than
they teach; And they tempt the people to be
puffed up, and think themselves worthy to be
preachers, because they can do as much and as
well as their teachers use to do.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And how cold and unskilful are
many in the application of that doctrine which
they have tolerably opened? And speak the
truths of the living God, without any affecting
reverence or gravity. And talk as drowsily of
the evil of sin, the need of grace, the love of God
in Jesus Christ, yea of death and judgement,
Heaven and Hell, as if it were their design to rock
the auditors asleep, or to make them believe that
it is but an histrionical fiction which they act, and
that nothing which they say is to be believed!
There is no need of any more forcible means to
entice men to sin, than to hear it preacht against
so coldly: Nor is there need of any more to
teach men to set light by Christ and Grace and
Heaven it self, than to hear them so hearteslly
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59262:192"/>
commended: We speak a few good words to the
people in a reading tone, like a child that is say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his lesson, as if we believed not our selves;
and then we blame the people for their being no
more edified by us; and we look they should
be much affected with that which never much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the speakers. If Christ himself who
preached with authority, and used to awaken
them, with an <hi>[He that hath ears to hear let him
hear]</hi> did yet convert no more than he did, what
can we expect upon our drowsie and dry dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
but drowsiness in the hearers, if not
contempt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And alas the <hi>private work</hi> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
is done as poorly by too many who do
pretty well in publick, as if they knew not that
it is any considerable part of their employment;
or as if indeed they believed not the immortality
and preciousness of souls! And if the praise of
men constrained them not, to do the publick part
somewhat better, they would become contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
burthens of the Church.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the great duty of Catechizing is so
much neglected, that few of the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the great fundamental truths; and few are
instructed in the true method of the Christian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
who know somewhat of the matter of
them. And such defects and languor in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
parts, will one time or other appear in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Formality and imagery choaketh or
excludeth the sense, life and power of the most
necessary truths. They that teach youth the
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rds</hi> of the Catechism, do oft content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59262:193"/>
with that much, as if they had made them
understanding Christians; and leave them as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
&amp; sensless of the importance of those words,
as they were before ever they learnt them. The
foresaid unacquaintedness with the people and
their weaknesses, doth make many teachers lose
their labour; while they measure the common
people by themselves, and think that they can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
such words as they themselves can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand:
When they little know how utterly
ignorant abundance are of the <hi>matter,</hi> when they
have learned to speak all the <hi>words</hi> by rote. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
experience hath oft constrained me to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that after all their study and learning in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
such Pastors as did never familiarly
converse with the poor and vulgar of the flocks,
and try the exercise of personal instruction and
exhortation upon them, are no more to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in many controversies about the Pastoral
work and discipline, than an unexperienced Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
or Chyrurgeon, or Soldier or Pilot in
many cases of their professions: Which maketh
many learned self-conceiced Doctors, become
the plagues, while they think themselves the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the Church.</p>
               <p>There are no parents or masters but find it
presently in their children, how quickly they
will learn a Catechism, and therein the Creed,
Lords Prayer and Decalogue, while they scarce
understand the sense and matter of any of the
plainnest words which they have uttered: And
we find it is just so with too many of the aged
also. And therefore if by other questions and
explications, you put them out of their rode, and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59262:193"/>
teach them not to fix their thoughts upon the
<hi>matter,</hi> as well as on the words, it will all prove
but as the teaching of a Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rot, and not of a true
believer.</p>
               <p>And what I have said of Catechising, is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of <hi>Prayer</hi> &amp; Confession and every other part of
worship: In which the Hypocrites part is easie;
even the out-side <hi>form</hi> and <hi>lifeless image;</hi> But it
is the <hi>inward Life,</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> which is
the excellent, heavenly and difficult part.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, And some make a formality and a
snare of the gift of extemporary expression; And
by a preposterous care to avoid all forms, they
teach them not these Catechism forms, with that
diligence as the matter doth require: But leave
their minds void of those orderly well-setled se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
notions, which should help the first: And
thus while some neglect the <hi>soul or spirit</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anity,
and others neglect the <hi>form</hi> or <hi>body</hi> of
it; betwixt them both it is too much neglected
by almost all.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Too many are meer wordlings, and
ungodly self-seekers, and enter upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
but as a trade to live by, and never had
that humble holy mind themselves, which they
expect in the people; But as riches, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and honour and ease, are the things which
they most seek, so they do proportion and choose
the means accordingly; And when they have
thus made themselves contemptible, and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the hearts of the people from them, they the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
call them all that passion can suggest, not for their
sin against God, but for crossing their carnal ends
and interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:59262:194"/>
Tenthly, And under all this ignorance, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and vice, pride maketh too many of them
to be enemies to repentance, and to all that would
bring them to it: so that they are not so much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with the people for their own faults, as
for disliking theirs: scarce a drunkard a swearer
in all the parish is so impatient of hearing of their
sins, as many of these high minded impenitent
Ministers. Nay so far are they from enduring to be
accounted of as they are, that they expect applause
and great veneration, when they deserve not
pardon: And they think they are neglected or
treated unreverently, if their ignorance be not
called wisdome, and their hypocrisie go not for
the only pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, and their carnal discourse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
(for which God threatneth their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<hi>Rom. 8. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13.)</hi> be not cloathed
with some fair and honourable names. And
when they have thus set the people so pernicious
an example, they storm against them for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more obedient to them, than they themselves
will be to God; and for rejecting the precepts
and reproofs of that Scripture which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and despised before their faces.</p>
               <p>I humbly propound it therefore to my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that if they have a people who despise their
Ministery, and turn away from them, and speak
against them, and seek after other teachers; that
they would first impartially ask their consciences,
I have we given them no cause or occasion of all
this? Is it not long of us? Have we so preached,
so privately overseen and taught them, and so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as that all this confusion will not be justly
laid at our doors?] When we have first truly
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59262:194"/>
cleared things at home, we are the fitter then
to expostulate with our people; And when we
have pulled out the beam of selfishness, carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty,
negligence, and pride out of our own eyes,
we may the better see to cast the motes of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
peevishness, and discontent out of the peoples
eyes.</p>

               <p>I Doubt not but the ministrations of a weak and
of an ungodly Minister, are <hi>valid</hi> and may
be <hi>effectual</hi> to the flock; And that the innocent
people forfeit not their priviledges in <hi>acceptable
worship</hi> and <hi>effectual Sacraments,</hi> though a <hi>wicked
Pastor</hi> may forfeit his <hi>own acceptance</hi> and <hi>reward</hi>
with God. But yet because there are none of us <hi>so
innocent,</hi> whose consciences may not justly tell
us that we have deserved to be afflicted in that
kind, and because God useth to work by means,
and vary the success according to the quality of
the means and instruments, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59262:195"/>
that the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Pastors is
a very excellent and needful help, to the peoples
setled <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Pence:</hi> And that where this help
is wanting, that ordinary means is wanting, by
which God useth to convey this blessing.</p>
               <p>I have met with many who are either insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
or ungodly themselves, or are guilty of
bringing such into the Churches, who use to make
very light of this, and say, God is not tied to
mens goodness or abilities in distributing his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
which is true, but nothing to the purpose:
He is not tied by any <hi>force</hi> or <hi>necessity;</hi> nor is he
so tied as that he <hi>cannot</hi> do otherwise: But yet
this is his ordinary way of working: which hath
made it a maxime, that as to means, <hi>Infused gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are obtained in the same way as acquired gnifts:</hi>
And let the contrary minded answer me these
questions.</p>
               <p>First, If it be only the <hi>Office</hi> of the Ministery,
and not the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> that are ordinarily
needful to their success, why doth Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and perish in all parts of the world, where the
Gifts and Graces of the Ministers decay? Why
are almost all the Greek Churches, the Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
the Russians, the Abassians, so lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ignorant? and most of them as vicious as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
in so much that the notorious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their lives, and contemptibleness of their
understandings, doth keep Christianity out of
most of the Heathen and Infidel Nations of the
world, that are acquainted with them? and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
up the reputation of Mahometanism and
Heathenism. Is not the experience of all the
Christian world a sufficient proof? The Greeks
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59262:195"/>
and other such corrupted Churches, have a truly
ordained Ministery as well as we, if that were
enough to serve the turn.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is more evident among our
selves than that Parishes do much vary in piety
and concord as their Pastors vary in ability, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
diligence and fidelity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though Parents have all equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to instruct and rule their children and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
is any thing more notorious, than that
notorious ignorance and impiety prevaileth in
most families where the Rulers are ignorant
and impious? Yet they have as true a power from
God to do their duty, as the Pastor hath to
do his: yea and promises from God for the
success.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What is the <hi>Office,</hi> but an <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and <hi>Obligation</hi> to do the Ministerial <hi>work?</hi>
And will <hi>work</hi> succeed well that is not <hi>done?</hi> Or
will it be done by bare <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi>
to do it? Will it serve to the building of your
house, to the conduct of an Army, to the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your sores or sicknesses, that you have an
Architect, a Captain, a Chyrurgeon, and Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
whose office is to do these works?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, What need men study or bestow so
many years at the University, if <hi>Ordination</hi> and
<hi>Office</hi> be enough?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Interpreting the Original Text is one
part of the Ministerial work: If the bare <hi>Office</hi>
without the Tongues, did never make any of you
a good Translator and Expositor, why should
the bare office serve turn for other parts of the
work, without proportionable abilities?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:59262:196"/>
Seventhly, Why do you lay so much blame on
the Ministers who dissent from you, or that are
the teachers of the dissenting people, as if all the
divisions were caused by them, if the difference
of teachers make no difference in the work and
flocks.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Why is it that in most ages of the
the world, the Pastors of one mind have desired
the silencing or deposing of those that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, as being injurious to the flocks, if
all Ministers be alike to them, what need there
so much silencing, imprisoning and banishing as
the world hath seen, if the Office alone do make
sufficient Pastors?</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Why also is there so much difference
between the Pastors reputations and their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
when they are dead? Why is the name and
works of an <hi>Augustine,</hi> a <hi>Hierome,</hi> a <hi>Basil,</hi> a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen,</hi>
more honourable than of any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
who had as true ordination and office as
they?</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Why should the Kingdome be at so
much cost upon the Ministery? And why should
one have more maintainance than another? If the
Office alone be all thats necessary, one <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>na</hi>
may serve for ordination in all the Empire of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassia,</hi>
and a few Priests may be had for ten pounds
a year, who have the same ordination as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
men. But having sufficiently shamed this
errour I dismiss it.</p>
               <p>If the reverence due to the <hi>Office</hi> be once lost,
the labours of <hi>all</hi> the Ministery will be obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And if only the <hi>Person</hi> lose the reverence of

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59262:196"/>
contempt of the <hi>Office,</hi> and so the <hi>whole</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
tendeth to <hi>Infidelity</hi> or Atheism: And the
contempt of <hi>particular</hi> Ministers, tendeth to
<hi>Schism,</hi> and to the ignorance and corruption of
their flocks. And though the contempt of the
<hi>person</hi> is bad enough of it self, yet if it fall on <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and there remain not a considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
who preserve their necessary reputation, it
turneth to the contempt of the Office it self, and
consequently of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And it must be <hi>apparent worth,</hi> that must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the <hi>persons</hi> honour. The silver lace did
make the Apprentices in <hi>Apelles</hi> shop to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
a foolish gallant a while; but when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to <hi>talk,</hi> they all fell on laughing at him. Our
grave attire will go but a little way, to keep up
our reputation, without some better testimony of
our worth. An empty head, a stumbling and
hesitant tongue, dry and dull and disorderly
preaching; and sensless, cold or confused pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a vain and frothy kind of talk; a common
and carnal conversation; all these or any one of
these, will more abate the reverence of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
than the title of Doctors, or the length of
our clothing, or the enlarging of the philacteries,
will advance it. <hi>Math. 23. 5. Mark. 12. 40.
Luk.</hi> 20. 47. It is their double measure of the
spirit, of wisdome, and Goodness, which must
procure a double measure of honour to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
               <p>And if we excel them never so much in <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
it will not suffice unless we excel them in
our proper Ministerial gifts of preaching exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and prayer, which are the works of our
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59262:197"/>
                  <hi>Office,</hi> it will neither preserve the honour of our
<hi>Office,</hi> nor attain its ends. When many of the
people can open the case of their souls in prayer,
in more orderly, clear and congruous expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
than the Pastor can, it tendeth to bring down
the honour of the Pastor, in the peoples esteem.
Some think to repair this, by casting out all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
except that which is read out of a book, or
recited by memory alone; that so there may be
no observable difference of mens abilities: But
this is so far from curing the peoples disease, that
it increaseth it: And they still say, all this is no
more than we can do our selves, or then a child of
ten years old can do. And if you extend the case to
all other parts of the Ministery, where the reason
is the same, they will say [what reverence is due to
such? or why should we maintain and honour men,
for doing no more than our children can do?]</p>
               <p>And the Popish devise, to make a disparity,
by keeping the people in ignorance, is the basest
and most pernicious plot of all. When the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
instead of excelling the people, would keep
down the people from increasing in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and expression, this is so notorious a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of <hi>envy, pride</hi> and <hi>malignity</hi> conjunct, that
the people presently flye from such Pastors, as
supposing them to be ministers of the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they see them bear his image. What do
we teach them for, if we would not have them
learn and profit? What greater honour can a
Teacher have, than to make his Schollars as wise
and able as himself? Every one who is a child
of Light, and believeth in him who is the Light
of the world, will suspect that man to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59262:197"/>
of the Prince of darkness, who is a malicious
adverstry of Light. This is that brand of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
iniquity, the hindering men from the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scriptures, and magnifying ignorance,
which maketh men so commonly think them to
be the <hi>Ecclesia malignantium</hi> and the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
brood. Thus Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Art of Printing, as that which would
take down the honour and profit of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
by making the people as wise as they. It
is not by keeping <hi>them down,</hi> or <hi>envying</hi> their <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,</hi>
that we must keep our distance from the
people; but by <hi>rising higher</hi> our selves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
them in all ministerial gifts. Else why
should we be thought any fitter to be their
Teachers and Guides, than they to be ours?</p>
               <p>Yea though we excel them in all these abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it will not serve turn to the ends of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
unless we also excel them in holiness
and every Christian vertue. The Devil <hi>knoweth</hi>
more than Ministers: And if he have a tongue to
speak he wanteth not utterance. He is the most
excellent and honourable, who is likest to God,
and hath most of his image. And God hath more
proposed himself to mans imitation in <hi>Goodness,</hi>

it to heart, to give glory to my name, I will send a

walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his
mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts:
But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of <hi>Levi,</hi> saith the Lord of hosts: Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

               <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. 24, 30. The sin of the young men was
very great, before the Lord; for men abhorred the
offering of the Lord:—Ye make the Lords people to
transgress—Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice, and at
my offering, which I have commanded—I said in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that thy house—should walk before me for ever:
But now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for

If as <hi>Moses</hi> you stand nearer to God than the

and your faces must shine with the beames of

               <p>If therefore by your low and common parts,

instead of exclaiming against the people,
cry out against your selves, and lament your

For it accounteth <hi>Love</hi> but a <hi>Moral-vertue</hi> (which

Is it a fault for <hi>children</hi> to be so impatient as to

               <p>And so there may from variety of <hi>passions</hi> of
the mind, through a diversity of bodily tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures:
One that is naturally <hi>fearful</hi> is apt to
apprehend a thousand things as <hi>terrible,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to be filled with scruples, and to run
away from <hi>doctrines</hi> and practises as <hi>dangerous,</hi>
where another doth apprehend no danger. And
one that is dark, or incredulous, or rash or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
or hardened by any sinful course, is apt to
conceive that he is safe in every dangerous way,
and to sleep quietly at the brink of death and hell,
and to laught at them that tell him of his peril:
As men sit under the same instructions with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of affections, of fear or hope, of Love or

               <p>And variety of Gods disposing providences
must needs also have some such effect. While
one is rich and another is poor; one hath crosses
of divers sorts, and another hath prosperity; one
is full and another is hungry; one is observed,
admired and honoured, and another is taken lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
notice of, or is vilified and despised; One
hath many friends and another many enemies:
One hath friends that are kind and constant, and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59262:208"/>
the other such as are unkind and mutable; One is
preferred by Rulers, and the other is ruined or
oppressed; All these will occasion variety of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions:
As it was with the Lady who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

from what they were in health; and in poverty
from what they were in plenty; and when we
are angred, displeased or abused, from what they
were when we were pleased: Yea when we have
but read a lively book, or heard a lively Sermon,
from what they were before our affections were
so excited.</p>
               <p>Also variety of <hi>Temptations</hi> may occasion great
variety of apprehensions: When one mans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
are all alluring, to lust or gaming or

Opportunities of <hi>study</hi> and <hi>instruction</hi>
make exceeding great differences in the world.
The Lawyer and Physician perhaps may on the
by, have bestowed a few years time in Divinity,
in the midst of other interrupting studies: When
the <hi>Divine</hi> hath studied almost all his life, and
drawn out his meditations in one uninterrupted
thred. And so we discern that Lawyers and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
have oft different apprehensions, of matters
of doctrine, worship and discipline, from those
of the best Divines.</p>
               <p>And diversity of <hi>Interests</hi> maketh no small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of apprehensions. And those that are
advantaged by their helps and studies may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantaged
by their <hi>interests.</hi> And therefore we
say the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and the <hi>subject,</hi> the <hi>Lawyer</hi> and
the <hi>Divine,</hi> the <hi>Prelate</hi> and the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi>
and the <hi>Protestant</hi> (both <hi>Princes, Prelates</hi> and
<hi>People)</hi> so strangely differ in their thoughts; that
one <hi>seemeth certain</hi> of that which another seemeth
<hi>certain</hi> to be false; and one ventureth his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on that, which another ventureth his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against. <hi>Interest</hi> worketh <hi>secretly</hi> and too
much with the best; but openly and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly
with the worst.</p>
               <p>And then the interest and opinion of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Kingdomes, Churches, Pastors, parties or
Sects which men are related to, or are engaged
with, doth strongly tend to different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in all matters which those interests are
concerned in. And many very good men think,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59262:210"/>
that <hi>publick interest</hi> may be allowed much power
upon their minds, though <hi>private and personal</hi> must
be denied. Is it not a wonder to see, not only that
almost all <hi>Christians</hi> are incorporated into one sect
or <hi>party</hi> or other, but how easily the inconsiderable
reasons of their party can prevail with them, and
how hardly the better reasons of their adversaries,
seem to them of any weight or worth? Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the parties of Papists and Protestants, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
and Reformed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shew this; but in the
same Church the Regulars and Seculars, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and the Jesuits, the Dominicans and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
the Thomists, Scotists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> declare it.
And the difference made by, <hi>natural capacities</hi> is
yet more than all this. When one man is born
to a duller understanding, and another hath a
quick and clear apprehension; All that these
men read and hear and meditate on, is like to
make different impressions on their minds. And
this is the greatest thing of any one, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
many controversies endless, and maketh
both Divines and people run away from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as dangerously erroneous: If a few men
have clearer understandings than the duller and
unstudied sort, they are like to be the minor part:
For the dull and slothful (and yet self-conceited)
will ever be the greater part, many to one, till
the golden age return. And when all the world
feeleth the consequents of this difference, can we
doubt of it, or so far dote, as to think it possible
to cure it?</p>
               <p>Yet the various degrees of the <hi>Grace of God,</hi>
do certainly also make great variety of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.
When God giveth to some those true
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59262:211"/>
illuminations, those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those powerful effects and victories, which he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

needs have different apprehensions of such things.
In which sense Christ saith, that he came not to
send <hi>peace but division,</hi> that is, to be such an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

<hi>grace,</hi> as would <hi>

               <p>And indeed the grand difference between the
seed of the woman and of the serpent, the holy
and the carnal seed, is that which is the root of
the greatest and sorest divisions in the world;
which will never be reconciled till Christ at the
day of judgement shall say to one part, <hi>Come ye

8. 6, 7, 8. It was not for nothing that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that great eruption of it, in the first man
that ever was born into the world, against his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
brothers life, on the bare account of
their <hi>religious sacrifices!</hi> And the <hi>Cainites</hi> are
still too strong for <hi>Alel</hi>'s successors, and too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.
And why did he <hi>kill his brother?</hi> But
<hi>because his own works were evil</hi> and his <hi>brothers righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
Gen. 4. 10, 11. 1 Joh. 3. 12. And as <hi>Paul</hi>
saith of the two sons of <hi>Abraham, as he that was born
of the flesh, persecuted him that was born after the
spirit, even so it is now.</hi> Gal. 4. 29. For the <hi>flesh
fighteth against the spirit and the spirit against the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59262:211"/>
flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other.</hi> Gal.
5. 17. And that which is <hi>born of the flesh is flesh, &amp;
that which is born of the spirit is spirit.</hi> Joh. 3. 6.
And <hi>they that are of the flesh do savour mind or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the things of the flesh, and they that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the spirit do mind the things of the spirit.</hi> Rom. 8.
5, 6. Our heavenly teacher told his <hi>disciples,</hi> that
if they were of the world the world would love
them; but because they are not of the world, but
he had chosen them out of the world, the world
would hate them (even as it hated him.) <hi>Ioh. 15.
18, 19, 24, 25. Ioh.</hi> 17. 14. And every <hi>one that
doth evil hateth the light. Ioh.</hi> 3. 19, 20. Nothing
then can be <hi>surer</hi> or <hi>plainer</hi> to a believer, than
that there will be still as great divisions and
diversitie of apprehensions as radicated enmity
can breed.</p>
               <p>And (to prevent many objections) let these
three things be noted.</p>
               <p>First, That this grand difference which lieth
in the greatest matters, in head and heart, must
needs have influence upon abundance of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
controversies: Both as the <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>main
cause</hi> are concerned in them. Reason and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
have put this past controversie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this doth not concern on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>visible Church</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> but the
<hi>visible Church within it self:</hi> For all the <hi>Hypocrites</hi>
and <hi>carnal</hi> worshippers, have still the <hi>Cainish ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
nature:</hi> Yea those that by advantages and
interest are brought over to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> as well
as <hi>Christian</hi> side. And it is a happy Church where
the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are not the <hi>greater part:</hi> And it is
neither great Learning, nor degrees, nor the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59262:212"/>
office, nor the profession of the highest
zeal, which will serve turn to cure the <hi>carnal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi>
without the sanctifying spirit of grace. So
that when controversies arise, we <hi>see not</hi> in the <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi>
that <hi>carnal mind,</hi> which in the strictest
pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ession, or greatest learning, or most venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
function, will work against the interest of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness:
But we are sure that <hi>there it is,</hi> though
we know not the persons in whom but by the full
effects.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And note also that there is a mixture
or remnant of this unhappy root and principle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the <hi>sanctified themselves.</hi> And it is hard in
a controversie to perceive in <hi>our selves,</hi> much
more in <hi>others,</hi> how much our judgements may
be moved by this party; and what influence it
may have into our conclusions.</p>
               <p>So that all this maketh it but too manifest,
what a certainty there is of perpetual differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Church, upon all these foresaid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p>Add also this great and unavoidable cause, that
one <hi>errour leadeth in another:</hi> And no man being
without some; and every one being <hi>generative,</hi>
and inferring more, what will it come to when
all those also shall have their <hi>off-spring?</hi> and the
further they go, the more they will increase and
multiply?</p>
               <p>And as the judgement by <hi>one</hi> is laid open to
<hi>another</hi> (even as <hi>truth</hi> inferreth <hi>truth)</hi> so the <hi>will</hi>
is engaged, and espouseth mens own opinions as
their <hi>interest;</hi> which maketh them stretch their
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts in study to maintain what once they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and asserted: And alas how often have I
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59262:212"/>
heard wise and reverend persons cry out against
this pride and partiality in <hi>others,</hi> who in their
next discourse or the same, have shamefully shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in themselves: making much of their own
inconsiderable reasonings, and vilifying cogent
evidence against them; and being so intent on
their own inventions and cause, that they could
scarce have patience to hear another speak; And
when they have heard him, their first words shew,
that they never well weighed the strength of his
arguments, but were all the while thinking what
to say against him, or how to go on as they had
begun.</p>
               <p>Lastly (not to run into any more causes) there
is an universal lamentable cause of differences,
that almost all people naturally are apt <hi>to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
confident of all their own apprehensions,</hi> And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few have any <hi>due suspicion</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
or an understanding submission to wiser
men. Yea boyes (that are once past their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
dictates) and the weakest women, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
as confident that they are in the right, as the
most learned and experienced persons. Yea
none are so apt to be too doubtful and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ident of
their own understandings, as the Learned who
are next the highest form: For they have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
enough to know what can be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and to see an hundred difficulties,
which the ignorant never saw. So that the more
<hi>weak</hi> &amp; <hi>worthless</hi> and erroneous any ones judgment
is, usually the more furious are they in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of it, as if all were most <hi>certain truth</hi>
which they apprehend: These are the boldest
both in <hi>schisms</hi> and <hi>persecutions;</hi> as being so sure
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59262:213"/>
that their conceits are right, that they dare <hi>censure</hi>
or <hi>separate</hi> or <hi>scorn</hi> or <hi>despise,</hi> or <hi>afflict</hi> dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>It is a common thing to hear religious people
<hi>speak</hi> meanly and humbly of their own understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
in the <hi>general;</hi> But when it cometh to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi>
it is the rarest part of humility in the
world, to find: Very few do shew any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<hi>modesty</hi> (except the grosly ignorant who
have no <hi>pretence</hi> to wisdome): What abundance
of good people of the darker sort, have I been fain
to rebuke for their <hi>over-valuing me</hi> and <hi>my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;</hi>
who when I have but crost <hi>their opinions</hi>
about any thing, which most groundlesly, they
took for a duty or a sin, have held as fast their vain
conceits, and made as much of their most sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
reasonings, and as passionately and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected the most unquestionable proof which
I have offered them, as if they had been <hi>infailible,</hi>
and had taken me for an errant fool.</p>
               <p>And this is not the case of one or two Sects
only; but <hi>naturally</hi> of <hi>almost all men,</hi> till God
hath taught them that rare part of humility, to
have <hi>Humble Understandings,</hi> and low thoughts of
their own judgements, and a due suspicion of their
apprehensions.</p>
               <p>And their cure is the harder because they know
not how to have a humble suspicion of themselves
without running into the contrary, extream of
scepticism, and being cold and unfaithful to the
truth; They know not how to hold fast that which
<hi>is good,</hi> and to be constant in religion, without
holding fast all which they have once <hi>conceited</hi> to
be good, and being constant in their errour:
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59262:213"/>
Especially when <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> is voted to them by
that party whose piety they most esteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</p>
               <p>Nor is this a <hi>Religious</hi> distemper only, but it is
so natural to mankind, that even in <hi>common matters</hi>
neighbours and neighbours, masters and servants,
husband and wife, and almost all, have a strange
diversity of apprehensions: One thinks that this
is the best way, and another that the other is best;
and let them reason and wrangle it out never so
long, usually each party still holdeth his own,
and hardly yieldeth to anothers reasons.</p>
               <p>And when they <hi>do yield,</hi> they are so unhappy
that they are as like to yield to one more <hi>erroneous</hi>
than themselves, and to change into a <hi>worse</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as to yield to the truth. For commonly,
<hi>Appearance, Advantage, Interest,</hi> and a taking tone
and voice, do more with them than solid evidence
of truth.</p>
               <p>Out of all this if you infer a necessity of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
so do I. But if a necessity of <hi>force and
rigor,</hi> think on it again, and first hear what I shall
further say: And consider what I have said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.

that such a <hi>difference there is,</hi> and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

concern both parties to search after it, and
practise as far as they can discern, than to cast
away Reason, because there is a difficulty in using
it aright? Just thus the Papists do with us about
the like notion of <hi>fundamentals</hi> or <hi>essentials</hi> of
Christianity; They call to us for a just enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>fundamentals,</hi> and because they find

they might therefore take either <hi>all things</hi> or <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
to be <hi>essentials,</hi> and of necessity: As
if Christianity had no constitutive essentiall
parts, and so were <hi>nothing.</hi> And when they have

And doth it not then concern them as much as us,
to know which they be? What if it be a hard

eat, and not be a glutton? or how many drops

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59262:215"/>
purge too much and which too little? Must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>all</hi> be used indifferently or <hi>none?</hi> If I am not
able to enumerate just how many faults or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
may be tollerable in my servants? Must I
therefore have none, till I have those that are
<hi>faultless?</hi> or else must I allow them to do <hi>any thing</hi>
that they list? Though just at the <hi>verge</hi> of <hi>evil,</hi>
even that which is <hi>good</hi> may be matter of doubt,
yet God in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> hath given us suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
light for an upright, safe &amp; peaceable life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And if ever Baptism had been well
understood, by these objectors, the essentials of
Christianity had been understood. Hath not
Christ himself determined who they be that shall
be <hi>admitted into the Church</hi> and numbered with
Christians, in the very tenor of the Baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant?
And did not the Church take the <hi>Creed</hi>
to be sufficient for its proper use, which was to
be the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Christian profession,</hi> as to the
Articles of faith to be believed? And yet are we
now to seek in the end of the world, what <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
is, and what are the essentials of our faith,
and who is to be received as a professor of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty.</p>
               <p>But this is a subject more largely to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
if Rulers will permit it: And in the mean time
because it is not the Magistrates but the Pastors
that I am now speaking to, I shall pretermit the
most which is to be said, and only acquaint you in
the conclusion, that one of these following wayes
must be chosen.</p>
               <p>I. Either to tollerate <hi>all men</hi> to do what they wil,
which they will make a matter of conscience or
religion; And then some, may offer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59262:216"/>
in sacrifice to the devil, and some may think
they do God service in killing his servants; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd
some may think it their duty to perswade people
that there is no God nor life to come, nor duty,
nor sin; but all things are left to our own wills as
lawless.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Or else you must tollerate <hi>no errour</hi>
or <hi>fault</hi> in religion; And then you must advise
what <hi>measure</hi> of penalty you will inflict. If but
a <hi>little,</hi> then you <hi>tollerate</hi> the errour still: For they
that err will err still; and they that conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pray as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. or forbear to
obey the King as the three Confessours did. <hi>Dan.
3.</hi> will do <hi>so still,</hi> for all your penalty; And so
there is <hi>no cure,</hi> but a <hi>tolleration</hi> still.</p>
               <p>But if you inflict upon them, banishment, or
death, you must resolve that the King shall dwel
alone, and have no subjects, and so be no King;
nor have any <hi>servant,</hi> and so be no Masters; nor
endure so much as a <hi>wife,</hi> and so be no husband; and
if he have children must use them as K. <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Spain</hi> did his eldest son Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and so be
no Father. It can be no less than this at last.</p>
               <p>Or if you will <hi>imprison them, every subject</hi> must
be in prison, and then who shall be the Jaylor,
and who shall find them food?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Or else you must deal <hi>partially</hi> and
unjustly, and condemn <hi>one</hi> while you acquit <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
for the same fault; or condemn <hi>one sort</hi> of
errours, while you allow to tollerate <hi>others as
great:</hi> As if all were to be punished who believe
<hi>not Christs descent into Hell,</hi> while all are tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
who deny the rest of the Articles of the
Creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:59262:216"/>
Fourthly, Or else you must make sure that all
the Kings subjects shall be born under the same
Planets, and of the same parents, and have the
same temperament and complexion, and the same
teachers, and company, and all hear the same
words, and all see the same objects, and all have
the same callings, employments, interests, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
temptations, advantages, and the same
degree of natural capacity, and of grace: That
so there may be no difference or defect in their
apprehensions.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, or else you must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>istinguish and say,
that <hi>some are tollerable and shall be tollerated,</hi> and
<hi>some errours ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> intollerable</hi> and <hi>shall not be tollerated</hi>
(in the <hi>tongue</hi> I mean; for you must tollerate them
in the <hi>mind</hi> whether you will or not) And then
you will find a necessity of discerning as well as
you can, the <hi>tollerable</hi> from the <hi>intollerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if so, for Christs sake and his Churches
sake and your own sake, bethink you whether
Christ be not the King of his Church, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath given his Church no Laws for its
<hi>Constitution</hi> and <hi>Administration?</hi> By which we
must try who are to be the members of himself
and his Church, and to have Communion with
himself and one another? and who are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and avoided? And whether the Holy Ghost
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not the Author of the Church-establishment in
the Scriptures? And whether we can expect more
infallible deciders of such cases, than Christ, and
his Spirit and Apostles? And whether the
Church be not the same thing now as then, and
and its <hi>universal constitution</hi> and <hi>necessary admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi>
the same? And whether the primitive
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59262:217"/>
Church or ours be the purer and more exemplary?
And whether it would do Kings and Kingdomes
and the souls of men any dangerous hurt, to have
all Christians hold their <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> just
on the same terms as they did under <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> and all the Apostles? Or at least whether it
be worthy all the calamitous divisions in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
and the blood of the many hundred
thousands that have for conscience sake been
shed, and the enduring of the outcries of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
and banished, and their prayers to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for deliverance from mens hands, and the
leaving of such a name on record to posterity, as
is usually left in History on the authors of such
sufferings; besides the present regret of mind,
in the calamities of others, and the sad divisions
and destruction of Charity, which cometh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
I say whether it be worth the suffering
of all this (and O how small a part is this) and
all to keep our Churches from the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
simplicity, and from the same way and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and the Churches
of their times, established and practised? Shall
we speak so highly of Christ and his Apostles and
the sacred Scriptures, and yet think all this
blood and misery, division and distraction, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be endured, rather than our Union and
Communion should be held on the terms which
they did appoint and practise? or rather than such
terms should be tolerated among us? I know
what is said against all this; But this is no place
to answer all that is said by such as cannot see how
to answer themselves in so clear a case.</p>

               <p>AS the Gospel is the revelation of the Love
of God, and it is a message of Love which
we have to bring, and a work of Love which we
cooperate to effect; so it is a spirit of Love which
must be our principle, and it is an office and work
of Love which we are called to; and the <hi>manner</hi>
must be answerable to the work. <hi>Faith</hi> is the
<hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Heart</hi> of the new <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
And as there is no <hi>Light</hi> in our office and
work, if there be no <hi>Faith</hi> and evidence of <hi>Truth,</hi>
so there is no <hi>Life</hi> in it, if there be no <hi>Love.</hi> God
himself in the great work of our Redemption,
&amp; Christ in his Incarnation, life and suffering, hath
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59262:218"/>
taught the world, that the manifestation of Love
is the way to win Love and to cure enmity: And
he is not worthy the name of a Minister of Christ,
who hath not learned this lesson, and doth not
imitate his Lord in this: That as our office par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipateth
subordinately of his office, both <hi>Ruling,
Teaching</hi> &amp; <hi>Priestly,</hi> so we may participate of that
<hi>Spirit of Love,</hi> which was his <hi>Principle</hi> and must
be <hi>ours.</hi> If it be not a work of <hi>Love</hi> which we
do, it is not the work of a Minister of Christ,
and Preacher of the Gospel. Can you well Preach
so great <hi>Love</hi> of Christ to men without <hi>Love?</hi> if
you shew not <hi>Love</hi> to them, you can never expect
to win their <hi>Love</hi> to your selves. And when you
overmuch desire to be loved your selves (as
which of you doth not,) you pretend that it is, to
make your endeavours more successful, when you
perswade them to the love of Christ. And
doubtless a just Love to the person of the
Preacher is a good advantage to this success. And
in good sadness, can you believe that any thing is
so likely to win Love as Love, or did experience
ever teach you, that reproach, or contempt, or
hurting men, was the effectual way to make them
Love you? This way hath been long tried by the
Mountebanks in <hi>Italy, Spain</hi> and many other
Countries, but alas with what success? Indeed
<hi>solitudinem faciunt &amp; pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>m vocant,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
saith: When they have killed those that they had
first oppressed, they affrighted the rest to <hi>say they
loved them,</hi> and <hi>really</hi> won the Love of their sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
blood-thirsty enemies: but that was all.
If the new knack of transfusion of blood cannot
do this feat, by letting in the blood of a Spaniel
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59262:218"/>
(who loveth him that beateth him) when you
let out their own, phlebotomy will never
do it.</p>
               <p>Account then that Sermon, that converse, that
reproof, that discipline in which Love is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
predominant, to be but a lifeless use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
thing, as to the winning of a sinners heart to
Christ. Though I deny not but when the case
of the sinner appeareth desperate, the severity of
Discipline in casting him off, may express more
of another affection as to him: But that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in so doing you must shew greater Love to
the <hi>Church</hi> which must be saved from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But perhaps you'l say,</hi> They despise me, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
me, and follow others and admire them, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not so well of them as I do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, we are most of us too partial to
be competent Judges of our own deserts. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishness
too often maketh us think better of our
selves, our preaching and our lives, than there
is cause: And it too often filleth men with envy
against those, whose greater worth and better la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
cause them to be preferred by the hearers:
And envy usually breeds detraction. I know that
many giddy persons heap up Teachers to them
selves and follow seducers, &amp; coutemn the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
servants of the Lord. But I know withall,
that there is usually a convincing power in the
preaching of able experienced Ministers, which
is not to be found in the cold &amp; formal discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of an hypocrite. And that there is a suitable
principle in true spiritual <hi>experienced</hi> Christians,
which causeth them to relish this spiritual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59262:219"/>
preaching much more than the more-adorned
carkas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es of formality: And seriousness
is still acceptable to serious Christians: Yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to common natural men, unless the malicious
possess them by slanders with prejudice against
it. Now if this should be the cause that others
are preferred before you, O how heynous were
your sin? As if it were not enough for you to
<hi>neglect</hi> your duty, and to do the work of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully,
and injure the souls of men in a cause
of such importance, but you must also impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
justifie such a crime, and also maligne those
that have more of the grace and gifts of God
than you, and that do more to help to save mens
souls!</p>
               <p>Secondly, But suppose that your deserts be as
great as you conceive, and their love to you as
little; I would further ask you: First, is it for
<hi>their own</hi> sake who thus hinder their own edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by it, that you are troubled at them? or is it
for <hi>your selves,</hi> because you have not the respect
which is your due. If it be the later, I need
not tell you what it is for Ministers of Christ
thus to seek themselves, and overvalue their
own esteem: If it be the <hi>former,</hi> 2 Why doth
it not please you then that they are edified by <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
though not by you. Do you think that it
is not the <hi>same Gospel</hi> which others preach to
them. And may not that Gospel edifie and save
them, by the Preaching of another as well as by
yours. And if their dis-esteem of you, be a <hi>sign</hi>
or <hi>means,</hi> that they are not edified by you, is not
their great esteem of others who are as faithful
a <hi>sign</hi> and means that they are or may be edified
by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:59262:219"/>
Thirdly, And why are you not much more
troubled at the state of all those who are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
or edified by you, though they do not
slight you or forsake you. How many be there
that seem to love and honour you, and yet do not
love and honour God? but despise religion and
their own Salvation? If it be for <hi>their</hi> sakes and
not your <hi>own</hi> that you are offended, you will
grieve most for them that are most ungodly,
though they honour you never so much; and you
will be <hi>glad</hi> for them that are <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
whose Ministery soever it be that they most
esteem.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But suppose them yet so foolish
and faulty, as to run from you to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
The question is, <hi>What is the way to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re
them?</hi> Is <hi>Love</hi> caused by hard words or stripes?
Will you say to them, <hi>Love me, or you shall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or imprisoned?</hi> Christ doth not teach you, to
use such arguments when you speak for <hi>him,</hi> but
to <hi>beseech men in his name and stead tobe reconciled
to God, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. But your <hi>own work</hi> will
be done in your own way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But Christ threatneth Hell to the impenitent,
and <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth him Anathematized that loveth
not the Lord Iesus: and he talketh to his hearers of
coming with a rod.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt but the corrupted mind of
man, hath need not <hi>only of Love</hi> to draw them
home to God, and work the cure, but of <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
to <hi>drive them</hi> and to <hi>help on</hi> the cure! And
though it be <hi>Love</hi> that causeth <hi>Love,</hi> which is
their <hi>Holiness,</hi> yet <hi>Fear</hi> removeth many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
But still remember that it is <hi>Love</hi> which
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59262:220"/>
is predominant, and <hi>fear</hi> is but subservient; And
that the fear which is contrary to Love is a <hi>vice,</hi>
and hindereth the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r salvation: And remember
that <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> towards God, will better stand
together, than <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love to you</hi> will: For
men know Gods <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Iustice;</hi> and
know that he is not to be questioned or resisted:
But if they suffer by <hi>you,</hi> it will not be so digested,
nor will it so consist with love. A patient will
not bear to be whipt by his Physician to force him
to take his medic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes, though a child will bear it
from his parents, whose Love and Power are
more unquestionable to him. I desire you but to
mark your <hi>own experience,</hi> and let <hi>your Love</hi> be
<hi>predominant</hi> in all your ministrations, and use no
<hi>force</hi> or <hi>hurting</hi> course which will really abate
their Love to you, and then I shall leave you in
the rest to your discretion. Secondly, Yet still
we grant that Christs threatnings may be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you, and must be; Thirdly, And that the
rod of discipline must be used: But this must be
done only on the scandalous and such as more
dishonour Christ than you: And it must be so
done, that it may appear to be <hi>Christs own work,</hi>
and done by you upon <hi>his interest</hi> and at <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi>
and not either arbitrarily or for your
selves.</p>
               <p>And I shall be bold with confidence to add
that in those cases where violent <hi>restraint</hi> or <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi>
is necessary, the <hi>Pastor</hi> is the unmeetest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to meddle in it. It is the <hi>Magistrates</hi> work
to <hi>drive</hi> and <hi>force</hi> (where it must be done) and
<hi>the Pastors</hi> to perswade and draw. The flock of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59262:220"/>
Christ is led by himself the Lamb of God, and his
Ministers must <hi>go before with him,</hi> and attend him
in the <hi>conduct;</hi> and the <hi>Magistrate</hi> must <hi>come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind</hi>
and <hi>drive;</hi> and it is the <hi>hindermost,</hi> and not
those <hi>before</hi> that must be <hi>driven.</hi> Pastors should
be so far from calling out for the help of violence
(unless it be to keep the peace) that they should
rather shew their love and tenderness, by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as far as they may to mitigate it: And they
should desire that no such ungrateful work be at
all imposed upon them, as to seem the afflicters
of their flocks: because when once they have
lost their love, they have lost their opportunity
and advantage of edifying them.</p>
               <p>And it is not <hi>Pilate</hi>'s hypocritical washing of
his hands, that will excuse him: Nor the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Clergies disclaiming to meddle in a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of blood, which will reconcile the minds
of sufferers to them, as long as they are Masters
of the Inquisition, or deliver them up to the
secular power, and excommunicate and depose
the temporal Lords who will not do such execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as they require.</p>
               <p>Though I have some where else mentioned it,
I will again request the Reverend Pastors of the
Church, to peruse the story of <hi>Idacius</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
in <hi>Sulpitius Severus.</hi> The sum of it is this.
<hi>Priscillian</hi> and many others (some Bishops and
some Presbyters and some private persons) were
zealous in religion, but heretical (Gnosticks
saith <hi>Sulpitius:) Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> were two
Orthodox Bishops who were very hot against
these her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ticks: Both of them men of rash and
haughty spirits, and one of them at least (saith
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59262:221"/>
                  <hi>Sulpitius)</hi> an injurious person that scarce cared
what he said or did by others (see what persons a
good cause may be defended by.) These Bishops
drew in the Bishops of the neighboring Churches,
&amp; in their Synods first condemned the Priscillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists;
and next provoked the Emperour against
them. The Priscillianists found that if that were
the way, an Emperours Court was not so Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
or constant, but there might be as good
hopes for them: And therefore they got a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
friend in Court to undertake their business,
and got the better of the Bishops: The Bishops
being born down for a time, at last <hi>Maximus</hi> was
proclaimed Emperour, and came over with
power and victory into <hi>Germany</hi> (such another as
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> who by the Bishops was accounted a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Religious Christian, but usurped the Empire,
and fought against and killed one of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and pretended that the souldiers made
him Emperour against his will.) This <hi>Maximus</hi>
(whether sincerely or for his own advantage is
unknown) did take part with the Orthodox and
greatly honour the Bishops and promote Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and got a great deal of love and honour. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thacius</hi>
and <hi>Idacius</hi> and the rest of the Bishops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to <hi>Maximus</hi> against the Priscillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists;
who hearkened to them, and to please
them put <hi>Priscillian</hi> and some others to death, and
punished others by other wayes of violence. The
more rude ungodly sort of Christians, so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
or over-went the Bishops, that they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their fury against any that seemed more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
than their neighbours: so that if any one
did but fast and pray more, and read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59262:221"/>
more than others, he was reproached as a
Heretick and favourer of the Priscillianists:
<hi>Martin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Turen</hi> was at that time a man
of no great Learning, but so famous for Holiness,
Charity, and numerous miracles, as the like is
scarce written with credibility of any man since
the Apostles (for which he is canonized a Saint.)
This <hi>Martin</hi> was grieved partly to hear strictness
brought into reproach, and partly to see Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
called to the suppression of heresies by the
Bishops; and so every heretick taught how to
persecute and suppress the truth, who could bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>get
the Emperor on his side: Therfore he petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Emperour for mercy to the Priscillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
and told him that it was a thing not used by
Christians, to propagate sound doctrine or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
mens errours by the sword: He also avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Synods of the Bishops, and refused not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Councils, but their Communion: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Bishops not only despise him as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
man, and one that deceived the people
with false miracles; but also suggested to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
that he was a favourer of the hereticks
himself: Insomuch that <hi>Martin</hi> hardly escaped
suffering with them, through the Bishops ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.
But the great piety and clemency of
the Emperour preserved him; And at last did
promise him the saving of the lives of some that
were further appointed to suffer, on condition
that he himself would communicate with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
<hi>Martin</hi> saw that there was no other
means to save the life of <hi>one</hi> that else was presently

mercy and not sacrifice, would in such a case al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

it, he promised to have Communion with
the Bishops, and so did communicate with them
the next day, and saved the mans life. When he
had done it he was in great doubt and perplexity
about it, whether he had done well or not? and
in this trouble went secretly out of the City
homewards: And by the way in a Wood as he
was in heaviness and doubt, an Angel appeared to
him, and rebuked and chastened him, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with them, and bid him take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this, lest the next time he hazarded his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
it self by it. And <hi>Martin</hi> professed that
long after this, the gift of miracles was denied
him; but he communicated with the Synod and
Bishops no more.</p>
               <p>This History I only recite without determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
how far the Reader is to believe it: But I
must say that the reading of it was a temptation to
me, to doubt concerning my Communion, the
Reader may easily know with whom. For though
I know how credulous and fabulous many ancient
Writers were, yet I considered, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
is one of the most ancient, one of the most
learned, one of the most strictly Religious of all
the old Historians of the Church; and that he was
himself an intimate acquaintance of <hi>Martins,</hi> and
had it from his own mouth; and most solemnly
protesteth or sweareth that he feigneth nothing,
and that the miracles of <hi>Martin</hi> were known to
him partly by his own sight, partly by <hi>Martin</hi>'s
own Relation, and partly by many credible wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:
And they were so believed commonly in
that age by good men, that it was the occasion of
his Canonizing. And if such History is not to be
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59262:222"/>
believed, I will not mention the consequences
that will hence follow.</p>
               <p>And yet on the other side I considered; First,
That it was possible that a holy man might be
mistaken by fear and scrupulosity, and take that
for an Angels appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition which was but a dream:
Secondly, That his avoiding Communion with
the Bishops might be only a prudential act, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that time and place, upon accidental or
circumstantial reasons which will not suit with
another time and place: Thirdly, It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
making the actions of any men, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of any Revelations and Miracles, to be
instead of Scripture, the rule of our faith or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
much more to prefer them before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
when there is a contrariety between them.
Fourthly, And his separation was but tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
not from the <hi>Order,</hi> nor from any of the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pastors,</hi> or from the <hi>people;</hi> but only from
<hi>those individual persons,</hi> whom he supposed to be
scandalous. And these considerations I judge
sufficient to resist that temptation.</p>
               <p>Whoever understandeth what a <hi>man</hi> is, and
what a <hi>Christian</hi> is, and what the office and work
of a <hi>Pastor</hi> is, will make no doubt, but that his
Guidance must be <hi>paternal,</hi> and that as <hi>Love</hi> is the
<hi>effect</hi> to be produced in the people, so <hi>Love</hi> in him
must be the <hi>means</hi> of causing it; &amp; that he must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the success of his preaching &amp; discipline
should not exceed the measure of Love, which is
manifested therin; further thanas God may extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
work beyond the aptitude of the <hi>means.</hi>
And when he hath complained of the people as
sharply as he will, he shall find that <hi>whatsoever it
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59262:223"/>
is that Love cannot do, in order to their conversion and
edification, and which Light or evidence cannot do in
order to their conviction, is not by him to be done at
all.</hi> And if he will be trying with edge tools,
he may cut his own fingers sooner than cure an
erring mind; And shall find that the people will
much worse endure acts of force and corporal
penalty, from a Pastor, than from a Magistrate;
and will hardly believe by any cloathing that he
is a sheep, if they once perceive that he hath
bloody teeth. Our work is to win the <hi>heart</hi> to
Christ: And he is unfit to be a Pastor, that
knoweth not how hearts are to be won.</p>

               <p>Some speak much of the many disorders

miseries of our corrupt and imperfect state? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
will <hi>force</hi> cure them better than <hi>evidence</hi>
of truth, and <hi>Love</hi> will do? Thirdly, will they
be so cured without a greater mischief! God
telleth the Sabbath-breakers of <hi>Israel,</hi> that when
they were rooted out, the <hi>land should keep her Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths:</hi>
Was that a <hi>mercy</hi> or a <hi>judgement?</hi> Would
you <hi>so cure</hi> Sabbath-breaking and disorder? and

work to be done, the saving of mens souls? And
shall any be saved against his will? And then
should not all force be meerly such as is subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to the ends of Love? Fifthly, will stripes
change the judgement in matters of Religion?
Sixthly, is he any better than a Knave or an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
who will say or swear or do that through
<hi>fear,</hi> which he verily thinketh God forbiddeth
him, and is disple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sed for, and feareth it may

felicity of so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ls to <hi>be such?</hi> or of Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to be composed of such? Eighthly, is not a
conscientious fear of sinning against God, a thing
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59262:224"/>
well pleasing to him, and necessary to mens sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and to the Churches welfare, and to the
safety of the lives of Kings, and of the Kingdoms

it (though not the errours that abuse it.) And
should not all care be used to cure the ungodly
world, of impiety and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earedness of conscience,
which makes them make a mock of sin. And if
conscience were once debauched and mastered by
fear, and the people be brought to prefer their
their fleshly interest before their spiritual, and
to fear mens punishment more than Gods, would
not such debauched consciences have a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
to make such men the masters of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and lives of others? And are the lives of
Kings, and the estates of neighbours, and the
peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God is not feared more than fines or corporal
penalties? Ninthly, if force be so far followed till
it have changed mens judgements or conquered
conscience, or exterminated and destroyed all
that will not be thus changed or conquered, who
differ from superiors in unnecessary things, will it
not (all things well considered) prove a dear price
for that which might be had at much cheaper
rates? Are not the most conscientious, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
helpers of the Ministery, by their example,
to cure the unconscionableness of the rest? And
therefore should be countenanced &amp; encouraged?
Tenthly, would not the cessation of unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
impositions, cast out the most of the scruples
of conscientious people, and cease the saddest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of the Churches? If <hi>Rome</hi> could have been
content with a Religion of no more Articles than

held Communion with other Churches? O what

the sober hearers (though partly guilty) will bear
his reproof of the faults of professours, with much

               <p>BY this means many Pastors have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great causes of schisms and separations.
Some of them are so carnal and selfish, that
they make the Ministery but a trade for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
and honour: And therefore for fear left
the people should encroach upon their advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

care not how ignorant they are, so that thereby

a blindfold reverence, dependance and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
How ordinarily the Roman Clergy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
this iniquity, the nations that are kept in
darkness by them, are doleful testimonies. Like
the great dog that will not endure the little one
to come near his carrion or his bone. And some
are so excessively fearful of schism, that they dare
not endure the people to pray together, or repeat
a sermon, or search the scripture, and exhort
one another daily, in that manner which God
requireth private men to do, for fear lest they
should go further, and grow proud of their own
gifts and doings, and despise their Pastors, and
set up for themselves! When as this very inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate

way to bring them, to the evil that is so much fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
While peoples care of their salvation is
cherished and stirred up, and the Pastors do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
them to pray and search the scriptures and
help each other in the way to heaven, they are
honoured and loved by the faithful of their flocks,
as men that indeed are true to their great trust,
and have a love and care for the peoples souls:
And then those Pastors who further the people in
such religious exercises, may usually as fathers
rule them in it, and keep them from usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing that is proper to the officers of
Christ, and from errours, and factions and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and may easily suppress any arrogancie
when it appeareth. And that honest desire which
religious persons have to do good to others, is
thus satisfied by such sober exercises as belong to
them: And so Pastor and people do peaceably,
lovingly and successfully concur to carry on the
work of Christ, whilest each one moveth in his
proper place. I speak this, through the great

Christians, and thereby kept out all heresies, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
schisms, and arrogancies from the flock;
with the great increase of their knowledge,
humility, piety, and just observance of their
guides.</p>
               <p>Whereas when the foresaid inordinate jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
doth restrain people, or discourage them from
any of that which is their proper work; First,
they grow into distaste of such Pastors, and take
them for enemies to godliness and to their souls:

Secondly, they grow next as jealous of all the

no fault to draw oft further from him themselves,
and then to disaffect others to him: Thirdly,
their appetite to religious exercises, when it is
restrained groweth inordinate, and affecteth that
which belongeth not to them. Fourthly, they
conceit that there is some necessity of their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>teachers,</hi> to do that which the Teachers will

               <p>THe clamours and wayes of violence used
by many Pastors, are oft but an unhappy
means to supply the defect of their own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and duties: And those who are conscions
of an insufficiency in themselves to do their parts,
do most intemperately call out to the Magistrates
to help them, and do most unmannerly censure
them, if they answer not their expectations: And
indeed if the sword of the Magistrate be such an
universal remedy, and may serve instead of the
ability and labour of the Minister, let it also
serve to cure the sick, instead of the skill and
labour of the Physician; and let all other callings
as needless be put down, and let us have none but
Magistrates alone.</p>
               <p>First, Some Ministers are so <hi>ignorant,</hi> that if
one of their people do but turn Antinomian, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist
or Separatist, they are <hi>not able</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them: Much less if one that is <hi>learned</hi> and
well-studied introduce these errours: If the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59262:228"/>
Sectary challenge them to dispute, its two to one
but errour will triumph, through the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of him that should defend the truth. And then
this insufficient Minister, will turn to railing, or
call out to the Magistrate for his help, to declare
to all that he is too weak: which will harden
and encrease the seduced party, and make them
think that it is the <hi>weakness</hi> of his <hi>cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, And too many Ministers, who seem
more able, are Lordly and lazy, and carry
themselves strangely and at a distance from the
people, and are seldome familiar with them in
private: And so they give advantage to such
seducers as creep into houses, to sow their tares;
and for the weaker sort to vend their errours,
when there is none to contradict them: These
Pastors take their proper work, to which they
are called, for a <hi>slavery</hi> or a <hi>toil.</hi> They are so
<hi>proud</hi> and <hi>idle,</hi> that for them to watch over all the

to house, night and day with tears as <hi>Paul</hi> did,
and to watch where any spark appeareth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to quench it, doth seem to them such a
drudgery and burden, that God were unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
if he should impose it on them: That is,
They think God unmerciful if he will not rather
let the patient die, than put the Chyrurgeon to
the trouble of dressing his sores: If he will not
let the people be damned rather than put Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to so much labour to instruct and save
them. If it were but to take their tythes and
honour, and to be reverenced by the people, and
to preach once or twice a week, a sermon which
tendeth to their applause, they could submit to

this much: But <hi>Paul</hi>'s exhortation <hi>Act.</hi> 20. see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

be informed or reformed at so cheap a rate. <hi>Sin</hi>

think that a lordly command or rebuke, should
serve the turn to keep them from errour and

their censures.</head>
               <p>BOth these extreams will tend to confusion:
First, They that care not at all what men
think of them, do but despise their advantages to
do good, whilest they think that they only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the praise or dispraise of men. We are
commanded <hi>not to please our selves, but to please all
men for their good to edification.</hi> Rom. 15. 1, 2, 3.
Our power over them is upon their <hi>minds</hi> and
<hi>wills,</hi> and not like Magistrates upon their bodies
or estates: Therefore when we have lost their
hearts, we have lost our power to do them good:
They will not easily hear him that is despised or
abhorred by them. Therefore a prudent care
must be taken, that we be not prodigal of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in them, lest it prove to be cruelty to their
souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And yet if we give up our selves to
their conceits and humours, and forsake the way
of truth or peace to keep their favour, it will
prove the more dangerous extream. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59262:232"/>
noted the peril of Ministers and the Church
by this temptation. The rawest and the rashest
professours are commonly the most violent and
censorious; And so ready to scorn and vilifie
the gravest wisest Pastors, who cross their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that many honest Ministers have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by the temptation; to forsake their
own judgement, and to comply with the violent
to escape their censures and contempt: But this
is not the way to the Churches peace. It may
prove a palliate cure for a time, to put by at the
present some sudden inconvenience: But it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
for after troubles and confusions. First,
it will make the rashest and indiscreetest people
(which is usually the women and young men)
to be the Governours of the Church: Whilest all
their Teachers must <hi>humour them</hi> lest they <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please</hi>
them. Secondly, When you have followed
them a little way, and think there to stop, you
must follow them still further, and never can
foresee the end: For that weakness and passion
of theirs which crieth up one errour to day, is
pregnant with innumerable more; and may cry
up more to morrow, and so on. And one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
commonly draweth on more, and one mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
engageth them to another: And the last
are usually the worst: And the same ends and
reasons which made you go out of the way to
please them, will make you still follow them,
how far soever they go, unless you repent. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
And if you repent and leave them, it must cost
you dearer than prevention would have done:
And you might have at much cheaper rates, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
them just there where they forsook the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59262:233"/>
way of truth and peace. Fourthly, And you will

dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dvantage your Ministry as to all the less
zealous, and all the more sober and peaceable of
the godly; And you will bring your selves into
contempt with these, for your levity injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and instability: And so you will lose
much more than you will get. Fifthly, And in the
mean time you will be made but the vulgars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to do hurt: you will be used by them
but to confirm themselves in their errours, and
to further dividing and unpeaceable designes-Sixthly,
And when all is done, and your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are wounded, and you are made the heads
or leaders of factions, at last those of themselves
that God sheweth mercy to, will see their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and when they repent, they will give you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thanks for your compliance. A sinful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring
of rash professours, is as great a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to godly Ministers, as a sinful compliance
with the Great ones of the world: I mean it is a
sin, which our station and disposition afford us
as great temptations to. For though to a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
wealth and honour be stronger temptations;
yet to a godly man the applause or censure of
those whom we account most wise and godly
may tempt much stronglier. And alas how or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
doth the fire of Church and state, which
flameth about our own ears, convince us of our
errour, in following those whom we should
lead! O how many doleful instances of it doth
Church history afford us! There are not many of
the tumults that have cost the lives of thousands
about Religion, but were kindled by the young
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59262:233"/>
injudicious professours, who drew in their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to humour them in countenancing too much
of their disorders. Historians tell us that when
King <hi>Francis</hi> of France had forbid the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Papists way of worship, and silenced
the Ministers for not obeying him; many of the
hot brain'd people, took up the way of provoking
them by scornful pictures &amp; libels; hanging up and

                  </gap>ulous and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
rhimes and images: But this (which was none
of the way of God) began that persecution (by
provoking the King) which cost many thousands,
if not hundred thousand lives before it ended.
And the Synod at <hi>Rochel</hi> which refused the grave
counsel of <hi>Du Plessis, Du Moulin</hi> and many such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
was stirred up by the peoples zeal; and
ended in the blood of many score thousands, and
the ruine of the power of the Protestants in
<hi>France.</hi> Abundance of such sad instances might
be given, if <hi>England</hi> need to go any whether
else for matter of warning than to it self. He
that after the experiences of this age, will think
it fit to follow the conduct of injudicious zealots,
is left as unexcusable as almost any man, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had a sight of hell. The dreadful ruine of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> according to Christs prediction (such
as the world hath scarce seen besides) was just
in the like manner brought about, by those fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ones whom <hi>Iosephus</hi> calleth the zealots.</p>
               <p>But if you will do all things <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> to
win men, and offend them by no <hi>unnecessary thing;</hi>
and yet stand your ground, and stir not an inch
from <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>seberness, piety</hi> or <hi>peace,</hi> to please a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
people in the world. This way shall do your

of sober principles and wayes: At least when

firm and stable. Compliance with one of the
contentious parties, may make you cried up by
<hi>that party</hi> for a time: But the contrary faction
will as much cry you down; and your estimation
is but like an Almanack for a year: And they
themselves that needed your sinful help for some
present job, will be like enough ere long to cast
you off (as is aforesaid:) And if they do not,
you are objects of pity to sober standers by: And

will still burn within, and be too ready to break
out into more open schisms when opportunity
serveth them. Yea the Churches of old have
found great cause to be very tender how they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
such reverenced valued Pastors, though they
should fall into any errour; and sometimes to
connive or bear with much, lest they should oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
a far worse disease, by the imprudent curing
of a lesser.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I dare be bold to proclaim to the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Pastors, of all the Churches wheresoever,
that</hi> True Piety, Love, Humility <hi>and</hi> Prudence, can
happily heal a great many of dissentions, which to the
carnal, uncharitable, proud and imprudent, seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
and by their malignant-medicines are still
exasperated a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But alas this quarrelsome distemper in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
hath had such pernicious effects upon the
Church, and is still going on to more confusion,
that it deserveth and calleth for our common la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.
And if we must lament it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
as an uncurable disease, I fear we must with
equal despair lament the Churches ruines, and the
consumption of Religion. For how can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the people should hear, if the Pastors
be obdurate and remediless? And who shall cure
them, if their Physicians themselves be they that
do infect them?</p>

and that the <hi>manner</hi> be suited to the <hi>end,</hi> and to

And he may as wisely hope at last to

by splenetick censures and divisions, in despight of

done against <hi>Holiness</hi> and against God, and against
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59262:236"/>
the <hi>Life</hi> of the Church: And therefore if any
Love-killer do call himself, a servant of Christ
and a friend to <hi>Holiness</hi> or to the <hi>Church,</hi> he must

bring us to believe that such a sacrifice is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to him, who offered himself a sacrifice for
the Church, and who calleth for a <hi>living acceptable
sacrifice, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. They have need to make a
better proof of their authority, than <hi>Kelley</hi> did
of his Revelation, when he brought Doctor <hi>Dee</hi>
to consent to adultery by the same pretended
warrant: God who is Love accepteth not such a
sacrifice at the hands of Love-killers and Church-destroyers.</p>
               <p>But especially when besides this acrimony of
mind, there shall other more pernicious disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be contracted, and foment these <hi>censures</hi> &amp; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi>
of their brethren; the malignity of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
is a sad prognostick. Two such <hi>causes</hi> of it <hi>Paul</hi>
layeth open, one <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 30. the other <hi>Rom. 16. 17,
18.</hi> One is the devilish sin of pride; and a desire to
have many disciples to be our applauders <hi>[They shal
speak perverse things to draw awaydisciples after them]</hi>
The other <hi>selfishness, carnality and coveteousness
[They serve not the Lord Iesus, but their own bellies.]</hi>
And so 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 3. Through Coveteousness they shall
with feigned words make Merchandise of you:</hi> They
buy and sell mens souls for gain: These are <hi>Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers</hi>
in a double sense: Their <hi>craft bringeth them

in no small gain,</hi> and lest it <hi>should be set at nought,</hi>
for <hi>gain</hi> they do <hi>gain-say</hi> the truth, and raise up
tumults against the best of the servants of Christ;

               <p>The sum of all this (and most that followeth)
is in 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5. If any man teach otherwise,

evil surmisings</hi> (while they pretend to no less
necessary a work, than the saving of Truth and
the peoples souls): <hi>Perverse disputings of men of
corrupt minds</hi> (the impatient scratchings of those
whose corrupt blood must needs have vent, and
therefore causeth this itch of quarrelling) and
<hi>destitute of the truth</hi> (whilest they think they are
saving the life of truth) <hi>supposing that gain is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>
(being so blinded by the love of gain that
they make themselves believe, that is the cause of
<hi>truth</hi> and <hi>Godliness</hi> which maketh for their gain;
and that the raising of them, is the raising of the
Church; and that all tendeth to the interest of

to his folly; by such conviction and rebukes as

his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes,
and think that none can stand before him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And it is commonly the most <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
sort of Ministers, who are the liberallest of
their supercilious contempt of those, whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
and worth are above their censures.
If a controversie be started, which they either
never studied, or have only turned over the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of a few books, to number the sheets, and
never spent one year in the deep and serious
search of the truth which is in question; Or if
they have clumsie wits, that cannot feel so fine a
thred, nor are capable of mastering the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
None then are (usually) so ready to shoot
their bolt, and pass a Magisterial sentence, and
gravely and ignorantly tell the ignorant, what e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
such or such a one maintaineth, as these
that talk of that which they never understood.
For as I have known many unlearned sots, that
had no artifice to keep up the reputation of their
learning, than in all companies to cry down such
and such (who were wiser than themselves) for
no schollars, but unlearned men; so many that
are or should be conscious of the dulness and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of their fumbling and unfurnished
brains, have no way to keep up the reputation
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59262:238"/>
of their wisedome, with their simple followers,
but to tell them, O such a one hath dangerous
errours, and such a book is a dangerous book;
and they hold this, and they hold that; and so to
make odious the opinions or practises of others,
which they understand not: And this doth their
business with these silly soals, who hear not what
can be said against them, as well as if they were
the words of truth and soberness.</p>
               <p>As for the younger and emptier sort of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
it is no wonder, if they understand not
that which they had never opportunity to study,
or have taken but a superficial taste of: But it
were to be wished that they were so humble as
to confess that they are yet but beardless; and
that time and long study is needful to make them
as wise as those (who with equal wit and grace)
have had many more years of serious study, and
greater opportunities to know the truth: and that
they have not their wisdome by special inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or revelation; nor so far excel the rest of
mankind in a miraculous wit, as to know that by
a few years lazy study, which others know not

Much time and study is necessary to
great wisedome: But much <hi>time</hi> and <hi>study</hi> may
consist with very mean attainments; and doth
not alwayes reach the wisedome which is sought.
And in such a case, the ancient and grey-headed
think that veneration is their due; and that if
they gravely sentence such or such to be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
they are injured if they are not believed.
They have not wisdome enough to make their
age honourable; and therefore they expect that
their age should make their wisdome honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and because they are not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the light, nor to stand before the power of
open truth, they find it necessary to do almost
all their work by <hi>back-biting:</hi> When they are
out of the hearing of those whom they back-bite,
among such as are as little sensible of this hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sin as they; then they have this man and
that man; this party and that party to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And (as Mr. <hi>Robert Bolton</hi> well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
to hide the malignity of their sin, and to
cheat the hearers and their own consciences) they
will first seem to praise him, and to confess that
he is in other respects a very worthy, a learned
or a pious man, and then bring in their back-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with a [but.] And that which must sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all this sin, and turns it into a work of zeal,
is the seeming interest of God, and of religion.
They do all out of a <hi>zeal of God</hi> (I cannot say,
<hi>A zeal for God)</hi> though it be not according to
knowledge. If it was an untruth which they spake
it was for religion: If they did <hi>back-bite</hi> it was
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59262:239"/>
to preserve the hearers from errour and danger:
If they reviled that which they never understood,
it was to keep the Church from the infection: If
they tear the Church, and use their reputation to
murder Love, and to make others odious who
are wiser than they, all this is but for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of truth: And if it be non-sense or envy
which they vent, they never repent of it (thats
the mischief) because they think that the <hi>Lord</hi>
and <hi>the Church,</hi> and the <hi>hearers have need of it.</hi> And
so all those Texts are to them <hi>Apocripha,</hi> which
condemn their sin. <hi>Psal. 15. 3. 2 Cor. 12. 20.
Rom. 1. 30. Prov.</hi> 25. 23. And sin is so be frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in mans corrupted nature, that they meet
but with few <hi>angry countenances to drive away</hi> such
reverend <hi>back-biting tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay that they may abuse Gods word and name,
against God, to the devils service, they arm
themselves (as the Tempter did <hi>Math. 4.)</hi> with
Gods authority and scripture, and will charge
those with sin who would reprove their sin, and
bring them to repentance: And as Master <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
noteth, how the Pope under the reverend
garb of Christs Vicar, doth do the like things to
the suppressing of the Church and Truth, as
Turks and Heathens do under the name of open
enemies: so these men find that the names of
<hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> with the <hi>words of God
abused,</hi> are among the well-meaning, a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
means to do that work which God abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
I have long used to resist this sin of <hi>back-biting;</hi>
and (not to justifie the faults of any, but)
to convince the <hi>back-biter</hi> of his sin. And I sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
do it, but they report of me that I am a
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59262:239"/>
                  <hi>defender of such and such corruptions:</hi> One back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth
men as Prelatists and formalists; another
the Presbyterians; another the Independents;
and another the Anabaptists; and say <hi>such a one
is of such a sect,</hi> and ever with epithetes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach:
And when I tell them that the way to
do them good, is to convince them of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to their faces, and not to talk of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
their backs, they report me presently to
be a patron of the sect, because I was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover
of their unchristian vice.</p>
               <p>And many of them having not so far digested
their Religion, as to see the evidences of it in
themselves, are fain to take it upon trust from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
And they choose that party to cast this
great trust upon, which they think to be most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable.
The Papist chooseth for number and
worldly pomp and order: The carnal self-seeker
chooseth the party, which may most further his
preferment and honour in the world: The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nester
sectaries do choose the party, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to them to be the most <hi>illuminated</hi> or most
<hi>strict:</hi> And some have the wit, to look most at
those, that set as many of these together as may
be hoped for. But among whomsoever they cast
their lot, their way to preserve the reputation of
Orthodoxness, and the peace of that conscience
which made the choice, is to be liberal in reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
those that differ in any thing from the sect
which they have chosen. (For how much of the
Christian world is now in sects, is a thing which
requireth more lamentation, than proof.) As
the Dominicans when they have written far much
more than <hi>Calvin</hi> about predetermination, they
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59262:240"/>
have no way to keep their honour with their
sect (the Papists) but to rail at the Calvinists
and belye them, and charge them with that which
they abhor, that so they may seem sufficiently to
differ from them.</p>
               <p>But the greatest reason of this contentious
back-biting quarrelling humour, is Ignorance
it self; which will not give them leave so much
as to see the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the points which they
oppose; much less the truth of that which they
have not been used to. The way which is <hi>spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against,</hi> they think they may also boldly speak
against.</p>
               <p>And hypocrisie (though mixed with sincerity)
hath too great a hand in this with many. The less
men are <hi>taken</hi> up in that true religion which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en-work and Heart-work, in the
Love of God and man, and the mortification of
their selfishness and pride; the more they are
addicted to make it up with a contentious zeal
for their several wayes, opinions and modes of
worship, that they may not seen to be cold or
neutral in religion. They never understood the
third Chapter of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mes,</hi> nor many other such
texts of scripture.</p>
               <p>O that the Ministers of Christ were once sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
not here only but through all the Christian
world, what a plague the conjunction of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and contensiousness, and their dividing

And what they have done against the souls of

If every Minister (especially your

When wisedom, holiness and humility are their

will then take place. And then we shall not,

and yet go on in our drunken fits, to make them

them that are under the Law, as under the Law,
that I might gain them that are under the Law:

given all things into his hands, and that he was
come from God and went to God, he riseth from
supper and laid aside his garments, and took a
towel and girded himself; After that he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
water into a bason, and began to wash the
disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel
wherewith he was girded. 12, 13. So after he
had washed their feet and had taken his garments,
and was set down again he said unto them, Know
ye what I have done to you? Ye call me <hi>Master</hi>
and <hi>Lord,</hi> and ye say well, for so I am: If I
then you Lord and Master have washed your
feet, ye also ought to wash one anothers feet:
<q>For I have given you an example, that ye should
do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I
say unto you that the servant is not greater than
his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he
that sent him. If ye know these things, happy
are ye if ye do them.</q>

that you may not say that I obtrude any thing
on you of my own, which is not the mind of your

can seriously peruse all these words of the spirit
of God, and yet can find in them no matter of
correction or instruction without a Commentary

them at this time; but to add Christs next words

               <p>I conclude as I began: that the consciousness of

of the people, who cannot be expected to equal
them in knowledg. Alas, Brethren, what are we (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

bloody Inquisitions? And who hindereth the
preaching of the pure doctrine of the Gospel in
all the <hi>Romanists</hi> dominions? Is it not an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Clergy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You'l say,</hi> Those are Papists and so are not we?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No, God forbid we should! But they
are a mistaken <hi>Clergy;</hi> which sheweth us that the
<hi>Clergy</hi> are as liable to be dividers and troublers of
the Church as the Laity are; and have done much
more.</p>
               <p>If any hence would infer, that the Pastors must
be vilified or deprived of their just liberties and
power, I would more largely tell such a one, that
it is also the Clergy that have opposed all these
Heresies and sins; and that have maintained obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Princes; and that have preserved the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59262:251"/>
Scriptures and the Christian saith; and that have
been the salt and lights of the world, without
whom Christianity never long continued in any
nation; And that have been the chief instruments
of bringing all the souls to Heaven that have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thither from the militant Church. (But I have
done this in two sheets for the Ministery long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.)
So that our faults consist with the honour
of our function, and of our necessary labours, and
with the praise of the more blameless.</p>
               <p>And even so, though the peoples weakness, and
inclinableness to unwarrantable separations and
schisms, be blameworthy, as a fruit of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
and injudiciousness: Yet must we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that they are the members of Christ, and
we must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot deny his interest in them; nor judge
or use them hardlier than Christ himself hath
done, or alloweth us to do: But study his Love
and tenderness and forbearance, that we may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him in serving him; and not follow our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
passions, and call it, a serving of him;
who liketh no such hurtful service. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Christ in none of his Infants or weaker mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
but in the strong and more prudent sort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
doth love him in so few, that he may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether he loveth him indeed at all; And
whether ever he shall hear, <hi>In as much as ye did
it to the least of these my brethren, ye did it unto
me.</hi>
