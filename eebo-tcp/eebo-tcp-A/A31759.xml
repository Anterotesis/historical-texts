            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Hope it will not be conſtrued any reflection upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I introduce a Clergy-man into familiarity with <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Obſervator.</hi> For though it is true, A man is known by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and therefore ſuch as are chary of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, would be very ſhy of converſing with two ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Libellers: Yet the Clergy of the complexion of our Dialogizer, do rather glory in ſuch converſation; And the more ſober and truly <hi>Reverend</hi> may do well to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Clubbs of our <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi>- and <hi>Tavern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunting Parſons,</hi> before they cenſure my expoſing them. If he ſpeak not over-much Reaſon, that's not <hi>my</hi> fault, but the <hi>Obſervator</hi>'s, whoſe Echo my <hi>Clergy-man</hi> is. As for the <hi>Obſervator</hi> himſelf, he diſcourſes <hi>after his manner,</hi> with little <hi>ſence</hi> but great <hi>confidence.</hi> But <hi>Heraclitus</hi> I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged <hi>partly</hi> to Act another's Part; which may not be very abſurd: for he that can <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>weep</hi> together, may well enough repreſent both <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory</hi> in one Perſon, doing all by Fits as the fancy takes him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is not only levelled againſt the <hi>Obſervator</hi>'s Animadverſions on <hi>The Tory Plot,</hi> but againſt all the Pamphlets of that Nature, that he has ever writ, or <hi>ſhall</hi> write. For he has a certain <hi>Sett</hi> of Arguments that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated <hi>Indifferently</hi> for all occaſions, that is, <hi>truly</hi> for none
<pb facs="tcp:57775:3"/>
at all; juſt as becomes <hi>Poor Robin</hi>'s Man: the <hi>Maſter</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his <hi>Obſervations</hi> by Whole-ſale once a Year at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon, and his <hi>Man</hi> His by Retail three or four times a Week, or oftner as Cuſtomers come in. The truth is, He's every way ſo contemptible, that no man of ſence, that values his <hi>Credit</hi> or his <hi>Hours,</hi> would take any notice of him, if the Faction for want of a better did not make <hi>him</hi> their Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo it may be but honeſt Policy to take the advantage of Encountring ſo <hi>Doughty</hi> a Combatant. But the Reader, when he finds <hi>Heraclitus</hi> upbraiding him with betraying their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> may deem me too <hi>ungrateful,</hi> thus to vilifie one that has contributed <hi>ſo much</hi> to my undertaking. For I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, he has intimated plainly enough, that he's at my Service to appear as an <hi>Evidence</hi> to prove <hi>A Tory Plot:</hi> But for all that, I ſhall not court him, but rather adviſe him to keep on that ſide he is; for the matter of Fact is ſo notorious, that there will be but very <hi>ſmall Encouragement</hi> for Witneſſes; and every one <hi>muſt live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any one ſhall yet clamour I have not ſufficiently juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>Charge,</hi> I am confident he ſpeaks not his conſcience, but deſigns only to egge me on to preſs ſo cloſe on the Heels of Truth, as to have my Brains beat out. But let him ſet his heart at reſt: for 'tis not ſo hard to diſtinguiſh their <hi>feigned</hi> Loyalty and <hi>treacherous</hi> devotion to the <hi>Church,</hi> from that which is <hi>genuine;</hi> but that a man may perfectly delineate the one, without giving one rude touch upon the other. And when it ſhall be as eaſie to bring the Plotters to condign puniſhment as to prove the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> they ſhall have no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the ſhortneſs of the Evidence.</p>

               <p>Worthy Sir, your acceptance is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. But I hope when our deſign is accompliſh'd, your ſervices will be better rewarded, and your merits procure you the <hi>Guidance</hi> of men above my degree.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Yes o' my conſcience, if ever we are ſo happy as to have a Catholick King, I ſhall not doubt, but to ſee Mr. <hi>L.</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> for he takes more pains than all the Jeſuits put together.</p>

               <p>Puh! is the Bond of Marriage ſtricter than the Vow of perpetual Virginity? and yet how ordinary is it for his Holineſs to diſpenſe with that? Though in this caſe there will be no need of the Pope's kindneſs; for the Civil Law will ſerve Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s turn, according to which, <hi>Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> makes a Nullity.

               <p>Troth Sir, I muſt be merry. But no more of that. Pray Gentlemen, what News?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Faith I have hardly any time to liſten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, theſe Libelling Raſcals find me ſo much work. And there's the <hi>Plaguey <hi>Tory Plot</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inf. Cl.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed Sir, we are much indebted to you for the pains you have taken with that damn'd Libel; and for the hints you have given us to take off the imputations it caſts on Loyal Proteſtants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>'Pox on't, it was too cloſe and ſerious for me to meddle with; and, but that ſomething was to be ſaid, <hi>Obſervator</hi> had e'en as good have let it alone too, as, if you'l give me leave to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate a Whig a little, I'le ſhew you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>As for the Whigs, they're ſuch dull ſouls, any thing will confute them: and our Friends that are privy to the Plot, know, that nothing can be ſaid to the purpoſe, to take off the ſuſpicion; nor is there much need to palliate the buſineſs any longer, now it is juſt come to perfection. But however Mr. <hi>Whig,</hi> let's ſee what you can ſay againſt my <hi>Obſervations?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>We underſtand one another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore freedom can be no offence. Have at your <hi>Obſervations</hi> then between Jeſt and Earneſt. In the firſt place (<hi>N.</hi> 130.) you find fault that he calls Addreſſes <hi>needleſs,</hi> (ſeeing they are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of the Oath of Allegeance) and ſay it is as needful to repeat that Oath as <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Prayers.</hi> Now you know that Baptiſm is but once adminiſtred, and therefore can be no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for your turn; and as for the repetition of the Lord's Supper, you of all men ſhould not make uſe of ſuch an Argument, that could neglect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57775:5"/>
it for ſeventeen or twenty years together, and the <hi>publick</hi> Prayers in like manner; (but for <hi>Cloſet-Prayer</hi> indeed, I can ſay nothing.) So that by your own practice you confeſs Addreſſes need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>In the ſecond place you are too Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd in affirming, That if the matter of a Law be <hi>Controvertible,</hi> the Subject is not to diſpute either the <hi>Authority</hi> of it or his <hi>Obedience.</hi>]</p>

               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Pardon me Sir, if I ſay you miſtake. For I never knew you affirm more, than that a Law can make a thing that is <hi>indifferent</hi> in its own nature, to become neceſſary as to <hi>practice.</hi> But the <hi>Obſervator</hi> extends this to all things <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi> which comprehends all the Articles of <hi>Faith</hi> owned by the Catholicks and rejected by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Worſhip of Images, praying for the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, whatſoever is <hi>Controverted</hi> betwixt the Catholicks and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>

               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>

               <p>Ha, ha, he! What, are they therefore no longer <hi>Controvertible?</hi> Why, the Church has as well condemn'd the Proteſtant Tenets; will the

Proteſtants therefore under a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Government never controvert ſuch Tenets more? I wiſh you could perſuade 'em to't, and then a Catholick Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor would make ſhort work, for, as you ſay, <hi>The King only is the Government. (Numb.</hi> 131.) You are likewiſe too open, when you ſay, That you can name at leaſt a dozen Sets of Diſſenters that are more Diabolical Hereticks than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.] You know the moſt learned Doctors of the Reformed Religion have alwaies held the Pope to be Anti chriſt, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Idolatrous; and the King-killing doctrine is avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by none but our ſelves.</p>

               <p>Puh! you would have me write to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at all; muſt not I train up my Charge to preferr Popery before Presbytery; and how ſhall I do that, if I do not give the Schiſmaticks a wipe now and then?</p>

               <p>Why, have I not done it ſufficiently? As to his Precedents, I have told him, (<hi>N</hi> 131<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) That nothing is therefore <hi>well</hi> done, becauſe it <hi>has</hi> been done; and it is to be <hi>ſuppoſ'd</hi> that none of his Precedents were juſtifiable.</p>

               <p>Yes, yes, 'tis beſt arguing <hi>ex conceſſis.</hi>

               <p>And as to the point of <hi>Religion,</hi> I do not read of any Bills of <hi>Excluſion</hi> among the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians. (ibid.)</hi>

               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Admirable! for it is to be <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> that the Emperours and Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>Primitive Chriſtians.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>And then I have prov'd it plainly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by this, That if any Parliament in Chriſtendom ſhall preach any other Doctrine of Obedience to Magiſtrates, than what our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have taught us, I am afraid that Parliament, without repentance, will go to the Devil, (<hi>ibid.</hi>)</p>

               <p>I wiſh they ſend no body thither before them. But where lies the Logick of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Why Sir, you very well <hi>ſuppos'd</hi> for me before, that the Emperour and Senate were primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians; and now give me leave to <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> for my ſelf, that firſt our Saviour, and after him S. <hi>Peter</hi> were Emperours, and the reſt of the Apoſtles the Senate; and we do not find that ever they attempted to exclude <hi>Tiberius</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> or any other from the Throne becauſe they were Heathens, and thoſe ſure were as bad as Papiſts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>'Pſhaw! but part of this <hi>Suppoſition</hi> is too groſs. For our Saviour ſayes, that <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not of this world:</hi> and that he <hi>came not to divide</hi> or diſpoſe <hi>of Inheritances;</hi> which implies, rather than denies, that ſuch whoſe kingdom is of this world, may diſpoſe of Inheritances. But as for S. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed, if we may gueſs at his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> by the Pope's his Succeſſour's, <hi>he</hi> was Univerſal Monarch; and if he had thought it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, might not only have excluded an Heathen Succeſſor; but from his plenitude of power, have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57775:6"/>
depoſed the preſent Heathen Poſſeſſor, and given the Crown to a Chriſtian. Which becauſe he did not do, your Argument indeed is very cogent, That no power on Earth can hinder any man from coming to the Crown in his courſe, be he as bad as the Devil.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Look you there! now I ſee you conceive me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inf. Cl.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and as to the Apoſtles that made up the Senate, you have their opinions plain in their writings: <hi>Submit your ſelves to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man——whether it be to the King as ſupreme: Obey them that have the rule over you: Put them in mind to be ſubject to principalities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates.</hi> And abundance of ſuch like commands we have. All which make it clear, (ſeeing the words are general) that Emperour and Senate, King and Parliament and all muſt obey, ſubmit and give way to the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive heir. For ſeeing diſperſed Jews and the meaneſt of the people are forewarned from rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt their lawful Soveraigns; it follows, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> that the King and Parliament cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any man from the Succeſſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed Sir, I think it is rather <hi>a debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori:</hi> and, upon my ſoul, if the Whigs argu'd at this rate, we ſhould call it perfect Cant, and make ſport enough with it. But however ſuch Arguing may do pretty well out of the pulpit, for it looks like Atheiſm, Schiſm and Irreligion to queſtion or diſpute any thing deliver'd there. Well Mr. <hi>L.</hi> I ſee a word is enough to the wiſe, you need
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57775:7"/>
but give the hint, and your Charge have it preſently.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, my Obſervations are their Common places, and I muſt leave <hi>them</hi> to improve them into Argument, for I have no time for that, nor does my talent much lye that way. But to go on: In the laſt place I prove the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion unlawful, becauſe the King, Lords and Commons can no more juſtifie an Unrighteous action than a private man. (ibid.). Now Sir, <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> the Bill <hi>unrighteous,</hi> 'tis plain they cannot paſs it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Well then your Argument lies thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> the paſſing the Bill of Excluſion be an <hi>unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> action, the King, Lords and Commons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs it.</p>
               <p>But ſuch paſſing is an Unrighteous Action.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Juſt ſo: for look you, get but the main point in queſtion once granted, and my life for it, you win the cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Well, theſe <hi>hypothetical</hi> ſyllogiſms are almoſt as ſerviceable as the Doctrine of <hi>probable</hi> opinions; the firſt to inform the reaſon, the latter to guide the practice. But what now if one ſhould not grant you, that the paſſing of ſuch a Bill were an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous</hi> action?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>If men will not believe the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, I cannot help it. But pray let's hear what <hi>you</hi> can ſay in the caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Faith I ſhall ſay little in the caſe, ſeeing there's more ſaid already than I ſee well anſwer'd.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57775:7"/>
But this I will add: You'l grant me <hi>the King can do no wrong.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that I will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Then I ſay, I canot ſee how his having the advice and conſent of Lords and Commons ſhould <hi>make him do wrong.</hi> For to me it ſeems indifferent as to that, whether the King do a thing from his own meer motion and ſcience, or by the advice of his Privy Council, or of his Parliament. Now Sir, to do <hi>wrong,</hi> or to do an <hi>unrighteous action,</hi> as you term it, are all one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Hang't, my miſtake was, to bring the King into the Argument; for if I had only ſaid Lords and Commons, I had hit it. But now I think on't, 'tis not the Pope and Council, but the Pope alone, that is infallible; and if I durſt own my ſelf a Papiſt, this would help me to make it out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>It would ſo, but the neceſſity of your diſſembling that, hinders you from making the beſt of your Argument. However I am ſure you are right in that which you inſtance in, That it would be an unrighteous action for the King, Lords and Commons to put a Man to death for refuſing to ſwallow forty Thouſand Black Bills: For no Power in Heaven or Earth can oblige a man to that which is impoſſible. But then what's this to the Bill of Excluſion; or where lies the parallel?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Now I ſee you are dull: <hi>Id poſſums quod jure poſſumus.</hi> The firſt is <hi>naturally</hi> impoſſible, and the latter <hi>morally.</hi> The firſt cannot be done, becauſe it <hi>cannot;</hi> and the latter, becauſe it <hi>ought</hi> not.</p>

               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Here are two faults in Logick, firſt, <hi>tranſitus a genere ad genus,</hi> and then <hi>petitio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipii.</hi> For you firſt paſs from a moral to a natural action, and then you are at your old way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the thing in queſtion. But beſides, this is nothing to the purpoſe; for the diſpute was, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what the <hi>King, Lords and Commons</hi> could do; and now you come to what <hi>a man</hi> can or can not do. For I ſee nothing to the contrary, but the King and Parliament may paſs the Bill of Excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though a man cannot ſwallow 40000 black Bills.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Come I warrant you would tye me up to the Pedantry of the Schools: I hate inſiſting too long upon one thing, for that does but confound a man: I love a touch and away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir, you are excellent at that: And thus you prove notably, That Parliaments are no eſſential part of the Government, for if that were ſo, in the Intervalls of Parliament there were no longer a Government. (<hi>N.</hi> 131) And I'll give you ſuch another, The Common Council are no eſſential part of the Government of the City, for if that were ſo, in the Intervalls of Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils there would be no longer a Government. Now Sir, this Argument will not down with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, nor yours with any man elſe. For hey'l be apt to diſtinguiſh between the Government, and the adminiſtration of it. Now the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (or more properly the Governours) are the King and Parliament, without whoſe joynt Authority no Law can be eſtabliſhed. But the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57775:8"/>
putting theſe Laws in execution, or adminiſtration of the Government, that indeed is in the Kings hand, or ſuch as he will commit it to. And till an Order of the King in Council ſhall be as valid as an Act of Parliament, I doubt we ſhall not get it believed that the King alone is the Government. But enough of this. In the next place I do not well like your faſtning the faults of the King's Miniſters upon the King. (<hi>N.</hi> 130.)</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Why, do you not know the myſtery of that? I have a double end in it: Firſt, to get the Libellers puniſh'd; and then to caſt the odium of all Male-adminiſtration upon the King. For you know well enough we care not what ſcandals and ſuſpicious we draw upon the King, ſo we can but preſerve the Duke's eſteem. And hence I ſay, that the pretended devolution of an <hi>ill</hi> thing done, from the King to his Miniſters, is as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as to excuſe a man that commits a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> by crying <hi>he was ſet on. (ibid.)</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>So then, you will have the King reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible both for his own faults, and for theirs alſo that adviſed him to them. This will do the King's buſineſs, I'll warrant him. And yet it may be very ſerviceable Doctrine for a Succeſſour: as thus: All the faults of his Miniſters will lye upon him; and ſeeing he cannot be called to account, the greateſt faults ſhall paſs unpuniſht, and ſo no man will be afraid of ſerving his pleaſure, and then hey for arbitrary Government! However ſince you are the Champion for the <hi>preſent</hi> Government, it ſeeems but a quaint way of maintaining the King's reputation, by devolving thoſe faults up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57775:9"/>
                  <hi>Him,</hi> that the <hi>Whigs</hi> are content to faſten upon his <hi>Miniſters</hi> only: but you have told me of the policy of it, and I am ſatisfied.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Well, is there any thing elſe you can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>How do you make it out that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants may not as well exclude a Papiſt from the Crown, as Papiſts a Proteſtant?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Thus: Either the Papiſts do <hi>Well</hi> in't, or <hi>Ill:</hi> If the <hi>former,</hi> they are not to be <hi>blam'd;</hi> if the <hi>latter,</hi> they are not to be <hi>imitated. (ibid)</hi> And this <hi>Dilemma</hi> I defie any Whig of 'em all to Anſwer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Thus: The Papiſts are the Aſſailants, who if they can help it, will neither let a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant King enjoy his Crown, nor Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects their Eſtates or Lives. Such King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may therefore <hi>lawfully</hi> unite and combine for their mutual defence and preſervation; and make ſure of him (or them) whoſe prevailing is ſure to be their overthrow. For if it be lawful for the Subjects to defend the King and Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57775:9"/>
and for the King to ſecure the Eſtates and Lives of his Subjects; I do not ſee how it ſhould be unlawful to diſable or prevent any man from deſtroying them.</p>

               <p>But there's an old rule, That ſimilitudes illuſtrate, but do not prove. And why ſhould not the King ſtand, though the Houſe fall? But now for my part, I think the Whigs ſpeak reaſon; for ſeeing the King is reputed an Heretick by the Catholicks, and when he is removed, they have hopes of a Popiſh Succeſſor, He is apparently in double danger, both as he's taken for an Heretick, and ſo it may be no ſin to murther him; and alſo becauſe in their opinion he keeps a better man from the Crown, and one that has more right to it. And beſides, the Whigs ſtill affirm, (and you <hi>dare</hi> not deny it) that for theſe reaſons there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral that <hi>actually</hi> undertook the Job, and I know not that their deſigns or principles are yet changed. But I care not for medling with theſe Edge-tools: let's paſs to the power and priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; tis ſafe enough to ſpeak freely there, for <hi>mortui non mordent.</hi>

               <p>As for the <hi>power</hi> of Parliaments, The Houſe of Commons are <hi>as much</hi> ſubjects to the King <hi>joyntly</hi> at <hi>ſeverally</hi> (N. 131.) They are made choice of <hi>by</hi> ſubjects, to repreſent <hi>as</hi> ſubjects.

               <p>The ſumm of what you ſay is this, That the Houſe of Commons have no more power, than thoſe that choſe them. Now I am not of your mind: Nor is there any correſpondence between Free-holders and a Houſe of Commons, and a Principal and his Truſtee. For a Principal can both pitch upon the <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>limit</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of his Truſtee: but ſo cannot the Free-holders, of their Repreſentatives in Parliament. For though they elect the <hi>Perſons,</hi> yet the <hi>Power</hi> is from the Law; and can neither be enlarged nor abridged by the Electors. You know, no ſubject has pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Life or Eſtate of his fellow-ſubject: And yet when twelve are elected or nominated by the Sheriff, they have a greater power than the King himſelf in depriving a man of either; which they have not from their <hi>Elector,</hi> but from the <hi>Law.</hi>

               <p>If we ſhould grant that, it would come ſtill to the ſame thing; for the King muſt owe it to the Law, that he can give ſuch a power.

               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis only the very ſame caſe. For as the King gives the Sheriff power to nominate the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who after their Impannelling have a power, which neither he that nominated them gave them, nor themſelves have ſingly and apart: ſo by the ſeveral Writs directed to be proclaim'd by the Sheriffs, Bailiffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the King gives the people a power to Elect Members for Parliament, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing return'd, and aſſembl'd in the Houſe, are by the Law and Conſtitution of the Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in a power which neither their Electors have, nor themſelves had before they were ſo aſſembled. They have not ſuch a power indeed as Jurors have, but they have a power that is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> to them, AS they are one of the three Eſtates in Parliament.</p>

               <p>Well, but with all this, what kind of power is this theſe <hi>Commons</hi> have, ſeeing the King is the SOLE Soveraign, and they are only to do <hi>their</hi> part toward the furniſhing of <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> for <hi>New Laws</hi> where they are <hi>Defective?

               <p>'Tis true, the King has a Negative Voice; but conſider it well, and 'tis no more than what either Houſe have. For let the Commons paſs a Bill, and the Lords can reject it; and on the contrary; though the rejecting Houſe know that the King ſo much favour the Bill, that he would moſt certainly paſs it into an Act, if they would but give their conſent to it. So that it is evident the conſent of either Houſe is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to the making of an Act, as the King's is. And indeed the uſual preface to all Acts evidences this plainly, <hi>viz.

The <hi>four Inns of Court them ſelves</hi> are not able to determine what they are (<hi>N.</hi> 132.)

               <p>You were once indeed pretty near being laid by the heels; but all the cunning's in catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But what ſignifies it what <hi>you</hi> had <hi>rather?</hi> I think there is no neceſſity to be made <hi>ſlaves</hi> either to <hi>prerogative</hi> or <hi>priviledge,</hi> which are both uſeful and wholſome enough when they do not exceed their bounds. Now ſeeing neither you nor <hi>your four Inns of Court</hi> can tell what theſe priviledges are, or upon what they are bottom'd, I'll tell you
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57775:12"/>
my opinion. I think <hi>they</hi> ſtand much upon the ſame terms with <hi>Prerogative, part</hi> of which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>expreſs Law,</hi> and <hi>part</hi> has no other foundation, but <hi>Preſcription;</hi> (the Kings and Queens of this Realm having exerciſed ſuch a power in ſuch and ſuch caſes, time out of mind:) and this part of the Prerogative I look to be as firm as the other. For preſcription or <hi>Common uſage,</hi> (time out of mind) is <hi>Common Law</hi> in all caſes. Nor is there any reaſon why the Sovereign ſhould not enjoy the benefit of that Maxime as well as the meaneſt ſubject, nor why the Houſe of Commons ſhould not enjoy it as well as either. 'Tis true, both <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Priviledge</hi> may be ſtrained too far, or ſomething may be <hi>call'd</hi> ſo, that <hi>is</hi> not ſo: but ſhall we therefore deny there are any ſuch things, or turn them into ridicule? It ſignifies lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle what <hi>you</hi> ſhall deny to be <hi>priviledge,</hi> or <hi>I</hi> to be <hi>prerogative:</hi> for I doubt the King will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a more competent Judge of the one, and the Parliament of the other.</p>

               <p>Let them think what they pleaſe, but it does not ſtand with the Conſtitution of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to ſuppoſe them to be competent Judges of their own priviledges: For it is an abandoning of the very <hi>eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> to their Mercy.

               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis as much, for <hi>my</hi> purpoſe, to the one as to the other. For though they be two Houſes, they are but one Parliament, and have community of priviledges. And origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they were but one Houſe. This, Sir <hi>Edw. Cook,</hi> while he was Speaker of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> has made out for me, <q>At firſt we were all one Houſe and ſate together, but the Commons ſitting in preſence of the King and amongſt the Nobles diſliked it, and found fault that they had not free liberty to ſpeak. And upon this reaſon, that they might ſpeak more freely, being out of the Royal ſight of the King, and not amongſt the great Lords ſo far their Betters, the Houſe was divided and came to ſit aſunder. A bold and worthy Knight at the time when this was ſought, (the King deſiring a reaſon of this their requeſt, and why they would remove themſelves from their Betters) anſwered ſhortly, That his Majeſty and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles being every one a great perſon repreſented but themſelves; but the Commons though they were but inferiour men, yet every one of them repreſented a thouſand of men. And this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was well allowed of. But now though we be divided in Seat, be we therefore divided Houſes? No; for if any writ of Error be brought, as you ſhall ſee a notable Caſe in 22 <hi>E.</hi> 3. this Writ muſt be returned in Parliament, that is, to the <hi>whole Houſe,</hi> and chiefly to the Upper Houſe, for We are but a Limb of the Houſe. Never any Man ſaw a writ returnable in the Lower Houſe;—Yet I ſpeak not this, to take any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57775:14"/>
from this Houſe; for—it is certain, whatſoever we do ſitting the Parliament, it is an Act of the whole Court; for the Lords without the Commons, and the Commons without the Lords, can do nothing.] <hi>Vid.</hi> Journ. of Parl. of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> page 515, 516.</q> You ſee here what unity and conſent there is between the two Houſes, ſo that one can have no priviledge, in which the other is not intereſted. Judgments indeed upon Writs of Errour are given by the Lords, but being the Writs are returned in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the ſentence is <hi>conſtructively</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons alſo, unleſs one would be ſo abſurd as to call the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as ſome do the <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi> But to make this plainer yet: You know the Upper Houſe has no Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Lower, ſo as to take cognizance of any thing tranſacted therein, otherwiſe than by deſiring Conference; and that the Lower Houſe has as well over the Upper: but in both caſes it is improperly called Juriſdiction: for at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, he that can ſhew the plaineſt Precedents or the moſt convincing Arguments, carries the thing in diſpute: or if either ſide be obſtinate, 'tis juſt ſo good and ſo good, the other may take its courſe, proteſt againſt the proceeding, and then ſit down and be quiet.</p>

               <p>Well, but this is nothing to the purpoſe; for if, for all this, the Parliament ſhall affirm that the <hi>Militia</hi> belongs to them, and they be the ſole Judges of their own priviledges, the ſame things may be acted over again.</p>

               <p>No, they cannot, for all that. For not to mention the <hi>improbability,</hi> nay moral <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> of the Parliaments <hi>pretending</hi> to a power which ſo <hi>recent</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> an Act has declar'd to be in the King; yet though they ſhould be ſo groſsly unreaſonable and bare-fac'dly factious, the Kings <hi>prerogative</hi> is able to cope with them. And this Prerogative <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt gave away when he aſſented to the Act of <hi>Perpetuity;</hi> in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of which if he ſhew'd <hi>little Policy,</hi> they ſhew'd <hi>leſs gratitude</hi> in making ſo bad an uſe of ſo redundant a Grace. But if the King will give away his Prerogative, who can help it? And if He will give the Parliament leave <hi>to ſit as long as</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57775:16"/>
                  <hi>they pleaſe,</hi> he gives away the only Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>priviledge.</hi> For though the King cannot <hi>determine</hi> of their priviledges, ſo as to <hi>ſentence this</hi> to be one, and <hi>that</hi> not: Yet he can do as much as this comes to, he can <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue</hi> or <hi>diſſolve</hi> the Parliament whenever he ſees reaſon for it, and that puts an end both to <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>Priviledges.</hi> And this is the <hi>incomparable</hi> Conſtitution of our Government! If it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there lay a gap open either for arbitrary power on the King's ſide, or for uſurpation on the Parliament's. For if the <hi>King</hi> might <hi>determine</hi> what were the Power and Priviledges of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, we might ſoon have a Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> and if <hi>They</hi> might ſit as long as they pleaſe, they would even be the high and mighty States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the King but a <hi>Stadtholder,</hi> or if you will a <hi>Staff-holder.</hi> But 'tis beſt as 'tis; and ſo long as the King ſhall be ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> as to keep what is his own, and ſo <hi>gracious</hi> as to deſire no more, 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe on one ſide or t'other. And therefore to make a <hi>Cuckow's</hi> ſong of <hi>Fourty one,</hi> may indeed betray ſomething of your own <hi>nature,</hi> but it ſignifies no more to the purpoſe you Chant it, than <hi>baculus in angulo.</hi>

               <p>Come, Sir, you are <hi>too</hi> ſharp upon me.

               <p>Truly, as to their doing what they are <hi>Sent</hi> for, I believe the Whigs will not be much againſt it. But then I doubt, if they do no more, the King would many times come ſhort of Money. For the greater number of the Electors who are they that <hi>ſend</hi> them, do commonly (as moſt other men do) love their money ſo well, that they care not how little of that they part with, nor how <hi>ſaving a bargain</hi> they make for removal of their <hi>grievances.</hi> And as for other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides raiſing of Money, I do not believe that any of <hi>us Tories</hi> do much care for their receiving or following the Inſtructions of thoſe that chuſe them, ever ſince the Members that were ſent to <hi>Oxford</hi> were <hi>documented</hi> by their Electors.

               <p>And if they be <hi>not,</hi> Liberty and Propertv are finely ſecur'd!

               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Then you ſhould have taken no notice of the <hi>charge</hi> at all; and ſo our party could have vapour'd it out, as if you ſlighted it for it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency: but now you have given it a caſt of your Office to <hi>ſo</hi> little purpoſe, you cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how they are dampt.

thoſe were Rebels, does it follow that others <hi>would</hi> raiſe ſuch a Rebellion if they <hi>could,</hi> nay or <hi>could</hi> if they <hi>would?</hi> 'Pray remember what I ſaid before, when I was Mr. <hi>Whig.</hi> In the <hi>next</hi> place you are but too injurious to his Majeſty, to faſten on <hi>Him</hi> all the Miſcarriages and male-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as if it were impoſſible for the King that has ſo many ſervants, to have a good opinion of, and commit a truſt to, a bad man. Nay and you ſtretch this ſo <hi>high,</hi> or rather ſo <hi>low,</hi> that a fellow cannot reflect on halfa dozen Printers Hawkers, but preſently you cry, the King is wounded through <hi>their</hi> ſides. If you hold on, I believe a man ſhall not call a Scullion wench of the King's Kitchin, <hi>dirty Slut,</hi> or his Corn-cutter, <hi>pitiful fellow,</hi> but you'l call it <hi>arraigning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> You know 'tis impoſſible the King ſhould attend all the affairs of State himſelf, He muſt neceſſarily ſee many things with other folks eyes, and hear them with others ears; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if things be miſrepreſented to him, he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed act otherwiſe than he would if he were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform'd: but He is ſo far from being worthy to be blam'd for ſuch acting, that thoſe that were the evil adviſers, ought rather to be doubly puniſhed, <hi>partly</hi> for the thing it ſelf of which <hi>they</hi> are <hi>truly</hi> the Authors, and <hi>much more</hi> for abuſing his Majeſty by their evil ſuggeſtions.

Thus when he goes about to prove that Kings cannot claim their Crowns by right of <hi>Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> from the frequent changes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the ſame Nation, whereby ſuch lineal ſucceſſion is every where interrupted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prove this asks, <q>In how many Kingdoms has force and violence and the longeſt ſword ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled an abſolute Monarchy? how oft has that yoke been ſhak't off, and the Government turn'd into a Free State? How many different Models of both Monarchies and States <hi>Are</hi> there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57775:20"/>

               <p>Well, but there is one point I have han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dl'd to purpoſe, (both <hi>N.</hi> 132. and 135.) that to imagin the death of the <hi>Preſumptive heir,</hi> is <hi>Treaſon.</hi>

               <p>Truly Sir, you ſeem not <hi>over</hi>-confident of what you have done as to that, for you ſay you will not deliever it for <hi>Law as a Lawyer,</hi> but ſhould be glad to be better informed. <hi>(ibid.)</hi> Now Sir, you have been told already, that my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> delivers it for <hi>Law as a Lawyer</hi> (though <hi>you</hi> will <hi>not</hi> the contrary) that a <hi>Collateral Heir</hi> is <hi>not</hi> within the Stat of 25 <hi>E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 3. that makes the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the death of the King's <hi>eldeſt Son and Heir</hi> to be Treaſon. But methinks you are like ſome Philoſophers, that undertake to ſolve <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that never were in Nature. Before you had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſuch pains to prove the <hi>preſumptive Heir</hi> to

ſtand upon equal ground with the <hi>King's Son and Heir,</hi> ſo as to make that which is Treaſon to the one, to be ſo to the other; I ſay you would have done well to have firſt made it out, that <hi>his death was imagin'd.</hi> For I do not find, by any Overt Act, that your Adverſary has imagin'd any ſuch thing.</p>

               <p>Why, has he not call'd him <hi>Traytor,</hi> and proteſted <hi>He ſhall not Reign over</hi> him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Herac.</speaker>
               <p>Not that I know not of. He calls ſuch an one indeed a <hi>Traytor,</hi> as ſhall <hi>murder</hi> the King or force him to <hi>reſign,</hi> and I think he does not call him out of his name: but 'tis <hi>you</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this of the <hi>preſumptive Heir;</hi> which if one ſhould <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> to be his true meaning, yet would not his proteſtation, that ſuch an one <hi>ſhall not reign over Him,</hi> be an imagining his death; for 'twere but for him and his thouſands he talks of, to ſlip over into <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt were made good.</p>
