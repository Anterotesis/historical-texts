            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

king of Rome, the first Moneth of
the yéere. For <hi>Romulus</hi> his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
the first king of Rome, began
his yere in March consecrating this
Moneth vnto his supposed Father
<hi>Mars:</hi> for at this time the Romans
had but ten moneths in their yéere,
called <hi>Annus Romuli</hi> after <hi>Romulus</hi> time. Ianuary and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary
were added to <hi>Romulus</hi> yéeres by <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> to
make the yéere twelue moneths. Ianuary he dedicated to God
<hi>Ianus,</hi> and caused it to bee the first moneth in the yeere amongst
the Romanes, making March to be the third moneth. For <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
preferred peace before warre, and ciuill things before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
and therefore <hi>Ianus</hi> was set before <hi>Mars,</hi> for were this
<hi>Ianus</hi> either king or demy-God, he was in former age very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and politike, of whom the Romans brag most: for hee had
temples, altars, sacrifices, and ceremonies done to him this
moneth. In the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> the Consuls, the Senators,
all the Magistrates of Rome should solemnly méete to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb facs="tcp:9233:5"/>
and to consult about wars or dangers of the Citie when
occasion so serued. By the temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> it was knowne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Romanes were in warres or in peace: if it were open
as alwaies it was, it signified wars, if it were shut, which was
neuer but thrée times, once in <hi>Numa Pomp.</hi> time, the second
time in <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> and the third after <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi>
triumphed ouer Hierusalem, then it signified peace, if there the
Senators and Magistrates of Rome had agreed vpon wars,
one of the Consuls should goe presently to the temple of <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and take a speare in his hande, and flourish with the speare
before the Altar of <hi>Bellona,</hi> and thereby pronounced warres
in the Romanes behalfe. <hi>Genial. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>All Calendes which is the first day of euerie moneth, was
consecrated to <hi>Iuno,</hi> and the Ides to <hi>Iupiter</hi> by the Romanes.
For in the Calendes of Ianuary, the king called <hi>Rex sacrorum,</hi>
and the priestes called <hi>Flamines,</hi> vsed to offer vp in sacrifice to
<hi>Iuno</hi> a lambe or a yoong dooue for good successe of that moneth:
for euerie first day of euerie moneth they vse the like sacrifice

as the Greekes were wont to do to <hi>Bacchus</hi> the feast of <hi>Lenaea</hi>
the same day, with all due solemne ceremonies belonging vnto

in hir sacrifice: of all married women and of yoong
women, which were to be married, they should come vnto the
temple of <hi>Iuno</hi> to make their supplication to their Goddesse, to
remoue all bitternes and choler from that present sacrifice, and
to bury all displeasure and offences which might moue <hi>Iuno</hi> to

the greatest pompe solemnized, and the greatest glorie finished,
that it was counted one of the roialest and greatest triumphes,
which if I should set foorth the dignitie, with the solemnitie and
pompe thereof, I should be tedious, howbeit I haue set diuerse
triumphes downe in order and manner as they were solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
by the which you may proportion these last triumphes, by
the dignitie of the other triumphes so set foorth, and yet some
triumphes farre exceeded others, according to the greatnesse
