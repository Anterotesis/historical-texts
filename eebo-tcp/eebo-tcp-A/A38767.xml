            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Kneeling?</head>
               <p>THe Resolution of the most weighty and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Doubts which may in point of Conscience
arise about this matter (and do at present much
influence the minds and practices of many honest and
well-meaning Dissenters) will depend upon the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these following Queries.</p>
               <p>1. Whether Kneeling in the Act of Receiving the
Holy Sacrament according to the Law of the Land, be
not contrary to some express Law of Christ obliging to
the observance of a different Posture?</p>
               <p>2. Whether Kneeling be not a deviation from that
example which our Lord set us at the first Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>3. Whether Kneeling be not altogether Unsutable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52296:3"/>
and Repugnant to the nature of the Sacrament, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Table-Gesture?</p>
               <p>4. Whether Kneeling Commanded in the Church of
<hi>England</hi> be not contrary to the general Practice of the
Church of Christ in the first and purest Ages?</p>
               <p>5. Whether it be Unlawful for us to receive Kneeling
because this Gesture was first introduced by Idolaters,
and is still notoriously abused by the Papists to Idolatrous
ends and purposes.</p>
               <p>1. Whether Kneeling in the Act of Receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
in Obedience to the Law of the Land, be not a
Transgression against some express Law of Christ which
obliges us to observe another Gesture?</p>
               <p>For satisfaction in this Point, our onely recourse must
be to the Holy Scriptures contained in the Books of
the New Testament, wherein the whole body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Laws delivered and enacted by our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
are collected and recorded by the Holy Ghost.
And if there be any Command there extant concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the use of any particular Gesture in the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Lord's Supper, we shall upon a diligent
enquiry be sure to find it. But before I give in my
Answer, I readily grant thus much by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
Whatsoever is enjoyned and appointed by God
to be prepetually used by all Christians throughout all
Ages without any alteration, that can never be nullified
or altered by any Earthly Power or Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
When once the Supreme Lawgiver and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World hath any ways signified and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that such and such positive Laws shall be perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unalterably observed, then those Laws (though
in their own nature and with respect to the subject
matter of them they be changeable) must remain in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52296:3"/>
full Force, and can admit of no Change from the Laws
of Men. It would be a piece of intolerable Pride,
and the most daring Presumption, for any Earthly
Prince, any Council, any Societie of Men whatsoever,
to oppose the known Will of the Soveraign Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth. In this Case nothing can take off the
Force and Obligation of such Laws, but the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authoritie which first passed them into Laws. Thus
much being granted and premised, I return this Answer
to the Question proposed.</p>
               <p>God hath been so far from establishing the unalterable
use of any particular Gesture in the Act of Receiving,
that among all the Sacred Records of his Will, there
is not any express Command to determine our practice
one way or other. We are left perfectly at our libertie
by God to use what comely Gesture we please, either
Sitting,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> the Case of Indifferent things.</note> Kneeling, or Standing. And if the Law of the
Land did not restrain our libertie, we might use any of
the forementioned Gestures, without the least violation
of any Law of God. This perhaps at first sight may seem
very strange and false to many of our Dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
who have been taught to believe otherwise; and
it may be (to judge Charitably) their Teachers and
Pastours have in this particular been imposed on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by the Writings and Assertions of other Men
whose Persons they have had in great admiration. But
yet I am so secure of this Truth, that I challenge
all the World to produce the Chapter and Verse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
any Command is given for the use of any particular
Gesture at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper. That
Popish Principle of believing as the Church believes,
and swallowing all for Gospel which she affirms to be
so, though very mischievous in its consequence, is not
so Popish, that is, so ill, as to pin our Faith on the Sleeves
of particular Men, and relying barely on the word and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52296:4"/>
credit of any one Man whom we highly esteem, of
what Party or Perswasion soever. For this is to create a
Pope to our selves, and make every Man whom we
phansie infallible; this is to make two more than six,
and the Authority of one Man outweigh the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church, that is a Society of Men who are
nothing near so liable to deception. I don't desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be trusted by any means in the matter under
present consideration; and therefore I would have the
Reader to observe this Rule: Trust no Mans Eyes or
Judgment where you are able to use your own, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the example of the <hi>Bereans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 17. 11.</note> so highly commended
by St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this very account; that is, to make an
ingenuous enquiry into the Truth of things, to search
the Scriptures whether these things be so as I say and
assert. If this course were generally followed, it would
go a great way towards the composing those differences,
and curing those divisions that at present are on foot
amongst us, occasioned by several Tenets and Opinions
about matters of Religion. By this means, a great many
which pass for Divine Oracles and Doctrines, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be no other than the whimsies and inventions of
Men. With this cautionary advice I might fairly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
this Question as being fully Answered, and leave all
my Readers to disprove me if they can.</p>
               <p>But because some may pretend they have not Leisure,
and others want of Skill, and others are not endued
with Patience enough to search and examine this matter
throughly as it ought, I will yield all the Charitable as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
I am able towards their relief, by doing the
work to their hands. My Business then at present is
this, to Collect and Present to your view all those places
which relate to the Sacrament, and are most likely to
inform us what our Lord by his Institution and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath obliged us to. And certainly if there be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52296:4"/>
any Command which tyes us up to the use of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Gesture, Sitting suppose or Standing, and not
Kneeling, we shall find it in one or other of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
who give us a perfect Narrative of the whole
Mind and Will of Christ in all matters necessary to
Faith and Salvation: Let us therefore bring them under
a strict examination.<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26.</note> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> gives this account of
the whole matter: <hi>As they were eating, Jesus took Bread,
and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the Disciples,
and said,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Take, eat; this is my Body. And he took the
Cup, and gave Thanks, and gave it to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Drink
ye all of it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>For this is my Blood of the New Testament,
which is shed for many for the Remission of Sins.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>But I
say unto you, I will not Drink henceforth of this Fruit of
the Vine, until that day when I Drink it new with you in
my Fathers Kingdom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>And when they had Sung an Hymn,
they went out into the Mount of</hi> Olives. Much to the
same purpose is the account which St. <hi>Mark</hi> gives of this
matter.</p>
               <p>And as they did eat,<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 22.</note> Jesus took Bread, and blessed, and
brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat; this is my
Body.<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> And he took the Cup, and when he had given
Thanks, he gave it to them, and they all Drank of it.
And he said unto them,<note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> This is my Bloud of the New
Testament,<note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> which is shed for many. Verily I say unto you,
I will Drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, until that
day that I Drink it new in the Kingdom of God.<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> And
when they had Sung a Hymn, they went out into the
Mount of <hi>Olives. And this is the sum of what Saint</hi>
Mark <hi>delivers concerning the Lord's Supper. Saint</hi>
Luke <hi>with very little variation thus describes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he took Bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and gave Thanks, and brake it, and
gave unto them, saying, This is my Body which is given for
you;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>this do in Remembrance of me. Likewise also the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52296:5"/>
Cup after Supper saying, This Cup is the New Testament in my
Bloud, which is shed for you.</hi> This Evangelist indeed makes
mention of another Cup which our Lord took, and after
he had blessed it, he said to his Disciples, <hi>Take this, and
divide it among your selves;</hi> and withal told them that
he would not Drink of the Fruit of the Vine until the
Kingdom of God should come; which Cup plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to the Passover,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> on Mat. 26. 26.</note> as will appear to any one who will
consult and compare the 15, 16, 17, and 18. Verse of
the fore-mentioned Chapter; and is supposed to be
that Cup wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to begin the
Paschal Feast,<note place="margin">Horae Heb. &amp; Talmud.</note> which they Blessed or Consecrated in this
Form of words: Blessed be God who Created the
Fruit of the Vine. And whereas our Lord saith he will
Drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, his meaning
is, that he would never Celebrate the Feast of the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with them any more after that time, but their next
Festival Meeting should be in Heaven: and this is very
consistent with our Lord's Drinking another Cup after
this, which he Consecrated to another use and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the Sacrament, Ver. 20. And this is all the
light this Divine Writer affords us concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Rites and Ceremones which our Lord used him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the Institution of the Sacrament, and established for
the use of all Christians in all succeeding Ages.</p>
               <p>As for St. <hi>John,</hi> he makes no mention at all of the
Institution of this Holy Feast by our Lord. All that
can be collected from his Writings relates to the Passover,
or,<note place="margin">John 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from Ver. 1. to 31. vid. Hor. Heb. Tal. p. 300. and Mat. 26. 6.</note> according to the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> to what past
between Christ and his Disciples at a common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
meal in <hi>Bethany,</hi> and that for this reason, among
many others judiciously urged by him, because the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
thought when our Lord had said to him, Ver. 27.
<hi>That thou doest do quickly,</hi> that he had given order to
<hi>Judas</hi> who kept the bag, to buy those things that they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52296:5"/>
had need of against the Feast, <hi>viz.</hi> the Passover; and
therefore all those passages, and that discourse related
by St. <hi>John</hi> in the foregoing Verses of that Chapter, were
transacted at an ordinary and common Supper. And
indeed this seems to be the great end and design which
St. <hi>John</hi> proposed to himself in writing his Gospel, and
which throughout he constantly pursues, <hi>viz.</hi> To add
out of his own Knowledge several remarkable passages
(especially such as tend to demonstrate the Divinity
of our Saviour) as had been omitted by the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
in their History of the Birth, Life, Actions
and Sufferings of our Blessed Saviour. There is another
passage in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel,<note place="margin">John 5. 53.</note> which in the Judgment of
many Learned Divines both Ancient and Modern, hath
respect to the Lord's Supper, though not at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
when those mysterious words were uttered by
our Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except ye Eat the Flesh of the Son of Man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>and Drink
his Blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso Eateth my Flesh,
and Drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal Life, and I will raise
him up at the last day.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>For my Flesh is meat indeed, and
my Blood is drink indeed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>He that Eateth my Flesh, and
Drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> Now all
that can be inferr'd from these words, as they relate to
this Holy Feast, is onely thus much: that it's highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for all Christians (who have an opportunity to
do it) to partake of the Lord's Supper, as they would
partake in the merits of his Sacrifice, and the Efficacy
of his Death and his Sufferings; and that none but such
as do receive the tokens and signs of his Body broken,
and Blood shed for their Sins, shall be owned and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him as his Friends. These are all the places
that we meet with in the Gospel; let us now see what
is delivered in the <hi>Acts</hi> and other Writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and Divinely-inspired Authors. Among all their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52296:6"/>
Writings there is but one place which gives any account
of the History of the Sacrament, and Institution of it,
and that is in the 1 Epist. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 11.
where St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, that what he delivered to them,
he received by immediate Revelation from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>viz.<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> That the Lord Jesus the same night in which
he was betrayed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>took Bread; and when he had given Thanks,
he brake it, and said, Take, eat, this is my Body which is
broken for you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>this do in Remembrance of me. After the
same manner he took the Cup when he had Supped, saying,
This Cup is the New Testament in my Bloud: this do, as oft
as ye Drink it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>in Remembrance of me. For as often as
ye eat this Bread, and Drink this Cup, ye do shew (or
shew ye) the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> There are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other places wherein the Holy Sacrament is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 16, 21.</note> and described by several Names and Titles sutable
to the nature and ends of it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 20.</note> which for brevity sake
I omit,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 46.</note> and desire the Reader to consult at his leisure;<note place="margin">Acts 20. 7.</note>
and I would not put him to that trouble, if they did
contain any thing that made against Kneeling, or that
lookt like a command for the use of any other Gesture.
Let us now look back a little upon the places forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
and see what our Lord hath ordained and appointed
to be of perpetual use in his Church.</p>
               <p>The Apostles and Disciples of our Lord, at the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Sacrament, were the Representatives of the
whole Church; and are to be considered under a double
capacity. Either as Governours and Ministers entrusted
by Christ with the Power of dispensing and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
the Sacrament, or as ordinary and lay Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</p>
               <p>If we consider them as Governours and Stewards of
the Mysteries, their Duty to which they are obliged by
the express command of their Lord, is to take the Bread
into their Hands, to bless and consecrate it to that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52296:6"/>
mysterious and Divine use to which he designed it, to
break it, to give it to the Communicants, as he gave it
them: And so in like manner to Take the Cup, to bless
it, to give it to their fellow-Christians.</p>
               <p>That which they were obliged to do by the command
of our Lord, considered as private Men, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with all believers, was to take and receive the
Consecrated Elements of Bread and Wine, to eat and
Drink, and to do all this in Commemoration of his
wonderful Love in giving his Body to be broken and
his Blood to be shed for the Sins of the World.</p>
               <p>And what the least Syllable or Shadow of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is there here in all this History, for the use of any
Gesture in the Act of Receiving? Since then the Holy
Scripture is altogether silent as to this matter, its silence
is a full and clear demonstration that Kneeling is not
repugnant to any express Command of our Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no Gesture was ever Commanded at all: And
this hath been ingenuously Confessed in writing by a
great Enemy to Kneeling,<note place="margin">A Manuscript of an unknown Author, cited by Mr. <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,</hi> p. 48.</note> and a great Advocate for Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<hi>That the Gesture of Sitting is but a matter of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and not expresly Commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ministers Assembled at <hi>Perth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> affirm
that when our Lord at the Institution Commanded his
Disciple to do this, he did by those words Command
them to use that Gesture which he used at that time, as
well as to Take, Eat, Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Force of their
Argument lies in this, if it have any force at all: Our
Saviour Sate at the Passover,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 20.</note> as the Scriptures plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us;<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 18.</note> and it is to be supposed he continued in the
same posture when he instituted and Administred
the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 14.</note> which was at the close of the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
therefore <hi>Do this</hi> relates to, and includes the
Gesture amongst other things. But this is a miserable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52296:7"/>
shift, which tends to Sink rather than Support their
Cause.</p>
               <p>For first,<note place="margin">Answ. I.</note> If our Lord did Sit when he Administred
the Sacrament (which we will suppose at present) yet
there is no reason in the World to incline us to think,
that he intended by those words, <hi>Do this,</hi> to oblige us
to observe his Gesture onely, and not several other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
which he observed at the same time. Since
Christ hath not restrained and interpreted these words
<hi>Do this</hi> so that they should onely respect Sitting as he
did, why should we not think our selves obliged to do
all that he did at the same time, as well as this? For
example, If these words may be interpreted thus, <hi>Do
this,</hi> that is, Sit as Christ did, why not thus also, <hi>Do
this,</hi> that is, celebrate the Sacrament in an upper Room,
in a private House, late at night or the Evening, after
a full Supper,<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 26. 20.</note> in the Company of 11 or 12 at most,
and they onely Men,<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 17.</note> with their Heads Covered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the custom of those Countries,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 14.</note> and with unleavened
Bread? There lyeth as great an Obligation upon all
Christians to observe all these Circumstances in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Lord by vertue of these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> as
there doth to Sit. So that this Argument violently recoils
upon those that urge it, and proves a great deal more
than they are willing to have it. It concludes strongly
against their own Practices, and the liberty they take
in omitting some things, and pressing the necessary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of others, upon a reason which equally obliges
to all.</p>
               <p>But I desire our Dissenting Brethren (who may be
of the same Perswasion with these <hi>Scotch</hi>-men) to take
this further consideration along with them;<note place="margin">Answ. II.</note> which I
think will turn the Scales, and make deep impressions
upon tender Consciences, and oblige them to observe
most of the other Circumstances which they omit,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52296:7"/>
rather than this of Sitting, which they so earnestly
press and contend for. All those forementioned Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
(except the two Last, which too are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allowed among Learned Men on all sides) are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned in the Gospel, and were without dispute
observed by Christ at the Institution of the Sacrament:
But the particular Gesture used by him at that time, is not
expresly mentioned; and what it was, is very disputable
and dubious, as I shall evince by and by under the
second Query.</p>
               <p>How then can any Man think himself obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
by the force of these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> to do what
Christ is no where expresly said to do, and not obliged
to do what the Scripture affirms he really did? Why
that which is dark and dubious should be made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Rule of Conscience, and that which is plainly and
evidently set down in Scripture should have no force, nor
be esteemed any Rule at all: These are Questions, I
confess, beyond my capacity, and surpassing my skill
to resolve.</p>
               <p>It's clear from St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the forecited place,<note place="margin">Answ. III.</note> that
those words of our Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23, 4, 5, 6, 27, 28. Verses.</note> 
                  <hi>Do this,</hi> do respect onely the
Bread and Wine, which signify the Body and Bloud of
Christ, and those other actions there specified by him,
which are essential to the right and due celebration of
that Holy Feast. For when it's said, <hi>Do this in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me;</hi> and, <hi>This do ye as oft as ye Drink it
in Remembrance of me;</hi> and, <hi>As oft as ye Eat this
Bread, and Drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lords Death
till he come;</hi> it's plain that <hi>Do this</hi> must be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Sacramental Actions there mentioned, and
not extended to the Gesture, of which the Apostle
speaks not a word. Our Lord Instituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Remembrance of his Death and Passion, and
not in Remembrance of his Gesture in Administring it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52296:8"/>
And consequently, <hi>Do this</hi> is a general Command,
obliging us onely to such particular Actions and Rites
as he had Instituted, and made necessary to be used
in order to this great end, <hi>viz.</hi> to signify and represent
his Death, and that Bloudy Sacrifice which he offered
to his Father, on the Cross, for us miserable Sinners.
Upon the whole matter, I think, we may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there is not a tittle of a Command in the
whole New Testament to oblige us to receive the Lords
Supper in any particular Posture; and if any be so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
after all, as not to receive it in any other Gesture
but what is expresly Commanded, they must never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it as long as they live: And then I leave this to
their serious consideration, How they will be ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to excuse their neglect of a known necessary duty
(such as receiving the Sacrament is) before God the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who loved us so much
as to send his Son to be a propitiation for our Sins:
How they will ever Answer to their Crucified Saviour
their Living and Dying in the breach of an express
Command of his given a little before his Passion to <hi>Do
this in Remembrance of him,</hi> meerly because the Gesture
prescribed by Authority was cross to their private
Wills and Phansies, but not to the Mind and Will of
God.</p>
               <p>2. For the further proof and Confirmation of this
Assertion, that there is no express Command in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for the use of any particular Gesture in the Act
of receiving the Sacrament, I will appeal to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Practice of our Dissenting Brethren, and all the
Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. To begin with our Non-conforming Brethren.
There are a great many Serious and Sincere-Hearted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52296:8"/>
persons among them, who profess that (were they left
to their liberty; and not tyed up by the Law to Kneel
at the Sacrament) they could with a safe Conscience
use that Gesture as well as any other. And they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tell us, that they are willing and ready to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with us, provided we would Administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to them either Sitting or Standing, that is, any way
but that which is imposed by Law. For the Rule by
which they conduct their Consciences in this matter, is
this: Things in their own nature indifferent, which are no
where Commanded or prohibited by God in Scripture,
cannot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> nor ought not to be restrained and limited by
any Power or Authority of Man: And therefore all such
things which God left free for us to do or not to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin, become sinful to us when imposed by humane
Authority. It's remote from my business to shew how
weak and false a Principle this is, and of what mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
consequences to the Peace of the Church; and for
that reason I will pass it by. But thus much may be
inferr'd from this Tenent to my purpose, that they who
hold and urge it as a reason why they cannot Receive
Kneeling, which otherwise they could safely do, plainly
own, that as to the Gesture, in the Act of receiving, it is
in its own nature Indifferent, and left free by God for us
to use or refuse as we think fit, and by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
that there is no express Command given by
God for the use of any particular Gesture. It could not
be a matter of indifferency to our Dissenting Brethren,
whose Principle this is, if there were no Law of Man to
Kneel at the Sacrament; and now there is such a Law, it
could not be Indifferent to them whether they received
Sitting or Standing, as they profess it is, if there were
any Law of God obliging to the use of any one Gesture
whatsoever.</p>
               <p>2. That there is no express Command in Scripture
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52296:9"/>
for any one Gesture in the Act of Receiving, may be
inferr'd from the Judgment and Practice of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches abroad: Whose Judgment and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
will, I presume, sway much with those who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the Church of <hi>England</hi> as not being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
purged from the Corruptions of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> as other Neighbour-Churches are, and who stood
once engaged in a Solemn Covenant, to reform the
Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> according to the Word
of God and the Pattern of the best Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
               <p>Let us now compare the practice of our Church with
the example of the Protestant Churches abroad, and see
whether she ought to reform the Gesture prescribed at
the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and those of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
and <hi>Helvetia</hi> Stand; the <hi>Dutch</hi> generally Sit; but
in some places (as in West-<hi>Friesland</hi>) they Stand. The
Churches of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> and <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession, which
spread through the large Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
and <hi>Sweden,</hi> through <hi>Norway,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,
Lithuany,</hi> and the Ducal Prussia in <hi>Poland,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate
of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and several other
places and free Cities in that Empire, do for the most
part, if not all of them, retain the Gesture of Kneeling.
The <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches were reformed by <hi>John Husse</hi>
and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who suffered Martyrdom at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
about the year 1416. long before <hi>Luthers</hi> time;
and those of the <hi>Augsburg</hi> or <hi>Augustan</hi> Confessions were
founded and reformed by <hi>Luther,</hi> and were the first
Protestants properly so called. Both these Churches, so
early reformed, and of so large extent, did not only use the
same Gesture that our Church enjoyns at the Sacrament,
but they, together with those of the <hi>Helvetick</hi> Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
did in three general Synods unanimously condemn the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52296:9"/>
Sitting Gesture (though they esteemed it in it self Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
as being Scandalous,<note place="margin">1 At Cracow, Anno. Dom. 1573.</note> for this remarkable reason
<hi>viz.</hi> because it was used by the <hi>Arrians</hi> (as their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
call the <hi>Socinians</hi>) in contempt of our Saviours
Divinity;<note place="margin">2 Petricow or Peterkaw, 1578.</note> who therefore placed themselves as Fellows
with their Lord at his Table.<note place="margin">3 Wladislaw, 1583.</note> And thereupon they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
and exhort all Christians of their Communion <hi>to
change Sitting into Kneeling or Standing, both which Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
we Indifferently leave free according as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of any Church hath obtained, and we approve of their
use without Scandal and Blame.</hi> Moreover they affirm,
<hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hese</hi> Socinians <hi>who deny Christ to be</hi> God, <hi>were the
first that introduced Sitting at the Sacrament into their
Churches, contrary to the Practice of all the Evangelical
Churches in</hi> Europe. Among all these Forreign Churches
of the Reformation, there is but one that I can find which
useth Sitting, and forbids Kneeling, for fear of Bread-Worship:
but yet in that Synod wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Kneeling, they left it to the choice of their
Churches to use Standing, Sitting, or an Ambulatory
Gesture (as the <hi>French</hi> do) and at last conclude thus:<note place="margin">Harmon.</note>
                  <hi>These Articles are setled by mutual Consent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Synods of Holl.</note> 
                  <hi>that if the
good of the Churches require it, they may and ought to be
changed, augmented or diminished.</hi> What now should be
the ground and reason of this variety both in Opinion
and Practice touching the Gesture to be used at the Lords
Supper? Is it to be supposed or imagined that an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Learned and Pious Divines, met together on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to consult how to Reform their Churches according
to the pure Word of God, should through weakness and
inadvertency overlook an express Command of Christ for
the perpetual use of any particular Gesture, if any such
there had been? Or shall we be so uncharitable as to
think that all these eminent Churches wilfully past it
by, and established what was most agreeable to their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52296:10"/>
own Phansies, contrary to the known Will of God
Would they have given liberty to all of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to use several Gestures according to the custom of
their several Churches, if our Lord had tyed them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
but one? Would they declare (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Synod
doth) that what they enjoyned might be altered, if the
good of the Church so required, if so be Sitting had been
expresly Commanded by our Lord, to be used by all
Christians to the end of the World? No undoubtedly,
they would not, we cannot either in reason or Charitie
suppose it.</p>
               <p>The true Principle upon which all these Reformed
Churches built, and by which they are able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
all this seeming difference in this matter, is the very
same with that which the Church of <hi>England</hi> goes
by in her Synods and Convocations, <hi>viz.</hi> That as to
Rites and Ceremonies of an indifferent nature, every
National Church hath Authoritie to institute, change and
abolish them, as they in Prudence and Charitie shall
think most fit, and conducive to the setting forth God's
Glory, the Edification of their People, and the Decent
and Reverend Administration of the Holy
Sacrament.<note place="margin">Vid. Art. 34 observat. of the French and Dutch Divines on the Harmony of Confessions, edit. Geneva 1681. sect. 14. p. 120. <hi>In hoc etiam ritu</hi> (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Kneeling at the Sacr.) <hi>suam cui<expan>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52296:11"/>
First, The particular Gesture used by Christ and his
Apostles at the Institution and Celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
can never be demonstrated so as that the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may surely build upon it. This I shall endeavour
to make good these two ways. First, we have no sure
ground for it in Scripture. Secondly, the Customs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the <hi>Jews</hi> render it very incertain and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable.</p>
               <p>1. All that can be gathered from Scripture amounts
to no more than this,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26.</note> that as they were eating,<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 22.</note> or as
they did eat, as the Phrase is rendred in St. <hi>Mark,
Jesus took Bread and blessed, it and brake it, and gave
it to his Disciples; and he took the Cup (when he had
Supped,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 25.</note> saith St. <hi>Paul; after Supper,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath
it) <hi>and gave Thanks;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and gave it to them, saying, Drink
ye all of it.</hi> Now it's very clear from this account which
the Scripture gives, that our Lord did Institute and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Sacrament to his Disciples, and that they
did Receive it: But whether Sitting, Kneeling, or Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is no where mentioned, nor plainly determined.
It's clear that he Instituted this Holy Feast at the close
of the Paschal Feast, for he took the Bread as they were
Eating, and the Cup when he had Supped; that he did
Celebrate the Passover according to the usual manner of
the <hi>Jews</hi> in those times,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 14.</note> which was in a Discumbing
posture,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the Marg.</note> on Beds placed about the Table, much after the
manner of our lying or leaning upon Couches. Yet
whether, after all, the Apostles Received, or our Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
the Sacrament still Sitting, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as they did at the Passover, is not exprest, nor can
it be certainly concluded from the Word of God. The
utmost strength of their Argument who urge Sitting
in imitation of our Saviours example, can arise to no
more than this: That it's probable our Lord did not alter
the Gesture he used at the Passover, when he Instituted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52296:11"/>
the Sacrament. But who sees not that a probability is
far from a certainty! A thing may be really false, though
it seem likely to be true: And that opinion which is
speculatively probable, may when reduced to practice
become a great Sin and a great Error. Thus to refuse
to Receive the Holy Sacrament Kneeling, and thereby
neglect a known necessary Duty, and not onely so, but to
disturb the Peace, and break the Unity of the Church,
upon a bare probability that our Lord sate, which we
are not, cannot be sure of, is a great fault in all who
are guilty of it. For they appeal to an incertain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
against a plain certain Command, <hi>viz.</hi> to receive
the Tokens and Pledges of our Saviours dying love, and
<hi>to do this in Remembrance of him.</hi> They therefore who
urge the example of Christ for Sitting at the Sacrament,
and as a Plea against Kneeling, would do well first to
make the example appear, and prove that he did Sit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they press a Conformity.</p>
               <p>2. If we consult the Records of <hi>Jewish</hi> Antiquities,
and the Writings of Learned Men both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
concerning the Passover and the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi>
Celebrating it, we shall find that they did not keep to
one and the same Gesture throughout the Solemnity.
For the <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem Talmud, Maimonides</hi> and
<hi>Buxtorf,</hi> do certifie us that they did alter their posture
at the Passover, though the Lying or Leaning posture
was generally and most Religiously used and observed
at this Feast above any other. And the Scripture gives
some hints and intimations of the Truth of what they
deliver.</p>
               <p>1. It was the antient custom of the <hi>Jews</hi> and of those
Eastern Countries at their ordinary Feasts and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
to Wash their Hands and their Feet,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 4. 19. c. 2. 24. 32.</note> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at their Religious Feasts to Wash their Hands of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 2. Mar. 7. 3. Luke 7. 44.</note> At the Passover they Washed their Hands thrice
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52296:12"/>
at least, according to the <hi>Talmudists</hi> and the Authors
forecited.<note place="margin">Tract. Berachoth. Pesachin. <hi>Maimon.</hi> in Chametz. Umatsah. <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag. c. 13.</note> Which Ceremony could not well, nor was
not in all likelyhood performed during their Lying or
Leaning posture on their left sides, as their manner was.
For the reason of their Washing at all, and so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
was, that no legal Impuritie or Uncleanness might
cleave to them, and to signify the great care they took
to keep this Solemn Feast Holy to the Lord. And as
they were Nice and Curious in Purifying and Washing
themselves,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Buxt.</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoga, c. 12. p. 286.</note> so in keeping the Beds, Table, Dishes, and
all other Utensils necessary for this Feast, clean and free
from all pollution too. To Wash so often more than
the Law required, and the general custom of those East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
and hot Countries warranted, was a Pharisaical Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and superstitiously abused by them; and, as such,
it's certain our Lord did not use it; but that he did Wash
sometime before he Eat the Paschal Supper, and after
he had Sat down as the manner was, there is little reason
to doubt: and all that I infer from hence is, that when
he Washed, be it once or twice, he altered his posture,
and in all probabilitie either arose from his Bed and went
to the place where Water and Vessels were prepared
and set for such uses,<note place="margin">Vid. John 2. 6.</note> or had Water brought to him
in a Basin, wherein he Washed either Sitting upright,
or Standing; which are both different from that Gesture
which was peculiar and proper to the Passover. St.
<hi>John,</hi> in Chap. 13. 2, 4, 5. Verses, will explain and
Confirm this Custom we are speaking of. There he tells
us how that <hi>Supper being ended</hi> (that is, in a manner
or almost ended; for by comparing the 12 and 26 and
27 Verses together, we shall find plainly that they had
not quite finished their Supper) <hi>Jesus riseth from Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and laid aside his Garments, and took a Towel
and girded himself; and after that poureth Water into
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52296:12"/>
a Basin, and began to Wash the Disciples Feet.</hi> There
are Learned Men on both sides,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Grot.</hi> in loc.</note> who think all this was
done at the Feast of the Passover,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> on v. 26.</note> and that towards the
close of it when he Instituted the Lords Supper;<note place="margin">Mark. 14. 12.</note> but I
shall wave this, and not insist upon it, because, as I
hinted before, I believe, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>
doth, it was no more then an ordinary or common
meal; and therefore I onely shall conclude thus much
from it, which I think is very probable: That it was
usual with the <hi>Jews</hi> to Wash at their Feasts, and that
in Supper-time: And that our Saviour complyed with
this custom. To Wash the Feet of the Guests was the
Office of Servants, and it was altogether unusual for the
Master of the Feast to do; but our Lord, to set his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
an example of Humility and Charitable condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one to another,<note place="margin">Joh. 13. 14, 15.</note> performs this servile Office himself
towards them; which he might as well have done after
Supper, if it had not been usual to have Washed in Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.
Seeing then it appears partly from Scripture, and
partly from Ancient Monuments of <hi>Jewish</hi> customs,
that the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont both before and at their
Civil and Religious Feasts to Wash, and particularly at
the Passover; then it's very probable our Lord did so
too, and altered his posture as they did; nay it is very
probable that our Lord, to make his Discipels under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what he was about to do, did at the Institution of
this new Feast, the Holy Sacrament of his Body and
Bloud, Wash before it; and having changed the posture
that he was in before at the Eating of the Paschal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
did not resume it, but used a new posture at this
new Festival-Solemnity; but what that was, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>2. At the beginning of the Paschal Feast, the <hi>Jews</hi>
did put themselves into this Discumbing or Leaning
posture, and used it while they Eat and Drank the two
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52296:13"/>
first Cups of Wine (for every Guest was obliged to
Drink four Cups at this Feast) but at the third Cup,<note place="margin">As the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudist and foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Writers testify.</note> called the <hi>Cup of blessing</hi> in their Language, and the
fourth styled <hi>the Song or Psalm-Cup</hi> when they Sung the
Hymn,<note place="margin">Vid. Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> Hor. Heb. 291.</note>
there was no necessity of lying along; and it's
likely our Lord took an opportunity when he took the
third Cup, to change the use and signification of it, and to
Institute the Eucharistical Cup, called by St. <hi>Paul</hi> the
Cup of blessing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>3. Before they Drank of the third Cup, the Master
of the Feast took a piece of Unleavened Bread and brake
it,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist in Ex. 12. 8. 11.</note> and after he had Eat some himself, he offers the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to the rest of the Company, to do the like.
After this he proceeds to take some of the bitter Herbs,
and to dip them in a thick Sawce called by them <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roseth</hi>
(which was formed in the shape of a Brick, to
represent the hard slavery undergone by their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
in the Brick-Kilns of <hi>Egypt)</hi> and commanded
all the Societie to follow his example. Now this was
not done in an inclining posture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Buxt.</hi> Syn. c. 13. p. 300.</note> as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors
teach us; and they give this reason for it, because this
was to put them in mind of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, and
therefore here they stood in all probability, because to eat
Standing was the manner of Slaves,<note place="margin">Pesachin, fol. 37. 2. Hor. Heb. 291, 292.</note> whereas Lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
after a Lordly manner, was in token of that ease
and rest they enjoyed in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of their
redemption from the House of Bondage. So often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as they Eat the bitter Herbs, so often they changed
their Gesture.</p>
               <p>4. Though the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Solemn Feasts used Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbing,
yet in blessing and giving thanks before those
Feasts they were,<note place="margin">In vita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat. p. 663. Col. Allobro. edit. 1613. p. 695.</note> as <hi>Philo</hi> relateth, in a Standing Gesture,
with their Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven. And
therefore it's no way probable that Christ and his Apostles
would continue in their Table-Gesture at the blessing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52296:13"/>
of the Holy Supper, which is an higher Ordinance than
the Passover: Because this would be very unsutable to
so great a Solemnity; Especially too, if Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s
Opinion be true (and it may be so for any thing that
appears to the contrary,) <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ changed the
third Cup at the Passover, called the Cup of blessing, into
the Sacramental Cup; because it was the custom of the
<hi>Jews</hi> then, to alter their Table-Gesture that was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the Passover; and it's highly Improbable that our
Lord would continue in the Table-Gesture contrary to
the General and Currant Custom of the <hi>Jews.</hi> They
that don't think so as I do in this particular, will receive
little advantage by being cross. For if it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that our Lord Sate sometimes when the <hi>Jews</hi> were
wont to Stand, it may equally be supposed that he Stood
sometimes when the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to Sit; and what
becomes of their Argument for Sitting at the Sacrament
after the example of Christ? because that stands built
upon supposition that our Lord Sate at the Passover, as
the <hi>Jews</hi> did, and continued in the same Gesture when
he Instituted the Sacrament, which was before the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal-Solemnity
was over. I will onely observe this brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the way, and then proceed to shut up all upon this
Head.</p>
               <p>That those Nonconformists who cry out so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the Church for Imposing, and her Members
for using a Kneeling Gesture, were very unfortunate in
their choice when they pitcht upon Sitting, and urged it
as the onely necessary Gesture to receive in, in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to our Saviours Practice and Example: Because the
Standing Gesture may be much better maintained and
defended than Sitting, and hath more and greater proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
attending it.</p>
               <p>If therefore variety of Gestures were used by the
<hi>Jews</hi> at the Passover, and it no where appears from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52296:14"/>
Scripture that our Lord did not comply in this matter,
then we cannot know for certain what the particular
Gesture was which Christ used at the Institution of the
Sacrament: it might be Lying along, and it might be
Sitting upright; it might be Standing in an adoring po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
with his hands and eyes lifted up to Heaven; which
is much more probable than either of the former, for the
reasons forementioned: we cannot certainly say which;
and yet we must be certain of one, before we can build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as an Infallible Rule of Conscience. Let it be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
granted to our Brethren who differ from us in this
point, that our Saviour Sate at the Passover, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was Instituted by him before the Paschal Feast
was fully ended, that the Disciples Eat the Sacramental
Bread, and Drank the Sacramental Cup, in the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
as they Eat and Drank at the Passover: What of all
this? how will the necessity of a Sitting Gesture appear
from these premises? Why, thus: Therefore our Lord
Instituted and Administred the Holy Sacrament Sitting,
say they. How doth this follow of course, I ask? Since
they Eat and Drank in several postures at the Paschal
Feast.</p>
               <p>I confess the Argument had been strong, if they could
make it appear, that throughout the whole Solemnity of
the Passover no other Gesture but Sitting was used by
our Lord. But this I am sure can never be done, and
consequently their conclusion can never be good. From
the whole I conclude thus much: Since the example
of our Lord cannot be certainly known in this matter,
our Church cannot be charged for deviating from it:
And consequently, to scruple Conformity to the practice
of our Church, because she doth not Conform to the
practice of Christ which no body can certify us of, is very
Unjust and Unreasonable.</p>
               <p>2. Supposing our Lord did Sit as they will have it,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52296:14"/>
yet his bare example doth not oblige all Christians to a
like Practice.</p>
               <p>1. Because naked examples without some Rule or
Note added to them to signify that it is the mind
and will of God to have them constantly followed and
perpetually Imitated by us, have not the force of
a Law perpetually obliging the Conscience. Thus in
our present Case, though our Lord did Sit at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
yet his example alone doth not become an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Rule for all Ages to observe, because he hath
no where discovered his binding will and pleasure in
this particular. And consequently, since he hath left us
in the Dark, we may act contrary to his will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
when we so zealously press and follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
especially in this matter relating to Gesture. For
even under the Law, where all other Circumstances of
Time, Place, Habits, and the Ceremonies relating to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, were with great particularity described, this
of Gesture was left free and undetermined. God never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
them to use any particular Gesture in any particular
part of his Worship, but left it to their choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Kneel, or Stand, or Bow down their Heads and
Bodies, or fall prostrate on the Earth; to use all, or any
one of these, as Custom and their own Pious Prudence
should prompt and direct them. Seeing then that the
Gesture in the Worship of God was never determined
under the Law: Since it was and is in its own nature
a Mutable Ceremony in the Service of God, it remains
so unto this day: Our Lord left it as he found it, unless
it can be proved that he hath by some Command or
Note of Immutability fixt and determined it to all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages. But because no such Command or Note
is to be found, therefore we are not tyed in Conscience
to a strict Imitation of his Example. A few instances
will clear this point.<note place="margin">Luke 3. 23.</note> Our Lord was not Baptized till
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52296:15"/>
he was about thirty years of Age; but this example
is not esteemed by the generality of Dissenters a Law
or Warrant for us to defer our Baptism so long. So
he Instituted the Sacrament a little before his Death:
But is there no obligation upon us to receive it but when
we are near our Graves, and under a Prospect of Death?
He also Instituted and Administred the Sacrament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a full Meal, in an upper Room, to Men onely. Doth
his bare example oblige us to observe punctually all
these Circumstances, or no? If it doth, why do our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Separation take the liberty to depart from
his example in these things? if his example layeth no
necessity upon us to follow it in these particulars, how
doth Sitting become necessary barely upon the account
of his example? I desire them therefore Seriously and
impartially to examine this matter, and see if they can
assign any reasons for this liberty they take of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the example of our Saviour in some things, and not
in others, where there is no other Rule to guide them.
I believe they will be constrained to do one of these two
things; either to withdraw their Suit against Kneeling,
and quit their own Principle; or condemn their own
practices, as shamefully repugnant to it.</p>
               <p>2. The bare example of Christ is no Warrant for us
to act by, because the great end and usefulness of that
Glorious example he left us, consists in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that
it shews the possibility, and clears up the sense of his
Laws, and excites and encourages us to the Practice
of them; it puts the Rule into activity, and sets it
forth to the life. It is to our lives, as Exhortation is
to Doctrine, it thrusts us forward to do that which
we were obliged in Conscience to do before. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
our Lord hath Commanded us to do, in that onely
we are necessarily bound to Imitate him: But where
there is no Precept, there is no Necessity.</hi> We may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52296:15"/>
do it if we will, and if we can innocently <hi>(as in the case
of a single Life)</hi> but we are not under Constraint, and
an indispensable Obligation. He hath Commanded us
to be Meek and Lowly, to be Just and Merciful, to be
Patient under all our Troubles and Afflictions, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Peace with all Men, to be ever contented and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to the Will of our Heavenly Father in all States
and Conditions of Life, and the like: And in all these
things he became an Example to us, that we might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Steps. He Commands us to do what he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
himself; and that which we are concerned in,
if we would walk surely, is first to look for our
Rule, and then for our encouragement to look unto
Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith. It's true
indeed, we are Commanded in Scripture to follow
the Examples of the Apostles so far forth as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ, and the Example of our Lord is made
the Touchstone to try all others by; but then if we
would know what is our Duty, we must bring his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to the Rule. For as to Preach Christ and to
Preach the Gospel,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> to Obey Christ and Obey the
Gospel,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 42.</note> are Phrases of alike Import it Scripture; so in
like manner,<note place="margin">Acts 11. 20.</note> to follow Christ,<note place="margin">Marc. 16. 15.</note> is all one with follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel-Rule,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 9.</note> or doing as Christ did in obedience
to his Commands.<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 8.</note> The Sum of all is this;<note place="margin">Col. 2. 6.</note> An Example
may help to Interpret a Law, but of it self it is no Law:
Against a Rule no Example is a Competent Warrant; and
if the Example be according to the Rule, it's not the
Example but the Rule that is the Measure of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>3. The bare Example of Christ is no Warrant for
us to go by, because he was an extraordinary Person,
and did many things which we cannot, and many which
we must not do. He Fasted 40 Days and 40 Nights,
and spent whole Nights in Prayer; he wrought many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52296:16"/>
Miracles, to prove the Truth of his Doctrine and his
Divine Authority by, that he was the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Son
of God, and Saviour of Mankind; he was a Prophetical
Priest, by which Office he was obliged to teach us the
whole mind of God in all things necessary to Faith and
Salvation, and to offer up himself as a propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for the Sins of the World. Nothing (we should
quickly experiment) would be more Vain and Foolish,
than attempts of an Imitation in some things: And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more Wicked, than to think and believe we may
and ought to follow his example in others. To dye to
Sin, and Crucify the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts,
is a good way (as the Scripture Teaches and Warrants)
of Imitating our Lords Death in a Spiritual Sense.
So, to Die rather than deny the Faith and Dishonour our
Saviour, is great and Praiseworthy; but to Die for Sin,
either our own or other Men's, to propose a Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Death to our Selves, and by way of expiation, is a Sin
of so deep a Stain, that the Blood of Christ will not Wash
out: For this in effect is Trampling upon and Vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Precious Blood of our Saviour, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the Virtue and Merits of his Sacrifice, and
thereby render it weak and insufficient to save us. Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore to follow the Example of Christ, is a certain
way to run into Error and Mischief. We must then of
necessity, if we would follow him safely, seek out for a
plain Rule in the Word of God, or guide our Selves by
the Dictates of Reason and Prudence; and either way
is a sufficent Demonstration that a bare Example is not to
be trusted to. Those who urge the example of Christ
for Sitting, were somewhat ware of this, namely, that
his example, and those of his Apostles, are not to be Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by us in all things;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gillesp.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Cer. p. 339.</note> and therefore they lay down this
for their Maxim and Guide:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are bound to Imitate Christ, and the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52296:16"/>
example of his Apostles, in all things wherein it
is not evident they had special reasons moving them
thereunto, which do not concern us.</hi> But I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be informed how we shall be ever able to know
when they acted upon special reasons, and what they
were, that we may know our Duty, if a bare Example
without any Rule obliges us: And if we guide our selves
by Scripture or Reason in this matter, then they are the
measures of the Example. Besides, if we are not to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
them in such things which they were moved
to do upon special reasons which did not concern us,
then we are obliged to Imitate their examples in such
things as they did upon general and common reasons
which concern us as well as them, or we are not obliged
at all by any Example; and if so, then those reasons are our
Rule, to which we are to reduce their Examples. Without
we find some general or common Reason, we have no
Warrant (according to their own Principle) to follow
their Examples; and when such Reasons do appear, then
it's not the example alone that obliges us, but Reason that
approves the Example. To bring their own Rule to
the case in Hand: How do they know but our Lord
was moved to Sit at the Sacrament by Special reasons
drawn from that Time and Place, from the Feast of the
Passover to which that Gesture was peculiar? How do
they know but that our Lord might have used another
Gesture, if the Sacrament had been Instituted apart from
the Passover?</p>
               <p>The necessity of the time, made the <hi>Jews</hi> Eat the
Passover after one fashion in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which afterward
ceasing, gave occasion to alter it in <hi>Canaan;</hi> and how
do we know but that our Lord complyed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
necessity, and that his Example (if he did Sit) was
onely temporary, and not designed for a Standing Law
perpetually obliging to a like practice? If Christ acted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52296:17"/>
upon special reasons, then we are not obliged, by their
own Rule; and if he did not, let them produce the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
if they can, which make this Example of Christ of
general and perpetual use, and to oblige all Christians
to follow it. When ever they do this, I am sure they
will expose their own Principle which they have built
so much upon, to the Scorn and Contempt of the World;
which is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gillesp.</hi> 338. disp. against Ceremo.</note> 
                  <hi>That the bare example of Christ and good
Men in Scripture, are a compleat Rule and Sufficient
Warrant for our Actions, in such things as we have no
Precept or Prohibition for in the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That a
Christians Duty in a great measure flows purely from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
Recorded in the Word of God, and not from the
express Laws of God, which he hath revealed to
us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It's absurd to talk of Christs Example apart from
all Law and Rule, and to make that alone a Principle
of Duty distinct from the precepts of the Gospel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ himself, all the while the World enjoyed the
benefit of his example, governed his actions by a Law.
For if we consider him as a <hi>Man,</hi> like unto us in all
things (Sin onely excepted) he was Born under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of the Moral and Natural Law; as a <hi>Jew,</hi> under
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law; as the <hi>Messias,</hi> sent of God into the
World to compass the great Work of our Redemption
which he had freely undertaken, he still acted by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
appointment, and was under the Gospel-Law. He
came to fulfil all Righteousness, and to teach us the
whole Mind and Will of God, and Exemplify to us what
he taught and delivered. That which made that bitter
and deadly Cup which ended his Days relish with him,
was this consideration,<note place="margin">John 18. 11.</note> that it was a Cup given him by
his Father, and the Drinking it was agreeable to his
will; and it was the comfort and support of his Soul a
little before his Death, that he had finished the Work
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52296:17"/>
that his Father had given him.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 4. v.</note> He frequently profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in his life-time that he did as his Father gave him
Commandment,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 27.</note> and that it was his great business and
delight to do the will of his Father;<note place="margin">Luke 2. 49.</note> and many such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
he used,<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 34.</note> which may be consulted at leisure.<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 30. 8 c. 28, 29.</note> If
therefore we onely look to his Example,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 25.</note> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the various Capacities and Relations he bare,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 24, 31.</note>
both towards God and towards us,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 10, 15.</note> and the several Laws
by which he stood Bound, which were the measures of
his Actions, we shall miserably mistake our way, and
bewilder our selves; we shall Act like Fools, when
we do such things as he did pursuant to infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Thus (to give but one instance) if we should Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
our selves to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as he did (for he
fulfilled the Ceremonial Law, which he came to abolish)
we should thereby frustrate the great Design of the
Gospel, and of our Saviours coming into the World:
And yet even this we are obliged to do, if his Example
alone, be a sufficient Warrant for our Actions. I have
staid the longer upon this Head, because so ill a use hath
been made of Scripture-Examples, and to shew how
far forth we may safely steer by them, I scarce know
any one Doctrine so teeming and big with Error, so Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to the Souls of private Persons, and the Peace of
Publick Societies both Civil and Ecclesiastical, <hi>as that
which teaches us to Learn and Derive our Duty from,
and to Judge of the Goodness and Badness of our Actions by
the Examples of Christ, and good Men, over and above
what we are obliged to do by the Precepts and Laws of the
Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They who urge the Example of Christ against
Kneeling at the Sacrament, as our Rule to which we
ought to Conform, do not follow it themselves. Because
the posture he Instituted the Sacrament in, which they
say was a Passover-Gesture, was (if so) very different
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52296:18"/>
from that which they so earnestly plead for and use at
this day. For that was a Discumbing or Leaning
Gesture on the left side, much after the manner that
we lye upon Couches, with the upper part of the body
almost erect. It is agreed by all Learned Men, that this
was the Ancient Custom of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours
time, and is so to this day at the Passover, by which
Gesture they distinguish this Festival Night from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Now if the same Gesture were used by Christ
at the Sacrament as was at the Passover, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
makes it necessary and obligatory to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
for what Reasons and by what Authority do our
Dissenting Brethren change it into Sitting upright, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Civil way and manner of Feasting? When
they tell us this, it will be very easy to justify Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the same Authority which they shall alledge for
Sitting; and our changing the Gesture will be as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
as theirs. Unless they will say, that they alone
have the Power and Priviledge to recede from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Christ when and how far they please, but our
Church hath not, nor any other upon the face of the Earth.
To say Sitting, as they do, comes nearer to the Gesture
used by our Lord at the Passover, and consequently
(as is supposed) at the Sacrament, then the Kneeling
Gesture, according to the Custom of our Church, will
do them no service: For there is no Room for this
Question, Who cometh nearest to the Example, they or
we? when they ought not at all to vary, if they keep
to their own Rule. The Example of Christ, as it is
urged by them against Kneeling, equally Concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all other Gestures besides what he himself used:
And then the supposed Gesture which he observed binds
to Lying along. For where we have nothing to go by
but his Pattern, we must cut exactly by it, or else we
take a liberty to do that of our own heads for which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52296:18"/>
we have no allowance: That is, we leave the Pattern
which we were obliged onely to follow, and act at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
upon our own heads; and then the Pattern can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be alledg'd for our Justification. Though our
Church therefore doth not strictly follow the Example
of Christ (as is objected) by requiring all her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants
to Kneel, yet they have no reason to complain
and to scruple Communicating with us, who do not
follow it themselves, but receive the Sacrament in their
separate Congregations in a Gesture different from what
our Lord used at the first Institution of it. The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
(if one may Argue from their Practices to
their Principles) lay very little stress on this Argument
taken from the Example of Christ. For though they
generally choose to Sit, yet they do not Condemn Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as Sinful, or Unlawful in its self; and several are
willing to Receive it in that posture, in our Churches:
which surely is every whit as wide from the Pattern
our Lord is supposed to have set us, (whether he Lay
along or Sate upright) as that which is Injoyned and
Practised by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> There is too a
Confessed variation allowed of and Practised by the
generality of Dissenters, both Presbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
from the Institution and Practice of Christ and
his Apostles, in the other Sacrament of Baptism. For
they have changed Immersion or Dipping, into aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note> or Sprinkling and Pouring Water on the Face. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
by Immersion or Dipping,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> is sutable to the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Lord, and the Practice of his Apostles,
and was by them ordained and used to represent our
Burial with Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4. 6. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> a Death unto Sin, and a New Birth
unto Righteousness,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 12.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains that Rite. Now
it's very strange that Kneeling at the Lord's Supper
(though a different Gesture from that which was used
at the first Institution) should become a Stumbling-block
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52296:19"/>
in the way of Weak and Tender Consciences, that
it's more unpassable than the <hi>Alpes;</hi> and yet they can
with Ease and Cheerfulness pass by as great or a greater
change in the Sacrament of Baptism, and Christen as
we do, without the least murmur or complaint. Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Kneeling, or Standing, were none of them Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
or used to signify and represent any thing Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to the Lord's Supper, as Dipping all over was; why
cannot Kneeling then be without any wrong to the
Conscience, as Safely and Innocently used as Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?
How comes a Gnat (to use our Saviours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb)
to be harder to swallow than a Camel? Or
why should not the Peace and Unity of the Church,
and Charity to the Publick, prevail with them to Kneel
at the Lord's Supper, as much (or rather more) as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Tenderness to the Infants Body, to Sprinkle
or pour Water on the Face, contrary to the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>4. They who Kneel at the Sacrament in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the Customs and Constitutions of the Church
whereof they are Members, do manifestly follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Christ.</p>
               <p>For our Saviour complyed with that Passover-Gesture
which was at that time commonly and generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Altar. Dam. 745. 747.</note> but cannot be pretended to be
the same that was used at the first Institution of that
Feast in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For thus the Command runs, <hi>Exod.
12. 11. And thus shall ye Eat it; with your Loyns
Girded, your Shoes on your Feet, and your Staff in your
Hand: And you shall Eat it in haste; it is the Lord's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover.</hi>
This, say the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, was but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Law, suted to the necessity of that time, and
served for that Night onely, and did not oblige the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Generations in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> For thus
they comment upon it: Four things were contained in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52296:19"/>
this Law,<note place="margin">Vid. Mr. <hi>Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> Exod. 12. 6. 11.</note> which did not oblige but for that night at the
Passover in <hi>Egypt.</hi> 1. Eating of the Lamb in their Houses
dispersed in <hi>Egypt.</hi> 2. Taking up of the Lamb from the
tenth Day. 3. Striking the Blood on their Door-Posts.
4. Eating in Haste. Here the Gesture in all probability
was Standing, though it be not expresly mentioned:
Howsoever, it was different from that used by the <hi>Jews</hi>
in our Saviours time, which was a Gesture denoting
Ease and Rest, and their deliverance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
And our Lord's Complyance with this Custom
may teach us thus much, That we should not be scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
about Gestures, but conform to the Innocent
and prevailing Customs of the Church wheresoever we
live.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 8.</note> To this Practice St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule well sutes; Not
onely, <hi>Whatsoever things are True, and Just, and Lovely,
and Pure, and Honest,</hi> but, <hi>whatsoever things are of

                     </gap>.</note>) and conform our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to them. And if Christians in the several places
of their abode did walk according to this Rule, they
would greatly promote the Peace and Welfare of the
Church of Christ, and in so doing procure quiet and
Peace to themselves, with unspeakable Comfort and
Satisfaction. Whosoever would be esteemed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
as a Peacemaker,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 9.</note> and avoid the ill reputation and
guilt of a Turbulent Person, ought among other things
carefully to observe this, <hi>viz.</hi> to Submit to, and Comply
with the Innocent Customs of the Church whereof he
is a Member. For thus the same Divine Writer (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had Argued against Womens being Uncovered
in the publick Assemblies) concludes all after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 6.</note>
                  <hi>If any Man seem to be Contentious, we have no

such Customs, nor the Churches of God.</hi> Pray by the
way let this be observed from this place, That we may
Lawfully do some things in the Worship and Service of
God, for which we have no Command or Example in
Scripture, or else St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument from Custom is of
no force.</p>
               <p>To sum up all upon this second Query: Seeing that
we can never be certain of the particular Gesture used
by Christ at the Institution of the Holy Sacrament:
Seeing his bare Example (supposing he did Sit) doth
not oblige us in Conscience to Imitate it: Seeing they
who urge his Example do not follow it themselves, even
in that particular they urge it for: Seeing Conformity
to the Gesture prescribed by Law, is a plain Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Example and Practice of Christ, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as to the Equity, Reason, and Spiritual Meaning and
Instruction of it. I think no Man can reasonably object
against Kneeling, and scruple in Conscience a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to it, as being repugnant to the Example of our
Lord.</p>

               <head>Query III.</head>
               <head type="sub">Whether Kneeling be not altogether Unsuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Repugnant to the Nature of the
Lord's Supper, as being no Table-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture?</head>
               <p>BEfore I proceed to the Case it self, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to premise something which may explain
the true sense of it; and Discover upon what Grounds
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52296:20"/>
and Reasons our Dissenting Brethren build their scruples
against Kneeling, as being no Table-Gesture. By a
Table-Gesture we are to understand thus much; That
at the Lord's Supper we ought in their Judgment to
use the same Gesture as we do at our ordinary Meals
and Tables, at our Civil Feasts and Entertainments:
And because divers Gestures are used at Meals, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the different Modes and Customs of several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
therefore we are obliged to use that at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
which the Custom of our Country hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
at our Ordinary and Civil Meals. Thus (saith
the Author of <hi>Altare Damascenum,</hi> a Stout and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Champion for a Table-Gesture,<note place="margin">Altar. Dam. <hi>p.</hi> 762.</note> 
                  <hi>Sitting cross-legged
as the Turks do at their Meals, would be amongst them
(if they were Converted) a Comely fashion of Receiving
the Lord's Supper.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Disput<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against Kneeling, p. 2. p. 56. arg. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sacrament is a Supper, a Feast,
a Banquet, and therefore requires a Supper, a Feast, a
Banquet-Gesture. And such a Gesture must be used as
Standeth with the Custom of the Country. In no Nation
was it ever held Comely to Kneel at their Banquets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abridgment p. 61. reply to Bp. <hi>Morton</hi> 3 Innoc. Cer. p. 37. set forth in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Reign.</note> 
                  <hi>or
to Receive their food Kneeling.</hi> So that according to the
sense of their own Writers, and great Patrons of Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
this is the reason why they question the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Kneeling: That the Gesture at the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ought to be the same with that which we use and
observe at our Ordinary Tables, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
and Fashion of our Native Country wherein we
live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then the full Import and meaning of the Query
is this:</hi> Whether the nature of the Sacrament, considered
as a Feast, doth not require and oblige us to Sit and not
Kneel, because Sitting and not Kneeling is the Ordinary
Table-Gesture, according to the Mode and Fashion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52296:21"/>
Here the Reader may observe, that this Argument
for Sitting, drawn from the nature of this Holy Feast,
quite overthrows the two former Arguments drawn
from the express Command and Example of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and renders them useless and unserviceable to their
cause.</p>
               <p>1. For they don't say we are obliged to use the same
Gesture with our Lord, but only a Table-Gesture, though
never so different from that which he used, according
to the Custom of our Country where we live. Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gestures, according to the Variety of Fashions and
Usages of several Nations at their Common Feasts, may
be all Comely and Sutable to the Nature of this Holy
Feast. According to this Argument, therefore, we are
not obliged to Sit, because Christ did at the Sacrament;
and then his bare Example is no Rule to us in this
matter. His Example was Governed and Guided by
the Nature of the Sacrament, and the Custom of the
<hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord Instituted the Sacrament before the Paschal
Feast was over, and he continued in the same posture
which he used at the Passover, say they, and that was
Sitting. Suppose this, what follows? Why therefore
we are bound to Sit too, after his Example. No, by no
means, say I, unless it be the Custom of our Country
to Sit at our Meals, and Sitting be our Common Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Gesture:
Which is the strength of this Argument
drawn from the Nature of the thing, if we may believe
what they say themselves.</p>
               <p>2. Again, if the Nature of the Sacrament require a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Gesture,
and we are obliged to use that in particular
which standeth with the Custom of our Country, and the
Gestures may be different according as their Customs
differ, then God hath no where Commanded the use
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52296:21"/>
of any particular Gesture, nor obliged all Christians in
all places to observe one and the same.</p>
               <p>3. And then Thirdly, we may Lawfully observe
some things in the Worship of God, for which we have
no Command or Example in the Holy Scriptures, if
this Argument of the Table-Gesture be good. And
this principle, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ought not to do any thing
in the Worship of God, but what we have some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or Example for in Scripture, is the great batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Engine which hath been constantly imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Ceremonies enjoyned by our Church, and
it <hi>is a Principle wherein the Mystery of Puritanisme doth
consist,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preface to his Serm. last E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. 1681.</note> as Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> Notes. Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
our Brethren not to be fond of this Table-Gesture,
as they love the Life of their Cause. I am sure no
greater Argument can be afforded of a routed baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
Cause in the matter of Sitting at the Sacrament,
than to see the Patrons of it running up and down
in Confusion, and flying for Refuge sometime to the
Command of Christ, then to his Example; when driven
out there, then to the Nature of the thing and Civil
Customs, and about again to the Example. For thus
the Authors of the fore-mentioned Tracts do. Thus
much being premised, I proceed to Consider the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
proposed; for the Resolution whereof, I shall</p>
               <p>1. Enquire into the Nature of the Holy Sacrament,
that so we may truly understand what Gesture is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or repugnant to it.</p>
               <p>2. Shew that the Nature of the Lord's Supper doth
not absolutely require and necessarily oblige us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a Common Table-Gesture, in order to our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receiving.</p>
               <p>3. That Kneeling is very Comely, and agreeable to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52296:22"/>
the Nature of the Lord's Supper, though no Table-Gesture.</p>
               <p>4. That the Primitive Church and Ancient Fathers
had no such notion of the necessity of a Table-Gesture
as is maintained and urged by Dissenters.</p>
               <p>1. As to the Nature of the Sacrament, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to discover it under these following Heads.</p>
               <p>First, the Sacrament in the Holy Scripture is called
the Lord's Table, and the Lord's Supper, and
and Banquet, by the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, because of
that Provision and Entertainment which our Lord hath
made for all worthy Receivers. It is styled a Supper
and a Feast, either because it was Instituted by Christ
at Supper-time, at night; or because it represents a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and a Feast: And so it is not of the same Nature
with a Civil and Ordinary Supper and Feast, though it
bear the same name. There is some resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this Holy Feast and Civil Feasts; and the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wherein it lies, will in part explain its Nature.
There are three things Essential and Necessary to a
Feast, and included in the notion of it: Plenty, good
Company, and Mirth. And upon the account of these,
the Sacrament is (considered in its own Nature)
properly a Banquet, a Feast; but then it is a Heavenly
and Spiritual one, consisting of Spiritual Graces and
benefits, Communion with Christ and with all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
signified by, and tendered under the outward
Elements of Bread and Wine: and even in these three
particulars which are Essential to it, considered as a Feast,
and are necessary ingredients into all Feasts whatsoever,
it very much differs from Civil and Ordinary Feasts.
For though there be <hi>Plenty,</hi> yet it doth not consist of
Variety of Dishes, to gratifie our Palats, or satisfie our
Hunger, as other Feasts do, and particularly the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover
did, where the Body was filled and Feasted as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52296:22"/>
well as the mind. The provision wherewith our Lord
hath Furnished out his Table, is not of an Earthly and
perishing, but of an Heavenly and Immortal Nature,
even the Body and Blood of Christ, which we Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Feast upon.</p>
               <p>Alas, if we only fix our Eyes and Thoughts upon
what is placed on the Table, and those small portions
of Bread and Wine allotted us to Eat and Drink, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lifting up our Hearts (as<note n="*" place="margin">So St. <hi>Cypr.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> and St. <hi>Aug.</hi> expound this Exhort. of the Minister at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Cyp.</hi> de orat. Dom. <hi>Chrys.</hi> Hom. de Encaeniis, <hi>Aug.</hi> de ver. Relig. c. 3.</note> our Church exhorts us
to do, by the Minister, in her Communion-Office) to
those Heavenly and Invisible good things, couched
under, and signified by the outward Elements of Bread
and Wine, what is there in all that we see that deserves
the name of a Feast, or can by the help of any figure
(but an Irony) be called by that name? Did ever any
Man esteem that a Feast, where there was not Meat
enough to fill his Mouth, nor Drink enough to
quench his thirst? It is upon the account therefore of
those Invisible and Spiritual good things, wherewith
the Souls, not the Bodies of worthy Communicants
are Strengthened and Refreshed (of which the Bread
and Wine are but the Types and Shadows) that the
Sacrament is, and may truly be called a Feast or Banquet.
And for this reason<note n="†" place="margin">St. <hi>Chrys.</hi> in Ps. 90. <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> orat. 40. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosol.</hi> Catech. and others.</note> the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers called it a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Feast,</hi> and the Table <hi>a Mystical Table;</hi> and the
Cup, <hi>the Cup of Mysteries:</hi> and the Sacrament, take it
all together, was by them Styled <hi>the Mystical Supper,
the Mystery, and Mysteries,</hi> as Presenting one thing to
the Eye, and another to the Mind.</p>
               <p>2. As Plenty is one necessary ingredient into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Feast, so also is Choice and Select Company.
Feasts are made in expectation of Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
A Man may Dine alone, but in Proper and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Speech, no Man is said to Feast alone. Now
though the Sacrament doth resemble our Common
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52296:23"/>
Feasts in this Particular (and therefore hath obtained
the name of <hi>Communion,</hi> and the Guests <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi>
which Phrases do naturally import Number or
Society:) yet if we consider what the persons are that
constitute this Society, and with whom Communion is
held, the Nature of this Spiritual Feast will further
appear.</p>
               <p>And truly our Communion is with God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, the three Divine Persons of the
Holy Trinity; though principally our Lord Jesus, the
Master of this Feast,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 18.</note> in and through whom we all have
access by one Spirit to the Father, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks.
This high and inestimable priviledge and Honour of
being admitted into the Presence of God, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a friendly Correspondence and Converse with him
at his Table, is founded on the Blood of Christ, which
we thankfully Commemorate at this Solemnity, by
<hi>which we who were afar off are made nigh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13.</note> as the same
Divine Writer hath it. Moreover, by Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Lord's Table, we are United to, and hold
Communion with all Faithful Christians and worthy
Communicants, the Members of his Mystical Body the
Church, whom he hath redeemed and cleansed by his
most precious Blood. And that which qualifies a Man
for such Communion, doth not Consist in External
Garbs or Ornaments of the Body, but in Holy and
Virtuous Dispositions of Soul, in a <hi>Penitent, Humble,
Charitable, Thankful, and Obedient Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Another thing necessary to a Feast is Mirth and
Joy, (which implies also good discourse) and in this
too the Sacrament resembles our Common Feasts. But
then the Joy is of a Spiritual Nature, and flows from
different Causes.</p>
               <p>Not from what we Tast and See, not from our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
and Phansies pleased and tickled with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52296:23"/>
and Variety of Dishes which adorn the Table,
nor from our Blood and Spirits raised and fermented
by generous Wines; but from Divine and Heavenly
Considerations. From the Boundless and Unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Love of God in sending his onely Begotten and
Beloved Son into the World, to lay down his Life and
shed his Blood as a propitiation for our Sins; from the
wonderful Condescention of our Dear Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
in undertaking this hard Task, in appearing Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with our Flesh in the form of a Servant, and at
last Humbling himself to the Death of the Cross for
our Sakes; from the Victory he hath gained for us over
Death and Hell, and all the Spirits of Darkness; from
the miraculous Redemption he hath wrought, and the
Right and Title to Eternal Life, which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for us Sinful Dust and Ashes, by his own most
Precious Blood. This is the secret Language and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of every Devout Christian at this Holy Feast;
and with these kind of Meditations he refreshes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
himself. So that from the whole we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Lord's Supper is in its own Nature tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and properly a Feast, though vastly different from
Common and Ordinary Feasts throughout, even in
those things wherein it seems to be like them. As to
the several Names and Phrases by which the Nature
of it is described, they are figurative, and borrowed from
Civil Entertainments: but although it hath received
the same names, and is represented by Phrases that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
sute to Ordinary Feasts, yet the Lord's Supper
differs in its Nature from Civil Banquets, as much as
Heaven and Earth, Body and Spirit, differ in theirs.
As to the Bread and Wine which we see and tast, they
are only Signs and Types of the true Spiritual Feast,
and serve to raise our minds to, and whet the Appetites
of our Souls after Celestial and Heavenly Enjoyments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52296:24"/>
Thus much may suffice to inform us what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
barely as a Feast.</p>
               <p>2. For a further Discovery of its Nature, we are to
be minded that it is a Feast upon a Sacrifice for Sin,
wherein we are particularly to Commemorate the
Death of Christ by way of expiation for the Sins of the
World.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>3. It was Instituted in Honour of our Lord, our great
Benefactor and Redeemer; where we meet to preserve
an Eternal memory of his Wondrous Works, to bless
and praise him, and speak good of his Name. And thus
partaking of the Lord's Supper is a proper Act of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Worship performed to our Saviour. It's the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God manifested in our Flesh, and of our Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Lord, who submitted himself to a Vile and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Death for the sake of us Vile and Miserable
Sinners.</p>
               <p>4. The Lord's Supper is a Mysterious Rite of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship, which as it respects God the Father, hath
the Vertue and Efficacy of a Thanksgiving and a Prayer,
as the Sacrifices under the Law had. For our desires
and affections may be signified by Actions as well as
Words, and by Ceremonies as well as Speech: And
with respect to this Notion and End of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<note place="margin">

which last name, as it was given to it in the most
early Ages of the Church, so it still retains the same
among all the Christian Churches to this day.</p>
               <p>5. The Lord's Supper was Instituted to be a Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or Covenanting Rite between God and all worthy
Communicants:<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19.</note> Where, by permitting us to Eat and
Drink at his Table,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 24.</note> he signifies that we are in a State
of Peace and Friendship, and in a Covenant-relation with
him; and we by coming to his Table, and Eating and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52296:24"/>
Drinking in his presence, do own him to be our God
and Saviour, and in effect plight our troth to him, and
Swear Fidelity and Allegiance to him: we take the
Sacrament upon it (as we ordinarily say) that we will
not henceforth live unto our selves, but to him alone
that Dyed for us, and gave himself for us an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and a Sacrifice to God, for a Sweet Smelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>6. The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for this further end, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>a means</hi> to Convey
and Apply to us the Merits of that Sacrifice which
Christ offered for Sinners on the Cross; and as a Pledge
to assure us thereof.</p>
               <p>7. It was instituted to be a Sacred Bond of Unity
and Concord among all Christians, to engage and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us to Love one another, as our Lord Loved us,
who thought not his Life too dear, nor his Blood too
much to part with, for our Sakes.</p>
               <p>This is a short, and, so far as it serves my present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
a full account of the Nature of the Lord's Supper.
If the Reader desire to see these things (which I have but
touched upon) more largely proved and explained, let
him for his satisfaction consult those two excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
(among many others) that pass under these
names,<note place="margin">Set forth by 1. Dr. <hi>Patri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Howsoever, by what hath been said it appears,
that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
Nature, and Instituted for various ends; that it
is vastly different both in its nature and ends from Civil
and Ordinary Feasts: And therefore I conclude that we
are not at this Religious Feast to guide our Selves by
the Rules of Common Table-Fellowship, but by more
Religious and Spiritual Considerations. Which leads
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52296:25"/>
me to the second thing proposed for the Resolution
of the present Case.</p>
               <p>2. That the Nature of the Lord's Supper doth not
absolutely require and necessarily oblige us to observe
a Table-Gesture, in order to a right and worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of it. The Reasons that I shall offer for the
Proof of this, are these:</p>
               <p>1. If the Nature of the Sacrament considered as a
Feast necessarily requires a Table-Gesture, then the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sacrament considered as a Feast equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
for all other Formalities which are either Essential
to all Civil Feasts whatsoever, or to all Feasts as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
among us. For if Sitting be necessary, purely because
the Nature of a Feast requires it, then all other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
which the Nature of a Feast requires, will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
necessary too. But our Dissenting Brethren will
by no means allow of this, nor think themselves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to observe all other formalities, though equally suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and agreeable to the Nature of a Feast as Sitting is:
Though for what good reason, I am perfectly in the dark.</p>
               <p>For 1. As they omit many things at the Sacrament
that are as agreeable to the Nature of a Feast as the
Table-Gesture is; So they observe several Modes
and Circumstances which are not agreeable to the
nature of a Feast, as the Custom of our Country
standeth. For instance, at our Common and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Feasts it's very sutable and agreeable to Laugh,
to Talk, and Discourse together; to Congratulate one
anothers welfare, to enquire of the State of absent
Friends and Acquaintance, to Sit with the Head Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to Eat plentifully and Drink Frequently, to Carve
and Drink to one another. It is further necessary and
convenient, that at such Feasts the Guests should be
well attended with Servants and Waiters, who are not
allowed to Sit down at the Table with those who are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52296:25"/>
Invited. It's agreeable that the Guests should, if they
please, help themselves and their Friends where they like.
And yet these (and many other things of this Nature)
though very sutable to, and commonly practised at
our Ordinary Feasts, are not allowed of, nor practised
by, nor urged as necessary to be observed at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by our Dissenting Brethren. But why they
should plead for and urge the necessity of a Common
Table-Gesture as being agreeable to the Nature of a
Feast or a Banquet, and at the same time think there lyes
no necessity at all upon them to observe other Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
equally agreeable to the Nature of Civil Feasts,
and warranted by custom as much as Sitting, is the great
knot of the Question, and that which puzzles me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
to unty.</p>
               <p>2. They observe several Modes and Circumstances
at the Sacrament, which are not agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Feast or Supper, nor to the customary way of
Feasting among us. For example: The Sacrament (say
they) is a Feast, a Supper, and requires a Feast, a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Gesture;
and then too (say I) it requires a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-time.
It is called in Scripture <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi>
and it was Instituted the same night in which he was
betrayed; and it's clear that our Lord Administred it
at Even, and that late, at the close of the Paschal Feast.
Now the Nature of a Supper, according to Common
use and acception, requires the Evening or Night, as the
proper and peculiar season for it; and yet our Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Brethren make no scruple of Communicating at
Noon.</p>
               <p>It's not agreeable to the Nature of a Feast, that one
of the Guests, and the Principal one too, should fill out
the Wine, and break the Bread, and distribute it to
the rest of the Society; but this the Dissenters general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allow of and practice at the Holy Communion. It's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52296:26"/>
not agreeable to the Nature of a Feast, to Sit from the
Table, dispersed up and down the Room. In all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Feasts there are several Tables provided, when one
is not big enough to receive the Guests; and yet the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
generally receive in their Pews, scattered up and
down the Church; and think one Table is sufficient,
though not capable of receiving the twentieth part of the
Communicants, in some large Parishes and numerous
Assemblies: And where they are few in number, that
they may come up to and Sit at the Table, they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are against it (especially the Presbyterians) and think
they are not obliged to observe that formality, though
constantly practised at Common and Civil Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
It's by no means agreeable to the nature of a Feast
to be Sorrowful. To Mourn and Grieve at a Feast, is
as Indecent and Unsutable, as to Laugh at a Funeral.
But sure our Dissenting Brethren will not say, that to
come to the Sacrament with a Penitent and a broken
Spirit, to come with a hearty Sorrow for all our Sins,
which caused much Pain and Torment to our Dearest
and Greatest Friend, our ever-Blessed Redeemer: To
reflect upon the Agonies of his Soul in the Garden, the
Bitterness of his deadly Cup, the Torture he endured
on the Cross, with a deep Sympathy and Trouble for
the occasion, they will not surely, I say, affirm that such
a disposition of Heart and Mind is improper and unsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Nature of this Holy Feast which we Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
in Commemoration of his Death for our sakes. I
make no doubt but all Pious Dissenters bring along with
them to the Sacrament such a temper; but this they
ought not to do, if their Rule hold good, <hi>viz.</hi> That at
this Feast we ought to be guided by the Rules of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Table-Fellowship.</p>
               <p>2. The Nature of the Lord's Supper doth not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
require a Common Table-Gesture, because it's not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52296:26"/>
of the same Nature with Common and Ordinary Feasts.
It is very ill Logick, as well as ill Divinity to argue from
Natural and Civil things to Spiritual; to conclude that
because they agree in their names, they are of the same
Nature, For example: When any Man, who hath
led a loose, sensual, wicked Life, is awakened and excited
by the Grace of God to consider and take up, to mind
Heavenly things, and to breath after God, and Christ,
and Eternity; to alter his mind and his manners, and
lead quite another Life from what he did before, this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is in Scripture-Phrase said to be Regenerate and
Born again. But if we would go about to judge of
the true Nature of Regeneration and the new Birth
purely by the Correspondency it holds with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Birth, and argue from the Natural to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
we should Entertain very gross and silly Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Regeneration, and greatly mistake the Nature
of it. How ridiculous would it be to prescribe the same
Rules to be observed by a New Convert, or a New-Born
Babe in a Spiritual Sense, in Order to his Spiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
and growth in Grace, as are prescribed and
practised towards Infants and New-Born Babes in a
Natural Sense for the maintenance and preservation of
their Natural Life, and Strength; as, that they should
be Swathed, and enter into a Milk-Dyet! And yet this
is every way as reasonable, as to prescribe Sitting as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the worthy Receiving of the Sacrament, which
is a Spiritual Feast, because it's agreeable to the Nature
of Civil Feasts: Or (which amounts to the same thing)
because it's called a Feast, therefore it's of the same
Nature with Ordinary and Common Feasts; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
such a Gesture and Behaviour as is necessary
and requisit to these, is also requisit and necessary to the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52296:27"/>
3. The Nature of the Lord's Supper, considered as a
Feast, doth not necessarily require and oblige us to use
a Common Tale-Gesture, in order to right and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receiving, because, in the Judgement and Practice of
numerous Dissenters, it may be worthily Received Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Thus the Presbyterians (and all their Writers
who have engaged against Kneeling) do not condemn
Standing as Sinful and Unlawful, nor esteem such
as use it unworthy Receivers on that account; and yet
Standing is no Common Table-Gesture.</p>
               <p>If any should yet urge the necessity of Sitting as the
onely agreeable Gesture to the Nature of the Sacrament
considered as a Feast,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and that to use any other Gesture
would Prophane the Ordinance;</p>
               <p>I offer this to be considered as a good Answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> That
the Passover was called a Feast by God himself who
Instituted it,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 14.</note> and yet he Commanded the Children of
<hi>Israel</hi> to Celebrate it in <hi>Egypt</hi> after this manner;<note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>with</hi>
their <hi>Loyns Girt,</hi> their <hi>Shoes on</hi> their <hi>Feet, and</hi> their
<hi>Staff in</hi> their <hi>Hands:</hi> All Signs of hast indeed, but
no Feast or Table-Gestures either among the <hi>Jews</hi> or
the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> To say that God enjoyned Gestures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable
to the Nature of that Ordinance, is to call in
Question the Wisdom, and the Knowledge, and the Truth
of God, as not Acting upon a right understanding of,
and in Conformity to the true Nature of things: it's all
one as to suppose, that God, after he had Created a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creature, would enjoyn him to do something that
was disagreeable to his Nature and Reason. On the
other hand, to say that the Feast of the Passover did in its
Nature admit of several Gestures, is to yield all that
I desire; for then the Sacrament, considered as a Feast,
will admit of several too, and Consequently doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to observe onely a Feast-Gesture for the due Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52296:27"/>
3. <hi>Kneeling is very Comely, and Agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Lord's Supper, though no Table-Gesture.</hi> Which
I hope will be made evident to every Honest and Unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed
Mind (which Impartially seeks after Truth) by
these following considerations:</p>
               <p>1. Kneeling is allowed on all Hands to be a very
fit and sutable Gesture for Prayer and Praise, and very
apt to express our Reverence, Humility, and Gratitude
by, and Consequently very fit to be used at the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament, and agreeable to its Nature. This will
appear, if we reflect upon what hath been delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Nature and Ends of the Lord's Supper. For
at the Sacrament we express that by Actions (as I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before) which at other times we do by Words; and
the Lord's Supper is a Solemn Rite of Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which implyes Prayer and Praise. It includes
all the Parts of Prayer. By partaking of the Signs of
his Body broken, and Blood shed for our Sins, we do
Commemorate, Represent, and Shew forth to God the
Father, the Sacrifice which his Dearly Beloved Son made
upon the Cross; we Feast upon the memorials of the
great Sin-Offering: And in so doing, we make an open
Confession and Acknowledgment of our Guilt and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
to God, and we plead with him in the
Vertue of his Sons Blood which was shed for us, for
the Pardon and Remission of all our Sins. We further
Humbly entreat him to be Propitious and Favourable
to us, and to bestow upon us all those benefits which
our Lord purchased with his most Precious Blood.</p>
               <p>We Intercede with him too at the Communion for the
whole Church, that all our Fellow-Christians and true
Members of his Body may Receive Remission of their
Sins, and all other benefits of his Passion. And as Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking at his Table, is a Visible and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52296:28"/>
Prayer in the sight of God; so it is a Visible Act of
Praise and Thanksgiving, whereby we let our Heavenly
Father see that we retain a deep and lively sense of his
Unexpressible Love, in sending his onely begotten Son
into the World to Dye for us that we might Live
through him. And that which enlivens our Faith, and
emboldens our hopes of finding Favour and Acceptance
at his Hands at this time above others, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Our
Prayers and Praises are not onely put up in the Name of
Christ, but presented, and as it were Writ in his Blood,
and offered to God over the great Propitiatory Sacrifice.
All this our Actions signify and speak, when we
Eat the Consecrated Bread, and Drink the Cup of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at the Lord's Table. If therefore these things be
True (and I think no body who understands what he
doth when he partakes of the Lord's Supper will gain-say
it) then Kneeling must be judged as fitting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to be used at such a time, when we signify our
desires and affections by external Rites and Ceremonies
of Gods appointment, as when we do it by Words, that
is, when we say our Prayers.</p>
               <p>2. Our Dissenting Brethren (and all good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
will Grant, that our Blessed Saviour ought to be
Worshipt and Adored by all worthy Communicants,
inwardly in their Hearts and Souls, when they Receive
the Tokens and Pledges of his tender and exceeding great
Love in laying down his Life for the Sins of the whole
World. And if so, then whatsoever is very apt and
meet to express the inward esteem and veneration of
our minds by, can't be thought Unsutable and Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Nature of the Lord's Supper: Because that
is a Religious Feast Instituted in Honour of our Lord,
and is a Solemn Act of Christian Worship performed
to our Crucified Saviour. Our meeting together at
this Holy Feast in Obedience to his Commands, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52296:28"/>
his Death, and tell of all his wondrous Works;
perpetuate the fame of our great Benefactor (as much
as in us lyes) throughout all Ages, is an External mark
of the Honour and respect we bear towards him in our
minds, and is, properly speaking, that which we call
Publick Worship. Since to Bow our Knees then, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be a proper mode of publick Worship, and an
External Sign of Reverence; why should an adoring
posture be thought Unmeet and Unsutable to the
Sacrament, which in its nature imports Worship and
Adoration?</p>
               <p>3. No good Christian, of what Party or Perswasion
soever, will deny, but that to lift our Hands and Eyes
to Heaven, and to Employ our Tongues in Uttering the
Praises of our Blessed Redeemer, even in the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
is very agreeable to the Nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
why then should Kneeling be thought Unsutable,
which is no more but onely Glorifying God and our
Blessed Saviour with another part of our Body? Why
should the Gesture be scrupled at more than the Voice,
or the Bowing of my Knees be esteemed incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and unfitting, any more than moving my Tongue,
or raising my Hands and Eyes to Heaven? Especially
if we consider, that the high degree of Honour and
Glory to which our Lord is advanced in the Heavens
by God the Father, as the reward of his Humble and
Submissive Obedience here on Earth, challenges from
us all manner of Respect and Reverence both of Soul
and Body, <hi>He Humbled himself, and became Obedient
into Death, even the Death of the Cross Wherefore
God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name
which is above every Name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>that at the Name of Jesus
every Knee should Bow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that every Tongue should
Confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the
Father.</hi>

4. The Holy Sacrament was Instituted in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of our Blessed Saviours Death and Sufferings:
And therefore I request all our Dissenting Brethren to
Consult one place of Scripture concerning our Saviours
Bodily Gesture or Deportment in the Heat and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of his Passion, wherein he presented himself
before his Father in his Agony and Bloody Sweat in the
Garden. <hi>Being in an Agony,</hi> he offered up this Prayer
to his Father:<note place="margin">Luke 22. 42, 44.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou be willing, remove this Cup from
me: Nevertheless, not my Will, but thine be done.</hi> But
after what manner, or in what Gesture of Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did his
perplexed Soul utter these earnest Supplications? Why,
<hi>Kneeling,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Ver. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>or fixing his Knees upon the Earth.</hi> Now though
we may remember and meditate on our Saviours Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in the Garden, when his Soul was so exceeding
Sorrowful, when he was reduced to such a Weak and
low Estate as to stand in need of Comfort and Support
from an Angel;<note place="margin">Ver. 43.</note> though, I say, this may be done Sitting,
yet sure no Sober and Considering Mind will say, that
to Celebrate the Memory of these Sufferings with ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Knees (as his were) on the Earth, is an Improper
and Unsutable behaviour to be used at the Sacrament,
where our proper work is to Commemorate the Death
and Sufferings of our Saviour, and particularly these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest.</p>
               <p>5. The Sacrament was Instituted to be a means of
Receiving the benefits of his Death and Passion, and a
Pledge to assure us thereof. If we do but Consider what
invaluable Blessings we expect to receive by our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
partaking of the Consecrated Bread and Wine at
the Table of our Lord, (such as the forgiveness of all
our Sins, the plentiful Communications of his Grace
and Spirit, and a Right and Title to Eternal Life) we
can't think Kneeling an Unmeet and Unbecoming
Gesture in the Act of Receiving the Outward Signs and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52296:29"/>
Pledges of this Inward and Invisible Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If a Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Hearty sense of Gods infinite mercy through the
Merits and Sufferings of his Son, and of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
rich benefits which our Lord hath purchased with
his most Precious Blood; if a mind deeply Humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sense of our own Guilt, and Unworthiness to
Receive any mercy at all from the Hands of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Soveraign Lord, whom we have by number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Heinous Crimes so highly provok't and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
against us; If such an inward temper and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Soul becomes us at this Holy Feast, (which I
think no Man will deny) then surely the most Humble
and reverential Gesture of our Body will become us
too. Why should not a Submissive Lowly deportment
of Body sute with this Solemnity, as well as a Humble
Lowly Mind?<note place="margin">See the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the end of the Communion-Service, in the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer.</note> And this is that which our Church De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
to be the end and design of her Injunction, in
requiring all her Communicants to Kneel, <hi>viz. for a
Signification of an Humble and Grateful acknowledgment
of the Benefits of Christ therein given to all worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. They who urge Sitting as necessary, and the only
agreeable Gesture to the Nature of the Lord's Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it's the Common Table-Gesture, must make the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
either the same with an Ordinary and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Feast, or onely like it in some respects, and unlike
it in others; as every like is not the same. To make
it the same, is directly to unhallow and prophane the
Ordinance;<note place="margin">1 Cor 11, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>it is to Eat and Drink unworthily, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Lord's Body,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
For it's clear from that Discourse of the
Apostle, that their not distinguishing between the Lord's
Supper, and a Common Meal or Supper, was their
great fault; which he sharply reproves them for, as that
which render'd them unworthy Communicants. Which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52296:30"/>
will appear to any that will take the pains to examine
the matter.<note place="margin">Vid. 20, 21, 22. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with 33, 34.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If the Lord's Supper be not the same with an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Feast, how comes it to pass that the same Gesture
must be necessarily used at both? If they differ in
their whole nature, then that which is agreeable to the
nature of the one, must be Repugnant to the nature of
the other. If they agree in some respects only, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in others, but not in their whole nature, then Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be as proper and sutable in some respects, as
Sitting is in others. For though the Civil Custom of
a Table-Gesture be allowed to strike some stroke in a
Spiritual Ordinance, where there is Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yet other respects in the Lord's Supper have a
stroke too, and that the greatest, if we duly weigh and
consider the ends of its Institution, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
described. And if upon such Examination it
appear, that Kneeling, or an adoring Gesture, holds fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Correspondence with the principal respects and ends
of the Lord's Supper, then the Banquetting Gesture,
though Lawful and Sutable in some less respects, must
and ought in reason to give place; at least, it ought not
to be Insisted on as the onely agreeable and necessary
Gesture, without which we cannot worthily Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever Gesture answers the principal respects
and ends of this Holy Feast, best Sutes to its Nature,
and consequently ought in reason to be best esteemed
of, and sway more with us than any other, if we will
wholly guide our selves by the Nature of the thing.
And that Kneeling or an adoring posture doth best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Nature and Ends of the Sacrament, I think is
clear and undenyable, if the account I have given
of the Sacrament be good. I am sure, howsoever, that
there is no reason why Sitting should justle our Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52296:30"/>
as Sinful, and Unsutable to the Nature of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ordinance.<note place="margin">Annot. in Luk. 22. 14.</note> Let Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> a Learned Advocate
for Nonconformists, be heard in this matter, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it: <hi>A Man must not</hi> (saith he) <hi>refuse to Receive
the Sacrament Kneeling, when he cannot have it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The Primitive Church and Ancient Fathers had
no such notion of the necessity of a Table-Gesture, as is
maintained and urged by Dissenters at present; which
will appear from those Names and Titles they gave to
this Holy Feast. And First, I observe from the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> that for the space of 200 years after Christ,
there is not the least mention made of the name <hi>Table</hi>
in any of their Writings.<note place="margin">Can. Apost. 2. St. <hi>Ignat.</hi> in 3 Epistles ad Philad. Tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Eph. <hi>Justin Mart. Irenaeus.</hi>
                  </note> They call the place on which
the Consecrated Elements stood, the <hi>Altar;</hi> and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
An <hi>Oblation</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> because at this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
they did Commemorate and Represent that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crfice
which Christ once offered on the Cross for the
Sins of the World. Now the Eucharist conceived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notion of a Sacrifice, and the place on which
it was offered of an Altar, doth not necessarily require
a Table-Gesture; there is not that strict Connexion and
Relation between an Altar or a Sacrifice, and a Common
Table-Gesture, as is conceived to be between a Feast or
Table, and a Feast or Table-Gesture.</p>
               <p>2. The Primitive Christians and Ancient Fathers of the
Church did not entertain any such conceits about the
necessity of a Common Table-Gesture, as our Dissentersdo.
As, that <hi>Kneeling or an adoring Gesture is against
the Dignity of Guests,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Arg. 1. p. 6. p. 26, 27, 28, 31, 37.</note> 
                  <hi>and Debarrs us the Priviledges
and Prerogatives of the Lord's Table, such as Social admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Social Entertainment; that it is against the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of Christ, whose intetion was to Dignify us by Setting
us at his Table;</hi> and much more of this Nature, and to this
effect. Now the Primitive Church little dreamt of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52296:31"/>
this Dignity and Priviledge of Communicants, of this
purpose of Christ, and of this kind of Fellowship and
Familiarity with him; as the Phrases they use, and the
August and Venerable Titles they give the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
even when they consider it as a <hi>Feast</hi> and
<hi>Supper,</hi> and speak of the <hi>Table</hi> on which it was Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
plainly demonstrate. They call it, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth, the <hi>Lord's Supper, the Kingly, Royal, and most Divine
Supper;</hi> which Import Deference, Distance, and Respect,
on our Parts; <hi>the Dreadful Sacrifice, the Venerable and
Unbloody Sacrifice, the Wonderful and Terrible Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
the Royal, Spiritual, Holy, Formidable, Tremendous
Table.</hi> The Bread and Wine after Consecration, are
in their Language called the <hi>most Mysterious, most Holy
Food and Nutriment,</hi> the <hi>most Holy things;</hi> and the place
where the Table stood, the <hi>most Holy part of the Temple,</hi>
in allusion to that of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Temple, to which the
<hi>Jews</hi> paid the highest Reverence. The Bread in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
they Stiled the <hi>Bread of God;</hi> the Cup, the <hi>Holy
and Mysterious, the Royal and Dreadful Cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Primitive Bishops and Holy Fathers advise the
Communicants to <hi>Reverence these Holy Mysteries, to
come with Fear and Trembling, with Sorrow and Shame,
with silence and downcast Eyes, to keep their Joy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
and to approach the Table with all the Signs and
Expressions of Reverence and Humility imaginable.
How can these Speeches consist with that Social, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
carriage at the Sacrament, which the Patrons of the
Table-Gesture contend for, as the Priviledge of Guests
and the Prerogative of the Lord's Table? For a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of this whole matter, I desire our Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brethren seriously to consider two or three Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which I shall propound to them, and endeavour to
frame an Honest and Impartial Answer, as in the Presence
of God, who searches our Hearts, and tryeth our Reins.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52296:31"/>
They are not of a Captious Nature, started to puzzle
the Cause, or for the sake of Contention (God knows
my Heart, I have no such designs through this whole
Discourse) but they are plain, and easie to be resolved
almost at first sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. I.</hi> Whether of two or three Gestures which are all
agreeable to the Nature of the Sacrament, any one is not
to be chosen and used by us, when we can't use another
without breaking the Peace and Unity of that Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. II.</hi> Whether it can consist with Piety or Prudence,
to Expose your Selves and Families to Danger, and the
lash of the Law, when nothing is Commanded but what is
consistent with the Law of God, and agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sacrament, though not to your Phansies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. III.</hi> Whether we are not, as Christians, obliged by
the Law of God, and the example of our Saviour, to deny
our Selves many things,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 2. 3, 8.</note> that are otherwise Lawful for us
to do and use, and are highly pleasing and grateful to us,
for the Good and Edification of our Neighbour? If so, How
much more, when the publick good and welfare of both Church
and State depends upon such self-denyal?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. IV.</hi> Whether it be Piously done of you to chuse
never to Receive the Sacrament, and so deprieve your Selves
of the Spiritual Benefit of that Heavenly Feast, rather
then part with a Civil Circumstance, such as a Table-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
is?</p>
               <p>It is the Custom of our Country to Sit at Feasts;
but few men are so mad as to refuse to Eat Standing,
and go Hungry away when they have no room to Sit
down. Why should we not be as Prudent at this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52296:32"/>
Feast, in the Concerns of our Souls, as we are in
those of our Bodies.</p>
               <p>Put the case we were strictly prohibited by the Law
of the Land the use of a Table or a Table-cloth at
this Holy Feast, and we could not receive with that
Convenience as now we may; would you end your
days in a continual refusal, and never receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
I don't know how far Passion and Prejudice, and
the heat of Disputation may blind and transport Men;
but if they will calmly consider this matter, and hearken
to Reason, they will find nothing to justify the total
neglect of this Ordinance by. I am very apt to think
they will be of my mind: for I declare to all the World,
rather than not Receive at all the Comfortable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Blessed Saviours Body and Blood. I will
Receive it on a Tomb-stone, on the ground, in a Church,
or in a Field, if all other things that are Essential to it
be rightly observed and performed. If any of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Brethren shall upon this Question think as I
do, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no absolute necessity of a Table
in this case, which the Custom of our Country requires
at Ordinary Feasts; He will also at the same time see
there is no absolute necessity of a Table-Gesture, and
that we may Receive worthily without either the one
or the other.</p>
