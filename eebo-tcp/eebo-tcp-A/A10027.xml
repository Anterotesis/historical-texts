            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>roote be dead,</hi> as the old <hi>Adam</hi> is, all the branches that rise from the root, <hi>must be dead also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, spirituall life is nothing else, but a coniunction of the soule with the Spirit of God; euen as the naturall life is a coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body with the soule: now as the soule leaues the body, so the holy Ghost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws him selfe from the soule, when it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynted, distempered, and made vnfit for vse. For euen as a man dwels in a house while it is habitable, hee playes on a musicall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment while it is fit, and in tune; he vseth a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell while it is whole, and sound; but when the house growes ruinous and inhabitable, he departs from it; when the instrument is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strung, he layes it aside: when the vessell is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14686:4"/>
broken or boared thorow, hee casts it away. And as the soule departs from the body when it is growne ruinous, when it is made inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table through mortall diseases, it layes it aside as an ouerworne garment: after the same manner, the holy Spirit withdrawes him selfe from the soule of a man, when it is broken, ruinatëd, and distempered, through the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall disease of sinne and of naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and this is the case of euery naturall man whatsoeuer, till he be reuiued by the infusion of a new life. And yet it is the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of naturall men, that if they liue in the Church, and be baptized, and pray, and heare the word, and imbrace the true religion, and practise the outward duties of it; that they are out of doubt in the state of this spirituall life. And therefore I thinke it would bee an houre well spent, to discouer dead men to themselues: to perswade them, that except they be made new creatures, <hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Except they bee</hi>

            <p>Now it is said, <hi>Ephes. 4. 18. That men are strangers from this life, through the ignorance that is in them, and the hardnesse of their hearts:</hi> Marke it; they are strangers from this life,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14686:5"/>
partly through ignorance, because they are <note n="e" place="margin">Pessima ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia boni est, bonum non esse. <hi>Prosper. Cont. Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem. cap.</hi> 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Ignorant of this worke of life and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> they thinke there is a greater latitude in religion than there is; within which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe if they come they are safe: that is, though they bee not so strict, and so zealous; though they goe not so fast to heauen as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet they shall do as well as the best: In a word, they are <hi>ignorant</hi> what belongs to this life, saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and therefore they are strangers to it. Partly againe they are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it, <hi>because of the hardnesse of their hearts;</hi> that is, either because they are so distracted and possessed with worldly businesse that they cannot attend it; or they are so besotted and surfeited with pleasures and delights, that they are not sensible of the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this life, and therefore they are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it: that is, they are not able to iudge of it, whether they haue this life of grace or not.</p>
            <p>You will say vnto me, how shall we know it?</p>

               <hi>As if another soule dwelt in the same body;</hi> that a man can say, <hi>Ego non sum ego;</hi> That when his old lusts, his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, his old temptations shall come, hee is able to answer them, and to say, hee is not the same man: though they knocke at the same doore, yet there is another inhabitant come into the house, and they finde not him they looke for. Euen as you see when a graft is put into a Crab-tree stocke, it changes all; the sappe, and the fruit, and the leaues, and all are of another fashion; so it is, when the life of grace is put into the heart of a naturall man, it changes the inward man and the outward; it changes the whole frame of the soule. For my beloued, this is not a light alteration; but as the old stampe must bee obliterated before the new can be imprinted; as the old building must bee pulled downe, before you can set vp the new; so this old nature of ours, must in a great measure be broken in peeces, before a man can be made a liuing man; which is done, by the infusion of the supernaturall qualities of grace and holinesse: I say, supernaturall; for euen as the earth may bring forth grasse and common wilde flowers of it selfe; but it must be plowed and sowen before any wheat,

But this is not enough, it must also be sowne; that is, there must be an implanting of spirituall graces, which change and renew vs: according to that which you shall finde, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Fashion your selues no more after this world, but be ye changed,</hi> or metamorphosed, <hi>by the renuing of your minde:</hi> And this is the first way by which you may discerne, whether you be dead or aliue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when there is no action, when there is no motion in a man, you say hee is <note place="margin">2.

            <p>I answer, it is very true; but yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Answer.</note> speakes of certaine <hi>dead workes,</hi> as <hi>Heb. 9. 14. The blood of Christ,</hi> is there said, <hi>to purge our conscience from dead workes;</hi> that is, all these before mentioned they may be done, and they are good workes in themselues, hauing all the lineaments of good workes, as you know a dead body hath of a liuing; but yet indeed they are but dead workes; that is, they may haue a golden out-side, and be very beautifull in the sight of the world, and also in the sight of men; but yet as Christ speakes, <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 16. 15.</note>

               <hi>to thinke well of the good workes and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> that they doe, to make them thinke they are currant coyne: but when they come to make vse of this treasure at the day of death, they finde them to bee but withered leaues, such as God will not accept of in the time of extremitie, at the day of iudgement. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. speakes of certaine men, <hi>Who had a forme of godlinesse, but denied the power thereof:</hi> that is, that haue a formall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomarie performance of good workes, and good duties, with which the conscience is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; and not able to iudge because it is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. And therefore Sathan doth with men in this case, as wee are wont to do with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; take from them true Gold; and when they fall a crying, stoppe their mouthes with Counters. So I say, Sathan labours to keepe men from the liuely and thorow performance of good workes and holy duties; and then satisfies their consciences, with that which hath but a forme of godlinesse, without the power of it.</p>
            <p>But you will say; How shall a man discerne <note place="margin">Question.</note> this, whether these good workes which are good in themselues, be good in such a manner as they are wrought by him?</p>
            <p>To this I answer; you may know it by these <note place="margin">Answer. Two wayes to discerne whether the workes we do are good or no.</note> two things.</p>
            <p>First, it is certaine, that except they be vital actions; that is, except they proceed from an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14686:7"/>
inward principle of life within, they are not <note place="margin">First if they proceed from an inward principle of life.</note> good actions, they are such as the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not. Now you know, there are motions, (as the motions of clockes and watches) that proceed not from life, but from Art; so it is in this matter of religion; many good actions may be done, many good motions in the waies of godlinesse, which yet may not proceede from the life of grace, but from outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to men; from feare of hell; from feare of iudgement; or in sickenesse; from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of death and calamity. In such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, we may be stirred vp to do them; and then euen as the wheeles that are set a going by the spring, when it is downe, you know they cease their motion: So commonly it is in these good fits, in these good moodes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, when that which set them on worke is remoued <note n="p" place="margin">Caduc<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </note> For coldnesse you know, is a symptome of death. Now these good workes when they are done by a naturall man, there is no life in them; there is no warmth in them, no viuaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nor quicknesse in them: where as you know, it is said, <hi>Iames 5. 16.

preuailes much:</hi> &amp; <hi>Rom. 12. 16. Be ye burning in spirit, seruing the Lord:</hi> that is, all those duties that haue not heat in them, that haue not fire in them, why, the Lord regards them not: the reason is this; because if there be no heat there, there is none of his Spirit there; and then you know our prayers are but the voyce of our owne spirits: the workes we doe are but dead workes, because they are but the fruits and effects of dead flesh, if there be none of the Holy Ghost there.

               <hi>reported to be a Wine-bibber, a companion of gluttones, and</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 9. 34.</note> 
               <hi>one that cast out Deuils by Beelzebub the Prince of Deuils.</hi> Thus he was hid. So the Apostle <hi>Paul;</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, he saith, they were hid from the world after this manner, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8. saith he, <hi>we are as deceiuers though true:</hi> that is, though we be true, yet we are as deceiuers: that is, we are reported to be deceitfull, and false men. And therefore they that are in great place should take <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 23. 1.</note> 
               <hi>speciall heed how they admit of reports.</hi> For yee shall findethis, that <note n="e" place="margin">See <hi>Tertulli an, Iustin Martyr.

               <hi>in all ages, in all stories,</hi> as they say, men for

the most part are mis-reported: <hi>Good men are reported the worst of, and euill men are reported the best of.</hi> So that, if we iudge by reports, we shall <note n="f" place="margin">Prou. 17. 15</note> 
               <hi>iustifie the wicked, and condemne the generation of the iust.</hi> I say, all these wayes this life is hid from vs, and therefore we must beleeue it, though we may helpe our selues a little by experience. We see there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men whose life is not in carnall pleasures and delights, that giue not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vp to sinne against God; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that no man can liue without some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, no creature can liue without it, and since their delight is not in these things, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is an other life that they liue; that is, an inward and retired life, euen this life <note n="g" place="margin">Col. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>that is hid with Christ in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, you see there is a generation of men that are <hi rend="sup">k</hi> 
               <hi>willing to suffer tortures, and imprisonments, to suffer death for Christ;</hi> and <note place="margin">h Acts 21. 13. Reuel. 12. 11.</note> sure they would not be so willing to part with this naturall life, if there were not a better life that they set a higher price vpon; they would not let this goe, if they did not hope for another. Thus we may helpe our selues with experience, we see not this life, but yet we must beleeue it. And this is the first vse we are to make of this, to beleeue there is such a life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if he that hath not this life is not in Christ; why then (my beloued) it <note place="margin">2. Vse.</note>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14686:14"/>
concernes vs all to see, that we haue the fruits and effects of this spirituall life in vs, that that change be wrought in vs which we speak of, that we haue these motions and actions that proceed from an inward principle of life; that we haue that attractiue, and that expulsiue disposition, that may emptie the heart of all knowne sinnes, which is the effect of this life. And further (which for ought I see, the Holy Ghost points at aboue all other signes of this spirituall life) you must consider whether you loue the brethren, you haue it in the first of <hi>Iohn 3. 14. We know by this we are passed from death to life, because we loue the brethren.</hi> You know a dead member hath no sympathy with the rest, but a liuing member hath a fellow-feeling, yea, a quicke and exquisite sence within, when any member is pained and hazarded; therefore let vs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to find this character in our selues, by being affected to our Neighbours, Brethren, and Churches abroad; by hauing bowels of compassion in vs to melt ouer their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to desire their safetie as our owne. For why should we not? Are they not <note n="i" place="margin">Ephes. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the same Church of God that we are?</hi> Are they not the same piece? And are they not as deere to God?

               <hi>wee would doe it to one as well as to another.</hi> Againe we haue reason to commiserate them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14686:15"/>
for our owne sakes, for wee cannot stand alone, and God hath so ordered it by his prouidence, <hi>Luke 6. 38. Looke what measure we mete to others in their distresse, the same shall men measure to vs in our necessities:</hi> and how soone the fire may take here also wee know not, but this wee shall find in the Prophet <note n="l" place="margin">Ier. 25. 15, to 30.</note> 
               <hi>Ieremie,</hi> when the Nations dranke of the cup of Gods wrath, wee see there the cup went round, <hi>All the Nations dranke of it,</hi> some more, some lesse. But yet if we drinke it not, yet certainely God will recompence vs, with good if we doe it, with euill if we omit it. For though he seeme angry with his Churches for a time, as <note n="m" place="margin">2 Sam. cap. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid was with Absalon,</hi> yet <hi>Ioab</hi> neuer did <hi>Dauid</hi> so acceptable a turne in all his life, as when he sought to bring home <hi>Absalon</hi> his banished sonne, though he were angry with him all the while. So we cannot doe God a more acceptable seruice, than to helpe the Church, though for the present shee seeme to bee vnder the cloud of his anger. And doubtlesse, as the Lord would take it exceeding ill if we should neglect our dutie to them (as I hope we doe not, and shall not) as we see in <hi>Iudges</hi> 5. 23. how the Lord is affected in such a case as this: <hi>Curse ye Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosh, saith the Lord, yea curse ye the Inhabitants of Merosh bitterly, because they came not out to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord against the mightie.</hi> Marke, not because they did them any wrong,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14686:15"/>
but because <hi>they came not out,</hi> but sate still; and you know the rule; <note n="n" place="margin">Qui cum possit malum non impedit, mali est act or potius quam qui id facit. <hi>Thucydides Historiae, l.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>He that keepeth not off an iniurie when he may, doth it.</hi> Againe, marke the ground why they came not out, because it was <hi>to helpe the Lord against the mightie:</hi> when the enemies were mightie, they had respect to their owne safetie, and sate still; and the phrase is to be obserued chiefely, <hi>they came not out to helpe the Lord:</hi> it was not to helpe the Lord, but to helpe the Churches at that time: but yet the Lord takes it as done to himselfe. So I say, as the Lord will take it ill if we doe it not: So againe, if we doe it, he will take it exceeding well at our hands. This worke hath meat in the mouth of it, it will bring <note n="o" place="margin">Prou. 11. 18.</note> 
               <hi>a sure reward with it.</hi> Euen as <note n="p" place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>the Arke when it was harbored by Obed-Edom &amp; others, it brought a blessing,</hi> you know, <hi>to them.</hi> So certainly the Church brings a blessing to them that defends it: whereas on the other side, <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. cap. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>when the Arke was violated and ill vsed by the Philistines, and the men of Beth shemesh,</hi> you know <hi>how many thousands were slaine for it.</hi> Whence I gather, if God would doe so much for that which had but a typicall holinesse, that which was but a dead Temple, where he dwelt but for a time; what will he doe, if this liuing Temple be destroyed? For the <hi>people of God are a</hi>

               <hi>liuing Temple. Ier.</hi> 2. 3, it is said there, <hi>Israel is an hallowed thing, he is my first fruits, therefore he that deuours it shall offend,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14686:16"/>
and euill shall come to him, saith the Lord:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in helping the Church of God from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deuoured by strangers, we helpe an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed people, as we see the Lord reckoned <hi>Israel,</hi> though they were subiect to many failings. I say, let vs be stirred vp to do it with all diligence: we may fall out and in at home, and the vicissitude of faire and foule weather within our owne Horizon may passe away and blowe ouer, as I hope it will, and I pray God it may: yet in the meane time, if any of the Churches bee swallowed vp, you know that it is a thing that cannot bee recalled: and therefore let vs do our best, and do it in time. And this I will be bold to say for our incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, they are the Churches of God; and there is a God in heauen that tenders them, and he is a God that <note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 22. 14.</note> 
               <hi>delights to be seene in the Mount,</hi> even when things are past hope; and though their enemies be exceeding great and mighty; yet when they go about to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the Church, they are as an <note n="t" place="margin">Zach. 12. 2, 3, 6.</note> 
               <hi>heape of strawe that goes about to oppresse a Coale of fire that will consume them;</hi> or as <hi>one that deuoureth a cup of poyson that will proue his death; or as one that goes about to ouerthrow a great stone that will fall downe againe and bruise him to powder:</hi> they are all the Scriptures expressions, as you shall finde them in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. though wee haue not leisure to quote the particular places. So, I say, will the Lord deale with the enemies of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14686:16"/>
Church, and will preserue her: Therefore let this hope incourage vs to do it: and for those who haue greatest power and opportunity of doing good in this businesse, let them consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that excellent speech of <hi>Mordecay</hi> to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Hester</hi> 4. 24. saith <hi>Mordecay</hi> to her, <hi>If thou holdest thy tongue at this time, deliuerance shall appeare to the Iewes from another place, but thou and thy house shall perish.</hi> The meaning is this; there was then an opportunity of doing good to the Church, (you know then what extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity the <hi>Iewes</hi> were in;) therefore saith he, if thou do it not, <hi>Thou and thine house shall perish.</hi> So if any be impediments; nay if they do not their best; I pronounce this in the name of the most true God, that will make it good sooner or later, They and their houses shall perish: they shall be as the straw we spake of before, that oppresseth the Coale of fire. So I say againe on the other side; if they seeke to deliuer the Churches from their and her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, there is this great aduantage in it, it will moue God to deliuer them from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againe, and to deliuer them: as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith; <note n="u" place="margin">Prov. 16. 7.</note> 
               <hi>When a mans waies please the Lord, hee will make his enemies be at peace with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, wherein I will bee very <note place="margin">3. Vse.</note> briefe; let vs bee exhorted to liue this life of grace, that is, to doe the duties of obedience, wherewith this life is nourished and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For so the Lord saith, <note n="x" place="margin">Leuit. 18. 5.</note> 
               <hi>He that keepeth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14686:17"/>
my Commandements, shall liue in them:</hi> euen as the Flower liues in the oyle; as the creature liues by foode: So man liues by keeping the Commandements of God; that is, this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, this life of grace; it is maintained by doing the Commandements: whereas euery motion out of the wayes of God, and into sinne, is like the motion of the fish out of the water; euery motion is a motion to death: and oh that we could thinke of sinne as a motion to death, and of euery good action as a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on towards life; that wee could thinke this life of grace farre more excellent then the life of nature, or of sinfull lusts, pleasures, and delights; for so it is. For surely the life that God and Angels liue, it must needes bee the most excellent, and fullest of ioy; and this life they liue. And to incourage vs to it, let vs consider, how God interlaceth this life of grace with the life of ioy, of peace, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prosperity; as you see in diuers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <note n="y" place="margin">Iudges 8.</note> 
               <hi>Gideon while he</hi> did the actions of this life, you know how he prospered; but when he set vp a golden Ephod, after which the people went a whoring, it was the destruction of him and his house. <note n="z" place="margin">2 Chron. cap. 1. to 8.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> how glorious was his rising, like a bright morning without cloudes, and so he continued till the euening of his life; but when he begunne to suffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions in his Kingdome against God in matter of religion; as it is said, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Kings 11. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Hee set vp
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14686:17"/>
Ashteroth the abhomination of the Zidonians, and Milcom the abhomination of the Ammonites, &amp;c.</hi> then God stirred vp rebellions against him: <note n="b" place="margin">1 Kinges 11. 9. to the end of the Chap.</note> 
               <hi>Then it is said, that Hadad, and Reisin, and Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boham his owne seruant lift vp his hand against</hi> him; as it is said in the text, <hi>the Lord stirred him vp for that cause;</hi> so that as long as <hi>Solomon</hi> did the actions of this life, God prospered him continually in high degree; when hee fell from it, he fell from his peace that hee had. So God interlaceth the life of grace, with the life of ioy, and peace, and outward prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And the like you see in his son <hi>Rehoboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for 3. yeeres:</hi> when <hi>hee sought</hi> the Lord, saith the text, and did the actions of this life, 2. <hi>Chro. 11. 17. so long he prospered,</hi> things went well with him and in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but after 3. yeeres hee forsooke the Lord and suffered the people to make them high places; then, saith the text, <hi>in the 5. yeere of his reigne</hi> (God gaue him 2. yeeres respite) <note n="c" place="margin">2 Chron. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>hee powred out his wrath vpon him and vpon Ierusalem by the hand of Shishak King of Aegipt; because they had transgressed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord.</hi> Where it is to bee obserued, that it was not because that <hi>Shishak</hi> the King of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> was angry with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> for it is not said it was <hi>Shishaks</hi> wrath, but the <note n="*" place="margin">Verse 5. Thus saith the Lord: Ye haue forsaken me, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I left you in the hand of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shak.</hi>
               </note> Lords wrath, <hi>Shishak</hi> was but the instrument: he was but the viol through which it was powred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. But an example you shall finde of this most cleare in <hi>Vzziah, 2. Chro.</hi> 26. 5. it is said,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14686:18"/>
               <hi>Vzziah sought the Lord all the daies of Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah the Prophet,</hi> and <hi>as long as hee sought the Lord, God made him to prosper.</hi> As long as hee did the actions of this life, the life of ioy, prosperity and peace, ran along with it. But after, in <hi>vers. 10. when the Lord had helped him that hee grew mighty, then</hi> (saith the text) <hi>his heart was lifted up to destruction;</hi> that, euen as you see blasings Comets (though they be but Comets) yet as long as they keepe aloft, they shine bright; but when they begin to decline from their pitch, they fall to the earth. So when men forsake the Lord, and mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, then they lose their light, and are dissipated, and come to destruction: Whereas on the other side, you see all holy and good Kings that liued the life of grace constantly, they shined in the dark World, as Stars in a dark night, neither losing their light nor fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from their place. And this you shall finde in al the Stories of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudah;</hi> that either the suffering of Idolatry and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition at home, or the resting vpon Ashur and Egypt abroad, was the cause of all their miseries. For when they were in distresses they sought to these nations that proued <note n="d" place="margin">Isay 36. 6.</note> 
               <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reeds,</hi> that <hi>did not onely deceiue them,</hi> but <hi>run into their sides.</hi> On the other side, you may obserue, that those that liued this life of grace perfectly, whose hearts were with God, that they emptied out all the old leauen of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14686:18"/>
and superstition at home, and in all their distresses, they trusted vpon God: And you shall finde it proportionablie, as they did it more or lesse, so they prospered. As you may see in <hi>Asa;</hi> it is the Prophets owne speech to him from the Lord in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 7. 8. saith he, <hi>Because thou hast relied on the King of Syriah, &amp; not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore is the hoast of the King of Syriah escaped out of thine hand: were not the Aethiopians and the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims an huge hoast, with very many chariots and horsemen?

Geber, because
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14686:19"/>
hee had ioined with Ahaziah the son of Achab,</hi> 2. Chron. 20. the last verses. I might giue you many examples (I must not goe beyond my time) <hi>Iacob,</hi> though the thing that he did was good, as you know hee might seeke the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing lawfully; for it was promised to him: yet because hee vsed euill meanes, <hi>Rebeccha and hee vsed ill means,</hi> a lye, you know what it cost him: <hi>hee</hi> was banished from his Fathers house many yeeres; and you know how much sorrow <hi>Rebeccha</hi> had for it, euen for failing in the manner. So <hi>Dauid,</hi> looke what his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions were in doing the actions of this life, this spirituall life, you see likewise his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were: and therefore let vs bee exhorted to liue this life of grace, seeing we haue so great incouragements: I say, if you obserue throughout the scriptures, and aboue all other places from the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. to the end of the book, which is exceeding well worth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, where you haue not onely the Stories of the Kings set downe, but the causes of all the accidents that did befall them; wee see all along, as they liued this life of grace, as they did the actions of this life, that is, as they kept their hearts perfect with <hi>God,</hi> so their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ioy and prosperity was accordingly; and the interruption and intermission they found in that, was according to their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in this. And therefore let vs bee exhorted to liue this life. For certainely,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14686:19"/>
euery life hath an excellency, hath a sweetnes in it, more then any meere being; and as any life exceedes another, so it hath it more: as the life of a man exceeds the life of a beast, so the life of grace exceeds the life of a man: and therefore it is capacious of greater ioy, and of greater grief. On the other side; as you know the <hi>ioy of the Saints is vnspeakable and glorious, and passeth all vnderstanding;</hi> so the despaire and horror of conscience againe, exceeds as much. And let vs marke this; that as hee that liues the life of a beast, destroies himselfe as a man; So hee that liues the life of a man, that is, the life of reason only, the life of a humane wisedome and pollicie, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies himselfe as a Christian. Therefore let vs bee exhorted to liue this spirituall life of grace: it is the best for our selues; yea let vs abound in the Actions of this life as much as may bee; <hi>For one man may liue more in a day then another man doth in a yeare.</hi> For life is <hi>in the action;</hi> so much as wee doe, as farre as wee exercise this spirituall life, so much wee liue: and looke what time is spent vainly and idlely, so much of our life death possesseth: as in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 3. it is said, <hi>The woman that liues in pleasure is dead while shee liueth.</hi>
