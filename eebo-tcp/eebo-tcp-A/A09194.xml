         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Wee will with all our hearts, and Gentle-men we thanke you hartily, for the paines you have taken, and especially, you Master <hi>Vicar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well Gentlemen (quoth I) we have now done a good office, and <hi>Beere-Cart,</hi> they are much beholding unto you.</p>

               <p>So are wee; for you have made us wiser then wee were, in understanding the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and misdemeanors either of them are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto, for which wee, and the world shall heartily thanke you.</p>

               <p>I could indeede say much more, but I am in good hope of their agreement, and they will not faile but visit our house three or foure times in the weeke, to see how their brother <hi>Beere-cart</hi> does; and with what liquor hee is laden.</p>
               <p>So now (quoth I) wee have made (honest friends, and good-fellowes, <hi>Coach</hi> and <hi>Sedan</hi>) an end of your businesse; Mr. <hi>Surveyor,</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Master <hi>Vicar,</hi> we will go dispatch our own: which way lies your way?</p>

               <p>To <hi>Westminster</hi>-ward, wee both goe.</p>
               <p>And I into the <hi>Strand</hi>; and for this merry meeting, and old acquaintance sake honest <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> and Master <hi>Surveyor,</hi> I have for you a quart of the best <hi>Canary</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> which I think is at Mr. <hi>Thomas Darlings</hi> (a very honest man) at the Three-tunnes by <hi>Charing-crosse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee will beare you company (quoth they) and so wee three, (leaving the other) departed.</p>
               <p>But in going along, to beguile the way, wee fell I know not how, into discourse, what alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Common-Wealthes, Cities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, Buildings, manners of Men, and Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in apparrell, the Revolution of Time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

to the opinion of man, brought forth; the <hi>Vicar</hi> earnestly maintaining the latter times to be the wisest; as I stiffely maintained the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against him.</p>
               <p>His first Argument was; that wee in our age have more learning then ever, <hi>Ergo,</hi> more wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>I denied his antecedent, replying, <hi>Quod efficit, tale, majus est tali</hi>: meaning the Auncients who were our Masters, aledging <hi>Chaucer</hi>:

               <p>Secondly, The Inventions of latter times farre excelled those of former; I denied that also.</p>
               <p>He instanced Guns, <hi>PRINTING,</hi> Watches, Wind-mills, &amp;c.
