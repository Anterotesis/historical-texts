         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is a piece of Charity to ſhew unto others thoſe Mines that have enriched our ſelves: or the Fountains out of which we have drunk, Cleanſing, quenching, and healing Waters.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:57235:4"/>
acquired skill I have in Theologie, what underſtanding I have got in Holy Scripture,</hi> (under God) <hi>I owe it all to this Authour. Hic vir, Hic eſt.</hi> This is the Man I acknowledge to have been my Maſter, and <hi>Myſtagogus</hi> in Divinis. From him I learned how to uſe <hi>my ſmall</hi> Stock of Humane learning in the purſuit of Divine. By him was my ſoul convinced of the Truth of Scriptures, and ſtored with Arguments to perſwade others, that at leaſt, it was worth their Labour to Try whether practiſe of Scripture Rules would not produce ſubmiſsion to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture. I did not know what a Monſter that <hi>Idol Infallibility</hi> was, till I ſaw it drawn out by his Pencill. I had ſwallowed, and as I thought concocted, the common <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> by a <hi>Full particular Aſſurance.</hi> But when I read this Authour, I perceived that <hi>Plerophorie</hi> was the golden Fruit that grew on the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch, <note place="margin">Faith is an Aſſent to the Truth or Goodneſſe of what God Revealeth in his Word, be it Hiſtory, Myſtery, Precept, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or Threat.</note> not the Firſt ſeed, no not the ſpreading Root, of that <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> by feeding on which the juſt doth live, and that, true <hi>Fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> can grow no faſter then, but ſhoots up juſt parallel with <hi>Fidelitas;</hi> I mean, that true Confidence towards God, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate to ſincere and conſcientious Obedience.</p>
            <p>Before I had Read this Authour, I meaſured Hypocriſie by the groſſe and vulgar Standard: Thinking the Hypocrite had been one that had deceived men like himſelf, but in this Author I found him to be a Man that had attained the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterium Satanae,</hi> even the Art of deluding his own Soul, with unſound, but high perſwaſions of Sanctity: and that, not by the Cubeia, or Cogging of unrighteouſneſſe, but by vertue of ſome One (or more) excellent Quality, wherein he out-ſtrips the very Saints of God.</p>
            <p>From Him I learned many inſtances and exemplifications of that Holy, but heavie Doom, of our Judge, and Saviour, <hi>Luke 16. 15. The things which are in high eſteem with men, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb facs="tcp:57235:4"/>
in the ſight of God.</hi> And that, the <hi>Common Receipts</hi> (if not the <hi>Notions)</hi> of the World touching <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> are as diſtorted, and monſtrous, as if a man ſhould define <hi>an Humble meek man,</hi> by <hi>Cowardiſe:</hi> or a <hi>Prudent Chriſtian,</hi> to be <hi>One, That had conquered his Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end this <hi>Firſt Stage of the Preface;</hi> I muſt profeſſe that I have not onely reaped from this Authors ſowen fields, an Harveſt of knowledge, but ſome weighty ſheaves of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too: He hath ſo convincingly (above others) proved out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and the Pſalms, and the Jews alſo; That our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus is <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> That my ſoul Reſts upon it as upon a Baſis, or Centre immoveable; And I am perſwaded, were his Works tranſlated into Latin, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, (of what Diviſion ſoever, that keeps the foundation) would confeſſe it ſelf Confirmed by him, and a Debtor to him.</p>
            <p>And now having this opinion rooted in my heart, I hope the Reader will approve, at leaſt pardon; if I pronounce this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, <hi>The Divine,</hi> of his Rank, and Age: and if in token of my private thankfulneſs for good received from him, I breath out, firſt towards Heaven, <hi>Benedic Anima mea Domino,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 103. and then <hi>towards men on earth, tokens of good will,</hi> and wiſhes.</p>

Bleſſed were the Places where theſe Apoſtolical Feet of Beauty trod,
<pb facs="tcp:57235:5"/>
when he went abroad <hi>Evangelizans pacem, Evangelizans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> And bleſſed be the memory of that man, whoſe hand (like the hand in the Margin) pointed out firſt unto me this Author. His name is ſweet, and his Bones <note place="margin">N. F.</note> ſhall one day flouriſh out of their Duſt.</p>
            <p>If Others at the firſt view, (Nay after ſome Readings and Reviews) of this Author come not up to my Rate, or eſteem of Him, I have their Excuſe as ready in my Pen, as mine own Blame is freſh in my memory. For when a Fatherly friend of mine (M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>F.</hi> of happy Memory, thinking my younger yeers had need of ſuch an Inſtructor) commended this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor unto my Reading; for ſome good time after, I wiſhed he had lent me his underſtanding together with this Book: Yet with conſtant and frequent Reading, I firſt began to like, at laſt I maſtered, and made mine own, ſo much of him as ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to improve, and impart his Sence to others: I often took his matter, and preparing it to their Capacity, preached it in popular Auditories. I ſhame not to tell this, becauſe I know my Title to it was juſt by Donation, not by <hi>Plagium.</hi> The Author intended it for this purpoſe: His very deſigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to afford helps to younger Students; to the Abler, Hints and provocations for ſearches into the leſſe beaten but more profitable paths, the abſtruſer but Richer veins of Theologie.</p>
            <p>It is to be expected that two Objections will <hi>militare</hi> againſt the Labours of this great Authour, and either break the Arms, (weaken the hands at leaſt) or Dazel, if not darken, the Eyes of the Induſtrious Reader. The One is, That his Stile is obſcure. The Other, That his Doctrine is Arminian. The ſecond part of this Preface will endeavour (with humility and Reaſon) to ſatisfie them. And to the former of theſe I anſwer; His Stile is Full and deep, which makes the Purity of it ſeem a kind of Blackneſſe, or darkneſſe; and though it abound in ſubſtantiall adjectives, yet it is more ſhort then other Authours, in Relatives, in <hi>Eeking</hi> and helping par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, becauſe he writ to Schollers. His ſtream Runs full, but alwayes in it own Channel, and within the Banks; if any will yet ſay it overflows, He muſt give me leave to tell him, It then inriches the Ground. His Pen drops Principles, as frequent as ordinary mens do ſence. His matter is rare; His Notions, uncouth parcels of Truth, digged <hi>

                  </gap> profundo,</hi> and ſo at firſt Aſpect look like ſtrangers to the Ordinary Intellect, but with Patience and Uſance will ceaſe to be ſo. And the Reader ſhall aſſuredly find this moſt certain token of true Worth in Him, that the more he is
<pb facs="tcp:57235:5"/>
acquainted with, the better he ſhall like Him. The probability of this proof I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from one of thoſe <hi>Reſponſa prudentum,</hi> which long ſince I read in <hi>Plutarch.</hi> A profeſſed Orator had made a ſpeech for One, who upon the firſt reading, went about the conning of it with much cheerfulneſſe and contentment; but after 2 or 3 dayes familiarity and Repetition, had begot a <hi>Faſtidium,</hi> he came to the Orator and told him; Sir at the firſt or ſecond reading, I liked this Oration very well, but now, I am quite of another mind, to ſay the truth, I loath it heartily; Well ſayes the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, how oft mean you to ſpeak this Oration to the People, any more then Once? No, ſaid he, But once onely. Go your way then, They will like it as well as you did at firſt Time, I warrant you. But Reader, if thou wilt believe above twenty yeers Experience or Converſation with this Author, Thou wilt find at every return, new matter both of Obſervation and delight in Him.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond Objection. It will be found a meer Noiſe; The phanſie of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate mind. The Reader muſt in juſtice Examine the particulars, before he paſſe his judgement, and then in wiſdom, not ſuffer himſelf to be deprived of a rich Treaſure, upon poor Pretences. It would fret a ſon of Valour, to find himſelf Robbed by a weakling and a Coward, that had firſt poſſeſſed his phanſie that ſome <hi>Viſors</hi> (ſupported with ſtakes in the Twilight) were ſtout Fellows ready to come in, if he did not deliver his Gold.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I may with modeſty averre, That there is not one word in this Volume, that (to my thinking) can poſſibly be ſo forced, or wreſted by the diſſenting, as to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>I</hi> find him through the whole Body of his Writings moſt Religiouſly Carefull to give unto God the Things that be Gods, even the <hi>glory of his Grace,</hi> his moſt <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous Grace</hi> in Chriſt preventing, exciting, furthering, and making to perſevere in all works or courſes of Chriſtianity, and that ſo requiſite and intrinſecall to every holy Action, that all our ſufficiency is from it. By the <hi>Grace of God</hi> we are what we are, and do what we do. And ſurely had the great Goodneſſe of the Lord been Taught and tendered, in ſuch manner as this Author ſets it forth, This Age had felt it ſelf better Thriven in Chriſtianity, and in the power of godlineſſe, then it now is. Sin had not ſo abounded, but Grace had ſuperabounded, and reigned through righteouſneſſe unto eternall life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Nor can any man (think <hi>I)</hi> produce one paſſage, that intimates, much leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs any inordinate prelation of <hi>The ſtrength of Nature,</hi> He making the chief uſe of that poor Remnat of Free-will left in us ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> to conſiſt not in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting or preparing, but, in our not being ſo untoward patients as we might poſſibly be, in not doing that evil which is in Our power to do.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Nor will any man ſpeak evil of Him, but he that himſelf narrows the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and engroſſes that plenteous ranſome he paid for all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> to ſome ſmall number of ſuch he conceits himſelf to be.</p>
            <p>Finally, if the worſt be Given, that this Objection pretends to, The offence will be much aſſwaged, if the ordinary Reader do but know, That the Lutheran, <hi>i. e.</hi> A conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Reformed Church is of that opinion, and that the other name is uſed moſtly to inflame the <hi>Odium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſumme, This <hi>Man of God</hi> knew he might not Strive, nor multiply queſtions to gender ſtrife: therefore he demands but two <hi>poſtulata</hi> of the diſſenting man. <hi>1 That God hath a True freedom in doing good. 2 That man hath a True freedom in doing evil.</hi> From him that agrees with him in theſe two, he wil not diſſent in other points. <note place="margin">Epiſt. before the Attributes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But from ſuch as teach, <hi>That all events are ſo irreſiſtibly decreed by God, that none can fall out otherwiſe then they do.</hi> Or, <hi>That nothing can be amended that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe;</hi> He juſtly differs. For, beſides that the Tenets be <note n="*" place="margin">See Busbequius Epiſt. 4.</note> Turkiſh,

being preſſed they yield a <hi>morbid</hi> bitter juice, and put out a Forked ſting. Their Conſequent being, that either, <hi>There is no morall evil under the Sun;</hi> or, <hi>That the Fountain of Godneſſe</hi> (who is <hi>Ultor &amp; intentator malorum) his will is the cauſe of ſuch evil.</hi>

But here, if the Reader be of my Temper, <hi>Secretum peto. I</hi> muſt lead him aſide a little to Condole the loſſe (the Great loſs) of one moſt Conſiderable piece, Finiſhed and (Alas for the Day!) loſt ſome yeers ago. It was, <hi>The Treatiſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies,</hi> or, Divine Forewarnings, betokening Blood. <hi>I</hi> am bold to ſay: Reader, <hi>Write this a Prodigie.</hi> And to render it the more Prodigious, take notice, that it was loſt in the Authors Life Time; as his ingenious <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> (M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>B.)</hi> told me, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after it above 9 yeers ago. What ſhall be ſaid or thought of This? Surely, The World was not worthy of ſuch a Bleſsing! It ſentenced it ſelf unworthy thereof, by the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid totall neglect of what he Preached at Court, and Printed at <hi>Oxon:</hi> in the Yeer 1637. about <hi>The Signes of the Times,</hi> a Subject neer of Kin to that Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The longing impatient deſire of Retreiving this Treatiſe, makes me not bluſh to transform this Preface into a kind of Proclamation: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or rather into a moſt humble and earneſt Supplication, unto the Perſon that hath this Treatiſe in keeping, (if yet it be kept from the Malice of the <hi>Deſtroyer)</hi> That he will pleaſe to bring it in unto the <hi>Stationer,</hi> for whom this Book is Printed, upon aſſurance to receive it again; or for it, twelve or twenty Copies, (or a ſum of Money Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent) if it be Printed: For it is the deſire and deſigne of more, and more able men, then my ſelf, to Collect and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh This Authors Works as Compleat as poſsibly may be.</p>
            <p>The Earneſt whereof is Given in this Firſt Volume; with this further Account. The <hi>Quarto</hi> Impreſsion was ſcarce and dear, and ill Printed. The weighty and many Quotations of Authors ſo exceeding falſly figured, (and disfigured too) that it coſt ſo much Time and great Turning, ſometimes to finde out One ſingle place, as none can believe, that hath not tried the like: nor could all the Authors be found in <hi>London.</hi> This the <hi>Famous Library of Oxon:</hi> and the chearfull Candor of a <hi>learned Friend</hi> there ſupplied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57235:7"/>
I am hopefull that the Authors Sence is not altered in the leaſt meaſure, (for the leaſt ſin in that kind is ſacriledge.) I am ſure, I was ſo ſcrupulouſly carefull of changing, as that I have omitted what I thought neceſſary correction. For example, in the Epiſtle to the Reader, line 12. I think, I ought to have changed the word <hi>Conſcience,</hi> into <hi>Conſcious,</hi> or, <hi>leſſe conſcience,</hi> into <hi>more conſcientious;</hi> unleſſe you will ſay, <hi>Conſcience</hi> there ſignifies <hi>Guilt.</hi> So Page the 12. Line 3. after And yet—Theſe two words, <hi>They perſecuted,</hi> ſhould be inſerted, as I conjecture; unleſſe the compariſon betwixt the Roman and Turkiſh Emperours Subjects make them needleſſe. So in the 250 page in the Margin, ſurely it ought to have been <hi>R. P.</hi> but it was <hi>R. B.</hi> in the old Copie, and in the ſearch of <hi>Parſons</hi> Reſolutions, not finding abſolute evidence that he was the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meant, I let <hi>R. B.</hi> ſtand.</p>
            <p>Yet have I added now and then, a Citation or Note in the Margin. As where the <hi>Great Buſineſſe of Charles Martell</hi> is Related page 110. I have cited divers Authours, whom the Reader may conſult, for his own better ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>To conclude, There is a ſaying, and men may think, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But, the pecuniary profit be to the Tradeſman. If my heart deceive me not, as divers <hi>Nutus Dei</hi> did invite the beginning, and many remarkable <hi>momenta providentiae</hi> did encourage the Progreſſe, (in a Time of greateſt trouble for outward eſtate) ſo the Glory of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> the Benefit of his Church and Children, the doing of ſome ſmall Thing (in a Time of Caſhierment) that may tend to the diſcharge of a moſt unprofitable ſervants account at the laſt Day, is the gain aimed at. And if our Pr: Brethren (Sons of the ſame Fathers with us) that caſt us out, viewing well the ſecond and third Books, and being here advertiſed, That twenty of thoſe men, whom they have put from the Stations (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God had ſet them in the Church of <hi>England,)</hi> as Factors for

            <byline>Written by a late Fellow of the ſame Colledge.</byline>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing earneſtly deſired by an intimate and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend, to deliver ſome</hi> Character <hi>of that Reverend and Learned Doctor</hi> Jackſon, <hi>(late Preſident of our Colledge) I might very well excuſe my ſelf from my unworthineſs to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo weighty a Task. I muſt ſeriouſly confeſs, it was not ſo much the</hi> Importunity of that Friend, <hi>which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, as</hi> the Merit of the man which Extracted it, <hi>and made me reſolve rather to run any hazard of my own Reputation, then not to pay the Honours due to his Memory. The Reſpect and
<pb facs="tcp:57235:9"/>
Intereſt which he gained in the hearts of all men that he converſed with, (and moſt from them that knew him beſt) was too great to be buried in this Grave, or to be extinct with his Perſon. A good Name is compared to a rich and pleaſant</hi> Odour, <hi>which not only affects the Senſe, whileſt he that wears it, is in preſence, but fils the the houſe, and makes you enquire, who had been there, although the Party be gone out of the Room. For his</hi> Birth, <hi>He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from a very worthy Family in the Biſhoprick of</hi> Durham, <hi>His Life ſeemed to be Conſecrated to Vertue, and the Liberal Arts, from his very child-hood: He had a natural Propenſity to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from which no other</hi> Recreation <hi>or</hi> Employment <hi>could divert him. He was firſt deſigned (by his Parents) to be a Merchant in</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>where many of his near Friends and Alliance lived in great Wealth and Proſperity; but neither could that Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay hold upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore (at the inſtance of a Noble</hi> Lord) <hi>he was ſent to the</hi> Univerſity of Oxford, <hi>for which highly eſteemed Favour he returns his ſolemn thanks, in the very</hi> Firſt Words, <hi>and</hi> Entrance <hi>of this Book. He was firſt Planted in</hi> Queens Colledge, <hi>under the Care and Tuition of the</hi> Profound <hi>D.</hi> Crakanthorp, <hi>and from thence removed to</hi> Corpus Chriſti <hi>Colledge, who although he had no notice of the vacancy of the Place, till the day before the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he Anſwered with ſo much readineſs and applauſe, that he gained the admiration, as well as the Suffrages of the Electors, and was</hi> choſen with full Conſent, <hi>although they had received Letters of</hi> Favour <hi>from</hi> Great Men <hi>for another</hi> Scholer. <hi>A ſure and Honourable Argument of the incorruptedneſs of that Place,</hi> when the peremptory <hi>Mandamus</hi> of the Pious Founder, Nec pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, nec pretio, <hi>(preſented with the Merits of a young man and a Stranger, ſhall prevail more then all other Sollicitations, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities whatſoever. This Reſolution hath been often aſſured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me from one of the Electors (yet living) M.</hi> John Hore <hi>of</hi> Weſt Hendred, <hi>a man of Reverend years and Goodneſs. There
<pb facs="tcp:57235:9"/>
was now a welcome neceſsity layd upon him, to preſerve the High O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which was conceived of him, which he did in a Studious and Exemplary Life, not ſubject to the uſual intemperances of that Age. Certainly the Divel could not find him idle, nor at leiſure to have the Suggeſtions of Vice whiſpered into his ear. And although many in their youthful times have their Deviations, and Exorbitancies, which afterwards prove Reformed and Excellent men. Yet it pleaſed God to keep him in a conſtant Path of Vertue and Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He had not been long admitted into this place, but that he was made more Precious, and better Eſtimated by all that knew him, by the very danger that they were in ſuddenly to have parted with him: For walking out with others of the Younger company to waſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, He was in imminent peril of being</hi> Drowned. The Depth cloſed him round about, the Weeds were wrapt about his head. He went down to the bottom of the Mountains, the Earth with her bars was about him for ever, yet God brought his ſoul from Corruption, <hi>Jonah 2. 5, 6. that (like</hi> Moſes <hi>from the flags) for the future Good of the Church, and Government of the Colledge where he lived, there might be preſerved the meekeſt man alive, or (like</hi> Jonas) there might be a Prophet revived <hi>(as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he proved)</hi> to forwarn the people of enſuing deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>if peradventure they might Repent, and God might revoke the Judgements pronounced againſt them, and ſpare this great and ſinful Nation. It was a long (and almoſt incredible) ſpace of time wherein he lay under water, and before a Boat could be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which was ſent for, rather to take out his Body (before it floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) for a decent Funeral, then out of hopes of recovery of Life. The Boatman diſcerning where he was by the bubling of the water, (the last ſigns of a man Expiring) thruſt down his hook at that very moment, which by happy Providence (at the firſt Eſſay) light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under his arm, and brought him up into the Boat. All the parts of his Body were ſwollen to a</hi> Vaſt <hi>proportion, and although by
<pb facs="tcp:57235:10"/>
holding his head downward they let forth much water, yet no hopes of Life appeared, therefore they brought him to the Land, and lapped him up in the Gowns of his Fellow-Students, the beſt ſhrowd that Love or Neceſsity could provide. After ſome warmth and former means renewed, they perceived that Life was yet within him, conveyed him to the Colledge, and commended him to the skil of Doctor</hi> Channel, <hi>an Eminent Phyſitian of the ſame Houſe, where with much Care, Time, and Difficulty, he recovered to the equal joy and wonder of the whole Society. All men concluded him to be reſerved for High and Admirable Purpoſes. His grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgements towards the Fiſherman and his Servants that took him up, knew no limits, being a conſtant Revenue to them whil'ſt he lived. For his thankfulneſs to Almighty God no heart could conceive, nor Tongue expreſs it but his own, often commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the Miracle of Divine mercy in his deliverance, and reſolving hereafter</hi> not to live to himſelf, but to God that raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the dead. <hi>Neither did he ſerve God</hi> with that which coſt him nothing; <hi>I muſt ranck his</hi> abundant CHarity, <hi>and</hi> Riches of his Liberality <hi>amongſt the Virtues of his firſt years, as if he would ſtrive with his Friends, Patron, and Benefactors,</hi> Utrum illi largiendo, an ipſe diſpergendo vinceret, Whether they ſhould be more bountiful in giving, or he in diſperſing: <hi>Or that he was reſolved to pay the Ranſome of his life into Gods Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, which is the Bodies of the Poor. His heart was ſo free &amp; enlarged in this kind, that very often his</hi> Alms-deed <hi>made him more Rich that received it, then it left him that gave it. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the ſtudy of Divinity was ſomething early, becauſe (as he well conſidered) the journey that he intended was very far, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out large and good Proviſions for the way. No man made better uſe of Humane knowledge, in ſubſervience to the Eternal Truths of God, produced more Teſtimonies of Heathens to convert themſelves, and make them ſubmit the Rich Preſents of their Wiſe-Men, to the Cradle and Croſs of Chriſt. He was furniſhed with all the
<pb facs="tcp:57235:10"/>
Learned Languages, Arts, and Sciences, as the praevious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or</hi> Beautifull Gate <hi>which led him to the</hi> Temple; <hi>but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi> Metaphyſicks, <hi>as the next in attendance, and most neceſſary</hi> Hand-maid <hi>to Divinity, which was the Mistreſs where all his thoughts were fixed, being wholly taken up with the</hi> Love <hi>and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified. The Reading to younger Scholers, and ſome Employments impoſed by the Founder, were rather Recreations and Aſsiſtances, then divertiſements from that intended Work. The Offices which he undertook (out of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not Deſire)</hi> were never the moſt profitable, but the more ingenuous; <hi>not ſuch as might</hi> fill his Purſe, <hi>but</hi> encreaſe his knowledge. <hi>It was no ſmall acceſsion of Reſpect unto him, (or rather a conſequent of the good Repute which he had already gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that thoſe two Noble Hoſtages, (M.</hi> Edward, <hi>and M.</hi> Richard Spencers, <hi>Sons to the Right Honourable</hi> Robert, <hi>Lord</hi> Spencer, <hi>Baron of</hi> Wormleighton) <hi>were commended to his charge, whom he reſtored fully inſtructed with all good Literature, the glory of Learned and Religious Nobility, and the very Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Countrey where they lived; for which faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his great Truſt, he (and his Memory) were ever in ſingular Veneration with that whole Family, and their Alliances. His Diſcourſe was very Facetious (without offence) when Time, and Place, and Equality of Perſons permitted it. He was</hi> Entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens, <hi>(as our Neighbours ſpeak it) a man (upon occaſions offered)</hi> of Univerſal Converſation. <hi>When he was choſen into Office, the Governour of the Colledge was wont to give this Teſtimony of him,</hi> That he was a man moſt ſincere in Elections, <hi>and that in a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious victory of younger wits, it was the ſafeſt</hi> experiment <hi>for an happy choiſe, to follow the</hi> Omen <hi>of his</hi> Judgement. <hi>He read a Lecture of Divinity in the Colledge every Sunday morning, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day of the week at</hi> Pembroke Colledge <hi>(then newly erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) by the inſtance of the Maſter, and Fellows there. He was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Vice-Preſident for many years together, who by his place was to
<pb facs="tcp:57235:11"/>
moderate the Diſputations in Divinity. In all theſe He demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf with great depth of Learning,</hi> far from that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which puſſeth up, <hi>but accompanied with all gentleneſſe, courteſie, humility, and moderation. From the Colledge, he was preferred to a Living in the Biſhoprick of Durham (in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) and from thence (with conſent from the ſame Colledge obtained, where no requeſt could be denied him) removed to the Vicaridge of</hi> New-Caſtle, <hi>a very populous Town, furniſhed with multitudes of men, and no ſmall variety of Opinions. It was a difficult task, (and onely worthy of ſo pious an Undertaker) ſo to become All Things to All men, that by all means he might gain ſome. This was the place where he was firſt appointed by his friends to be a Merchant; but he choſe rather to be</hi> a Factor for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>One precious ſoul refined, poliſhed, and fitted for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters uſe, preſented by him, was of more value to him, then all other Purchaſes whatſoever. He adorned the doctrine of the Goſpel (which he preached and profeſſed) with a ſutable life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: Manifeſting the ſignes of a true Apoſtle. In all things ſhewing himſelf a Pattern of good-works; In doctrine incorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, gravity, ſincerity, ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemned, that they which were of the</hi> contrary part might be aſhamed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no evil thing to ſay of him, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I lately received letters from a Gentleman, who lived there at the ſame time with him, who gave this Teſtimony of him. He was a man very ſtudious, humble, courteous, and charitable. At New-Caſtle (when he went out) what money he had, he uſually gave to the poor, who at length flocked ſo unto him, that his ſervant took care that he had not too much in his pocket. At a certaine time Doctor</hi> Henderſon, <hi>the Towns Phyſitian, his neighbour and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance, (having made a Purchaſe) ſitting ſad by him, and fetching a ſigh, he demanded what was the reaſon? He ſaid, that he had a payment to make and wanted money: Doctor</hi> Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>bad him be of good chear, for he would furniſh him; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:57235:11"/>
for his ſervant, told him the Phyſitians need, and asked what money he had. The man ſtepping back ſilent, the Doctor bids him ſpeak, at length the man ſaid, Fourty ſhillings; he bad him fetch it, for Maſter</hi> Henderſon <hi>ſhould have it all: at which Maſter</hi> Henderſon <hi>turned his ſadneſſe into laughter Doctor</hi> Jackſon <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his reaſon. He ſaid, that he had need of 400. pound, or 500. pound. Doctor</hi> Jackſon <hi>anſwered, that he thought fourtie ſhillings was a great ſumme, and that he ſhould have it, and more alſo if he had had it. Thus in a</hi> place of buſie Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, <hi>his minde was intent upon better things, willing</hi> to ſpend and to be ſpent for Them, not ſeeking Theirs but Them. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome years of his continuance in this Town, he was invited back again to the Univerſity by the death of the Preſident of the ſame Colledge, being</hi> choſen in his abſence, <hi>at ſo</hi> great a diſtance, <hi>ſo unexpectedly without any</hi> ſuit <hi>or</hi> petition <hi>upon his part, that he knew nothing of the vacancie of the Place, but by the ſame Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that enformed him that it was conferred upon himſelf. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of ſo good account, that it hath been much deſired, and eagerly ſought after by many eminent men, but never before, went ſo far to be accepted of. Upon his return to Oxford, and admiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Government, They found no alteration by his long abſence, and more converſe with the world, but that he appeared</hi> yet more humble <hi>in his elder times; and this not out of coldneſſe and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpirit, but from a prudent choice and experience of a better way: not without a great Example of</hi> Paul <hi>the Aged, who when he had Authority to command that which is convenient, (yet for loves ſake) choſe rather to beſeech,</hi> Epiſtle to Philemon. <hi>He ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a moſt obliging manner, the Fellows, Schollers, Servants, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> Nemo ab eo triſtis diſceſsit, <hi>no man departed from him with a ſad heart, excepting in this particular, that by ſome miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, or willing errour, they had created Trouble, or given any offence unto him. He uſed the</hi> Friends <hi>as well as the</hi> Memorie <hi>of his</hi> Predeceſſors <hi>fairly. He was</hi> Preſidens pacificus, <hi>a lover
<pb facs="tcp:57235:12"/>
and maker of Peace. He ſilenced and compoſed all differences, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures, and animoſities by a prudent Impartiality, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his own ſweet diſpoſition. All men taking notice that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more hatefull unto him then Hatred it ſelf, nothing more offenſive to his body, and mind, it was a ſhame and cruelty (as well as preſumption) to afflict his peaceable ſpirit. It is a new and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Art of Diſcipline, but ſucceſſefully practiſed by him, that thoſe under his Authority were kept within Bounds and Order, not ſo much out of fear of the Penalty, as out of love to the Governour. He took notice of that which was good in the worſt men, and made that an occaſion to commend them for the goods ſake; and living himſelf,</hi> tanquam nemini ignoſceret, <hi>as if he were ſo ſevere, that he could forgive no man, yet he reſerved large Pardons for the imperfections of others. His nature was wholly compoſed of the properties of Charity it ſelf. Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind, &amp;c. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things. I can truely avouch this teſtimony concerning him, that living in the ſame Colledge with him, more then twenty years, (partly when he was Fellow, and partly when he returned Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) I never heard (to my beſt remembrance) one word of Anger, or diſlike againſt him. I have often reſembled him in my thoughts (with favour of that honourable Perſon, be it ſpoken) to him (whoſe name ſounds very near him) who being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dr. Juxon.</note> 
               <hi>in the upper part of the World, carried on his Dignity with that Juſtice, Modeſty, Integrity, Fidelity, and other gracious plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, that in a place of Truſt, he contented thoſe whom he could not ſatisfie, and in a place of Envie procured the Love of them who amulated his greatneſſe, and by his Example ſhewed the preheminence and ſecurity of true Chriſtian Wiſdom, before all the ſleights of humane Policie, that in a buſie time no man was found to accuſe him; So</hi> this good Man <hi>(in that inferiour Orb which God had placed him) demeaned himſelf with that Chriſtian Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, Candor, Wiſdom, and Modeſty, that malice it ſelf was more
<pb facs="tcp:57235:12"/>
wary then to caſt any aſperſions upon him. I ſhall willingly aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Him to thoſe other Worthies his Predeceſſors in the ſame Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (all living at the ſame time) To the invaluable Biſhop Jewel,</hi> Theologorum quas Orbis Chriſtianus per aliquot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum centenarios produxit maximo, <hi>as grave Biſhop</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win <hi>hath deſcribed him, the greateſt Divine that for ſome former Centuries of years the Chriſtian World hath produced. To the famous</hi> Mr. Hooker, <hi>who for his ſolid Writings was ſirnamed,</hi> The Judicious, <hi>and entitled by the ſame, Theologorum Oxonium.</hi> The Oxford of Divines, <hi>as One calls</hi> Athens, <hi>The Greece of Greece it ſelf. To the learned</hi> Dr. Reinolds, <hi>who managed the Government of the ſame Colledge, with the like care, honour, and integrity, although not with the ſame auſterities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He willingly admitted (and was much delighted in) the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and familiarity of hopeful young Divines, not deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their youth, but accounting them as ſonnes and Brethren, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and adviſing them what Books to read, and with what holy preparations, lending them ſuch Books as they had need of, and hoping withall that (conſidering the brevity of his own life) ſome of them might live to finiſh that work upon the</hi> Creed, <hi>which he had happily begun unto them. This was one of the ſpecial advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and directions which he commended to young men.</hi> Hear the Dictates of your own Conſcience: Quod dubitas ne feceris, <hi>making this the Comment upon that of</hi> Syracides, <hi>In all thy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> truſt <hi>(or beleeve)</hi> thine own ſoul, <hi>and bear it not down by impetuous and contradictious luſts, &amp;c. He was as diffuſive of his knowledge, counſel, and advice, as of any other his works of Mercie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all the Hiſtories of learned, pious, and devout men, you ſhall ſcarcely meet with one that diſdained the World more generouſly: not out of ignorance of it, as one brought up in Cells and darkneſſe, for he was known and endeared to men of the moſt reſplendent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; nor out of melancholy diſpoſition, for he was chearfull and
<pb facs="tcp:57235:13"/>
content in all eſtates, but out of a due and deliberate ſcorne, knowing</hi> the true value, <hi>that is,</hi> the vanitie <hi>of it. As perferments were heaped upon him without his ſuit, or knowledge, ſo there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his power to give, which he was not ready and willing to part withall, to the deſerving or indigent man. His Vicarage of St.</hi> Nicholas <hi>Church in New-Caſtle, he gave to Mr.</hi> Alvye <hi>of Trinity Colledge, upon no other relation, but out of the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which he conceived of his merits. The Vicarage of</hi> Witny <hi>neer</hi> Oxford, <hi>after he had been at much pains, travail, and expence to clear the Title of the Rectory to all ſucceeding Miniſters, when he had made it a Portion ſitting either to give, or keep, he freely beſtowed it upon the worthy Mr.</hi> Thomas White, <hi>then Proctor of the Univerſity, late Chaplain to the Colledge, and now Incumbent upon the Rectory. A Colledge Leaſe, of a place called</hi> Lye <hi>in</hi> Glouceſterſhire <hi>preſented to him as a gratuity by the Fellows, he made over to a Third, (late Fellow there) meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a plea of Poverty. And whereas they that firſt offered it unto him were unwilling that he ſhould relinquiſh it, and held out for a long time in a dutifull oppoſition, He uſed all his power, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and importunity with them, till at length he prevailed to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it. Many of his neceſſary friends, and attendance have profeſſed that they made ſeverall journeys, and employed all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull mediation with the Biſhop, that he might not be ſuffered to reſigne his</hi> Prebendſhip <hi>of</hi> Wincheſter <hi>to a Fourth; and upon knowledge that by their contrivance, he was diſappointed of his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution herein, he was much offended that the</hi> Manus mortua, <hi>or</hi> Law of Mortmain <hi>ſhould be impoſed upon him, whereby in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dayes they reſtrained the liberality of devout men toward the Colledges, and the Clergie. But this was interpreted as a diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and diſ-ſervice unto him, who knew that it was</hi> a more Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing to give then to receive. <hi>But that which remained unto him, was diſperſed unto the Poor, to whom he was a faithfull diſpenſer in all places of his abode, diſtributing unto them with a</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57235:13"/>
free heart, a bountifull hand, a comfortable ſpeech, and a cheerfull eye. <hi>How diſreſpectfull was he of Mammon, the God of this world, the golden Image which Kings and Potentates have ſet up? before whom the Trumpets play for Warre and ſlaughter, and Nations and Languages fall down and worſhip, beſides all other kinde of Muſick for jollity and delight, to drown (if it were poſsible) the noiſe of Bloud, which is moſt audible, and cries lowdeſt in the ears of the Almighty. How eaſily could he caſt that away, for which others throw away their lives and ſalvation, running headlong into the place of eternall skreekings, weeping, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth. If it were not for this ſpirit of Covetouſneſſe, all the World would be at quiet. Certainly (although the nature of man be an apt ſoil for ſin to flouriſh in, yet) if the</hi> Love of money be the root of all evil, <hi>it could not grow up in him,</hi> becauſe it had no Root: <hi>and if it be ſo hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God, and the narrow gate which leads unto Life, then he that ſtooped ſo low by humbleneſſe of minde, and emptied himſelf ſo neerly by mercifulneſſe unto the Poor, muſt needs finde an eaſier paſſage: Doubtleſſe, they that ſay and do theſe Things, ſhew plainly that they ſeek another Countrey, that is, an heavenly, for if they had been mindfull of</hi> This, <hi>they might have taken op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to have uſed it more advantageouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His</hi> Devotions <hi>towards God were aſsiduous and exemplarie, both in publick and private. He was a diligent frequenter of the publick Service in the Chappel, very early in the Morning, and at Evening, except ſome urgent occaſions of Infirmity did excuſe him. His private Conferences with God by Prayer and Meditation were never omitted, upon any occaſion whatſoever. When he went the yearly progreſſe to view the</hi> Colledge Lands, <hi>and came into the Tenants Houſe, it was his conſtant cuſtome (before any other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſcourſe, or care of Himſelf, were he never ſo wet or weary) to call for a retiring room to pour out his ſoul unto God, who led him ſafely in his journey. And this he did not out of any ſpecious
<pb facs="tcp:57235:14"/>
pretence of Holineſs, to devour a Widows Houſe with more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Rack their Rents, or Enhance their Fines, for excepting the conſtant Revenue to the Founder (to whom he was a strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant) no man ever did more for them, or leſs for himſelf. For thirty years together he uſed this following Anthem, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect (commanded by the Pious Founder) in Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the Holy and Undivided Trinity.</hi> Salva nos, Libera nos, Vivifica nos, O Beata Trinitas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Save us, Deliver us, Quicken us, O Bleſſed Trinity. Let us praiſe God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son, with the Holy Spirit, let us praiſe and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-exalt his Name for ever.</hi>
               </q> Almighty and everlaſting God, which haſt given unto us, thy ſervants, Grace by the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a true Faith, to acknowledge the Glory of the Eternal Trinity, and in the Power of the Divine Majeſty to Worſhip the Unity: We beſeech thee that through the ſtedfaſtneſs of this Faith, we may evermore be defended from all Adverſitie, which liveſt and raigneſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This he did perform, not onely as a Sacred Injunction of the</hi> Founder <hi>(upon him and all the Society) but he received a great Delight in the performance of it. No man ever wrote more highly of the Attributes of God then he, and yet he profeſſes that he alwaies took more comfort in admiring, then in diſputing, and in praying to, and acknowledgeing the</hi> Majeſty <hi>and</hi> Glory <hi>of the</hi> Bleſſed Trinite, <hi>then by too curiouſly prying into the</hi> Myſterie. <hi>He Compoſed a</hi> Book of Private Devotions, <hi>which ſome judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men (having peruſed the ſame) much Extolled and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, as being repleniſhed with Holy Raptures, and Divine Meditations, which (if it be not already annexed to this Book) I hope the Reader will ſhortly enjoy in a Portable Volume by it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus have many other Famous Scholars and Polemical men (in their Elder times) betaken themſelves to Catechizing, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as</hi> Pareus, <hi>Biſhop</hi> Andrews, <hi>Biſhop</hi> Uſher, <hi>and</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin
<pb facs="tcp:57235:14"/>
               <hi>himſelf ſeems to prefer his Book</hi> De Aſcenſione Mentis ad Deum, Of the Aſcenſion of the Soul to God, <hi>before any other part of his Works. Books (ſaies he) are not to be estimated,</hi> Ex multitudine foliorum, ſed ex fructibus, By the multitude of the Leaves, but the Fruit. <hi>My other Books I read onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſsity, but this I have willingly read over three or four times, and reſolve to read it more often; whether it be (ſaies he) that the Love towards it be greater then the Merit, becauſe (like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> Benjamin) <hi>it was the Son of mine old age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſeemed to be very</hi> Prophetical <hi>of the Enſuing times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as may evidently appear by his Sermons before the</hi> King, <hi>and Appendix about the ſigns of the Times, or</hi> Divine Fore-warnings <hi>therewith Printed ſome years before, touching the</hi> Great <hi>Tempest of Wind which fell out</hi> upon the Eve of the Fifth of <hi>November, 1636. He was much aſtoniſhed at it; and what apprehenſion he had of it appears by his words.</hi>—This mighty Wind was more then a Sign of the Time, the very Time it ſelf was a Sign, and portends thus much, That though we of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were in firm League with all Nations, yet it is ſtill in Gods Power, we may fear in his Purpoſe to plague this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by this or like tempeſts more grievouſly then he hath done at any time by Famin, Sword, or Peſtilence, to bury many living ſouls, as well of Superiour, as of Inferiour Rank, in the Ruin of their ſtately Houſes, or meaner Cottages, <hi>&amp;c. Which was obſerved by many, but ſignally by the Prefacer to M.</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts Remains, <hi>I ſhall not prevent the Reader, or detain him ſo long from the Original of that Book as to repeat the Elogies which are there conferred upon Him; I cannot forbear one paſſage in that Preface wherein he makes this profeſsion.</hi> I ſpeak it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, I have not read ſo hearty, vigorous a Champion againſt <hi>Rome</hi> (amongſt our writers of his rank) ſo convincing and demonſtrative as D. <hi>Jackson</hi> is. I bleſs God for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which he hath given me in the Chriſtian Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>
               <hi>As he was alwaies a Reconciler of differences in his Private Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo he ſeriouſly lamented the Publick Breaches of the Kingdom. For the Diviſions of</hi> Reuben <hi>he had great Thoughts of Heart. At the firſt Entrance of the Scots into</hi> England, <hi>he had much compaſsion for his Countrymen, although that were but the beginning of their Sorrows. He well knew that War was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attended with Ruin and Calamity, eſpecially to Church and Church-men; and therefore that Prayer was neceſſary and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them,</hi> Da pacem Domine in diebus noſtris, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Give peace in our time, O Lord, becauſe there is no other that fighteth for us but onely thou, O God, <hi>One drop of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian blood (though never ſo cheaply ſpilt by others like water upon the ground) was a deep Corroſive to his tender heart. Like</hi> Rachel weeping for her children, <hi>he could not be comforted. His body grew weak, the chearful hue of his countenance was impaled and diſcoloured, and he walked like a dying</hi> Mourner <hi>in the ſtreets. But God took him from the evil to come; It was a ſufficient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puniſhment for him to foreſee it; it had been more then a thouſand Deaths unto him to have beheld it with his Eyes. When his</hi> Death <hi>was now approaching, being in the chamber with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I overheard him with a ſoft voice repeating to himſelf theſe and the like Ejaculations.</hi> I wait for the Lord, my Soul doth wait, and in his Word do I hope; my Soul waiteth for the Lord more then they that watch for the morning. As for me, I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs. <hi>And he ended with this</hi> Cygnean Cantion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 5. Gracious is the Lord and righteous, yea our God is merciful. The Lord preſerveth the ſimple, I was brought low and he helped me. Return unto thy Reſt, O my Soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. <hi>And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ſpoken, ſoon after he ſurrendered up his Spirit to Him that gave it.</hi>

               <hi>If you ſhall curiouſly enquire what this Charitable man left in</hi> Legacie <hi>at his death, I muſt needs anſwer, that giving all in his Life time, as he owed nothing but Love, ſo he left nothing when he Dyed. The Poor was his Heir, and he was the Adminiſtrator of his own Goods; or (to uſe his own Expreſsion in one of his laſt Dedications) he had little elſe to leave his Executors, but his Papers onely, which the Biſhop of</hi> Armagh <hi>(being at his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals) much deſired might be carefully preſerved. This was that which he left to Poſterity</hi> in pios uſus, <hi>for the furtherance of Piety and Godlineſs,</hi> in perpetuam Eleemoſynam, <hi>for a perpetual deed of Charity, which I hope the Reader will advance to the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. He that reads this will find his Learning Chriſtening him</hi> The Divine, <hi>and his Life witneſsing him a man of God, a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and I might add, a Prophet of things to come. They that read thoſe Qualifications which he in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third Book requires in them which hope to underſtand the Scriptures aright, and ſee how great an inſight he had into them, and how many hid Myſteries he hath unfolded to this Age, will ſay his Life was good,</hi> Superlatively good. <hi>The Reader may eaſily perceive that he had no deſign in his opinions; no hopes but that bleſſed One propoſed in the beginning, that no preferment nor deſire of Wealth, nor affectation of Popularity, ſhould ever draw him from writing upon this Subject; for which no man ſo fit as he, becauſe (to uſe his own</hi> Divine <hi>and high</hi> Apothegme) No man could properly write of Juſtifying Faith, but he that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually affected to Death and Honour.</p>

               <hi>Thus have I preſented you with a Memorial of that Excellent Man, but with</hi> infinite diſadvantage <hi>from the unskilfulneſs of the Relator, and ſome likewiſe from the very diſpoſition of the Party himſelf. The humble man conceals his perfections with as much pains, as the proud covers his defects, and avoids obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as induſtriouſly, as the Ambitious provoke it. He that would draw a face to the Life, commands the Party to ſit down in the
<pb facs="tcp:57235:16"/>
Chair in a conſtant and unremoved Poſture, and a Countenance compoſed, that he may have the full view of every line, colour, and dimenſion; whereas he that will not yield to theſe Ceremonies, muſt be ſurprized at unawares, by Artificial ſtealth, and unſuſpected glances, like the Divine who was drawn at diſtance from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, or an ancient man in our daies, whoſe Statue being to be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Artificer that carved it, was enforced to take him ſleeping. That which I have here deſigned (next to the Glory of God, which is to be praiſed in all his Saints) is the benefit of the Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he may learn by his Example, as well as by his writings, by his Life as well as by his Works, which is the earneſt deſire of him who unfaignedly wiſhes the health and Salvation of your Souls.</hi>

                  <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Gnorant altogether I am not of the diſpoſition, though not much acquainted with the practiſes of this preſent age: wherein, to have meditated upon ſo many ſeveral matters as I here preſent unto thy Chriſtian view, will unto ſome (I know) ſeem but an effect of melancholie, as to have taken the pains to pen them, will argue my want of other imployments, or forlorn hopes of worldly thriving. Unto others (and thoſe more to be regarded) ſo ſoon in print to publiſh what had been not ſo well concocted, and more rawly penned, will be cenſured as a ſpice of that vanity which uſually haunts ſmatterers in good learning, but wherewith judicious Clerks are ſeldom infected. To the former I onely wiſh mindes more ſetled, or leſſe conſcience of their own extravagancies and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſpence of choiceſt time, faults apt to breed a miſlike of others indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie in ſuch courſes as will approve themſelves in his ſight that ſits as Judge and trier of all our wayes, howſoever ſuch as deſire to be meer By-ſtanders as well in Church as Common-wealths affairs, may upon ſiniſter reſpects, mutually miſinform themſelves. For many of the later, I am afraid, leſt, being partly ſuch and ſo eſteemed, they prepoſterouſly affect not to be taken for more judicious ſcholers then indeed they are: for the foſtering of which conceit in others, their unwillingneſſe to publiſh what they have conceived aright, may well be apprehended as a means not improbable. Not to expoſe their Meditations to publick cenſure, is and hath been (as the Chriſtian world too well can witneſſe) a reſolution incident to men of greateſt judgement: though no ſuch eſſential propertie, as neceſſarily argues, either all ſo minded to be, or all otherwiſe minded, not to be, alike judicious. Certain it is, the more excellent the internall feature of mens minds is, the greater diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them will an ordinary repreſentation of it be, and to adorn their their choice conceits with ſuch outward attire as beſt beſeems them, would require too great coſts and charges. Thus from perfection oft-times ſprings defect: whileſt judgement, too much over-growing fancie, and drying up that kind affection, whereby the fruit and vertue of one ſoul is diffuſed unto another, makes men more jealous of diminiſhing the high eſtimate of their fore-prized worth, then zealous of their inferiours good, which many times might be reaped in greateſt abundance from ſuch labours as yeeld leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to their Authors. In this reſpect alone can I gratulate my imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: hoping that as my meditations can neither pleaſe the delicate, for their form, nor inform the judicious for their matter, ſo they may prove nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offenſive for the one, nor unfruitfull for the other, unto many of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and inferiour rank.</p>
                  <p>At the leaſt (I truſt) they will occaſion ſome others, whom God hath bleſſed with better abilitie and opportunitie, to hunt that out which in this long range I may chance to ſtart, or make full conqueſt of that goodly field
<pb facs="tcp:57235:19"/>
wherein that ineſtimable pearl lies bid, for whoſe diſcovery theſe my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels may happily yeeld ſome obſervations not impertinent. To this end have I purpoſely trained my wits to untroden pathes, to adventure on new paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, unto that true treaſure which all of us traffick for, oft-times one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hindrance, the more becauſe we beat one place too much, when as many others might afford us the ſame or greater commodities better cheap. Though the truth be one: yet it is not alwayes of one ſhape, whiles we look upon it divers wayes. The Mine wherein it lies, is inexhauſtible; oft-times more full of droſſe and rubbidge, where moſt have digged: and, though the inward ſubſtance of it be the ſame, yet the refining of it admits variety of inventions. Do not prejudice me (charitable Reader) ſo much as in thy ſecret cenſure, as if theſe premiſes might ſeem to argue my diſſent in any concluſions which our Church profeſſeth: the event (I truſt) ſhall acquit me, and condemn all my accuſers, if any I have; and how I ſtand affected in points of ſpiritual obedience to my ſuperiours, thou mayeſt be informed, if it pleaſe thee but to peruſe ſome few ſheets of theſe my firſt-fruits, which I preſume thou wilt, ſurely thou oughteſt, ere thy cenſure paſſe upon me. If in the explication of ſome Points I fully accord not with ſome well eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med domeſtick Writers: I truſt <hi>Sarahs</hi> free-born children may enjoy that priviledge amongſt themſelves, which is permitted the ſons of <hi>Hagar,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their brethren, though all abſolute bondmen to their mother. Yet that I do not thus far diſſent from any of my mothers children, upon emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or humour of contradiction, thou wilt reſt ſatisfied upon my ſincere religious proteſtation, That the whole fabrick of this intended work was ſet, and every main concluſion reſolved upon, before I read any Engliſh Writer upon the arguments which I handle. From ſome indeed which had written before me, I have ſince perceived a direct diſſent in one or two points of moment; but wherein they had (in my judgement) contradicted the moſt judicious Writers of our Church and all Antiquitie I am acquainted with, more raſhlie, then I would do the meaneſt this day living. Yet ſhall they, or whoſoever of their opinion, find the manner of my diſputing with them, ſuch as ſhall not (I truſt) exaſperate, howſoever the diſſonance of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may diſlike them. For outlandiſh or forrain Latin Writers, I muſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly confeſſe, when I firſt laboured to be inſtructed in the fundamental principles of faith and manners, ſome points which I much wiſhed, I found they had not handled, in others, wherein I miſliked nothing as unſound, I could not alwayes find that full ſatisfaction, which (me thought) a more accurate Artiſt (for a mean one I was then my ſelf) would require. The greater ſince hath been my deſire either of giving, or by my attempt, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing ſatisfaction. But will not others, when I have done my beſt, ſo think and ſay of mine, as I have done of theſe much better indeavours? It were great arrogance to expect any leſſe. Notwithſtanding, if what they ſhall find defective in my labours, move them to no worſe patience, then what I thought (at leaſt) was ſo in theirs that every way go before me, hath done me: nor I, nor they, nor the Church of Chriſt, (by this means partaker, and free to diſlike or approve of both our labours) ſhall (I truſt) have any great cauſe to repent us of our pains. For thy better ſatisfaction, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee with the particulars which moved me to write.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in unfolding the nature and properties of Chriſtian Faith, to omit the errours of the Romiſh Church, (wherein it is impoſſible it ſhould ever come to full growth,) many in reformed, too much followed in particular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, did ſtrive to ripen it too faſt. <hi>I have heard complaints immediately from
<pb facs="tcp:57235:19"/>
the mouthes of ſome yet living, of others deceaſed, that they had been ſet too farre in their firſt Leſſons: that the hopes they had out of hand directly built upon Gods general promiſes applied to them by their Inſtructours, were too weighty, unleſſe the foundations of their faith had firſt been more deeply and ſurely planted.</hi> That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of juſtification and full perſwaſion of inherent ſanctifying grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at theſe Worthies (whoſe footſteps I preciſely track not) aim, is (I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt) the mark which I propoſe unto my ſelf, but cannot hope at the firſt ſhoot to hit; if at the ſecond, third, or fourth (as ſhall pleaſe God,) it muſt content me. In the mean time (I hope) I ſhall neither offend him, nor any of his, as long as I gather ground of what I proſecute, and ſtill come neerer and neerer the propoſed end. The firſt ſtep, me thought, that tended moſt directly to this certain apprehenſion of ſaving faith, was our <hi>undoubted Aſſent</hi> unto the divine truth of Scriptures in general: and for the working of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, means ſubordinate I could conceive none better for the kinde (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars others happilie may finde more forcible,) then ſuch as I have proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at large in the firſt Book: not ignorant, that ſuch as moved me more, might move others leſſe, thoſe every man moſt, that were of his own gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, wherein the diſpoſition of the divine providence (alwayes concurrent to this ſearch ſo men would mark it) is moſt conſpicuous. For this purpoſe I have propoſed ſuch variety of Obſervations, as almoſt every one able to read the Scriptures or other Authors, of what ſort or profeſſion ſoever, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents eſpecially, may be occaſioned to make the like themſelves, well hoping to find a Method as facile and eaſie for eſtabliſhing the aſſent of the ſimple, and altogether illiterate, unto thoſe articles whoſe diſtinct explicit knowledge is moſt neceſſary to ſalvation. But many (I know) will deem the broken traditions, or imperfect relations of heathen men (for theſe I uſe,) but weak ſupporters for ſo great an edifice: nor did I intend them for ſuch ſervice. Their ignorance notwithſtanding, and darkned minds, do much commend the light of divine truth, ſo may the experience of their vanity diſpoſe our minds to embrace the ſtability of Gods Word with greater ſtedfaſtneſſe. We know the vertue and benefit of the Sun, not ſo much by looking upon it ſelf continually or directly, as by the variety of other objects or colours, all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with it to the eye, but altogether inviſible or indiſtinguiſhable without it: ſo for mine part, I muſt profeſſe, that ſuch hiſtorical narrations, poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fictions, or other conceits of Heathens as they themſelves knew little uſe of, nor ſhould I have done had I been as they were, being compared with this heavenly light of Gods Word, did much affect me even in my beſt and moſt retired meditations, of ſacred myſteries, their obſervation, as it were, tied my ſoul by a new knot, or feſt, more ſurely unto that truth, which I knew before to be in it ſelf moſt ſure, moſt infallible. Yea even in points wherein my heart, unto my ſeeming, was beſt eſtabliſhed, it much did nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, augment, and ſtrengthen belief already planted, to obſerve the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſonancie, of profane with ſacred Writers, or the occaſions of their diſſonancie, to be evidently ſuch, as Scriptures ſpecifie: that of many events wondred at by their Heatheniſh relators, no tolerable reaſon could be given, but ſuch as are ſubordinate to the never-failing rules of Scripture. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, may (I preſume) obſerve by Experiment, the truth of what I ſay. There is no motive unto belief ſo weak or feeble, but may be very avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for quelling temptations of ſome kind or other, either in ſpeculation or practiſe; oft-times ſuch as are abſolutely more weak or feeble, more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for expelling ſome peculiar diſtruſt or preſumption, then others farre more forcible and ſtrong for vanquiſhing temptations of another kinde, in
<pb facs="tcp:57235:20"/>
nature moſt grievous. Many, half ſtudents, half gallants, are often tempted either to diſtruſt the commendations of this Eden which we are ſet to dreſs, or diſtaſte the food of life that grows within it, from delights ſuggeſted by prophane books, wherewith commonly they are firſt acquainted, and hence much affect the knowledge their Authors profer, as likely to Deifie them in the worlds eies. Our proneneſs to be thus perſwaded, is a witneſs of our firſt parents tranſgreſſion, and theſe ſuggeſtions as reliques of Satans baits, whereby he wrought their bain. But what is the remedy? not to tread in any heatheniſh ſoil, leſt theſe ſerpents ſting us? rather the beſt medicine for this malady would be a confection of that very fleſh wherein ſuch deadly poyſon lodged. Other arguments may more perſwade the judicious, or ſuch as in ſome meaſure have taſted the fruits of the ſpirit: But none the curious artiſt better, then ſuch as are gathered from his eſteemed Authors. Even ſuch as are in faith moſt ſtrong, of zeal moſt ardent, ſhould not much miſpend their time, in comparing the degenerate fictions, or hiſtorical relations of times ancient or modern, with the everlaſting truth. For, though this method could not add much encreaſe, either to their faith, or zeal: yet would it doubtleſs much avail for working placid and milde affections. The very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilmen of ſacred writ themſelves were taught patience, and inſtructed in the waies of Gods providence, by their experience of ſuch events as the courſe of time is never barren of, not alwaies related by Canonical Authors, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately teſtified by the ſpirit, but oft times believed upon a moral certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſuch a reſolution of circumſtances concurrent into the firſt cauſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſer of all affairs, as we might make of modern accidents, were we other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe partakers of the ſpirit, or would we mind heavenly matters as much as earthly.</p>
                  <p>Generally two points I have obſerved, not much for ought I know, if handled at all by any writer: albeit their fruit and uſe would fully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the beſt pains of any one mans life-time, though wholly ſpent in their diſcuſſion, whoſe want in my mind hath been the bane of true devotion in moſt ages. The firſt is <hi>an equivalencie of means</hi> in the wiſedome of God ſo proportioned to the diverſity of times, as no age could have better then the preſent, howſoever they may affect the extraordinary ſigns and wonders of former generations. Of this argument here and there, as occaſion ſhall ſerve in this work; elſewhere at large, if God permit. The ſecond is, <hi>an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Errors,</hi> Hypocriſie, Infidelity, and Idolatry, all which vary rather their ſhape then ſubſtance, in moſt men, through ages, nations, and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ignorance of God remaining for the moſt part the ſame, his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes as much (though in another kind) transformed by many in outward profeſſion joyned with the true Church, as in times paſt by the Heathen. The truth of which aſſertion, with the original cauſes of the error, and means to prevent it, are diſcuſſed at large in the article of the God-head. Many like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for ought their conſcience (becauſe not rightly examined) will witneſs to the contrary, are ſtrongly perſwaded they love Chriſt with heart and ſoul, and ſo deteſt as well the open blaſphemy, or profeſſed hatred, which the Jew; as the ſecret enmity the Jeſuit or other infamous Hereticks, bear againſt him: when as oft times the onely ground of their love to him, is their ſpite to ſome or all of theſe, as they are deciphered to them in odious ſhape, the onely original of their deſpite to theſe, the very dregs of Jewiſh, Popiſh, or other Heretical humours in themſelves, by ſome light tincture of that truth which they outwardly profeſs, exaſperated to more bitter enmity againſt them with whoſe internal temper they beſt agree, then otherwiſe they could
<pb facs="tcp:57235:20"/>
conceive; as admiſſion to place of credit or authority makes baſe minds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own forepaſt villanies, more rigid cenſurers of others miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, or cruel perſecutors of ſuch malefactors, as themſelves in action have been, and in heart yet are (were all occaſions and opportunities the ſame) then any moderate or ſincere man in life and action could be. Of the original of this diſeaſe, with the criſis and remedy, as alſo the tryal of faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, in the articles concerning Chriſt and remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>From the manner of Jeruſalems progreſs to her firſt deſtruction, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Jews natural temper (the principal ſubject of my ſubciſive or vacant hours from theſe meditations, and other neceſſary imployments of my calling) I have obſerved <hi>the original as well of moſt ſtates, as mens miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariages profeſſing true religion, to have been from preſumption of Gods favour before dangers approach, and diſtruſt of his mercy after calamities ſeiz upon them:</hi> The root of both theſe miſperſwaſions to be ignorance or error in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Gods providence, whoſe true knowledge (if I may ſo ſpeak) is the fertil womb of all ſacred moral truths, the onely rule of rectifying mens wils, perſwaſions, and affections, in all conſultations or practiſes private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Unto this purpoſe much would it avail to be reſolved, whether all things fall out by fatal neceſſity, or ſome contingently; how fate and contingency (if compatible each with other) ſtand mutually affected, how both ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the abſolute immutability of that one everlaſting decree. Want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in theſe points, (as far as my obſervation ſerves me) hath continually bred an univerſal threefold want: of care and vigilancie for preventing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in themſelves avoidable: of alacrious indeavors to redeem time in part ſurprized by them; of patience, of hearty ſubmiſſion to Gods will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant expectation of his providence, after all hope of redemption from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral plagues long threatned by his meſſengers, is paſt. For here we ſuppoſe (what out of the fundamental principles of Chriſtian religion ſhall in good time be made evident) that <hi>in all ruinated ſtates,</hi> or forepaſt alterations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from better to worſe, there was a time wherein the poſſibility of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which afterwards befel them, might have been prevented, a time wherein they might have been recovered from eminent dangers, wherewith they were encompaſt, a time after which there was no poſſibility left them of avoyding the day of viſitation, never brought forth but by the precedent ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of iniquity, but alwaies neceſſarily by it. In the diſcuſſion of theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points of like nature (becauſe more depending upon ſtrict examination of conſequences deduced from the undoubted rules of Scripture, then upon authorities of antiquitie, ſkill in the tongues, or any other learning that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long experience or obſervation) I laboured moſt, whileſt thoſe Arts and Sciences which are moſt conducible to this ſearch, were freſheſt in my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And could I hope to ſatisfie others in all or moſt of theſe, as fully as I have long ſince done my ſelf, I ſhould take greateſt pleaſure in my pains addreſſed to this purpoſe. But would it pleaſe the <hi>Lord</hi> in mercy <hi>to raiſe up ſome Engliſh writer,</hi> that could in ſuch ſort handle <hi>theſe points,</hi> as their uſe and conſequence, <hi>or neceſſity of preſent times requires: ſucceeding ages</hi> (I am perſwaded) ſhould have more cauſe <hi>to bleſs the day of his nativity,</hi> then of the <hi>greateſt States-mens</hi> or <hi>ſtouteſt Warriors</hi> this land hath yielded ſince the birth of our Fathers this day living. It ſhall ſuffice he to begin the offering with my mite, in hope ſome learned Academicks (for unto them belongs the conqueſt of this golden fleece) will employ their Talents to like publick uſe. What I conceive, ſhall be (by Gods aſſiſtance) unfolded in as plain and unoffenſive terms, as the nature of the ſubject will bear, or my faculties reach unto, partly
<pb facs="tcp:57235:21"/>
in the Article of Gods providence, partly in other diſcourſes directly ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate unto it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for the full and perfect growth, at leaſt for the ſweet and pleaſant flouriſhing of lively <hi>Faith,</hi> one of the moſt effectual means our induſtry that can but plant or water, attains unto, would be to <hi>unfold the harmony betwixt Prophetical predictions, and Hiſtorical events</hi> concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt, and time of the Goſpel: a point, for ought I know, not purpoſely handled by any modern writer, except thoſe whoſe ſucceſs cannot be great, until their delight in contention and contradiction be leſs. Notwithſtanding, whatſoever I ſhall find good in them or any other, without all reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, much more without all deſire of oppoſition, or occaſion of contention (a matter alwaies undecent in a Chriſtian, but moſt odious and lothſom in a ſubject ſo melodious and pleaſant,) I will not be afraid to follow, intending a full Treatiſe of the divers kindes of Prophecies, with the manner of their interpretations, before the Articles of Chriſts <hi>Incarnation, Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the eſpecial points, which for the better confirmation of true Chriſtian faith, and rectifying perſwaſions in matters of manners or good life, are principally aimed at in theſe meditations. The main obſtacle the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt ſtumbles at, is the Article of the bodies reſurrection. Whoſe paſſive poſſibility ſhall by (Gods aſſiſtance) be evidently demonſtrated againſt him by the undoubted rules of nature, whoſe Prieſt or Miniſter he profeſſeth himſelf to be. That <hi>de facto</hi> it ſhall be, the Scriptures, whoſe truth ere then will appear Divine, muſt aſſure us; Nature cannot, though thus much were in ſome ſort known and believed by many natural men from traditions of the ancient, or ſuſpected from ſome notions of the law of nature not quite oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in all ſorts of the heathen, as ſhall in that Article (God willing) be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But why our Aſſent unto this and all other Articles in this Creed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good meaſure eſtabliſhed, the momentary hopes or tranſitory pleaſures of this world, ſhould with moſt in their whole courſe of life, with all of us in many particular actions, in private and ſecret temptations, more prevail, then that exceeding weight of glory, which Chriſtian hope would faſten on our ſouls, to keep unruly affections under, hath often enforced me to wonder, and wonderment hereat firſt moved me to untertake theſe labors, if by any means I may attain unto the cauſes of this ſo grievous an infirmity, or find out ſome part of a remedy for it. Doubtleſs, had the heathen Philoſophers but known or ſuſpected ſuch joyes, as we profeſs we believe and hope for, or ſuch a death, or more then deadly torments, as after this life ended we fear; their lives and manners would as far have ſurpaſſed the beſt Chriſtians now living, as their knowledge in ſupernatural myſteries came ſhort of the moſt learned that are or have been in that profeſſion: and yet whatſoever helps any Chriſtian or heathen had for encreaſing knowledge or bettering manners, are more plentiful in this then any precedent age, ſo that the fault is wholly in our ſelves, that will not apply medicines already prepared, as ſhall (God proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe proceedings) be declared in the laſt Article of this Creed.</p>
                  <p>For controverſies betwixt us and the Romiſh Church, beſides ſuch are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the end and method propoſed, I purpoſely meddle with none: of that rank, ſome (as that of the Churches infallibility) undermine the very foundation, others (as the doctrine of merit and juſtification, the propitiation of the Maſs) unroof the edifice, and deface the walls of Chriſtian faith, leaving nothing thereof but altarſtones for their idolatrous ſacrifices. For this reaſon have I built with one hand, &amp; uſed my weapon with the other: lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:57235:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the poſitive or general grounds of Faith againſt the Infidel or Atheiſt in the firſt Book, and gaurding them in the ſecond by the ſword of the Spirit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all attempts of Romiſh <hi>Sanballats,</hi> or <hi>Tobiahs,</hi> who ſtill labor to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our people the walls of Chriſts Church <hi>here</hi> erected ſince our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers redemption from captivity, unleſs ſupported by their ſuppoſed infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are ſo weak, <note n="a" place="margin">Nehem. 4 5.</note> 
                     <hi>That if a Fox ſhould go upon them, he ſhould break them down.</hi> In the third (which was at this time intended, but muſt ſtay a while to bring  forth a fourth) I batter thoſe painted walls, whoſe ſhallow foundations are diſcovered in the ſecond.

                  <p>By this (beloved Reader) thou mayſt perceive my journey is long, and may well plead my excuſe for ſetting forth ſo ſoon: but from that courſe which I have choſen, or rather God hath ſet me, I truſt nor hopes of preferment, nor any deſires of worldly wealth nor affectation of popularity, by handling more plauſible or Time-ſerving arguments, ſhall ever draw me away. <hi>So far I am from aiming at any ſuch ſiniſter end, That ſince I begun to comment upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtian faith, I never could, nor ever ſhall perſwade my ſelf it poſſibly can find quiet lodging, much leſs ſafe harbour, but in an heart alike affected to Death and Honour; alwaies retaining the Deſires, and fear of both (either ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered, or mutually compared) in equal ballance.</hi> Both are good when God in mercy ſends them; both evil, and hard to determin whether worſe, to unprepared minds, or whileſt procured by our ſollicitous or importunate ſuit or beſtowed upon us in their Donours anger. Onely this difference I find; death is mankinds inevitable doom, but worldly preferment neither ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, nor ſo certain to any: the leſs (in reaſon) ſhould be our endeavors either for providing it, or preparing our ſelves to ſalute it decently, though comming of it own accord to meet us. <hi>But what meditations can be too long, or what endeavors too laborious for gaining of an happie end, or giving a meſſenger of ſo importunate and weighty conſequence as death one way or other brings, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent entertainment?</hi> This Chriſtian modeſty I have learned long ſince of the heathen <hi>Socrates,</hi> to beſeech my God he would vouchſafe me ſuch a portion of wealth, or whatſoever this world eſteems, as none but an honeſt, upright, religious mind can bear: or, to uſe the words of a better teacher, <hi>That of all my labours under the ſun, I</hi> may reap the fruit in holineſs, and in the end, the End of theſe my preſent meditations, <hi>Everlaſting Life.</hi>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O believe a thing, is to aſſent unto it as true, without any evident certainty of the truth thereof, either from our ſenſe or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 That belief is an aſſent; that to believe is to aſſent, all agree: but what more beſides aſſent is required to ſome eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to Chriſtian belief, is much controverſed among Divines: of which (God willing) in the Articles following.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 That <hi>evident certainty, either of ſenſe or underſtanding, muſt be excluded from the aſſent, which is properly called belief, is evident and certain</hi> by our uſual and common ſpeech. Thus whiles we demand of him that relates any thing unto us for true (as news or the like) whether he know his relation to be certainly true, or no: if he neither have immediately heard, nor ſeen the things which he relates, but have onely taken them at the ſecond hand, his uſual anſwer is: Nay, I know not certainly, but I verily believe they are true for divers reaſons and credible reports: but if he had either ſeen or heard them himſelf, he would not ſay, I believe, but, I know they are moſt true. For evident certainty doth drown belief.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Yet is this evident knowledge (whether ſenſitive or intellectuall) to be excluded onely from the thing it ſelf which is to be directly believed, not from other things that are linked or united to it by nature.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 That which we evidently know, may oft-times be the cauſe, why we believe ſome other matters that have affinity with it. As he that ſeeth it very light in the morning, when he firſt openeth his eyes, may probably believe the Sun is up, becauſe he evidently ſeeth the air to be light. But no man (if you ſhould aſk him the ſame queſtion) would ſay, that he believed the Sun was up, when either the heat thereof doth ſcorch his face, or the beams dazle his eyes; for now he knoweth this truth directly and evidently in it ſelf. Nor is there any man that hath his right minde, that will ſay he verily believeth twice two make four: for this is evident, and certain to ordinary capacities, and he that onely believeth this, knoweth nothing. For what men know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and evidently, they will not ſay, they onely believe, but know: what they ſo know not, they may truly and properly ſay, they believe, if their aſſent to it be greater then to the contrary.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 Some again diſtinguiſh this unevident aſſent (which is properly called belief) from other aſſents or opinions, by the grounds on which it is built. The ground of it (in their opinion) is <hi>Authoritas docentis,</hi> the authority of the teacher or avoucher of the points propoſed to be believed.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 This diſtinction in ſome caſes is true, but it is not neceſſary to all belief; nor doth it fully and properly diſtinguiſh belief from other unevident aſſents or perſwaſions. For even thoſe aſſents or perſwaſions, which ſeem moſt to rely upon authorities, may be ſtrengthened by other motives or inducements: yea our belief, or relying upon authorities, uſually (alwayes if it be ſtrong)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57235:25"/>
ariſeth from experiment of our Authors fidelity and skil, as ſhal appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. For our preſent proceedings we take it here as granted or ſuppoſed, that this word <hi>[Belief]</hi> as it is uſually taken, is more general then that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or perſwaſion, which relies upon authoritie; yet not ſo general as to comprehend theſe aſſents or perſwaſions, which are evidently certain.</p>
                           <p n="8">8 It may be objected, that the Apoſtle calleth evident knowledge, belief, when he ſaith, The Devils believe there is a God, and tremble. For it ſhould ſeem, that the Devils know as evidently that there is a God, as we do that the Sun did ſhine but yeſterday, or this morning. For they once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the preſence of God, and ſaw his glory, and ſince have had evident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his power.</p>
                           <p n="9">9 Of Gods Being (no doubt) they have evident certainty; albeit of his other attributes their knowledge is not ſo direct nor evident, but conjectural, or a kinde of <hi>Belief.</hi> Wherefore unto this place of our Apoſtle we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer two wayes: Either that under this word <hi>[Belief]</hi> he comprehends not onely their aſſent unto the Being, or exiſtence of the Godhead, but their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto other Attributes of God, which they know not ſo evidently, and therefore may be ſaid to believe them. Or if he underſtand onely that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which they gave unto the exiſtence or Being of the Godhead, he calleth this (though joyned with evident knowledge) a Belief, in oppoſition or with reference unto the Belief of Hypocrites (againſt whom he there ſpeaks) which was much leſſe then this aſſent of Devils. For albeit that which is greater in the ſame kinde, cannot be properly and abſolutely ſaid to be the leſſe; as we cannot properly and abſolutely ſay that four is three, but rather contains three in it: yet upon ſome reference of the greater unto the leſſe contained in it, or unto ſome other third, we may denominate the greater with the name of that which is leſſe in the ſame kinde: as we may ſay of him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed three and gave four, that he gave three, becauſe three is contained in four. So the Philoſopher ſaith, that <hi>Habitus eſt diſpoſitio,</hi> every habit is a diſpoſition, not abſolutely and properly, for it is more; yet becauſe it is more, with reference unto that which is leſſe, or unto the ſubject in whom it is, we may ſay it is <hi>diſpoſitio,</hi> that is, it contains diſpoſition in it, albeit no man would ſay that <hi>habitus</hi> were <hi>diſpoſitio,</hi> if he ſhould define it.</p>
                           <p n="10">10 And men uſually object to ſuch as ſcoff at matters of Religion, that the day will come, wherein, if they repent not, they ſhall believe the things which now they little regard. Albeit they cannot be ſaid in that day to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, if we ſpeak properly and abſolutely, without reference to their former incredulity. Our meaning is, they ſhall do more then believe them, for they ſhall feel them. Nor can we ſay properly that the Elect after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhall believe the articles of faith: ſeeing all agree, that of theſe three principal vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> onely Love ſhall then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. The reaſon is that which you have heard alreadie; becauſe evident knowledge muſt be excluded from the nature of faith and belief; and the godly ſhall then clearly ſee Chriſt face to face, and fully enjoy the fruit of his Paſſion, which now they onely believe.</p>
                           <p n="11">11 As for certainty, <hi>We may not exclude it from the nature of belief,</hi> unleſſe this ſpeech be warily underſtood. For the certainty of the Articles of our Faith ought to be greater, then the certainty of other knowledge; for we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, although they be contrary to the capacity of our underſtanding: for even this muſt we believe, that many things (as all ſupernatural things) ſurpaſſe the reach of our underſtanding. Yet this we may ſafely ſay, that the certainty of the articles of our belief, [as of Chriſt his death, of his and our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57235:26"/>
reſurrection,] cannot be ſo great to us in this life, as it ſhall be in the world to come, when we ſhall evidently know them. This rule then is infallible; <hi>That the knowledge of any thing is more certain, then the belief thereof: although the belief of ſome things (as of Chriſt his Paſſion) be more certain, then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of other things; as namely, then the knowledge of humane ſciences.</hi> So then out of this it is evident, that belief taken generally, doth neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all certaintie, nor neceſſarily require any; ſeeing ſome belief hath a kinde of certaintie adjoyned with it, and ſome cannot admit it. Wherefore it remaineth, that <hi>Aſſent is the eſſence of belief in general;</hi> I ſay, <hi>ſuch an aſſent, as is not joyned with evidency.</hi>

                                 </gap> of natural belief are of two ſorts,</hi> either <hi>ſcibilia,</hi> or <hi>opinabilia;</hi> either ſuch things as may be evidently known in themſelves, but are not ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57235:26"/>
by him that believes them; or elſe ſuch things, as we can have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or certain knowledge of, but onely an opinion. And of this nature are all the monuments of former ages, and relations of ancient times, in reſpect of us which are now living: all future contingents, or ſuch effects, as have no neceſſary natural cauſe why they ſhould be, nor no inevitable let or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance why they may not be; as whether we ſhould have rain or fair weather the next moneth, whether ſuch or ſuch Nations ſhall wage war againſt each other the next year. Theſe matters paſt, and contingent which are not yet, but may be, albeit they agree in the general nature of <hi>opinabilia,</hi> that neither of them can be exactly known, but onely by opinion believed: yet both dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in that which is the ground of our aſſent or belief. The ground or reaſon why we believe things paſt, (as that <hi>Tully</hi> lived in <hi>Julius Caeſars</hi> time, or that the Saxons inhabited this land,) is the report of others. The ground or reaſon why we believe future contingents, is the inclination or propenſion which we ſee in ſecond cauſes to produce ſuch effects; or the coherence betwixt any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or moral contingent cauſe, and their poſſible or probable iſſue. As if we ſee one Kingdom mighty in wealth, and at peace and unitie in it ſelf, bearing inveterate hate to another; or if we know that the one hath ſuffered wrong, not likely to be recompenced, and yet able in politick eſtimation to make it ſelf amends: we beleeve that ſuch will ſhortly be at open hoſtilitie one with another. Or if we ſee the air wateriſh, we believe it will ſhortly rain. Yet are not the grounds why we believe things paſt, and the grounds of believing future contingents, alwayes ſo oppoſite, but that they may jump in one, and conſpire mutually for the ſtrengthning of belief. For we would believe our former conjecture of war or weather a great deal the better, if a cunning Stateſ-man ſhould give judgement of the one, or an Aſtronomer, or ſome that we know very weather-wiſe, his opinion of the other. For now beſides the probability of our own conjectures, we have other mens authority to confirm our belief. In both kindes, (either where the grounds of each are ſeveral, or where both conſpire together) as the ground of belief, or our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the ground is greater, ſo our belief waxeth ſtronger. Thus we believe the Roman ſtories of <hi>Caeſars</hi> times more firmly, then the relations of <hi>Herodotus</hi> concerning matters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or other countries; becauſe more Writers, and they ſuch as are leſſe ſuſpected of vanity or impoſture, do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the truth of Roman affairs.</p>
                           <p n="16">16 Other things, which are credible, or may be believed, are (as we ſaid) <hi>ſcibilia;</hi> ſuch things as may be exactly known by natural reaſon, though not of the party which onely believes them; (for exact knowledge alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels meer belief of the ſame thing in the ſame party.) That the Sun is bigger then the Earth, or that the motion thereof is ſwifter then any Arrows flight, may be known exactly by a Mathematician; but ordinary Countrey-men (ſuch as are not ruſtically wayward) do believe it; evidently and exactly know it they cannot. <hi>The ground</hi> of their belief in ſuch a caſe is <hi>authoritas do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centis.</hi> And this authoritie of teachers, or others, upon whoſe aſſertions we relie, conſiſteth partly in a perſwaſion of the teachers or relators skill in thoſe matters which he teacheth or relateth; and partly in his honeſtie, fidelitie, or veracitie in his dealings or ſayings. And as theſe are reputed greater, ſo do we more believe him in theſe things which he avoucheth for true, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie more ſecurely upon his authoritie. For as we ſaid before, <hi>Caeteris paribus, the certainty of belief encreaſeth as the ground of belief doth, both for the number of points believed, and for the firmneſſe of the belief it ſelf.</hi> If two of the ſame facultie teach us divers things, whereof we have no other ground but their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57235:27"/>
aſſertion, we believe him better, whoſe skill and fidelitie we account of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the more the parties be that report or avouch the ſame thing, the more we believe them, if they be reputed skilful and honeſt. And where the authoritie is the ſame, both for extenſion and degrees, yet we believe the things taught, better, from the better or more immediate apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the authoritie. As if <hi>Ariſtotle, Euclide,</hi> or <hi>Archimedes</hi> were alive, and in that reputation for skill in their ſeveral profeſſions, which their works are in; we would believe thoſe concluſions which we heard them teach, better than ſuch as we had from them by others, or (as we ſaid) at the ſecond hand. For though the authoritie in both caſes were the ſame: yet ſhould not our apprehenſion of it be ſo, but more immediate in the former. We ſee by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, how opinions onely grounded upon the authoritie of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for their skill in ſuch matters well reputed of, do enforce others (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inferiours in that kinde of skill) to give an aſſent unto the ſame truth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have good ſhew of reaſon to the contrarie. As what Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is there, but would think he might ſafely ſwear, that the Earth were an hundred times greater then the Sun? yet if an Aſtronomer, (of whoſe skill he hath had experience in other matters, which he can better diſcern) one whom he knew to be an honeſt plain dealing man, not accuſtomed to cog with his friend, ſhould ſeriouſly avouch the contrarie, <hi>that the Sun is bigger than the Earth;</hi> few Countrey-men would be ſo wayward as not to believe their friend Aſtronomer, Albeit (his authoritie ſet aſide) they had no reaſon to think ſo, but rather the contrarie. And it were a ſigne of ignorant arrogancie, if Punies or Freſh-men ſhould reject the axiomes and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> uſual in the Schools, becauſe they have ſome reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, which themſelves cannot anſwer. For reaſon might tell them, that others (their betters) which have gone before them, have had greater reaſons to hold them, then they can yet have to deny them. This perſwaſion of other mens ſkill or knowledge will win the aſſent of modeſt and ingenuous youths, unto ſuch rules or Axiomes, as otherwiſe they would ſtiflie denie, and have wittie reaſons to overthrow. But albeit this aſſent, which men give to concluſions, they know not themſelves, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon other mens aſſeverations, may be very great; as many Countrey-men will believe an Aſtronomer affirming that the Sun is greater then the Earth, better then they will the honeſteſt of their neighbours in a matter that may concern both their commodities: yet if the relators or avouchers could make them conceive any probable reaſon of the ſame concluſions, [as if the Aſtronomer in the mentioned caſe could ſhew, how everie bodie the further it is from us ſeemeth the leſſe, and then declare how many hundred miles the Sun is from us:] Mens mindes would be a great deal better ſatisfied, and this aſſent or belief, which formerlie did onely relie upon authoritie, would be much ſtrengthned by this ſecond tie or hold-faſt. And if we would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, <hi>There is uſually a kinde of regreſſe betwixt our Belief of authorities, and our Aſſent unto concluſions taught by them. Firſt, (uſually) we believe authority, and afterwards the concluſions taught by it, for the authorities ſake. But after we once finde experiment of the truth of concluſions ſo taught, we believe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the better from this experimental truth of the concluſion.</hi>

Such are the myſteries of our ſalvation, and the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtian Belief. For <hi>no Article of our Belief (if we conſider them with all the circumſtances, and in that exact manner as they are propoſed in Scripture to be believed) could ever have come into corrupted mens cogitation, unleſſe God had revealed it unto him.</hi> Seing then we cannot know them in any ſort by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon and authoritie; neither can humane reaſon or authoritie be the ground of our aſſenting to them; it remaineth then, that <hi>Authoritas docentis, The word of God,</hi> be the ground of our belief.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Here then muſt you call to minde what we ſaid before that <hi>authoritas docentis did conſiſt in two things; namely in the skill, and fidelity, or ſincerity of the Teacher: and by how much we know thoſe to be greater, by ſo much is our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or belief ſtrengthned.</hi> Now it is evident to reaſon, that God is infinitely wiſe, and therefore cannot be deceived; whence neceſſarily it followeth, that he knoweth, and can tell us the truth. Again, it is evident that God is moſt juſt and true, and therefore will not deceive us, but will tell us the truth if he profeſſe ſo. Again, we cannot conceive of God aright, but we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him as omnipotent, and full of power; and conſequently ſuch an one as needs not in policie, or jealouſie of our emulating him in knowledge, to tell us otherwiſe then he knows.

                           <p n="3">3 And if the Heathen were of opinion, that the Gods did not envie Men knowledge; then muſt they needs believe, that if they taught them any, they would teach them true knowledge. Wherefore this muſt be laid down as a certain ground, <hi>That whatſoever God teacheth us, is moſt true.</hi> Nor is there any, (admitting there were a God) but would aſſent unto this. But here is the difficultie. How can we be aſſured that God doth teach us any of theſe things? Or, how ſhall we know that this we call Scripture, is the Word of God? If our apprehenſion of this ground be ſure, our faith is firm and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: if our apprehenſion hereof be doubtful, our faith muſt needs be unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or, at the beſt, but conditional.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Let us firſt therefore look what this conditional aſſent or belief doth binde us unto.</p>
                           <p>Although many, that firmly beleeve, <hi>whatſoever God ſaith, is true,</hi> either do not acknowledge or do not firmly believe that theſe Scriptures are the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57235:28"/>
Word of God: yet thus much in all ſenſe and reaſon any natural man will grant; there be great preſumptions and probabilities, why they ſhould be taken for the Word of God. And he that doth acknowledge but thus much, doth by this acknowledgement binde himſelf to reverence them above all humane writings. For all men naturally know, that if they be Gods Word, they are worthie all poſſible reverence. Wherefore if a man ſuppoſe it only as probable, that they are, or know nothing to the contrarie why they may not be Gods Word: he is bound to reverence and eſteem them above all words or writings of man. As for example; If any Subject in this land ſhould receive Letters concerning ſome lawful and indifferent requeſt from any other his equal or fellow ſubject, whom he had great reaſon well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; ſuppoſe he certainly knew that they were ſuch a mans Letters, and no counterfeit: yet if he ſhould receive Letters in his <hi>Majeſties name,</hi> containing the ſame or other as reaſonable requeſt: although he knew not ſo certainly that theſe were his <hi>Majeſties Letters,</hi> as that the others were ſome well-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected Subjects, yet is he in dutie bound to uſe them with greater reſpect and reverence, than the former. The bare preſumption and probabilitie that they were <hi>the Kings Letters,</hi> doth binde him to enquire further, whether they were his Letters or no: nor were his fault excuſable, if he ſhould ſhew any ſigne of diſloyaltie, or irreverence towards them, until he knew that they were not ſuch, as their Title or ſuperſcription did import.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 He that hath but the ſame probabilitie, that the Scriptures contain in them Gods own words, as that <hi>Livie</hi> his Hiſtories contain the Roman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, muſt needs eſteem of them infinitely above all humane works. And <hi>This fruit hypothetical or ſuppoſed Belief may bring forth, even in the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or natural man.</hi> And what hath been ſaid of reverence to the Scriptures upon this ſuppoſal, is alſo moſt true of mans actions. <hi>If men do but believe it as probable, that the Scriptures are the Word of God: this belief will procure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good moral actions, and much amendment of life, though not ſuch ſpiritual perfection, as God in his Word requireth.</hi> And the reaſon of this aſſertion is evident. For we ſee daily, that men undertake actions of great difficultie and danger, not ſo much according to the probabilitie of attaining ſome good, as according to the greatneſs of that good which poſſibly may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. So we ſee many, that might live in eaſe at home with certaintie of moderate gains, to undertake voyages to the Weſt or Eaſt Indies, only upon this reſolution, That if it be their luck or lot to be rich, there they may have enough, although the adventure be ſubject to great dangers, and obnoxious to infinite caſualties. And many there be, that will not uſually lay out a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but upon very fair ground of ſome gain or ſaving thrift, who yet will be well content to venture a Crown or an Angel in a Lotterie, where there may be ſome poſſibilitie, though no probabilitie, of obtaining twentie or thirtie pounds. Theſe, and infinite other examples, obvious to dailie experience, may ſerve as a perfect induction of our general aſſertion. <hi>That the meer poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of obtaining ſome great and extraordinary good, is of greater moment in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Yea, how could they not be deſirous to lay down this life it ſelf, upon hope of obtaining ſuch a life? For this life compared to that to come, hath not the proportion of a Farthing to whole Millions of Gold, or all the treaſures in this World. Nor is the caſe herein like unto that of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Lotterie; where a man may venture his life, or goods if he liſt, but if he do not, none calleth him to an account for not doing it: But in the Scriptures everlaſting torments, grief, and perpetual horror are threatned to all ſuch, as frame not their lives according to Gods will in them revealed.</p>

For ſeeing in the Scriptures are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to every mans choice everlaſting life, or everlaſting death: what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream madneſs is it for men to enter into any courſe of life, or to undertake any matter of moment, which may exact their chief imployments, before they have diligently looked to the main chance? before they have tried the utmoſt of their wits, and others beſt adviſe, to know the tenour of their own eſtate? We ſee daily what great pains men of no ſmall account do take in the ſtudie of Alchymie, ſpending their ſpirits, and moſt of their ſubſtance in trying concluſions, and ſearching out the truth of thoſe things, for which they have but weak grounds of Philoſophie or reaſon; onely the conceit of the good they aim at, (which is rather poſſible then probable for them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) inforceth a kinde of hope, and encourageth them to go forward.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 To ſpeak nothing of the good the Scripture promiſeth, the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of eternal death (me thinks) ſhould move, either the Chymicks, (which ſpend much gold only upon hope of getting more) or any other man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to ſpend all the treaſure, whatſoever either this their Art, or all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could yeeld, to ſecure themſelves from ſuch horrible torments, as the Scriptures threaten to their Contemners or negligent Hearers.

moſt men beſtow leſs labor in them, then in other ordinary Studies. Firſt, if we compare the good they ſet before us, as a recompence and reward of our travails, it is beyond all compariſon greater then the ſcope of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trade or Science. For here is a double Infinity of ſolid Good: Firſt, they promiſe Joy two wayes Infinite, both in Degree and Continuance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they threaten unto their Contemners &amp; deſpiſers death &amp; torments doubly infinite, both in Degree and Continuance. Now if the probabilities of the truth of Scriptures were far leſs, than is uſually found in other ſtudies, or Humane hopes; yet could this in Humane reaſon be no reaſon why we ſhould labour leſs in them, than in other affairs; ſeeing the incomparable exceſs of the good they promiſe, doth abundantly recompence this. But if the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the truth of Scripture, be in natural reaſon equal to the probabilities which men uſually take for their grounds in many greateſt attempts; then certainly not to beſtow as great pains and travail, in trying the truth of their promiſes, as in any other Human attempts, or affairs, doth argue infinite Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Aſk we the Chymick, what reaſon he hath to toil ſo much in the ſtudy of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> or other intricate Writers of his Faculty; (the like we may ſay of any Phyſitians:) their anſwer (as you may reade in their writings) is this: <hi>Many Philoſophers in former ages have laboured much in this ſtudy, and have ſet down good rules of their experiments; who</hi> (as is probable) <hi>would never have taken ſuch pains upon no ground.</hi> And verily this tradition, or the authority they give to their Writers, is their chief motive. For I think few of their Ancient Authors have bequeathed to their ſucceſſors any Gold made by this Art, thereby to encourage them. If then tradition, conſent of time or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Authors, or relation of experiments, be an eſpecial induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for men to adventure their charge, pains, and travel in this Faculty, as in all other affairs: without all controverſie the Scriptures in all theſe motives have an eſpecial Prerogative above all other faculties or ſciences, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit humane reaſon were admitted judge. For the Authority of Gods Church is far more general, then the conſent of any Writers in any one faculty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. The conſent of time likewiſe is greater. For no Age ſince Chriſts time in theſe civil parts of the World, but by the report of other Writers, as well as Chriſtians, hath yeelded obedience unto Scriptures as the Word of God. Men of moſt excellent ſpirits and learning in every Age, have addicted their ſtudies unto this truth. About the time of our Saviours coming, Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arts, and other civil diſciplines did moſt flouriſh. The Grecians ſought after Wiſdom and ſecular Philoſophy with the like; the Romans after Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, State knowledge, and diſcipline of war; all the World almoſt, (above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thoſe places wherein Chriſtianity was firſt planted) was then ſet upon Curious Arts: yet we ſee how the ſtudy and ſearch of Scriptures in ſhort time did prove, as <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod amongſt the Magitians Serpents. It hath devoured all, and brought them to acknowledge Allegiance unto it; uſing the help of beſt ſecular Arts, as it were Nutriment for the growth of Chriſtianity, and expelling the reſt as Excrements out of the Church. Nor can the Atheiſt name any Age, wherein the Heathen had an <hi>Oliver</hi> to oppugn our profeſſion, but we had a <hi>Rowland</hi> to defend it. If they had a <hi>Porphyrie</hi> or <hi>Celſus</hi> to oppoſe Philoſophy againſt it, we had an <hi>Origen</hi> (a <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p n="3">3 Laſtly, the experiments which are related by Authors of this profeſſion, men (in any reaſonable mans judgement) as much to be Believed herein, as any other Writers in theirs; are far more notable and apt to produce belief, and hope of attaining the truth in this profeſſion, than any others can have in theirs. The experiments of others were but ordinary and natural; theſe are extraordinary and ſupernatural. <hi>If the Atheiſt ſhould impudently deny the truth of their report: we may convince him with S.</hi> Auguſtines <hi>acute Dilemma. If the Miracles related by our Writers be true, they give evident experiment of the truth of Scripture: if there were no ſuch particular miracles, but all feigned; then this was a miracle above all miracles, that Chriſtian Religion ſhould prevail againſt all other Arts, Power, or Policy, without any extraordinary event or mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> It was not ſo eaſie a matter to cozen all the Roman Emperours, and their Deputies, with feigned Tales; the World, which hated Chriſtians ſo much, was inquiſitive enough to know the truth of their reports. I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; <hi>Niſi veritas magna fuiſſet non praevaluiſſet.</hi> It was miraculous doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that it ſhould ſo enreaſe without arms; without any promiſe of carnal pleaſure, or ſecurity: but even againſt their natural inclination that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, and all the Worlds oppoſition againſt it. It had enemies both private and publick, domeſtick and forraign, even the fleſh and ſenſe of thoſe which followed it fought againſt it.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſince that time hath found a multitude of followers; but all either enforced to follow him by threats of ſhame, diſgrace, and tortures in this life; or elſe allured thereto by fair promiſes of carnal pleaſures to be perpetual without interruption in the life to come. He hath ſet his followers ſuch a courſe, as they might be ſure both of wind and tide. And <hi>if the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whereat they arrive were as ſafe as their courſe is eaſie, they were of all men the moſt happy.</hi> But Chriſtianity from its firſt beginning, was to row againſt the ſtream of fleſh and blood, and to bear out ſail againſt all the blaſts that the Devil, World, or Fleſh could oppoſe againſt it. In a word, <hi>the increaſe of Mahumetiſm hath followed the barbarous Turkiſh monarchies advancement, as moiſture in bodies doth the increaſing fulneſs of the Moon.</hi> And it had been an extraordinary Miracle, if a barbarous multitude (never acquainted with any civil pleaſures,) ſhould not have compoſed their mindes unto their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, in following a Religion, framed, as it were, to court the ſenſes, and wooe the fleſh. But Chriſtianitie then flouriſhed moſt, when the ſcorching heat of perſecution was at the height: When the countenance of Emperours, as terrible to their foes (for their Heroical valour) as plauſible to their friends (for their lovely carriage) were moſt fiercely ſet againſt it. What Princes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more terrible to their enemies, or more amiable to their friends, than <hi>Trajan, Diocleſian,</hi> or others of the Chriſtians perſecutors were? What man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57235:30"/>
living is there of civil education, that would not have lothed <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the whole ſucceſſion of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Familie, in reſpect of theſe Roman Princes? And yet a great part of their native Subjects, men, as otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently qualified, ſo of a quiet and peaceable diſpoſition, yet readie alwaies to venture their lives for theſe Heathen Princes, in moſt dangerous ſervice againſt the enemies of the Roman Empire, but moſt readie to follow the Cruciſied Chriſt through fire and ſword, againſt their Emperors command (dearer to them than this mortal life) and all the Worlds threats, or allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It were ſottiſh to think, that ſuch men had not perfect notice of ſome Higher Powers Commandment to the contrarie, (whom they thought it ſafer to obey) when they contradicted the commandments, or fair allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe ſupream Earthly Powers. And it were as ſilly a perſwaſion to think, that, if the great Turk would change his religion for any other, that might yeeld like hopes of carnal pleaſure after this life, any great number of his Subjects would loſe their dignities for refuſing ſubſcription.</p>

For the conceit of impoſſibilities or repugnances in nature, objected by the obdurate Atheiſts to make the Principles of Chriſtian religion ſeem incredible (that they might like old Truants have the companie of Novices in Chriſtianitie to loiter, or miſ-ſpend good hours with them:) we ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance diſpel them, and all other Clouds of like Errours, in unfolding the truth of thoſe Articles, which they moſt concern.</p>

In the mean time I muſt requeſt him to ſuſpend his judgement of them, and onely to intend the lively Characters of Hiſtorical truth in other relations, of matters neither ſtrange nor incredible in themſelves. Either <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote a true Hiſtorie, or elſe his words are but a Fiction: either <hi>Poetical</hi> to delight others, or <hi>Political</hi> to advantage himſelf or his ſucceſſors.

As for example, if theſe relations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 1. and the 25. had not been either real Adjuncts of ſome <hi>Famous Truth</hi> then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known, or elſe appointed by God to be notified for ſome ſpecial purpoſe to poſteritie: how could it poſſibly have come into any mans thought, or to what end ſhould it have gon thence into his Pen, to ſhew the reaſon why <hi>Evah</hi> ſhould call her firſt ſon <hi>Cain,</hi> or her third <hi>Seth?</hi>

Then</hi> Lamech <hi>begat a ſon, and called his name</hi> Noah, <hi>ſaying, This ſame ſhall comfort us concerning our work, and ſorrow of our hands, as touching the earth which the Lord hath curſed.</hi> It was doubtleſs from ſome diverſity in the matter preſuppoſed unto this work, not from the workmans choice or invention, why the reaſon of theſe three mens names ſhould be ſpecified, as afterwards will more plainly appear.

V. 37. Then <hi>Reuben</hi> anſwered his father, ſaying, Slay my two ſons, if I bring him not to thee again: Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him to mine hand and I will bring him to thee again.

Cap. 43. v. 1. Now great famin was in the land. V. 2. And when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father ſaid unto them, Turn again, and buy us a little food. V. 3. And <hi>Judah</hi> anſwered him, ſaying, The man charged us by an oath, ſaying, Never ſee my face, except your brother be with you. V. 4. If thou wilt ſend our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food. V. 5. But if thou wilt not ſend him, we will not go down: for, &amp;c. N. 6. And Iſrael ſaid, wherefore dealt ye ſo evil with me, as to tell the man, whether ye had yet a brother, or no? V. 7. And they anſwered, The man asked ſtraitly of our ſelves, and of our kinred, ſaying, Is your father yet alive? Have ne any brother? And we told him according to theſe words. Could we know certainly that he would ſay, Bring your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther down? V. 8. Then ſaid <hi>Judah,</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his father, Send the boy with me, that we may riſe and go, and that we may live and not die, both we, and thou, and our children. V. 9. I will be ſurety for him, of my hand ſhalt thou require him: If I bring him not to thee, and ſet him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever. 10. For except ye had made this carrying, doubtleſſe by this we had returned the ſecond time. V. 11. Then their father ſaid unto them, If it muſt needs be ſo now, do thus: Take of the beſt fruits of the land in your veſſels, and bring the man a preſent; a little Rozen, a little Honey, Spices, and Myrth, Nuts, &amp; Almonds. V. 12. And take double money in your hand, and the money that was brought again in your ſacks mouths: carry it again in your hand, leſt it were ſome overſight. V. 13. Take alſo your brother, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and go again to the man. V. 14. And God Almighty give you mercy in the ſight of the man, that he may deliver you your other brother, and <hi>Benjamin:</hi> but I ſhall be robbed of my child, as I have been.</note> The ſtorie is is <hi>Geneſis</hi> 42. from the 29. unto the 15 verſe of the 43 Chapter.

                           <p>AN other Inducement for believing the truth of the Old Teſtament, is the <hi>Harmony</hi> of ſo many ſeveral writers, living in ſuch diſtance of Ages, handling ſuch diverſity of arguments, and covering them with ſtiles, for the majeſty of ſome, and the familiarity of others, more different, then <hi>Virgils</hi> verſes, and the rudeſt countrymans talk; and yet all of them retaining the ſelf ſame reliſh. Whiles we reade <hi>Tully, Virgil, Livie, Saluſt</hi> and <hi>Ovid,</hi> though all living near about one time; yet their writings differ as much as Fleſh and Fiſh. Many learned men like ſome one or few of theſe, and yet much miſlike others, reputed as excellent writers in their kinde, living about the ſame time: much more might he that ſhould have read the common or vulgar Hiſtoriographers, Poets, or Orators of that time, have contemned them as baſe in reſpect of the former. But the Prophets of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Hiſtoriographers of the ſame, though differing infinitely in degrees of ſtile and invention; yet agree as well in the ſubſtance or eſſential quality of their writings, as the ſame Pomander chafed and unchafed. There is the ſame odour of life, and goodneſſe in both, but more fragrant and piercing in the one than in the other. And no man that much likes the one, can miſlike the other: he may like it leſſe, but diſlike it he cannot, if he like the other.

One eſpecial motive is from the drift, and ſcope of all theſe ſacred writings; whether Hiſtories, Prophets, Pſalms, or the Goſpel. <hi>The end and ſcope of all theſe, is onely to ſet out the glory of God, and the good of mankinde.</hi> In their moſt famous victories, and good ſucceſſe of their beſt contrived policies, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the glory wholly to God. There is no circumſtance inſerted to erect the praiſe of man, not of the chiefeſt managers of ſuch affairs. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it the greateſt praiſe that can be given unto their Worthies, to let the World know they were Beloved of God, and that God did fight for them. Not one Writer in this ſacred volume bewrayes the leaſt ſigne of envie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, that lived with him, or had gone before him: Not one that giveth the leaſt ſuſpition of ſeeking his own praiſe by leſſening others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, as if he had corrected wherein others had erred, or finiſhed what they had well begun, but left imperfect. No intimation in any of them to let poſterity underſtand, that it ſhould think it ſelf beholding to them for their good directions. They ſeek no thanks, as if they undertook their labours vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, only for the good of others; but proclaim a neceſſity laid upon them, for doing that which they do, and a Wo if they do it not. They ſpare not to rehearſe the iniquity, and ſhame of their progenitors and neareſt kinsfolks, with Gods fearful judgements upon them for the ſame, to regiſter their Prince and peoples, or their own diſgrace (as the World counteth diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>grace) to all poſterity: ſo Gods Name may thereby be more glorified, and his Church ediſied, <hi>Jer. 9. v. 23, 24. Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57235:33"/>
nor the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength: but let him that glorieth, glory in that he underſtandeth and knoweth the Lord. Jeremy</hi> himſelf revealeth his own ſlackneſſe in undertaking his appointed charge, <hi>Jer. 20. v.</hi> 7. 8, 14, 5, 16, 17, 18. he no where bewrayes any deſire of praiſe, as if he had excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all his equals in wit: all that is good in him, or his people, he giveth to God. <hi>Daniel,</hi> who did excel in the interpretations of dreams and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and had the ſtate of many kingdoms for many years to come revealed unto him; ſo as if he would have challenged the revelation of his countries return from Captivity, he could not have been diſproved, yet ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth that he learned this out of the prophecy of <hi>Jeremy Dan. 9. v.</hi> 2. Although his meaſure of knowledge was exceeding great, yet he affects not the reputation of <hi>Knowing above that meaſure, which God hath given him, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 This one quality (in them all) of not ſeeking their own, nor their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries praiſe, but onely the praiſes of their God, and the profit of his Church (if we conſider it well) may ſufficiently teſtifie, that they ſpeak not upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate motions, who were thus clear from all ſuſpition of private reſpects. Nor can we ſuſpect, that they ſhould thus conſpire together unto one end, from the will and purpoſe of man. For what man could limit others thoughts, or rule their wits which lived after him? Leaſt of all can Chance be imagined the Author of ſo many ſeveral writers conſtancy in conſpiring thus to one end in ſeveral Ages. Let us conjecture what cauſes we can, S. <hi>Peter</hi> muſt reſolve the doubt, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 20, 21. <hi>All of them ſpake as they were moved by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which was preſent one and the ſame to all.</hi> If they had not ſpoken as they were moved by the Spirit, but as if they had moved themſelves, to finde out matter, or ſtretched their wits to enlarge invention: then would the later ſort eſpecially have catched at many By-narrations, and inſerted many <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, little pertinent to that foundation which others had layed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. But now we ſee the continual drift of their writings ſo ſeriouſly ſet upon one and the ſelf-ſame end, as if they had all wrought by an others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who had caſt the platform of the edifice himſelf, not minded to finiſh his work in any of the firſt workmens age: and yet will have the later to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin where the other left, without any alteration or tricks of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 All theſe properties of theſe ſacred Writers, do ſufficiently witneſſe their motives to have been Divine, but more abundantly whileſt we conſider the vanity of the Jewiſh people, if we take them as they are by nature, not ſanctified by the Spirit of God. For naturally they are given to magnifie their own Nation, more then any other people living, yea to make God behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto them for their ſanctity: few of them would ſeek the praiſe of their God, but with reference to their own Hence our Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings it as an argument of the truth of his Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4 5. in that he <hi>did not preach himſelf but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and himſelf their ſervant for his ſake</hi> ſo doth our Saviour, <hi>John 7. v. 18. He that ſpeaketh of himſelf ſeeketh his own glory, but he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſſe is in him.</hi> This ſincerity in teaching, (eſpecially in a man of Jewiſh progeny) when it is tried to continue without all affectation or diſſimulation, is the true <gap reason="foreign">

The like live Characters of ſincerty are not to be found in any elſe, ſave only in theſe ſacred Writers, or ſuch as have ſincerely obeyed their doctrine. And in many of thoſe books which our Church accounts Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal, there evidently appears a ſpice of ſecular vanity; howſoever the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57235:33"/>
Pen-men of them were truly religious ſanctified men, and have ſought to imitate the writing of the Prophets, and other Writers of this ſacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. But much more eminent is the like vanity in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> a man other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as excellent for meer natural parts, or artificial learning, as his Country yeelded any, not inferior to any Hiſtoriographers whatſoever.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Seeing in this whole body of Scriptures there appears one and the ſame Spirit, albeit the members be of diverſe faſhion and quality: this ſacred vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume it ſelf may ſerve as a lively type or image of that <hi>Vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> which ought to be in the Church and myſtical body of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ. 4. v.</hi> 3.

As Gods plagues upon the Ancient Iſraelites were oft-times ſudden, and (for the time) violent: ſo their deliverance from them was ſpeedy, becauſe their ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was leſſe, and the ſins, for which they were to repent, of leſſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>But the continual increaſe of this peoples wickedneſſe, in their ſucceſſions, and poſterities ſlackneſſe, in ſorrowing either for their own or Predeceſſours ſins, made Gods plagues inflicted upon them more durable,</hi> as appeareth by the long Captivities and oppreſſions of this people in later Ages, If we compare them with the often, but ſhort afflictions, which in former times had befallen them. This long durance of great calamities, made Poſteritie leſſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of Gods promiſes then their forefathers had been; at the leaſt, whiles theſe continued, they were leſſe acquainted with Gods favour then their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors were. And from the want of like ſenſible Experience of his preſent help in time of trouble, later generations are more querulous and leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in their prayers uttered in their diſtreſſe, as we may ſee in the 98, and other Pſalms, conceived by the Godly amongſt this people in the calamities of later Times. Thus we may ſee how truly the diverſity of Gods dealing with his people in different Ages, is repreſented in the Character, Stile, or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57235:36"/>
Affection of theſe ſacred Writers, all much different in former and latter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: much more may we preſume, that the general and true Diverſity of Times, and GODS divers manner of proceeding with mankinde in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Generations, is moſt truly related and exemplified in the Hiſtorical relations of the ſame ſacred Volumes; of which in the Section following.</p>

And as in the Art of Painting, general rules may be given for the right drawing of Pictures, yet he that will take any particular mans, muſt look upon the love face it ſelf, or uſe the benefit of his Glaſs: So in this caſe, there may be good directions given, how men ſhould draw Experiments, or take Obſervations of this kinde, which being taken, can not be fully imprinted in another, by him that took them: but every man muſt have continual recourſe unto this Spiritual Glaſſe, which far ſurpaſſeth all bodily Glaſſes in this; that in It we may ſee, not onely the true ſhape and proportion of our Souls as they are, or of what faſhion they ſhould be; but It hath alſo an operative force of aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them unto the paterns of godly and religious mens Souls repreſented herein, yea, even of transforming them into the ſimilitude of that Image wherein they were firſt created. <hi>The</hi> Idaeas <hi>of Sanctity and Righteouſneſſe contained in this</hi> Spiritual Glaſſe, <hi>are the cauſes of our Edification in good life and Vertue: as the</hi> Idaea <hi>or Platform in the Artificers head, is the cauſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Houſe that is builded by it.</hi>

But the Heathen (as Heatheniſh minded men do even to this day) ſought the reaſons of ſuch alterations from ſenſible Agents, or ſecond Cauſes, which have ſmall affinity with thoſe effects: or if they had, yet the diſpoſition of ſuch cauſes depends wholly upon his will; who, though moſt <hi>Immutable in Himſelf, changeth times and ſeaſons at His pleaſure.</hi> And whereſoever the light of his Goſpel cometh, it verifieth that ſaying of our Apoſtle, <hi>Ecce vetera tranſierunt, &amp; nova facta ſunt omnia:</hi> And new times yield new obſervations; which cannot be taken aright, nor their cauſes known, without eſpecial directions from this rule of Life.

For many inventions, which in ſucceſſion ceaſe to be of like uſe and conſequence as they were in former times, become yet matters of delight and ſport unto poſterity: as Shooting continues ſtill an Exerciſe of good recreation to us of this Land, becauſe it hath been a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of admirable uſe and conſequence unto our worthy Anceſtors. But whence came this conceit of the gods appearing in ſenſible ſhapes into <hi>Homers</hi> and other Ancient Poets heads? How became it a common place of Poetical invention, whileſt Poetrie it ſelf was but beginning? Surely, as God had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in divers manners unto the old world, ſo had he appeared in divers forms (perhaps) not onely to the Iſraelites, but unto other nations alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſtinction of this people from them: howſoever, as the devils had counterfeited Gods manner of ſpeaking to his people, ſo did they the manner of His, or his Angels apparitions.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Such apparitions of God or his Angels, the ſacred Storie tels us, were frequent, not onely in <hi>Abrahams, Iſaacs, Jacobs,</hi> and the Patriarchs times, but in the Ages immediately going before the times that <hi>Homer</hi> wrote of: ſo that the traditions of theſe undoubted Experiments (if <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Aſia</hi> had <note place="margin">Exod 3. 2.

The like apparitions in times following were more rare in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; not that the date of Gods, or his Angels extraordinary preſence was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly expired: but their preſence was ſeldom apprehended, by reaſon of that peoples blindneſſe of heart, and want of Prophets eyes. For <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant had not ſeen ſo much as a glimpſe of any Angel, albeit a mighty Hoſt of theſe heavenly ſouldiers had pitched their tents about him, unleſs his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by his prayer to God, had opened his eyes.

And he anſwered, Fear not: for they that be with us, are more then they that be with them. Then</hi> Eliſhah <hi>prayed, and ſaid, Lord open his eyes that he may ſee. And the Lord opened the eyes of the ſervant, and he looked, and behold, the mountain was full of horſes and chariots round about</hi> Eliſhah. This place, and that other of the Angels appearing to <hi>Balaam,</hi> may inſtruct us, that ſuch apparitions might be conſpicuous to ſome one or few whom they concerned, though not to others preſent with them: and that the eyes of ſome, which were open enough to worldly ſpectacles, might be cloſe ſhut to theſe celeſtial viſions, as the ears of others have been in like caſe.

Yet I cannot think, that he would have fained ſuch an Aſſiſtance, unleſſe the Valour of ſome men, in former times, had been extraordinary, and more then natural. Which ſupernatural Excellency in ſome before others, could not proceed but from a ſupernatural Cauſe. And thus far his conceit agrees with Scripture: that there were more Heroical ſpirits in old times, then in latter, and more immediate directions from God, for managing of moſt wars. And from the experience hereof, the Ancient Poets are more copious in their Hyperbolical praiſes of their Worthies, then the diſcreeter ſort of latter Poets durſt be, whileſt they wrote of their own times.

And, beſides this general occaſion of miſtaking other mens actions, and events of other times, every particular ſort of men ſeek to aſſign cauſes of things ſutable unto their proper Faculties. The <hi>Natural Philoſopher</hi> ſtriveth to reduce all effects to <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> or ſome ſenſible qualitie; the <hi>Mathematician,</hi> to abſtract <hi>Forms or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi> or inſenſible influences; the <hi>Politician</hi> thinks no alteration in publick States, or private mens affairs, fals out, but from ſome Politick cauſe or <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of man:</hi> and whileſt in the Annals of Antiquities he reads of ſundry events, ſurpaſſing the reach or ſkill of mans invention, or contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie courſe of nature, he attributes all unto the <hi>Simplicity or credulitie of their Anceſtors.</hi> Albeit, if we ſhould ſearch the true cauſe of their creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in yielding aſſent unto ſuch ſtrange reports, it will eaſily confute the error of poſterity: for this credulity in ſuch particulars, could not have been ſo great in their Anceſtors, unleſſe their mindes had been firſt inclined to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, from the tradition of their Predeceſſors. But why their forefathers ſhould either have invented ſuch ſtrange reports, or be ſo inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them: if we ſearch into the depth or firſt ſpring of this perſwaſion, we cannot imagine any other cauſe, but the real and ſenſible <hi>Experience</hi> of ſuch ſtrange events as they reported to poſterity. This did enforce <hi>Belief</hi> upon the firſt Progenitors of any Nation: and from the fulneſſe of this perſwaſion, or actual <hi>Belief</hi> in them, was bred this credulitie or aptneſſe in poſterity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the like, which yet in ſucceſſe of time did by little and little wear out. It is great ſimplicity and uncharitable credulitie in us, to think, that either the moſt Ancient, or middle Ages of the world, were generally ſo ſimple, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, or apt to believe every thing, as ſome would make them. It had been as hard a matter to have perſwaded men of thoſe times, that there were no Gods, no divine power or providence: as it would be to perſwade the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Athieſts, that there is an Almighty power, which created all things; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth and diſpoſeth of all things to his glory. <hi>The moſt politick Athe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The often manifeſtation of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power in Battels, or preſence in Oracles, and ſenſible documents of revenge from heaven, made the one prone to entertain any report of the Gods, though never ſo ſtrange: and the want of like ſenſible ſigns or documents of the ſame power in our dayes (whileſt all mens minds are ſtill ſet upon poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick means and practiſes for their own good) doth make the other ſo credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and apt to aſſent to any Politik Diſcourſe, and ſo averſe from Belief of the Prophets or ſacred Writers, which reduce all effects to the <hi>Firſt Cauſe.</hi> But this we cannot do ſo immediately as the Ancient did: becauſe God uſeth his Wiſdom more in the managing of this Politick world, then he did in times of old; <hi>and men naturally are leſſe apprehenſive of His Wiſdom, then of His Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;

                                 </gap>, then ever it was.</hi> For the ſame reaſon were the Ancient Iſraelites more prone to Idolatry, then their ſucceſſours were, after the erection of the ſecond Temple; or either of them were at any time to ſerve their GOD. For the ſenſible ſigns and bewitching inticements of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary powers, miſtaken for Divine, were then moſt common; and Gods Wonders and miracles grew more rare, becauſe they ſwarved from his commandments. What Jew was there, almoſt, in the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> but would have given his body for an Holcauſt, rather then ſacrifice to any of the Heathen Gods? The undoubted experience of long Wo and miſery for their former Idolatry, made them ſo averſe from this ſin. And the certain ſigns of the Meſſiahs approach, did ſupport them from falling into Atheiſm. Such violence as theſe later willingly ſuffered at the hands of Heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rather then they would conſent unto Idolatry, their Forefathers in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe were as ready to offer unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> for not furthering them in their idolatrous imaginations.

                           <p n="6">6 The viſion was of three ſorts of beaſts; The <hi>Frſt, Lions and Leopards;</hi> The <hi>ſecond, Bears and Wolves;</hi> The <hi>third, of Dogs or leſſer creatures,</hi> biting and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another.

Thus much may ſuffice for the removal of that prejudice, which <hi>Atheiſts, Infidels,</hi> and other <hi>Worldly-wiſe men</hi> have, of their Anceſtors Credulity, or Fabuloſity, which were not incident to primary Antiquity, but unto Ages in ſucceſſion nearer to thoſe times wherein wonders had been plentiful: as commonly the Braggadochian humour doth hant the degenerate race of worthy Anceſtors, before their poſterity come to be Sneaks or Peſants, which in the race of private perſons anſwers in proportion to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, the common Symptom of decrepit Age in Kingdoms.</p>

                           <p n="2">2 A <hi>Poet</hi> being (as his name imports) a <hi>Maker,</hi> according to the Latin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, is not made by Art, but framed to this divine Faculty by Nature. Not that any amongſt the Romans became Poets on a ſodain: but that many very fruitful wits in all other kindes of learning, could not be forced by any indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, art, or culture to ſuch a temper, as was befitting this plant of Eden, which groweth not in any modern breſt without more tender care and greater che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, then any other ſlip or branch of the tree of knowledge; and yet when all is done ſeldom comes to any proof, unleſſe it borrow grounds from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: as tender plants can hardly be removed from a better ſoil to a worſe, without ſome of the earth wherein they naturally grow. Were Arts to begin anew, <hi>Poetry,</hi> which was the firſt and moſt common among the Ancient, in all probability, would ſpring the laſt, &amp; grow the ſloweſt amongſt us. Their wits of old were not naturally or generally better then ours: why then was the way to <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> which unto us uſing all help of Art and Imitation, is laborious and hard to aſcend, ſo plain and eaſie to them, without any guide or help; all other Artificial learning being then either unknown, or very ſcant? Such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or obſervations as they had or cared for, they knew not otherwiſe how to convey unto poſteritie, then by Poetical numbers and reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

advantage. The Faſhion of the world in their times was more apt to raviſh their thoughts with Admiration: wonderful Events were then frequent: nor did their frequency abate, but rather increaſe wonderment, becauſe their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety was great, and the apprehenſion of inviſible or Supernatural Powers in them uſual. So that admiration was then inforced upon men, and the breaſts of ſuch as diligently obſerved theſe events, or were any way diſpoſed by nature to the Faculty, were inſpired with lively and ſublimate affections, apt to vent themſelves in ſuch Poetical Phraſe and reſemblances, as we cannot reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, unleſs we raiſe our invention by Art and imitation, and ſtir up Admiration by meditation and ſtudy. And becauſe neither our ſenſes are moved with any extraordinary effects of Gods <hi>Power,</hi> nor our minds bent to obſerve the ways of his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſo as we might be ſtricken with true Admiration of them, we have fewer good ſacred Poems, then of any other kind. But as the Ancients chief learning did conſiſt of Poetry: ſo the excellency of their <hi>Poetry</hi> was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen in the proper and native ſubject of this Faculty, that is, in matters of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Uſe or obſervation: whence the title of <hi>Vates</hi> did deſcend unto ſecular or profane Poets, which retained the number and manner of ſpeech uſed by the former.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 That ſuch as were <hi>Vates</hi> indeed, were taught this ſublimity of ſpeech by admiration of extraordinary events, may be confirmed by the Hiſtorical nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Sacred Story: wherin Poetical Hymns or ſons are the uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of ſtrange or wonderful events. As, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. after the victory gotten over Siſera, <hi>Then ſang</hi> Deborah, <hi>&amp;</hi> Barach <hi>the ſon of</hi> Abinoam, <hi>the ſame day ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Praiſe ye the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Hannah</hi> after the Lord had heard her prayer, and taken away her barrenneſs, burſt out into the like Poetical Hymn, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.

So likewiſe after the manifeſtation of Gods wonders in the red Sea, all his people (as if they had been baptized in a ſacred Helicon) preſently turn Poets, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1. And again, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. after they had returned to <hi>Beer,</hi> the <hi>Well</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> had opened out of the hard rock with his rod, Iſrael (as if they had waſhed their mouths in Hippocrene) had their voices tuned to an high ſtrain of <hi>Poetry: Then Iſrael ſang this ſong: Riſe up, WELL, ſing ye unto it, the Princes digged this Well, the Captains of the people dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, even with their ſtaves.</hi>

                           <p n="4">4 That the frequent uſe of <hi>Poetry</hi> among the Ancient heathen, did ariſe from like occaſions, may be gathered from <hi>Strabo:</hi> who from Antiquity, better <note place="margin">Strabo Lib. 1. Fol. 15.</note> known to him then us, avoucheth it as unqueſtionable, that all other ſet ſpeech, whether Hiſtorical or Rhetorical, was but the Progeny of <hi>Poetry,</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in latter times from its wonted ſtate and dignity; whereas the Ancients knew no other branch of Artificial or ſet ſpeech, but only <hi>Poetry.</hi> Albeit to ſpeak properly, it was (in reſpect of the Efficient or impulſive cauſes) rather <hi>Superartificial,</hi> then Natural or Artificial; and Rhetorick and Hiſtorie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Artificial. This opinion will not ſeem ſtrange, if we conſider, that the wiſer ſort in thoſe times did commend ſuch matters onely to writing, as might inflame poſterity with devotion and love of vertue. For <hi>Poetrie,</hi> as the ſame Author tels us, was accounted by Antiquitie, <hi>Prima quaedam Philoſophia,</hi> a kind of ſacred moral Philoſophie, appropriated, as it ſeems, at the firſt to the relation or repreſentation of ſupernatural Events or divine matters onely: of which the moſt Ancient had beſt experience, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to communicate them to poſteritie, elevated (as is obſerved before)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57235:46"/>
by the excellency of the Object, to this celeſtial kind of ſpeech which is moſt apt to raviſh younger wits, as it ſelf was bred of Admiration. This uſe of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi> appears in ſome Fragments of moſt Ancient Poets, in their kind propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> and the ſongs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the only pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of true Poeſie: whoſe ſubjects, uſually, are the wonderful works of God manifeſted unto men.

Or if we would but ſearch the native uſe of <hi>Poetry</hi> by that end which men, not led awry by hopes of applauſe, or gain, or other external reſpects, but directed rather by the internal impulſion of this Faculty, and ſecret working of their Souls, do aim at: <hi>It principally ſerves for Venting Extraordinary Affections.</hi> No man almoſt ſo dul, but will be Poetically affected in the ſubject of his ſtrongeſt paſſions.

And as Speech or Articulation of voices in general, was given to man for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his conceits or meaning unto others; ſo <hi>Poetry,</hi> the <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Speech,</hi> ſerves for the more lively expreſſing of his Choicer Conceits, for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57235:46"/>
                              <hi>Beautifying His darling-thoughts or Fancies,</hi> which almoſt diſdain to go abroad in other then this exactly-proportioned attire, <hi>The ſouls wooing ſuits</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) whereby ſhe wins others to Sympathize with her in abundance of <hi>Grief,</hi> or to conſent with her in exceſſive <hi>Joy,</hi> or finally to ſettle their <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or diſlike where ſhe doth hers. And the more ſtrange or wonderful the matter conceived, or to be repreſented, is, the more pleaſant and admirable will the true and natural repreſentation of it be: and the more he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it, is raviſhed with delight of its Beauty or goodneſſe, the more will he long to communicate his conceit and liking of it to others. Whence, ſuch as had ſeen the Wonders of God and had been fed with his Hidden Manna, ſought by their lively &amp; hearty repreſentations to invite others, as the Pſalmiſt doth, <hi>To taſte and ſee the Goodneſſe of the Lord,</hi> as Birds and Beaſts, when they <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 8.</note> have found pleaſant food, call (on their faſhion) unto others of the ſame kinde, to be partakers with them in their Joy: until Satan, who hunts after the life of Man, as Man doth after the life of Birds, did invent his counterfeit <hi>Cals</hi> to allure our ſouls into his Snare. For, when men had once taken a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the natural repreſentation of events, delightful in themſelves: he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up others to invent the like, albeit there were no real truth or ſtability in the things repreſented, and the manner of repreſentation uſually ſo light and affected, as could argue no credence given by the Authors to their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but rather a deſire to pleaſe ſuch as had never ſet their mindes to any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſolid Truth, whoſe unſetled Fancies cannot chooſe but fall in Love with as many Fair Pictures of others pleaſant Imaginations as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them. For, as to view the connexion of real Cauſes with their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects (moſt of all, if both be rare, or the concurrence of Circumſtances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual) doth much affect the judicious underſtanding: ſo the quaint or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contrivance of Imaginary Rarities, ſet forth in ſplendent Artificial colours, doth captivate the Fancies of ſuch as are not eſtabliſhed in the love of truth. But (as the Orator ſaid of ſuch as applauded the Tragedie of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes)</hi> how would ſuch mens ſouls be raviſhed, could they upon ſure grounds be perſwaded, that theſe ſtories were true, albeit devoid of Artificial Colours, or Poetical contrivances, never uſed by ſacred Antiquitie? in whoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Wonders, the Phraſe is uſually moſt Poetical, as naturally it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be, where the mind is much affected; their invention leſſe Artificial or affected, then our Hiſtorical narrations of Modern affairs; the Character of their ſtile, (as was intimated before) doth argue that they ſought onely to ſet down the true Proportion of matters ſeen and heard, with ſuch reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as were moſt incident to their kind of life. And from the Efficacy of ſuch extraordinary effects upon their ſouls, is it, that the Prophets ſo often expreſs the ſame things in divers words, as if all they could ſay, could not equalize the ſenſible Experiments, which did move their Hearts and Fancies (as the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians hands or breath doth his inſtruments) to ſound out ſuch Pathetical Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Nor had their Ditties any greater diſproportion with their ſubject, then our Songs of Famous Victories, have with theirs; or other paſſionate Ditties, with their compoſers affections: albeit he that hath experience of <hi>Love,</hi> or abundant <hi>Grief,</hi> or <hi>Joy,</hi> will ſpeak in another Dialect, then ordinarily he uſeth, without any touch of affectation.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Hence we may clearly diſcern, whileſt wonders decayed, and men ſought as great delight in Fained, as their forefathers had done in True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations: how the diſproportion betwixt Repreſentations, and the real Events, or Experiments of the times, wherein the later Poets lived, became ſo Monſtrous and Prodigious. This fell out juſt ſo, as if the Armorours of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57235:47"/>
this Age ſhould not obſerve the ſtature of men now living, but faſhion their Armour by old <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwicks</hi> Harneſſe, or our Painters, not look upon the bodies of modern Engliſh-men, but take their proportions from ſome Ancient Pictures, which had been truly taken about ſome 1000 years ago, in ſome other Countrey, that had yielded men of more ample ſtature in that Age then this land of ours did in any. Such an Errour as this, which we have mentioned in <hi>Poetry,</hi> would quickly have been reformed in any other Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that had concerned mens temporal profit or commodities, or whereof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had been as competent Judges as the Profeſſors: for ſo, when they had begun to wander, or digreſs a little from their right end, they ſhould preſently have bin called to this account; <hi>Quid ad rem?</hi> your Work may be Prety, but not to our Purpoſe. But when ſuch Admirable Events, as were well worth Poetical expreſſion, decreaſed, and worldly cares did multiply, as men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: the divine art of <hi>Poetry,</hi> which admits not many competent Judges in any age, was counted no better then a matter of meer delight, or recreation; and for this reaſon the Prodigious Repreſentations of it, ſo Monſtrouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable to the truth repreſented (becauſe oft times more pleaſant to men wearied with other ſtudies or imployments, then the bare narration of the truth) were never reformed. And ſo at length, that <hi>Audacious Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Fictions,</hi> for moving delight, did in the judgement of poſterity diſparage the very patterns or Prototypes of Poetical repreſentations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto later Poems had been framed: As many Tall Fellows in this preſent age, if they ſhould ſee the true image or picture of ſome Ancient Giants, would ſwear that the painter had plaied the Poet: were it not that the dead bodies or limbs of ſome Ancient people, lately digged out of the ground, did by their unuſual bigneſſe teach us to eſtimate (as we ſay) <hi>Ex pede Herculem,</hi> how great others might have been, whoſe big limbs and bones have not come unto this Ages ſight.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 But moſt of theſe ſtrange Events were ſuch, as did continue no longer then while they were a doing, wherefore we muſt ſeek out the true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Heavenly Bodies, by their ſhadows, repreſented in the later Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Poets.

That man-kinde had a new propagation about the time aſſigned by <hi>Moſes</hi> of the Univerſal Floud, and that the Nations were propagated from thoſe Regions, which <hi>Moſes</hi> tels us were allotted to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and inhabited by his Nephews, is apparant, from the ſuddain encreaſe of Arts and Sciences: Which were in a good meaſure perfect in thoſe Countries, in times as Ancient as any profane Hiſtorie can point unto; yet ſeated onely in a narrow room, whence they were derived, as from a Centre, to more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the World. The ripeneſſe of Literature, Civil Diſcipline, and Inventions, amongſt the <hi>Aſſyrians, Caldeans,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> before the like did ſo much as bud forth in <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> or other Countries, far diſtant from the former doth argue, that theſe were the ſtock, and others but ſlips or Branches tranſplanted thence. Again, the State and Pomp of theſe Eaſtern Countries, before <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or any other Weſtern People, did grow into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a Kingdom or civil Nation, demonſtrates unto us, That the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of thoſe places were the Heirs of the World, who had the Court, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Metropolis amongſt them, and other Nations but as Colonies of men of meaner ſort, not ſo near allied unto the Firſt-born; or (as it were) of a younger houſe, and far ruder Education. And it is moſt likely, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident, that the ſons of <hi>Japhet</hi> did firſt inhabit <hi>Scythia,</hi> or the Northern parts of <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> and other parts near adjoyning, before they came into <hi>Greece,</hi> or other Countries of <hi>Europe.</hi> And theſe were the ſons of <hi>Noahs</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſteritie, until the fulneſſe of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Chams</hi> iniquitie were accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as Gods promiſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was not accompliſhed in his Perſon, but in his Poſteritie, many generations after his death; ſo neither did his curſe upon <hi>Cham</hi> take place, till the ſametime. The Execution of Gods curſe upon the one, was the collation of his bleſſing upon the other: but the enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of <hi>Japhets</hi> race came long after both. Thus the Egyptians were the firſt great Princes; the <hi>Aſſyrians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> the next; the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> after them; and in later times the race of <hi>Iſmael</hi> hath been the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie People: for of him the <hi>Saracens</hi> lineally deſcend, and the <hi>Turks,</hi> by Adoption Heires of the ſame promiſe.

For the Artificial Form is not the End of the Artiſts work, but rather incites the Spectator to view and admire his Skill, from which his gain or fame may redound.

Which opinion hath no pretence of Scripture to enforce it: and grounds in nature it can have none, unleſſe they will avouch this evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, That every diſpoſition of the Air, or every Cloud, is fitly diſpoſed to bring forth the Rain-bow. And if other Natural Cauſes, with their motions and diſpoſitions, depend upon the Final; ſuch as acknowledge the truth of Scripture have no reaſon to think, that either the Clouds or Air had that peculiar diſpoſition which is required unto the production of the Rain-bow, before the Floud, when this wonderful Effect could have no ſuch uſe or end, as it hath had ever ſince. For it was ordained, as the Scripture tels us, to be <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 12, 13. 14.</note> a Sign or witneſſe of Gods Covenant with the New World, a Meſſenger to ſecure mankind from deſtruction by Deluges.

Put in <hi>Jewry</hi> the true Doctrine of the Divine Power, or Providence was wel known For God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had both given them his written Oracles as an abſolute F<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemerides of all things that had been ſince the firſt moment of Time, by whoſe Rules they were to diſcern all other ſucceeding Predictions; and alſo continually raiſed them up Prophets, like yearlie Aſtronomers, to continue the Ephemerides, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had made for the direction of mans Life, and to inſtruct them as it were in a Monthly Kalendar of every particular Alteration or Change, unto which that great Law-giver in his General Predictions could not deſcend. From this reaſon it is, that the Pen-men of the Sacred Story do not always relate the ſame, or like Events, but aſſign divers manners of his working and ſpeaking to ſeveral Ages. Some afford us lively Monuments of his <hi>Power;</hi> others Patterns of his <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> ſome Examples of his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> others, of his <hi>Mercy:</hi> yet all of them continually acknowledge him to be the <hi>Onely Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their Good,</hi> albeit the manner of procuring it be divers, yea contrary. Thus <hi>Fzra, Nehemiah,</hi> and other Godly men of that time, aſcribe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from Babyloniſh Captivitie, as immediately to the Wonderful Working of their God, as their Fore-elders did their Deliverance from Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Thraldom: although no ſuch Miracle of his Power were ſeen in the later. The former Deliverance had confirmed his Omnipotent Abilitie of doing what He would, the later, his infinite Wiſdom in doing what He could, by what means He would: and it was his good Pleaſure to be Glorified in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie Ages, by divers Manifeſtations of his ſeveral Attributes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 But the Heathen wanting His Word for their direction, after they had once begun, knew not how to make an End. If God ceaſe to ſhew his Miracles in any one kind, which they had heard of before, either they ſought to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them by feigning the like, (more ready to play upon former reports, then to obſerve the courſe of Gods proceedings in their own times:) or elſe from the varietie of wonderful Events, whoſe Cauſe they knew not, they imagin a pluralitie of Gods. Others, from theſe mens Superſtition, and Curioſitie, were prone to ſuſpect the Truth of what had been; after once ſuch ſenſible Events, or Experiments begun to ceaſe. This gave the firſt occaſion unto Atheiſm; which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet might this their diſeaſe be ſooner cured, if they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare other Countries vanitie in faining wonders without Occaſion, with this Religious Sobrietie of the later Writers of the Bible, or other godly men, who have written of Jews Affairs; not one of them ſince <hi>Ezekiahs</hi> time relating ſuch wonders, as their Fathers had told them. This <hi>Sobriety</hi> in them evidently ſhews,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57235:53"/>
that the Former Miracles were no Fictions of Humane Fancie: otherwiſe the Jews, living between <hi>Ezekiahs</hi> and Chriſts time, would have been copious in their Inventions of the like, as we ſee by experience, that the <hi>learned fews</hi> ſince our Saviours time have been moſt ridiculouſly apiſh in coining, and the <hi>Illiterate</hi> as groſſe in believing moſt abſurd and <hi>Filthy Fables.</hi> That this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, during the whole time of the <hi>Second Temple,</hi> added no books to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Bible, confirms their Forefathers care, of admitting none in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, but upon evident and ſure Experiments of their divine Authority. Again, it was moſt miraculous, that this people which had Prophets, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writers in every Age, before the Babyloniſh Captivity, ſhould after their redemption thence lie ſo quiet, that not the moſt Learned among them did ever challenge the name of Prophet; though they had men of divine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and excellent obſervation in Heavenly matters, as appears by the Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> the Book of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and other Books of good uſe amongſt all Religious men, though not Canonical amongſt the Jews themſelves. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to this ſobriety of the learned was the diſpoſition of the unlearned among this people; which during the former Period of time, wherein they wanted Prophets, were generally moſt averſe from all Idolatrie, whereunto they were moſt prone, while Prophecies were moſt plentiful amongſt them; and yet continued ſtill as far from Atheiſme, as Idolatrie. The reaſon of all which, I have given before. <hi>God had injoyned a General Silence throughout this Land, that all might hearken more attentively unto the Criers voice, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prepare the wayes of the Lord:</hi> after whoſe meſſage once fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as it had been after the ringing of a Market-Bell, every Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank throughout their coaſts, ſets to ſale the dreams and fancies of his own brain, for Divine Prophecies.</p>

And his <hi>Concluſions</hi> (to omit <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Authority or other Inducements) can not ſeem Improbable, from ſuch <hi>Premiſſes,</hi> as the Roman writers have confirmed; though little intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch <hi>Inferences,</hi> as we now make from them. Do thoſe calamities of the Jews, related by <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> ſeem ſtrange? They juſtly may, if we conſider This People <hi>as Natural or Ordinary men,</hi> not as <hi>Patterns of</hi> GODS <hi>Extraordinary Judgements.</hi> Strange might their Judgements ſeem, and incredible to the Romans or Worldly-wiſe, unleſſe other circumſtances of that Time, witneſſed by the Romans themſelves, were as rare. But if, <hi>By the Romans Opinion, every Unuſual Effect in Nature did Portend ſome ſuch ſtrange Event in Human Affairs:</hi> why ſhould not the Wiſeſt of them in that Age, expect ſome Extraordinarie or Miraculous Matters of <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> time? yet, (excepting what he did to thoſe ſtubborn Jews) his other Acts were but Ordinarie, and required no Pompous or Magnificent <hi>Prologues:</hi> whereas many <hi>Signs,</hi> either foreſhewing his <hi>Exaltation to the Empire,</hi> or confirming his <hi>Right</hi> unto it, or <hi>Authority</hi> in Managing it, were ſuch as no Heathen, I think, hath ever heard of before, but moſt Conſonant unto Gods wonted Signs in <hi>Iſrael</hi> whileſt their Kings did proſper. Seeing the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and Underſtanding of the Prudent amongſt this People, had been long hid, as the Lord had threatned by his Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> Chapt. 29. and they themſelves had complained, <hi>We ſee not our tokens, we have not one Prophet more:</hi> Whence was it that <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jew ſhould become a prophet for <hi>Veſpaſians good,</hi> who had already brought much, likely to bring more Harm upon his Country and Him, now Captived, and Impriſoned by Him?

For the better underſtanding of which we muſt call to mind, what was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before; That <hi>Hieruſalem was the Lords own Seat, and the Jews a People ſet apart by Him, and diſtinguiſhed of purpoſe from others, to Exemplifie his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice in their Proſperity and Diſtreſſe.</hi> Conſequent hereunto his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was, that in the deſolation of <hi>Jewry,</hi> and deſtruction of the Temple, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations ſhould be put in mind of their mortality, and not think in their hearts that theſe were Greater Sinners then any other Nation; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he who plagued them was Lord of the whole Earth, as well as <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> that the like and more Fearful Judgements did hang over their heads, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would learn by the known Calamities of this People, to avoid them.

                              <note place="margin">Jer. 25. 29.</note> 
                              <hi>plague the City where my name is called upon, and ſhould you go free? ye ſhall not go quit: for I will call for a ſword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. Therefore Prophecy thou againſt them, all theſe words, and ſay unto them; The Lord ſhall roar from above, and thruſt out his voice from His Holy Habitation: he ſhall roar upon his habitation, and crie aloud, as they that preſſe the grapes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the inhabitants of the earth. The ſound ſhall come to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controverſie with the Nations, and will enter into judgement with All Fleſh, and he will give them, that are wicked, to the ſword. And thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts; Behold a plague ſhall go forth from Nation to Nation, and a great whirl-wind ſhall be raiſed from the coaſts of the earth, and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be at that day, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they ſhall not be mourned, neither gathered nor buried, but ſhall be as the dung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground. Howl ye ſheep-herds and cry, and wallow your ſelves in aſhes, ye principal of the flock: for your dayes of ſlaughter are accompliſhed, and of your diſperſion, and ye ſhall fall like Precious Veſſels. And the flight ſhall fail from the ſheep-herds, and the eſcaping from the Principal of the flock.</hi> Thus when the City and Temple was firſt deſtroyed by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> all the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57235:70"/>
Nations round about them were enforced to taſte of the ſame Cup. <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> her ſelf that begun the Carouſe, which ſhe meant not to Pledge; hoping to make her ſelf Sport to ſee others drunk with the Bloud of their ſlain, was compelled at length to drink ſo deep of the dregs, till (as the Prophet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) all her ſtrong-men did fall, and her Princes ſlept their <hi>Everlaſting Sleep.</hi> This Prophecy notwithſtanding concerns the Second Deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as literally as the former: and ſundry plagues here mentioned, for ought that can be gathered from any Hiſtory Sacred or Profane, were not in any degree verified of the Nations, in the dayes of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or his Son. But ſcarce any Nation was free from ſuch calamities as are here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the time of <hi>Titus</hi> and his Succeſſors; as ſhall be declared anon. <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, which had rejoyced at <hi>Judahs</hi> miſery, and triumphed in <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> wo, troden <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> under her feet, and given her duſt and aſhes for a covering to her Nakedneſſe, was ſhortly after <hi>Pinched at the Heart</hi> with like Sorrows; how ſoever her outward <hi>Robes of Majeſty</hi> did cover her ſecret Wounds from their eyes that lived after, or beheld her eſtate onely a-far off, not acquainted with her inward Gripes or ſmothered Out-cries. <hi>All is not Sound within, that is Fair without, nor they furtheſt from Danger who feel leaſt pain for the Preſent:</hi> ſuch as ſince have lived ſecureſt, neither regardful of <hi>Hieruſalems</hi> miſery, nor the calamities of other Nations that enſued them, altogether unacquainted with any like ſorrows of their own times, ſhall have their deepeſt ſhare in the Horrors of that <hi>Dreadful Day,</hi> whereof theſe were but <hi>Shadows</hi> and Maps, to repreſent unto us in ſome proportion the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable Affrightments</hi> that ſhall then appear. But as no man knows of that Day and Hour, ſo neither did the Prophets themſelves diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the manner of it: They did ſee it onely in theſe Adumbrations, which in proceſſe of time grew ſtill more lively. The ſecond deſtruction of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the Signs following it, exceeds the former in the diſtinct prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of the later day, as much as a Map of a particular Country taken at large, doth the repreſentation of the ſame in a general Map of the whole Earth, of like quantity. And <hi>as Maps have a diſtinct quantity of their own, eaſie to be known by ſenſe,</hi> but which no man meaſures ſo much for it ſelf, as for to know the Capacity of the Country which it repreſents: <hi>ſo have moſt Prophecie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the old Teſtament a diſtinct, Peculiar, Natural, or Literal ſenſe Verified in the time of the Law, which is not ſo much to be reſpected as the Myſteries of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or matters of the world to come prefigured by theſe Events paſt:</hi> the moſt ſecret of which Myſteries, after ſome one or few Circumſtances be revealed, may be diſtinctly known. For the proportion of one Circumſtance or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with another, is all one in the later, and in the former; ſo that by the diſtinct knowledge of the former, we may diſcern the later, after it be Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd in any one part: as by the meaſure of a Map, we find out the quantity of the ground repreſented. For this reaſon hath our Saviour Chriſt pictured us out The Laſt Day by the calamities of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> onely. For, (under correction) I ſhould think, that no one part of his Prophecy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. from the 15. to the 36.

And immediately after the tribulations of thoſe dayes, ſhall the Sun be darkned, and the Moon ſhall not give her light, and the Stars ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken. And then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of man in heaven; and then ſhall all the kindreds of the earth mourn; and they ſhall ſee the Son of man come in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory: and he ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Windes, and from the one end of heaven to the other. Now learn A Parable of the Fig-tree; when her bough is yet tender, and it bringeth forth leaves, ye know that Summer is near: ſo likewiſe when ye ſee all theſe things, know that the Kingdom of God is near, even at the doors. Verily I ſay unto you, This Generation ſhall not paſſe, till all theſe things be done.</hi> Some refer theſe words <hi>[immediately after]</hi> to the troubles of the Church; as if their meaning were this: <hi>And immediately after God hath made an end of the troubles of his Church, theſe Signs ſhall follow.</hi> But who knows when that ſhall be? whereas our Saviours words muſt be referred to thoſe dayes whereof he had ſpoken, which were compriſed within determinate and ſet Bounds, and would ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt themſelves; ſo as all men might be certain when to expect thoſe Signs, which he promiſed to all the world for the confirmation of His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and their Faith. The full and natural meaning of the place is, as if he had ſaid,: <hi>When you have ſeen</hi> Hieruſalems <hi>Fatal Day, then look for ſuch Signs in the Sun and Moon as I have told, for the one doth Prognoſticate the others Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, as certainly, as the Budding of the Fig-tree doth Summer.</hi> The like connexion of theſe fearful Signs with <hi>Hieruſalems</hi> deſolation we have in Saint <hi>Luke, chapt.</hi> 21. 25, Having ſpoken before onely of the tribulation of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he continueth his ſpeech: <hi>Then there ſhall be ſigns in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the earth, trouble amongst the Nations with perplexity, the Sea and the Waters ſhall roar, and mens hearts ſhall fail them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which ſhall come on the world. For the Powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken; and then ſhall they ſee the Son of man come in a cloud with power and great glory. And when theſe things begin to come to paſſe, then look up and lift up your Heads, for your Redemption draweth near.

But whilſt I conſidered again, how the Almighty, whether, in his juſt Judgement for the Sins of that preſent, or, in his Wiſdom and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for the greater good of future Generations had deprived us of all their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Meditations that lived about <hi>Titus</hi>'s time, or immediately after: both Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as I conceived, might have One &amp; the ſame juſt Cauſe, though ſecret and onely known to God, not fit for us to make any further Inquiry after, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And who knows whether the Lord had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that the ſerious conſideration of thoſe <hi>Prodigious Signs,</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the publiſhing of the Goſpel, ſhould ſleep in all or moſt intermediate Ages, till theſe later dayes wherein we live, wherein ſuch <hi>Obſervations</hi> are more <hi>Seaſonable, We being the Men on whom the later Ends of the world are come.</hi> Happily had Eccleſiaſtick Writers Commented upon thoſe times, our curious Modern Wits, too much addicted unto Gentiliſm, would have given leſs Credence to the pregnant Teſtimonies of profane Authors, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting, leſt Chriſtians, (in whoſe Cuſtody their writings for many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been) had infected either the whole Diſcourſes or ſome peculiar Circumſtances pertinent to their purpoſes, or apt to countenance their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, otherwiſe improbable in the worlds Judgement. But now, by how much the Silence of Eccleſiaſtick Authors in theſe narrations hath been greater, and the Teſtimonies of Heathen Writers more plentiful or pregnant, ſo much the more unexcuſable is the curious and unregenerate <hi>Artiſt,</hi> or incredulous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt.</hi> That moſt generations, ſince thoſe times whereof we treat, ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Signs in the Sun, &amp; Moon, to come before the Day of Judgement, cannot ſeem either ſtrange in itſelf, or prejudicial to this Doctrine which we deliver, if we call to mind how men otherwiſe truly Religious have been uſually ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or miſtaken in the meaning of divine Myſteries, until the time apoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Revelation, or until they unfold their <hi>Enigmatical Conſtruction</hi> by the approach or Real <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of the Events foretold. Thus, many well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to our Saviour and his doctrine did expect <hi>Elias</hi> ſhould come before the Kingdom were reſtored to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even whilſt they had <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> (of whom that Prophecy was properly meant) amongſt them; Yea, after he had Sealed his Embaſſage with his Bloud. Even in the Apoſtles time, That our Saviour ſhould inſtantly come to give Final Judgement, was an Opinion (as it ſeems from S. <hi>Paul</hi> his Admonition to the <hi>Theſſalonians)</hi> generally received <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 1.</note> amongſt Chriſtians: firſt occaſioned as is moſt probable, from miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Saviours Propheſie, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, This Generation ſhall not paſſtil all theſe things be done,</hi> and this Miſconſtruction cauſed from a Common Errour or Ignorance in not diſtinguiſhing betwixt the <hi>Typical</hi> and the <hi>Myſtical</hi> or Subſtantial Senſe of Propheſies; oft-times, both alike literally and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imported in the ſelf-ſame words.</p>

The King himſelf (unleſſe <hi>Oroſius</hi> be partial for him) was careful to perform his promiſe, to ſecure them of peace during their abode, and of ſafe paſſage at the time appointed. But the Marriners having once gotten them aboard, did make their ſhips as ſo many priſons, or houſes of torture, to wreſt wealth out of their hands, lengthning the time by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and unneceſſarie turnings, back and forth, until the <hi>Jews</hi> had quite ſpent all their proviſion, afterwards enforced to buy their food, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the Marriners, at what rate they pleaſed. And, not content with ſpoil of their goods, they abuſe the bodies of their wives and daughters to their luſt, not pleaſant enough, unleſſe ſauced with other contumelies, and indignities practized upon their Fathers and Huſbands. Finally by <hi>theſe marriners, too much thinking that their paſſengers were Jews, and might be uſed accordingly, they forget that they themſelves were Chriſtians, and ſtain that ſacred profeſſion with all manner of baſe villany and impietie.</hi> Partly through this delay in ſhipping over the firſt company, partly, through the abuſes done unto them, ſo ſhameful, that the fame thereof was brought unto their fellows ears by the wind, which ſerved the Marriners back to <hi>Portugal:</hi> the later ſort remaining in expectation of ſafe paſſage, either could not, or would not be tranſported at the day appointed, and ſo by their ſtaying become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives to <hi>John</hi> then King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> But <hi>Emanuel</hi> his ſucceſſour, not long after ſets them free, uſing all other fair means to bring them unto Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> his confederates, ſolicit theſe ill-thriving plants eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <note place="margin">The Jews <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The greatneſſe of their number, beſt appearing by their confluence about the day appointed for their paſſage, moved the good King with compaſſion, to ſee ſo many thouſand ſouls ſhould deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run the wayes of death; and ſeeing no hope of diſeaſoning the old and withered ſtocks, fit fewel for everlaſting flames, he was the more deſirous to recover ſome of their young and tender grafts, by watering them with the water of grace: and for this purpoſe gives ſtrict commandment, that all their children under fourteen years of age ſhould be taken from their Jewiſh parents, and trained up in the School of Chriſt. This ſodain and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divorce, though intended in compaſſion of the children, brought greater miſerie on the Parents, then if their own fleſh had been torn from their bones.

But theſe were bereft at once of all their loving children, in the open Sun. Many of them, not able either to reſcue or diſpatch their own bowels, become mad with the ſight that their eyes had ſeen, and killed themſelves: Others, having better opportunitie, account it a part of their happineſſe, to be able to prevent their childrens waſhing in the ſacred Font, by drowning them in draw-wels and ditches. In both theſe calamities, at the two fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranſportations, we may ſee thoſe Prophecies of <hi>Moſes</hi> exactly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Deut. 28. 30.

6 Generally, the outward carriage, and inward temper of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Jews are ſuch, as all that have any Experience of them, may perceive the Excellent qualities of their worthy Progenitours, and the extraordinary Prerogatives whence they are fallen, as ſenſibly and undoubtedly, as we can know by the Lees, or corrupt remainder of any Liquor, what the vertue and ſtrength thereof was in its Prime.

                           <p n="10">10 Like <hi>Experiments</hi> might be drawn from the <hi>Revolutions</hi> or <hi>Alterations of other ſtates,</hi> oft times wrought by ſuch cauſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as are without the reach of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but moſt conſonant to the Rules of Scriptures; or from the Verification of ſuch rules, in Gods <hi>Judgements</hi> upon private perſons. But theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations cannot be made ſo evident to ordinary Readers, before the doctrine of Gods providence be unfolded. Wherefore I muſt refer them partly to that place, partly to others of my Labours, which have been moſt plentiful in this Argument. Only that mutation in our deliverance from the <hi>Servitude of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church,</hi> may not be omitted. For, if we compare it with the Iſraelites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture <note place="margin">A Parallel of the Iſraelites deliverance from Egyptian, and Ours from <hi>Rome</hi> Babrlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ihraldom.</note> out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> the manner of Gods Providence exemplified at large by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the former, is as a perfect rule to diſcern the ſame power in the later; and the freſh <hi>Experiment</hi> of the later confirms unto our conſciences the truth of the Hiſtory concerning the former. God from the ſpoils of the Egyptians furniſhed the Iſraelites with all things neceſſary for their journey; the ſame God had revived the ſtudy of Tongues, and revealed the Art of Printing, a little before our fore-fathers departed out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they ſhould not come away empty, but wel furniſhed to wage war with their Enemies, whom they had robbed of their chief Jewels, leaving ſmall ſtore of polite literature, or ſkill in Scriptures amongſt them; though they have increaſed their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that way ſince. If we diligently view the diſpoſition of Gods Providence before thoſe times, we cannot but acknowledge, that it was the ſame power that firſt cauſed light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, which then renewed the face of the earth again, and brought the light of ingenious and ſacred <hi>Literature</hi> forth of the <hi>Chaos of Barbarity,</hi> obſcurity, and fruitleſs curioſity, wherein it had been long incloſed. It is (me thinks) a pleaſant Contemplation to obſerve how the Worthies of the Age precedent did beſtir themſelves in gathering and dreſſing Armour, not uſed for many hundred years before, no man knowing for what purpoſe, until the great Commander of heaven and earth gives our his Commiſſion to the Captaines of his Hoſt, for invading his enemy, the Man of Sin.

For he that knoweth God, or his Providence aright; knows this withall, that he will not ſuffer us to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted above our ſtrength. And once having had Experience of his Mercies paſt, we cannot, without Injurie to his Divine Majeſtie, but in Confidence of it, Believe and Hope, that his All-ſeeing Wiſdom and Almightie Power will ſtill (maugre the ſpight of Death, Hell, Satan, and their Agents) preſerve his Sacred Word ſincere without admixture of any profane, falſe, or humane Inventions that might overthrow, or pervert our Faith begun. Hereto we may refer all former Documents of His Care and Providence in preſerving the Canon of our Faith from the <hi>Tyrannie</hi> of ſuch, as ſought utterly to deface it; and the <hi>Treachery</hi> of others, who ſought to corrupt it. And it ought to be no little motive unto us, thus to think: when we ſee <hi>Auſtin, Gregory,</hi> and other of the Ancient writers, either maimed, or mangled, or purged of their beſt Bloud, where they make againſt the Romiſh Church; or elſe her untruths fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered upon Them, by her ſhameleſſe ſons, in places where they are ſilent for her: and yet this Sacred Volume untouched and uncorrupt, by any violence offered to it by that Church; only it hath loſt its natural Beautie and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, by long durance in that homely and vulgar Priſon; whereunto they have confined it.</p>

                        <p n="3">3 Tell me then, you that ſeek to bring the unlearned Lay-ſort of men to ſeek ſhelter under the Infallible Authoritie of the Romiſh Church: how can you aſſure them what is the very true Meaning of that Church? They underſtand not the Language wherein her Deciſions were written. What then? muſt they infallibly, and under pain of Damnation, Believe that you do not Erre in your Tranſlations of them? or muſt they ſtedfaſtly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that you Interpret Her Decrees aright? Nay even thoſe Decrees, which you hold Infallible, condemn all private Interpretation of them: and your greateſt Clerks daily diſſent about the Meaning of the Trent-Councel in ſundry Points. Yet, unleſs the Lay people can ſtedfaſtly Believe, that you Interpret the Churches Sentence aright: your ſuppoſed Rule of the Churches Infallibilitie in confirming Tranſlations or Senſes of Scripture, can neither be a Rule Infallible, nor any way Profitable unto them. For it hath no other Effect upon their ſouls, ſave only <hi>Belief:</hi>

For, if they ſhould be thus Infallibly perſwaded of your Skil or Fidelitie: then were their good Perſwaſion of you, the Ground and Rule of their Faith; and ſo they muſt Believe that you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor could Erre in this Relation; Whereas your own Doctrine is, That even the Learnedſt among you may Erre: and you cannot denie, but that it is poſſible for the Honeſteſt Juſuite, either to Lie, or Equivocate. Otherwiſe, your Infallibilitie in not Erring, were greater then your Popes or Churches: for they both may Erre unleſſe they ſpeak <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> Now, whether the Pope ſpeak this or that <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> or whether he ſpeak or write to all or no is not known to any of the common People in theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries, but only by your Report: which if it be not Infallible, and as free from Errour as the Pope himſelf, the People muſt ſtill ſtagger in Faith. Nor do I ſee any poſſible Remedie: unleſſe every man ſhould take a Pilgrimage to Rome, or unleſſe you would bring the Pope throughout theſe Countries, as men uſe Monſters or ſtrange Sights. Yet, how ſhould they be certain that this is the Pope, rather then ſome Counterfeit? or how ſhould they know <hi>Rome,</hi> but by others? Or can you hope to ſalve this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience by an Implicit or Hypothetical Faith? as, that it were enough for the Lay people to Believe abſolutely and ſtedfaſtly, that the Pope, or

Church cannot Erre: but to believe your Report or Informations of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in doubtful Caſes, only Conditionally; if it be the Popes Mind: if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we will be free to recall our preſent <hi>Belief.</hi> This is all which I can imagin any of you can ſay for your ſelves. And may not we, I pray you, ſay as much, if thus much would ſerve for us? Might not we by the ſelf ſame Reaſon teach the People to admit of Tranſlations, but only Conditionally, as far forth as they ſhall be perſwaded that this was the Meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or the Word of God? For Queſtionleſſe, it is more certain that God cannot Erre, then that the Pope cannot. And it is more neceſſary un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That the Pope and his Cardinals do arrogate thus much unto themſelves, is more then the Lay and unlearned People can tell, but only by yours and others Relation: But that the God of Heaven neither can, nor will Teach amiſſe, is a Principle not controverſed by any that thinks there is a God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Let it then firſt be granted, That God is freer from Errour, from Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or being Deceived in Points of Faith, or matters of Mans Salvation, then the Pope is, although he ſpeak <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> From this Poſition it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes moſt directly and moſt immediately, that if the Lay unlearned People of this Land have as good Means and better, to know that theſe Books of Scrpture are Gods own Words, then they can have to know that this or that Canon in any Councel was confirmed by the Popes teaching <hi>ex Cathedra:</hi> then muſt the ſame People Believe the One more ſtedfaſtly then the Other; to wit, Gods Word, as it is read unto them in our Church, more ſtedfaſtly then the Popes Interpretations, Injunctions, or Decrees. Let us compare the Means of knowing Both. Firſt, if the Popes Decrees be a certain Means of knowing any Truth: they are as certain a Means of knowing thoſe Scriptures which our Church admits, to be Gods Word, as of any thing elſe; for the Pope and his Councel <note n="†" place="margin">Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Seſſione quarta.</note> have avoucht Them for Such, although they adde ſome more then we acknowledge.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 If the worſt then ſhould fall out that can be imagined; as if we had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deſpair of all other Tranſlations ſave onely of the Vulgar, yet that it were the Word of God we might know, if by no other Means, yet by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Romiſh Church; and all the People of this Land might be as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this Decree, as of any the Pope can give. But take the ſame Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as it is Tranſlated into our Engliſh, the People may be as certain that it is the Word of God, as they can be that the Trent Councel was Lawfully called, or by the Pope confirmed, yea much more certain. The Jeſuites may tell them, that theſe very words (being firſt engliſhed) were ſpoken in the Trent-Councel, and confirmed by the Pope. Why ſhould they believe it? Becauſe they avouch it ſeriouſly, whom they think able to underſtand Latin? Suppoſe not only one, or two, or three, but the whole Aſſembly of our Clergie tels the ſame People, that theſe (reciting the Points of our Salvation are the very Words of God Himſelf; and are for Subſtance all one in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, Latin, and Engliſh. What Difference can you here imagine? That the Trent-Councel decreed thus, the modern Jeſuites have it but from Tradition of this Age: That God ſpake thus, we have the Conſent of all Ages. Yea, but it is eaſier to render the Trent-Councels Meaning out of Latin, then the Meaning of Gods Word out of Hebrew or Greek. Whether it be ſo or no, the unlearned People cannot tell, but by hearſay: yet, if we would take the Vulgar Latin, this fooliſh Objection were none: for It is as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57235:105"/>
eaſie to be Rendred, as the Trent-Councel; and if the Trent-Councel be true, It is the Word of God. All then is equal concerning the Difficulties, that may ariſe from the Skill, or Ignorance of the Tranſlators of the one or other; the Popes Decrees, or Scripture. Our Miniſters know to Render the Meaning of Scripture as well as yours do the Meaning of the Councels. Let us now ſee whether it be as likely, that our Miniſters Fidelitie in telling them as they are perſwaded, and as they Believe themſelves, be not to be preſumed as Great. To call this in Queſtion were extream Impudencie and Uncivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, eſpecially ſeeing we Teach, that the people ſhould be throughly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Truth: whereas you hold it for good Chriſtian Policie, to hold them in Ignorance. Our permitting the free Uſe of Scriptures to all doth free us from all ſuſpition of Impoſture of Guile: of which in the Jeſuite or learned Papiſt the denail of like Libertie, is a foul Preſumption. Further, let us examin, whether from the Matter or Manner of the Popes Decrees, there can be any Argument drawn to perſwade the People that theſe are his Decrees and no other Mans: more then can be gathered from the Matter and Manner of Scripture Phraſe, to perſwade a man that theſe are Gods, and can be no Mans Words: And Here certainly we have infinite Advantage of <note place="margin">Granting the Pope to be as infallible as God himſelf: yet were not his Decrees rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to be ſo much believed, as Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us &amp; them, becauſe it is more free from ſuſpition of Forgerie, then they can be; harder to be Counterfeited, then they are.</note> you. For no man of Senſe or Reaſon, but muſt needs ſuffer himſelf to be perſwaded, that it is a far eaſier matter to Counterfeit the Decrees of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran or Trent-Councel, or the Popes Writs, Interpretations, or Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: then Artificially to imitate the Invincible and Majeſtical Word of God, either for the Matter or the Manner.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 The Sequel is this, that if the Scriptures received by us, be obnoxious to any the leaſt Suſpition of being Forged: then from the ſame Reaſons, much more liable to the ſame Suſpition are thoſe which we account the Popes Decrees, and therefore in reſpect of us, much leſſe to be Believed; although otherwiſe we ſhould grant the Pope Decrees (which without controverſie were his Decrees indeed) to be as Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible as the Eternal and Immutable Decrees of the Almightie. Gods Word oft-times unto Atheiſts hath diſcovered it ſelf by the Majeſtie of Stile and Sublimitie of Matter, to be more then Human, and therefore Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, not able to imitated by any lying Spirit. If any Jeſuite will deny this: let him make trial of Imitation in the Prophecie of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, the Relation of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethrens Dialogues, the Book of <hi>Job, &amp;c.</hi> The Majeſtie of Speech and other Excellencies which appears in them (eſpecially if we conſider the Time, wherein moſt of them were written) doth argue a Divine Spirit: in whoſe Imitation the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Writers of later Ages, (albeit no man writes excellently but from ſome Beam of Divine Illumination in the Facultie) are but Apiſh, if we read the ſame Scriptures in the Tongue wherein they were written, or in ſundry modern Tongues capable of the Divine Splendor which ſhines in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; with which the Latin (eſpecially in Proſe) hath greateſt Diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Learned or copious Tongues. As for the Popes Decrees they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray themſelves both for the Matter and Manner, to be only Human, and therefore eaſie to be imitated by the Spirit of Man, ſubject to many Errours. Nor doth the Pope challenge to himſelf the gift of Prophecie, but only of legal Deciſions: which are no otherwiſe written, then many write, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no deeper nor more Supernatural Matter, then many may invent: moſt of them uſually penned in a baſe and barbarous Logick Phraſe: his Stile at the beſt is not peculiar, his Character eaſie to be counterfeited by any man that can pen a Proclamation, or frame an Inſtrument in Civil Courts.</p>

7 To recollect what hath been ſaid. Firſt, ſeeing God is more to be Believed then Men; ſecondly, ſeeing we have better Arguments to perſwade the People that theſe Scriptures daily read in our Church, are Gods own Words, then the Prieſts and Jeſuites have, that the Tidings which they bring from beyond Sea are the Popes or Churches Decrees or Sentence: we may and ought Teach them to relie immediately upon Gods Word preached or read unto them, as the ſureſt and moſt Infallible Rule of Faith, the moſt lively, moſt effectual, and moſt forcible Means of their Salvation. Or if the Jeſuites will teach them to Believe the Popes Decrees given <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> or the Churches Opinion indefinitely taken <hi>Fide divina,</hi> by Infallible Faith; but the Jeſuites or Prieſts Expoſitions or Tranſlations of them, only Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and with this Limitation, <hi>[If ſo they be the Pope or Churches Decrees:]</hi> we may in like ſort with far greater Reaſon, teach the People to Believe the Scriptures or the Word of God abſolutely, and our Tranſlations or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of it but Conditionally or with Limitation, ſo far as they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Word of God. Seeing it is as probable, that we may expound Gods Word as rightly and ſincerely, as the other can the Church or Popes Edicts; we have better Reaſon to exact this conditional Obedience and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in the Vertue and Authoritie of Gods Word, which we make the Rule of Faith; then they can have to exact the like Obedience by Vertue of the Pope or Churches Edict, which is to them the Miſtreſſe of Faith. For it is more certain to any man living, that Gods Word is moſt Infallibly True, then that the Pope cannot Erre. Wherefore if the Abſolute <hi>Belief</hi> of the Popes Infallibilitie, and Conditional <hi>Belief</hi> of the Jeſuites or Prieſts his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers Fidelitie or Skill, be ſufficient to Salvation: much more may the Abſolute <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Aſſent</hi> unto the Infallibility of Gods Word, and ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional and limited <hi>Belief</hi> of his Miniſters Fidelitie, be ſufficient for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his People: who, as hath been proved, cannot be more certain that the Romiſh Church ſaith This or That, then we can be of Gods Word. For they never hear the Church or Pope ſpeak, but in Jeſuites or Prieſts Mouthes. And although they knew he ſaid juſt ſo as thoſe ſay: yet may a man doubt in Modeſtie, whether the Popes Words be alwayes Infallible; but of the Infallibilitie of Gods Word, can no man doubt.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 And Here I cannot but much wonder at the prepoſterous courſes of theſe Romaniſts, who holding an Implicite Faith of Believing as the Church Believes, (in many Points) to be ſufficient unto Salvation: will yet faſten this implicite Faith upon the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not refer it rather unto that Church as it was under S. <hi>Peters</hi> Juriſdiction and Government. For if Univerſalitie be (as they contend) a ſure Note of undoubted Truth: then muſt it needs be more undoubtedly True, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> could not Erre in Matters of Faith, then that this preſent Romiſh Pope and his Cardinals can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo Erre. For all Papiſts hold this as True of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as of this preſent Pope: and all Proteſtants hold it True of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> not in the preſent Pope: and ſo did all the Fathers without controverſie hold it moſt True, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> did not teach amiſſe in his Apoſtolical Writings. So that Univerſalitie is much greater for S. <hi>Peter,</hi> then for this Pope that now is, or the next that ſhall be.</p>

he had been, (in which reſpect they brought the <hi>Cardinal</hi> firſt unto S. <hi>Cuthberts</hi> Tomb:) yet, becauſe he knew him not ſo well, but only by their Report, he praies very warily; <hi>Sancte Cuthberte, ſi Sanctus es, or a pro me.</hi> But, afterwards brought unto <hi>Bedes</hi> Tomb then in the <hi>Conſiſtory;</hi> becauſe he had been Famous in Forrain Nations, from the Commendations of leſſe partial Antiquitie: he fell to his prayers without <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands; Vener abilis Beda, quia tu Sanctus es, or a pro me.</hi>

                        <p n="10">10 Proprotional to this <hi>Caution</hi> in this <hi>French-mans</hi> Prayers, ſhould every modern Papiſt limit his <hi>Belief</hi> of the preſent Popes Infallibilitie in reſpect of S. <hi>Peters;</hi> And ſay thus in his heart: As for S. <hi>Peter,</hi> I know he Believed and Taught aright: And I beſeech God I may Believe as he Believed, and that my Soul may come whither his is gone: as for this preſent Pope, if he believe as S. <hi>Peter</hi> did, &amp; be likely to follow him in LIfe and Death, I pray God I may Believe as he Believes, and do as he Teacheth; but otherwiſe (believe me) I would be very loath to pin my Belief upon his Sleeve, leſt happily he run Headlong to Hell to that which ſhould have drawn me up to Heaven: For in this Life I walk by Faith, and by Faith I muſt aſcend Thither, if I ever come There; and therefore I dare not faſten my Belief upon any Man, whom I would be loath to follow in his Courſe of Life. But moſt ſurely might this Implicite Faith be faſtned upon Gods written Word, contained in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts.

They themſelves ſpeak aright, by their own Confeſſion, where they ſpeak conſonantly unto it. Wherefore the ſafeſt Courſe for us muſt be, to ſearch out the True Senſe and Meaning of it: which is as eaſie for us, as them to find, as in the Proceſſe of theſe Meditations, God willing, ſhall appear.</p>

This fals out only and alwayes then, when the Difference between the Greatneſſe or Probabilities of the evil feared in the one, and the Goodneſſe hoped in the other Action, is greater then the Quantitie or Probabilitie of the former evil, which admitted no mixt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Good. The Reaſon is plain, becauſe the Mixture of good doth only recompenſe ſo many degrees of evil as it ſelf contains of good. Now if in the Actions of <hi>equally mixt Perſwaſions,</hi> the Proportion between the evil and good be ſuch, as is between eleven and five; the overplus of the evil will be as ſix; and ſo ſhall it make that Action, wherein it is, worſe, then that which hath but five degrees or parts of evil, albeit without all Mixture of any contrarie Perſwaſion, or Conceit of good. But alwayes where the evils feared are equal, and the Probabilities of their enſuing likewiſe equal: any <hi>mixt Apprehenſion</hi> of ſome good probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the one, not to the other, doth make the Action whereto it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, leſſe evil, according to the degrees, either of the good apprehended,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57235:111"/>
or of our Probabilities that it may be accompliſht: and yet ſhall the Action ſtill be evil, as long as the evil which we Fear is greater then the good which we can Hope for; or, (theſe being equal) the Probabilities greater, that the evil ſhould fall out, then the good. For if to prefer a leſſe good before a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be evil, much more to adventure upon a great evil, in hope of a leſſer good; moſt of all to adventure upon any great or probable evil, without Probabilitie of any good to countervail it in the choice.</p>

For <hi>Abraham, upon private Inſtigation or ſecular Motives, to have killed his Son, had been hideous and monſtrous Cruelty,</hi> one of the greateſt Breaches imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Law of Nature: but <hi>being appointed by God ſo to do,</hi> to have killed his Son had been <hi>no Man-ſlaughter.</hi> Not that God in this particular did (as ſome ſpeak) Diſpenſe with the Law of Nature: for diſpenſation had made his Action or purpoſe, only not Unlawful; whereas <hi>Gods</hi>

                              <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obedience made that <hi>Action,</hi> which without it had been <hi>worſe then Murther,</hi> to be <hi>better then Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> How far the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance ſerveth to infer the Concluſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note>

                        <p n="3">3 But ſome (perhaps) will here demand, what Argument can be drawn from Obedience unto Divine Supreme Authoritie, for juſtifying Obedience unto Subordinate Powers, in Matters, which, in our private eſtimation, we deem Unlawful? Shal we equalize Man with God, or Humane Authority with Divine? No, but we ſhould know, that <hi>all Lawful Powers are from God,</hi> and he that reſiſteth them, reſiſteth the Authoritie of Divine Power. <hi>Abrahams</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for killing his Son, was more Authentick and expreſs, then we can have for any particular Action, which we privately conceive as evil: but not more Authentick &amp; expreſs, then many Divine Precepts for obedience unto lawful Governours are. As his <hi>Warrant</hi> was better, ſo had his <hi>Action</hi> without it been more deſperate, then ſuch as ſuperiour powers uſually impoſe upon inferiors. The former Inſtance then was brought, principally, to mitigate the Rigour of their Preciſeneſs, who ſtifly maintain, That no Obedience can legitimate ſuch Actions, as, without it, would be evil; but all muſt be performed only in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters preſuppoſed Good and Lawful, or at leaſt acknowledged for Indifferent unto Private Men, before injoyned by Publick Authoritie. The Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to which univerſal Negative appears moſt true, in this particular Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Reſolution and Obedience: from which we may further Argue thus. <hi>As the immediate interpoſition of Divine Authority made that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Holy and Religious, which otherwiſe had been barbarouſly Impious: ſo may the interpoſition of Authoritie, derived from God, make ſome Actions, which, barely conſidered, would be apparantly Evil, Deſperate, or Doubtful,</hi> to be Honeſt, Good, and Lawful. To beat one that is <hi>Sui Juris, at his own diſpoſition, and in his right mind,</hi> againſt; or one that is not <hi>ſuch,</hi> with his Conſent; were inſolent Wrong: Becauſe, we have no Power over the one; the other none over himſelf, to Authorize ſuch uſage of his Bodie. What would it be then, in private Men, to beat ſuch as they know for Gods Embaſſadours, though requeſted by them ſo to do; when as the very Requeſt might ſeem to argue ſome preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, or Diſtraction of Minde?

But he that took the Prophets Authoritie for his Warrant, though he ſmote, and in ſmiting wounded him, yet did he not hurt his own Conſcience a whit, but rather by thus doing, preſerved it whole, notwithſtanding the former Precept of <hi>doing Gods Prophets no harm.</hi> † To rifle a Spaniſh ſhip, upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Quarrels, were Piracie in an Engliſh Navigator, to kill a Spaniard, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but ſuppoſe the Kings Majeſtie, upon Wrong done, by that Nation to our State, not ſatisfied; ſhould grant his letters of Mart: to rob them of their Goods were no Piracie, to take away their Lives no Murther: yet were the out ward Action in both Caſes the ſame, but the circumſtances diverſe, and the partie that now undertakes it, hath better Motives then before he had.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Many Inſtances might be brought unto this purpoſe, all evidently evincing thus much in general, That <hi>ſundry Actions, which undertaken out of private Choice, would be Wicked,</hi> (becauſe we conceive in them ſome Evil, without any conceit of poſſible good to ſet againſt it) <hi>may by Injunction of publick Authority become Lawful</hi> to us; becauſe we have new Motives and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Warrants for to do them; nor can our adventure upon ſuch Actions be cenſured for Deſperate, as before it might well have been. For firſt, whileſt Men of ſkill and judgement, appointed by God to Adviſe in ſuch Matters, are otherwiſe perſwaded then we in private are: the Rule of Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie bindes us to ſuſpect our own Perſwaſion, and conſequently, to think there may be ſome Good even in that Action wherein heretofore we thought was not; wherein as yet we our ſelves ſee none, yet may ſafely perſwade our ſelves that others ſee, either more Good or leſſe Evil. And unto this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion we muſt adde this Conſideration alſo: That Performance of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf is a good and acceptable Action in the ſight of God.

At the leaſt then, <hi>ſome Actions, which privately we would avoid as altogether Evil, may upon the former Motives be as lawfully undertaken, as thoſe which we hold, as probably Good, as Evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6 But, as every Conceit of any Good is not ſufficient to countervail all Conceit of Evil, which may appear in the ſame matter: ſo neither may all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie countervail every private Perſwaſion, in any man; but the greater, or more publick, the Authoritie is, the more ſhould it prevail with all private Perſons, for the undertaking of ſuch Actions, as otherwiſe would ſeem Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. The like may be ſaid of the danger, or ſcandal, which might ariſe from the Example of our Diſobedience, or <hi>non performance</hi> of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The greater the Harm is, likely to enſue ſuch Neglect of Obedience, the more we are bound to be leſſe ſcrupulous in Obeying, for theſe are not meer Conſequents of the Action. The Reaſon why men often miſtake them for ſuch, is, becauſe they diſtinguiſh not between the real Harms themſelves, or ſcandalous Events, which follow the Action, and the ſerious
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57235:112"/>
Forecaſt of their Danger. For as the Means are precedent to the real Aſſequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the End, and yet the Intention of the End doth alwayes go before the right Choice of Means, and as it were, ſeaſons them for the Production of what we intend: ſo albeit the real Events or Harms be meer Conſequents, yet the mature and prudent forecaſt of Danger, likely to follow any Action or Reſolution, muſt be admitted into the Conſultation precedent, and ought to ſway our Conſciences, according to every degree of their Probabilities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially conceived, as wel as if we were as probably perſwaded of ſo many degrees of inherent goodneſſe in the Action it ſelf, or its eſſential Object. For the Avoidance of any Evil equally probable, is as good as the Attaining of an equal good. If the danger which we juſtly fear may follow our Neglect of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, whether in things Forbidden or Commanded, be as great as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which (upon like Probabilitie) we conceive in the very Action it ſelf; it ſhould make us as willing to do what we are Commanded, as to refuſe: albeit we ſet apart the goodneſſe, which may ariſe from the meer Act of Obedience it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 That both goodneſſe of meer Obedience, as Obedience, and alſo the danger of Evil likely to enſue our denial thereof, are either Eſſential Parts of the Object, or ſuch Internal Motives precedent, as may raiſe a new Form in the Action: may be gathered from what hath been ſaid afore, of things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.

So as, not only the Obedience is to be thought good, but the very Action wherein Obedience is ſeen, though before Indifferent, is now inherently good, and the Omiſſion of it would be <hi>in it ſelf Evil,</hi> and not by <hi>Conſequent</hi> only. For Obedience either is, or cauſeth, a new Form or Eſſential Difference, which doth as it were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate the outward Action, to an higher Nature and Quality then it was capable of before. For the ſame Reaſon may this goodneſſe of Obedience, and the due Conſideration of Harms, which may follow its Refuſal, make ſuch Actions, as before had been Evil for us out of private Reſolutions to have undertaken, not to be any more Evil, but Good. The Difficultie only is, what private Doubts or Diſlikes may be countervailed by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: or what certain Rule may be given when they may, and when they may not.</p>

For ſeeing the Caſe ſtands in Controverſie betwixt Us and our Superiours: we ſhould do as we are Commanded by them, and refer the final Deciſion to the Supream Judge, whether they do well or ill in making ſuch Lawes, as to us may ſeem to be Occaſions of Evil, but whether they ſhall prove ſo or no, he beſt Knows, that onely can prevent the Danger.

Such Acts then may be ſaid to be of Faith, onely becauſe the Doctrine of Faith enjoyns them, and the Habit or Vertue of Faith inclines the Soul unto them, and moves Charity unto the exerciſe of them.

As for example; If a man, free from neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Imployments of his Calling, ſhould ride half a ſcore of miles to be merry with his honeſt friend: this were neither an <hi>act of faith,</hi> nor an <hi>exerciſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea by faith,</hi> and <hi>yet truely of faith,</hi> in our Apoſtles Senſe, and no way Sinfull, becauſe <hi>warrantable by the Doctrine of faith:</hi> Neither Faith, nor Conſcience, nor Law of Nature would condemn him for ſo doing. But if his deareſt Friend lay on his Death-bed, and did expect ſome comfort by his Preſence: his Abſence upon ſuch light Occaſions would be ſinfull, becauſe it could not be <hi>of Faith.</hi> Neither the doctrine of Faith, nor the Law of Reaſon, could countenance ſuch an Action. Such reſolutions may properly be ſaid, <hi>Not of Faith,</hi> becauſe they cannot proceed but from ſome Inclination, or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, oppoſite to the Habit of true Faith, and the dictates of Natural well diſpoſed, much more of ſanctified Conſcience. Suppoſe ſome mans Conſcience were ſo ſcrupulous, as to doubt whether he might ride ſo farre to be merrie with his friend, when he had no urgent Occaſions to withdraw him; and another ſo confident, and fully perſvvaded in his mind, as to make no queſtion whether he ſhould meet his friend in a Plaguie houſe, or when his own Father lay a dying. The Queſtion is, whether of theſe two doth ſinne the more? or if both do not ſin, whether of them is freed from ſin, and by what means? The former, as is ſuppoſed, doubts of the Action, and yet doth it: the other doth the like, but worſe, and doubteth not. If that Journey which in it ſelf is Lawfull, (ſuppoſing the former Caſe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unlawfull to the one, becauſe he doubts it is Unlawfull: then may the others confident Perſwaſion make his expedition Lavvfull unto him, although in it ſelf (ſuppoſing the Caſe above mentioned) it were Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. For who can give any Reaſon, why Confidence of Perſwaſion may not as well legitimate what otherwiſe is Unlawfull, as Doubt, or Scruple illegitimate that which otherwiſe were Lawfull and Warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

If the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſhould wage Warre againſt the Spaniard, he that were addicted to their Religion might reply, <hi>I ſhould be as willing as another to do my King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey any Service, but I Doubt whether I may afford him my goods to the hurt and dammage of Roman Catholicks: the Cauſe I am afraid is moſt Unlawfull, and will bring Gods Plague upon this Land, therefore I may not hazard my Life in it, nor adventure to ſhed the innocent bloud of our Holy Mother the Churches Children.</hi> The like might a Lutheran ſay, if War ſhould fall out betwixt our State and the Saxons; or if with ſome other reformed Churches, the like might be ſaid by moſt in our Land: Finally, there would be continuall Diſtraction in the mannaging of all publick Affairs. But ſuch ſcrupulous demurs in Civil Matters, are either ſeldom made, or quickly anſwered by the Temporall Sword. And are they leſſe dangerous in Caſes as little doubtfull, (wherein the Conſequents feared are of no leſſe moment) when they are given to the chief Mannagers of our ſpiritual Warfare, in times wherein Diſobedience threatens diſſolution of Chriſts Armie, that muſt fight his Battels againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and the Man of Sin? Is the Authoritie of Binding and Looſing, Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Shutting the Kingdom of Heaven, leſſe than the Authority of Life and Death, or the diſpoſing Powers of Temporal Goods? What ſhould be the Reaſon then that every Scruple ſhould be held ſufficient to denie Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (in matters of greateſt Conſequence) unto Spiritual, more than Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Authoritie? <note n="‖" place="margin">Deniall of Obedience upon Scruple, yea even the ſcruple or doubt it ſelf, may be <hi>not of Faith,</hi> as well as the poſitive Action, of whoſe Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they doubt: whence the Objection, which many draw from the Apostles Rule, is moſt forcible against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> Out of doubt, that Rule of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth no more Warrant the one than the other. The true Reaſon is: moſt men fear Tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poral Cenſures, more than either Gods or His, an ordinary Goal, more than Hell: and had rather be Door-keepers in great Mens Houſes, than glorified Saints in Heaven; but of this hereafter. To proceed then with our Apoſtles Rule. Were it univerſally to be underſtood, it would bring all Chriſtian Souls into ſuch perpetual, miſerable, inextricable Perplexities, as they ſhould alwayes live in ſuſpence, and ſcarce Reſolve upon any thing. For his Rule holds as true in the Omiſſion of what ſhould be done, as in the Commiſſion of what we think ſhould not be done. Suppoſe then thy Paſtor Commands thee to Obey in this or that Particular, which he verily thinks, either neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be undertaken by all Chriſtiane, at all or moſt times; or elſe moſt Expedient for thy Souls health, the ſetting forth of Gods Glory, or the Good of others, at this preſent. But thou art contrary-minded, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt whether thou mayeſt do it Lawfully or no. Why? becauſe thou haſt no Warrant for it out of Scripture, or becauſe he brings no neceſſary Reaſons why thou ſhouldeſt do it, but bare Probabilities, which cannot overſway that Doubt, which thou haſt framed unto thy Conſcience. But he can ſhew
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57235:116"/>
thee expreſſe Commandment out of Scripture, that thou ſhouldeſt Obey Him. Thou wilt ſay; in things Lawful only. This he avoucheth to be ſuch; Thou denieſt it. He can ſhew thee again expreſſe words of Scripture, that thou ſhouldeſt not be wiſe in thine own conceit, but be willing to learn of thy Paſtor, <hi>Who is the Meſſenger of the Lord of hoſtes, at whoſe mouth thou ſhouldeſt ſeek the Law, and on whom,</hi> as our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>thou doſt depend.</hi> Tell me then, firſt, by what Place of Scripture thy Diſobedience in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular can be Warranted? How canſt thou chuſe but Doubt, whether thy denial of Obedience be <hi>of Faith</hi> or no, ſeeing Gods Word Commands thee, in general tearms, to Obey, and no where wils thee to Diſobey in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Or if thou thinkeſt thou haſt ſome general Warrant for Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe thou ſuppoſeſt this particular to be Unlawful: yet how canſt thou but doubt, whether thou haſt learned the Precepts of Chriſtian Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie as thou ſhouldeſt? Whether thou haſt learned to deny thy Self, and thy Aſſections? whether thou haſt learned to reverence thy Paſtor as Gods Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, not taking any offence at his Perſon? Finally, whether thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all ſuch delights and deſires, as uſually are the Grounds of falſe Perſwaſion, and Impediments of ſincere Obedience? If thou canſt not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly reſolved in theſe, then muſt thou doubt, (whether thou wilt or no) whether thy doubt or ſcruple it ſelf be <hi>of Faith</hi> or Conſcience, or of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> only. And if thou canſt not but doubt herein, then maiſt thou aſſure thy ſelf, that thy denial of Obedience is not <hi>of Faith,</hi> and therefore Sinful: if the Apoſtles Rule (as thou ſuppoſeſt) were univerſally true, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth any thing, of whoſe Lawfulneſſe he doubts, doth Sin, becauſe he doth it not <hi>of Faith.</hi>

                        <p n="7">7 But for a direct Anſwer to our Apoſtles Speech.

Nor was it ſo much a poſitive <hi>Doubt,</hi> as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Ra hneſſe, or want of ſetled Reſolution, in many of them, which made
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57235:116"/>
them Sin; as may appear from the Circumſtance of the Place: yet was this eating not only a Sin, but a moſt Grievous Sin, in all that did eat ſuch Meats, without a conſtant and wel-grounded Reſolution. Both the Sin, and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie Grievouſneſſe of it, did hence ariſe: they had eaten of things ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idols, or other Meats, (in their Judgement) accurſed by the Law, which they ſuſpected not only to be Unlawful to be eaten, but Doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in eating them they ſhould not be partakers of the Table of Divels, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated to the Sacraments of Idolatrie, or ſeparated from the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, or finally become Apoſtata's from Faith, and the Holy Doctrine. As on the one ſide, the evil which they feared was extraordinarily grievous, and the Reaſons of their fear ſuch as could not eaſily be caſt off, but would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes likely to breed Deſpair after the Action were paſt, albeit many of them did ſhake off all doubt for the preſent: ſo on the other part, there was not <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> not the leaſt poſſible Surmiſe of performing any degree of any good or acceptable Service in the ſight of God, by their eating. For, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place notes: <hi>The Kingdom of God is not Meat or Drink, but Righteouſneſſe and Peace, whoſoever in theſe,</hi> (as if he had ſaid, not in eating and drinking) <hi>Serveth Chriſt, is Acceptable unto God, and is Approved of Men.</hi> Thoſe then of whom he there ſpake, accounting it a chief part of their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to abſtain from all Unclean things, their danger in eating was in Quantitie exceeding Great, and for the Qualitie Spiritual: their Loſſe in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from ſuch meats (being provided of others) was in Quantitie as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and for the Qualitie meerly Corporal. Wherefore <hi>thus to have eaten, with the leaſt Scruple of ſuch grievous Danger, was worſe then</hi> Eſau'<hi>s alienating of his Birth-right for a Meſſe of Pottage.</hi> And albeit they had <hi>Doubted</hi> today, and grown Reſolute tomorrow, upon no better Motives then the bare exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others; or in an Humour or Braverie, becauſe they would not <hi>Doubt</hi> any longer, but uſe their Libertie as others did: yet had ſuch Reſolutions been deadly. For Opinions of this nature may not be caſt off in a Moment, nor may a man adventure upon a <hi>Doubt</hi> of ſuch fearful Conſequence, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great Motives of ſome Spiritual good; the Probabilities of attaining which may countervail the evil feared: or upon ſerious deliberation, and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcovery of their former Errour, and cauſeleſſe Scruple.

For ſuch Reſolutions, albeit they may ſeem moſt ſtrong, as indeed they are for the time exceeding ſtiff: yet are they eaſily to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Satan, the inward Temptations of the Fleſh, or other Occurrents; and after once they begin to fail, ſuch as lean moſt unto them, fall ſo much the more Headlong into deepeſt Deſpair, by how much they have been ſtronger or higher Pitcht; as it ſeems ſome of theſe, to whom he writes, had been too bold in eating, and were afterwards tortured by the Sting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

                        <p n="8">8 Whether any ſuch Oppoſition, as I have ſpoken of, can probably be found between any expreſſe Law of God, and our Churches publick Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſuch Rites and Ceremonies, as many painful Labourers in Gods Harveſt have made ſcruple of, or whether ſuch ſcruples have been firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon probable diſcovery of ſuch Oppoſition, after ſuch ſerious and due Examination, I leave it to their Conſciences that have made, or do make them: beſeeching God for the Good of his Church, and his Glory ſake to inſpire many of their Hearts but with this Cogitation; Whether were more likely, That they themſelves ſhould commit any Act of Inſidelity or Popery, by continuance in their Paſtoral charge, upon ſuch tearms as many of their religious and learned Brethren do: or whether Atheiſm and Inſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ſhould increaſe abundantly throughout this Land by their ſilence.

                        <p n="9">9 But my Purpoſe in this place was, only to ſearch out the Limits of true Obedience unto Spiritual Authority in general, ſo far as it concerns the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their Faith, or edification in Manners, who are to be governed and inſtructed by it. None of them can juſtly pretend, (ordinarily) any ſcruple <note place="margin">That the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by our Apoſtles Rule, <hi>(whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin)</hi> ought to move men unto ſuch conditional <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> unto their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors as hath been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> of ſuch conſequence as Inferiour Miniſters may. If they could but duly conſider, and unpartially eſteem the Goodneſſe which accompanies Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>(which is better then ſacrifice)</hi> and the evil of Diſobedience, <hi>(which is as the Sin of Witchcraft)</hi> theſe two laid together would be more then equivalent to any evil that Lay-men, or Inferiours, uſually conceive in ſuch Actions, as they deny Obedience in unto their Paſtors. <hi>Nay in this unbelieving Age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is more to be Complemental then Religious,</hi> it is thought an anſwer good enough, ſo it be complementally performed unto their Paſtors: We would do as you Adviſe, or Injoyn us, in Chriſts Name, if we certainly knew that it were Chriſts Will, or agreeable to Gods Word. Whereas in truth, in giving ſuch Anſwers, when neither they certainly know, nor are careful to learn, whether their Adviſe be contrary to Gods Word or no, they ſin directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtian Faith, advancing their own Humours above Gods Word, which commands Obedience unto Paſtors, preferring the Liberty of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Wils before the ſafety of their Conſciences. And it is prepoſterous to plead Ignorance of Gods Will before them, whoſe Inſtructions therein they are bound duly to Hear, and hearing to Obey, until they can light on better, or find them falſe, upon ſerious and due examination: that is, They muſt Obey them not abſolutely and irrevocably, but with <hi>Limitation and Caution.</hi> And queſtionleſſe if men did infallibly Believe, or abſolutely from their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57235:120"/>
hearts Obey, that which they undoubtedly know to be Gods Will: they would never make queſtion, but that, for which they have Preſumptions that it is part of Gods Will, or that, which is commended unto them for his Will, by ſuch as he hath appointed to be Meſſengers of the ſame, ſhould be <hi>conditionally Believed</hi> and <hi>without caution Obeyed,</hi> eſpecially when it is delivered ſolemnly upon deliberation, and premeditation, or out of that place whence he hath appointed them to learn his Wil. <hi>Did not Prieſts</hi> (as the Proverb is) <hi>forget that ever they were Clerks,</hi> or ſuch as take themſelves for great profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that they were ſometimes Novices in the School of Chriſt; they might remember how they came unto that abſolute and infallible Belief of thoſe Chriſtian Principles, by which they hope for Salvation, by entertaining this conditional Belief, which we ſpeak of, and by yielding like Obedience unto Divine Truths, now fully, but at the firſt imperfectly, known for ſuch. And albeit ſuch general Articles of Chriſtian Faith, as are neceſſary for all to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, neither increaſe, nor diminiſh their Number: yet if we deſcend unto the Diverſity of mens Eſtates and Callings, and Difference of Time and Place: Chriſtian Faith receiveth perpetual increaſe, not only in its proper Strength, or as we ſay by way of Intention, but in extent alſo unto many particulars, either directly contained (though not ſo eaſie to be diſcerned) as eſſential parts under the former general Principles, or elſe annexed unto them collaterally as limbs or borders. Beſides, all Chriſtian Duties, or Matters of Practiſe, are not promiſcuouſly fir for every Time or Place, but muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally proportioned to their diverſitie. Again, the ſame duties, (I mean of the ſame kind) muſt be performed in different meaſure, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent exigence of Time, Place, Perſons, or other Occurrents. In all theſe and many more reſpects is this conditional Aſſent, and Obedience unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors moſt neceſſary. And ere men can retain ſtedfaſtly that which is beſt, they muſt make triall of all, or many things of different kinds: and yet trial of Spiritual Medicines without Spiritual Phyſitians preſcripts, is ſo much more dangerous to ordinary mens Souls, then like trial of Phyſick-concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is to their Bodies, by how much ſuch men are more ignorant of the ſtate of their Souls, then of their Bodies. The neceſſity and uſe of what hath been delivered concerning Obedience in general, will appear in ſundry points to be diſcuſt hereafter. In reſpect of which (eſpecially of that point concerning the manner, <hi>how we may know the Senſe of Scriptures,</hi> and that concerning the <hi>nature of Chriſtians Faith)</hi> ſome further unfolding of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Obedience will be</hi> likewiſe neceſſary.</p>

The <hi>Act</hi> of our Obedience in this particular, muſt proceed from the ſame Habit, from which our Acts of Obedience unto ſuch Truths, as we infalliblie Beleeve for Divine, do: for even this very <hi>Act,</hi> is performed primarilie and abſolutely to Gods Word in general, unto which we owe Religious and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Obedience: and unto this Particular (enjoyned by our Paſtor) only ſecondarilie, and upon ſuppoſition that it is Part of Gods Word.

For if one of his Flock ſhall have an advantage againſt his Neighbour or have picked a Quarrel with his Leaſe; or let a Gentleman be diſpoſed to put off his Tenants, or inhance their Rents to their utter undoing: let any, gengle, or mean, have but good hope to make his own great Gain by ſome others Loſſe: Here if we trie him, and charge him upon his Allegiance unto Chriſt to remit his Hold, to let go all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and be good unto his Fellow-ſervant, or poor Brother, theſe are matters the Miniſter muſt meddle no more with than an other man, the Law can determine whether he do Right, or Wrong, and this Caſe belongs properly unto the Lawyer. As if the Power of Gods Spirit, or Authority of his Miniſters, did conſiſt onely in Words, and required no other Obedience, than a formal ſpeculative Aſſent unto their general Doctrine, not a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of mens Wills, or heartie Submiſſion of Affections, unto ſuch Rules as they ſhall preſcribe, for the preſervation of a good and upright Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in particular Actions, or entercourſe of Humane Affairs. Or if one of a thouſand will be ſo good as to grant that he is to Obey the Precepts of Chriſt, before the Cuſtomes of our Common-Law, or other Civil Courts: yet even the beſt of ſuch, when it comes to Points of private Commoditie, will diſpenſe with his Paſtor, and replie: <hi>I would do as you admoniſh me, if I ſaw any expreſſe Command for it in Gods Word, or any evident Neceſsity that ſhould bind me to renounce that Right, which Law doth give me:</hi> but for ought I can perceive, I may proſecute my Right in this preſent Caſe, with a ſafe Conſcience, and you do not know all particular Circumſtances, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto this matter; if you did, or were in my Caſe, I am perſwaded you would be of my Mind. This although it be the onely ſhelter, under which the Infidelitie of later Ages takes its reſt, the onely Dormitory wherein Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie ſleeps profoundly, and never dreams of further Danger: yet is it a moſt ſillie Excuſe, and ſhameleſſe Apologie, in the judgement of any that knows, or knowing rightly eſteems, the Principles of Chriſtianitie. For, ſuppoſe thou ſee no Evidence, that Chriſt hath commanded thee to confeſſe his Name in this particular, doth the law lay any neceſſity upon thee, to make thee proſecute thy ſuppoſed Right? If it did charge thee upon pain of Death ſo to do, thou haſt ſome pretence to Obey it; albeit thou ſhouldeſt fear him more, that could Condemn thee, and the Interpreters of it, to everlaſting Death: but the Law doth leave it to thy Choiſe, whether thou wilt uſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57235:123"/>
the Benefit of it, or no: and thy Paſtour upon penaltie of incurring Chriſts diſpleaſure, commands thee, that thou uſe it not. Thou replieſt, <hi>Thou ſeest no Evidence that Chriſt Commands thee.</hi> But doſt thou abſolutely and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly know, that he doth not call thee at this time, to trie thy Obedience in this Particular? If thou canſt out of ſincerity of Heart, and Evidence of Truth, fullie inform thy Conſcience in this Negative (ſo the End of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings be good,) thou maiſt be the bolder to diſclaim thy Paſtours Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. If thou canſt not, how wilt thou anſwer thy Judge, when thou ſhalt appear before him, why thou out of the Stubbornneſſe of thy Heart, didſt more reſpect thy private Gain, than his heavieſt diſpleaſure? For ſuppoſe thy hope of Gain were great, (as it is uſually to ſuch as thou art, more great than certain) yet cannot the greatneſſe, and certaintie of it, countervail the leaſt danger of incurring His Wrath, nor could the certaintie of worldly Gain counterpoiſe, much leſſe overſway, the leaſt ſurmiſe or probabilitie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring thy Souls deſtruction, unleſſe thy Mind had been ſet more on Gold, than upon thy God, more enclined to private Commoditie and Self-love, than unto Chriſt thy Redeemer. Or ſhall thy anſwer ſtand for good in his ſight, when thou ſhalt ſay unto his Meſſenger: <hi>It is more then I know, that Christ Commands me?</hi> Then ſhould the damned be juſtified at the Day of Judgement, when they ſhall truly replie, they knew not that ever Chriſt did ſupplicate unto them <hi>ſub forma panperis.</hi> Moſt of them, we may ſafely ſwear, had leſſe Probabilities to Believe this in their life time, than thou haſt now to perſwade thee of this particular: although thy Paſtours, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and frequent Admonitions were ſet aſide; which make thee ſo much the more Inexcuſable. For thou mighteſt have known by him, that God had Commanded thee as much, unleſſe thy bad Deſires had made thee Blind. But neither ſhall theirs, or thy Ignorance herein help. <hi>For Ignorance which is bred of bad Deſires, corrupt Affections, or greedy Appetites, brings forth hardneſſe of Heart, and Infidelity:</hi> ſo that ſeeing, thou ſhalt not ſee, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou ſhalt not hear, nor underſtand the Warnings for thy Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt formerlie ſhut thine ears at thy Paſtors Admonitions, or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at his juſt Reproof. And the Law of God binds thy Soul, upon greater penaltie, and better hopes, than all Laws in the World beſides could bind thy Bodie, even upon of everlaſting Life, and penaltie of everlaſting Death, to lay aſide all Selfe-love, all worldlie Deſire, for the finding out of the true ſenſe and meaning of it, as well as to Obey it, when thou knoweſt it. And when any point of Doctrine or Practiſe, either in general or particular, is commended to thee by thy Paſtour, Gods Word doth bind thee to ſearch, with all Sobrietie, and Modeſtie, the Truth and force of all Motives, Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Probabilities which he ſhall ſuggeſt unto thee; all private reſpect laid aſide, leſt thou become <hi>a partiall Judge of evil thoughts:</hi> and if thou canſt not find better Reſolution, it binds thee to relie upon his Authoritie. And even in this again, Gods Word (ſo perfect a Rule is it) doth rule thy thoughts, to diſcern the Fidelitie, Sinceritie, or Authoritie of thy Teacher.</p>

other Motives to Believe, beſide his Paſtors Authority. For this is a dictate of common reaſon, and cannot but command the Aſſent of every ſanctified Mind; That ſuch Men are moſt likely to have the Meaning of Gods Spirit, which walk according to Gods Spirit, and ſeek not their own Gain, Glory, or pleaſure, but Chriſts Glory, his Will, and peoples Good: and ſuch again are moſt likely to uſe greateſt ſincerity in delivering the Truth, which they know, without partiality or reſpect of perſons. Again, men are bound <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> to Believe them beſt, and Obey them moſt, of whoſe ſkil, and ſincerity in diſpenſing the Myſteries of faith, they have had moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſpiritual Experience.

                        <p>Thus much concerning this point, I have thought good to inſert in this place, becauſe the true and ſincere Practiſe of Obedience, according to that meaſure of Truth, or Belief which men have, though but imperfect, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt Means, for attaining the clear ſight of Divine Truth, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Meaſure of ſanctifying Belief, which in this life can be looked for, as ſhall (God willing) afterwards appear.</p>

In this Senſe we ſay, the Concluſion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely contained in the Premiſſes, the Corollarie in the Theorem, or the immediate Conſequent in his neceſſarie Antecedent. For he that grants One of theſe abſolutely, muſt upon the ſame terms grant the Other, at the firſt propoſal of it unto him. But this conditional, or reſervative Belief may be of ſuch Points, as are not certainly, and infallibly contained in any Principle of Faith, abſolutely, expreſly, actually, or infallibly acknowledged; much leſſe ſo eſſentually, and immediately contained in any, that a man cannot abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely grant it, but he muſt abſolutely Believe them.

And before the deduction be made as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, and apprehended asinfallible, as are the general Articles whence they are deduced, the Particulars deduced from them may not be ſo infallibly and abſolutely Believed, as the Generals are.

It is enough that they know them to be propoſed by the Church. For once Believing, <hi>Whatſoever the Church ſaith is moſt Infallible,</hi> (which is the main Article of Roman Faith) no man can denie any particular propoſed by it to be infallible, more then he can deny the Concluſion for certain, after he hath granted the Premiſſes for ſuch.

For nothing can be reſolved beyond it rule, &amp; to make the Churches authority ſuch an abſolute, authentick, unqueſtionable rule of faith, as the Papiſts do, and withal to ſeek the reſolution of any point of faith further then it, or to derive it from Scripture, doth argue ſuch a medley of Folly &amp; Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as if ſome gulliſh Gentleman, deſirous to prove the Antiquitie of his Houſe, ſhould draw his Pedigree from <hi>Adams</hi> great Grandfather, and yet hold the Records of <hi>Moſes</hi> for moſt undoubted and true, which affirm <hi>Adam</hi> to have been the firſt Progenitour of all Mankind.

                        <p n="1">1 WHen we affirm, that the Scriptures are the only infallible Rule in matters of Faith and Chriſtian Obedience, we underſtand ſuch a Rule in thoſe matters, as <hi>Ariſtotles Organon</hi> may be ſaid of Logick: ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it were ſound, and free from all ſuſpicion of Errour in every point, and contained in it all the general and undoubted Principles, from which all true Forms of Argumentation muſt be deduced, and into which all muſt be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſolved. To illuſtrate this Truth by a known Practiſe. Our younger Students are bound to yield their abſolute Aſſent unto <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Authoritie, in matters of Logick: but not unto any Interpreter, that ſhall pretend it, ſave only when he ſhall make evident unto them, that this was <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Meaning. And while they ſo only, and no otherwiſe yield their Aſſent, they yield it wholly and immediately unto <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> not to the Interpreter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by his Means they came to know <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Meaning; which once known, without any further confirmation of other Teſtimonie or Authoritie, commands their Obedience and Aſſent. But ere they can fully Aſſent unto this great Maſter, or throughly perceive his Meaning, they muſt conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Aſſent unto their private Tutors, or other Expoſitors, and take his Senſe and Meaning upon their Truſt, and Credit. In like manner (ſay we) in all Matters, Doctrines, or Controverſies of Faith, and Chriſtian Obedience, we are bound to yield our Aſſent, directly, abſolutely, and finally unto the Authoritie of Scriptures only: not unto any Doctor, Expoſitor, or other whoſoever he be, that ſhall pretend Authoritie out of Scripture over our Faith, ſave only when he ſhall make it clear, and evident unto us, that his Opinion is the true Meaning of the Scripture. And thus yielding our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Aſſent unto the Truth explained by him, we yield it not to him, but unto the Author of Truth, whoſe Words we hold to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in whoſe Mouthes ſoever; and once known to be His words, they need not the Teſtimonie or Authority of him, that did bring us to the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them. And before we be brought to ſee their Truth with our own eyes, and feel it by our ſenſe, (by the effects or experiments of it upon our own Souls) we are to limit our Aſſent and Obedience, as it is ſet down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) according to the Probabilities, or unpartial Inducements, which we have of the Expoſitors Skill, and Sincerity, in diſpenſing Divine Myſteries. And theſe Motives or Inducements, which we have of his Skill and Sincerity, muſt be framed according to the Rules or Precepts of Scripture, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Affections, or Humours: we may not think him moſt to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that is in higheſt Place, or hath the greateſt ſtroke in other Affairs. For as the Faith of Chriſt, ſo muſt our Perſwaſion of the faithful Diſpenſers, or ſkilful Seedſ-men of Faith, be had without reſpect of perſons.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 If we yield <hi>Aſſent</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> unto any Expoſitor, or other, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then upon theſe <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Limitations,</hi> then, as we ſaid before, whileſt we yielded abſolute Obedience unto his doctrine that perſwaded us to true Belief, becauſe we perceived that which he ſpake to be the Word of God, we did not yield it unto him, but unto Gods Word, delivered and made known unto us by him: ſo here again by the ſame Reaſon (only inverted) it will evidently follow, that if we Believe any mans Doctrines or Deciſions, to be the Word of God, becauſe he ſpeaks it, or becauſe we hold his Words
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57235:125"/>
to be infallible, we do not truly and properly Believe the Word of God, (ſuppoſe his doctrine were the Word of God) but his Words and Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie onely. Hence again it follows, that if we yield the ſame abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Aſſent</hi> unto his Authoritie, which we would do unto Gods Word immediately known in it ſelf, and for it ſelf; or relie upon his Infallibility in expounding Gods Word, as fully as he doth upon the Word, (which it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he knows immediately in it ſelf, and for it ſelf:) by doing thus we rob God of his Honour, giving that unto Man, which is only due to Him. For the Infallibility of this Teacher hath the ſame Proportion to all that thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Believe him, as the Infallibilitie of the Godhead hath unto him; his Words the ſame Proportion, to all other mens Faith, that Gods Word hath unto his.

                        <p n="3">3 Here it will be demanded, how men, altogether Illiterate, can examin any Doctrine by Scriptures? <note n="*" place="margin">In what Senſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures may be ſaid the Rule of mens Faith altogether illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate.</note> If they cannot Read them, how ſhall they Examin any thing by them? not examining the Points of Faith by them, how can they be ſaid to be the Rule of their Faith?

And the rules of Truth once fully apprehended and embraced, ſerve as a Touchſtone to diſcern all Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Concluſions, which ſhall be ſuggeſted unto them by others: ſo as they wil admit of nothing for ſound &amp; true Logick, but what may be reſolved into the former, or ſome other Principles, which they can perſpicuouſly and immediately diſcern, to have been drawn from the Fountain of Truth, by the ſame natural Facultie or Ability, by which they did diſcern the former: for the faculty will ſtill be like affected with all Principles, of like Nature, Uſe and Perſpicuity. In like ſort muſt the firſt and general Principles of Faith be derived from Scriptures, (the only pure fountain of Supernatural Truths) unto all illiterate hearts, by the Miniſtery of the learned. For Hearts, though Illiterate, once illuminated by Gods Spirit, are as apt to diſcern Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Principles, from falſhood or carnal Conjectures, as the natural Man is to diſcern natural Truths, from Errours of the ſame kind. And theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and fundamental Principles of Faith, engrafted in their hearts, ſerve as infallible rules, for diſcerning the Conſonancie or Diſſonancie of ſuch Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as ſhal be ſuggeſted unto them; as ſhal (God willing) hereafter be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: nor may they without Injury to Gods Spirit or inward Grace, admit any other precepts into the ſame rank or ſociety with theſe, but either upon evident and diſtinct deduction from them, or ſure Experiments of their like Spiritual fruit and Uſe, for the amendment of Life, and procuring that peace of Conſcience, which no Natural Man can conceive, much leſſe can it be cauſed by meer Natural precepts.

From their Truth ſuppoſed (which we are ready to make good againſt all Gain-ſayers) it neceſſarily follows, that this Queſtion about the Scriptures Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie, or Perſpicuitie, cannot be univerſally meant of all, and every Part of <note place="margin">The Queſtion concerning the Obſcuritie or Difficulty of Scriptures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of all Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reſpect of all Ages, or all Men.</note> Scripture in reſpect of all Perſons and Ages: as whether no Part be obſcure or difficult to all, or any this day living.

And no doubt but it was Gods Wil, to have them in matters concerning one calling not ſo facile unto ſuch as were of another Profeſſion: that every man might hence learn Sobriety, and be occaſioned to ſeek, if not only, yet principally, after the true Senſe and Meaning of thoſe Scriptures, which either neceſſarily concern all, or muſt direct him in that Chriſtian Courſe of life whereunto his God hath called him. But ſhal this Difficulty of ſome Parts (which ariſeth from the Diverſitie of Vocations) be thought any hinderance, why the whole Canon of Scripture ſhould not be a perfect Rule to all in their ſeveral Vocations? Suppoſe ſome univerſal Artiſt, or compleat Cyclopedian, ſhould ſet out an abſolute Syſtem, or Rule for all ſecular ſciences: it would be ridiculous exception to ſay, his Works could be no perfect Rule for young Grammarians, Rhetoricians, Logicians, or Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, becauſe he had ſome difficult Mathematical Queſtions, or abſtruſe Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical diſcourſes, which would require a grounded ſchollers ſerious Pains, and long ſearch, to underſtand them throughly: and if he ſhould admoniſh young ſtudents, to begin firſt with thoſe common and eaſie Arts, and not to meddle with the other, until they had made good trial of their Wit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie in the former: this would be a good token of a perfect Teacher, and one ſit to rule our Courſe in all thoſe ſtudies which he profeſſeth.

Even in this Age they are only ſeen in matters that concern learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of Scriptures, not neceſſary for private and unlearned perſons to know. And the eſpecial reaſon, why his doctrine in ſome Epiſtles (as in the Epiſtle to the Romans) ſeems obſcure, difficult, and intricate, is, becauſe learned men of later Times have too much followed the Authorities of men in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, who had examined S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, according to the rule or Phraſe of thoſe Arts or Faculties, with which they were beſt acquainted, or elſe had meaſured his Controverſie with the Jews, by the Oppoſitions or Contentions of the Age wherein they lived. Were this Partialitie unto ſome famous mens Authoritie (which indeed is made a chief rule in expounding Scriptures, even by many ſuch, as in words, are moſt earneſt to have Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures the only rule of Faith) once laid aſide, and the rules of Faith, elſe-where moſt perſpicuouſly and plainly ſet down by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> unpartially ſcan ned: his Doctrine in that Epiſtle would be ſo perſpicuous and eaſie unto the Learned, as it might by them be made plain enough and unoffenſive to the Unlearned. For the light of Truth, elſewhere delivered by this Lamp of the Gentiles (might it be admitted as a Rule, againſt ſome Expoſitions of that Epiſtle) would direct mens ſteps to avoid thoſe ſtumbling Blocks, which many have fallen upon. But to conclude this Aſſertion; their Difficultie (take them as they are) is no juſt Exception againſt this Part of Scripture: becauſe it remains difficult ſtil, even for this reaſon, that it is held generally for difficult, and is not made a rule, indeed for our directions; but <hi>other mens Opinions or Conjectures</hi> concerning it are <hi>taken for an Authentick Rubrick,</hi> by whoſe level only we muſt aim at our Apoſtles Meaning, from which we may not, without imputations of Irregularitie, ſwerve in the deciſion of Points (to ſay no worſe) as now they are made hard and knottie.</p>

Ere their allegations of this or like places, brought to prove the Scriptures Difficultie or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity can be pertinent, they muſt (according to the ſtate of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already propoſed) firſt prove this Obſcurity or Difficultie to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and ordinarie, not inflicted as a puniſhment upon Hypocrites, or ſuch as love Darkneſſe more than Light. And this they never ſhall be able; this one place alledged by <hi>Valentian</hi> moſt evidently proves the contrarie. For this was an extraordinarie and miraculous Judgement vpon theſe Jews, for their Hypocriſie, as appears, Verſes the thirteen and fourteen. And unto ſuch as they were, weacknowledge the Scriptures, by the juſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to be moſt Difficult ſtill; but denie ſuch Difficulties to be any Bar, why they ſhould not be the complete Rule of Faith. If the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites will avouch the contrarie: Let them tell us whether any other Rule could in this caſe ſupply their defect, be it unwritten Tradition, or <hi>viva vox infallibilis authoritatis, the infallible teaching or preaching of the viſible Church or Pope.</hi> This (I preſume) they will be aſhamed to affirm. <note n="†" place="margin">

Why could they not? Becauſe they had, as the Papiſts now have (though not ſo openly) diſclaimed the Scriptures for the Rule of their Faith, and

did follow the Precepts or Traditions of Men; and <hi>God</hi> (as we ſaid before <hi>hath ſo de reed that ſuch as neglect the Truth known, or love Darkneſſe more than Light, ſhould be given over to this reprobate ſenſe; that the more evident the Truth is, the more hatefull it ſhould be to them:</hi> as the hate of theſe Scribe, and Phariſees to our Saviour was greater then their fore-elders had been to the Prophets, becauſe the light of his Doctrine was greater, his Reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more ſharp, and their deeds and Hypocriſie worſe than their Fathers. No marvail then, if it be ſo hard a matter to recover a learned Papiſt, or make a Jeſuite recant his errour in this Point, ſeeing they are farther gone in this Jewiſh diſeaſe of contemning Gods Word, following Traditions, and Precepts of Men, for the Rule of their Faith, than theſe Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were; not likely therefore they would have yeelded to our Saviour himſelf, if they had lived in his time. Nor ſhould the ingenious Reader think we <hi>Hyperbolize</hi> or over-laſh, when we charge them with deeper Blaſphemie in this Point, than theſe Jews were guiltie of: as if this were ſtrange, ſeeing they are ſuch great Scholers, and profeſſe that they love Chriſt as well as we: for ſo would theſe Jews boaſt of their Antiquitie and ſkill in Scriptures, and thought that they loved God, and his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did.

                           <hi>If any man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.

The occaſion of the Multitudes admiring his Doctrine, was that He, who had never been Scholar to their Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, ſhould be ſo expert in Scriptures [as it is Verſe the fifteenth.] Our Saviours replie to this their Doubt conceived by way of admiration. [in the ſixteenth Verſe] is, that he had his Learning from God, and not from Man: <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi> And as he was taught by his Father, to deliver and teach the heavenly Doctrine, ſo might the ſimpleſt, and moſt unlearned amongſt them, be likewiſe taught of God

to diſcern whether his Doctrine were of God, or whether he ſpake of himſelf; If they would do the Will of God, and ſeek his Glory, not their own, as Chriſt did not ſeek his own Glory, but his that ſent him.

But let this Queſtion concerning Grace and Free-Wil, ſtand ſtil, as it doth in Controverſie, betwixt us and them, and the Lutherans. This is granted by all; that if Chriſt grant his grace to all that wil endeavour to follow his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, then it is eaſie to all, to learn this firſt Leſſon of Chriſtianity, <hi>Lowlineſſe, and Meekneſſe,</hi> the Rudiments of true Knowledg in Scripture, without which all other Learning in them is but Verbal. As this is confeſſed by all, ſo would I be reſolved by any Jeſuite, whether, if it be Chriſts pleaſure to deny his Grace to any, it be not altogether impoſſible for him to learn this Leſſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, or to become a good Proficient in the School of Chriſt, although the Pope, their ſuppoſed infallible Teacher, ſhould vouchſaſe to Catechize him <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> What hath this Jeſuite got then, by his fierce objecting this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of learning Humility, for to make the Scriptures ſeem Obſcure?

If it be more hard for him, then us ſo to do, we are more likely to become better Schollers in Chriſts ſchool, then his infallible Holineſs: more likely to be more certain of the true ſenſe or meaning of Scriptures then he can be, much more certain (in all neceſſary Points) hereof, then he can be of his <hi>Infallibility.</hi> For this Leſſon of true Humility muſt of neceſſity be learned, ere we can proceed in the true Knowledge of theſe Myſteries.

                        <p n="14">14 Doubtleſſe it is for want of acquainting Youth, and Childhood with the former Rules of Scripture, which make the Scripture generally either ſeem Obſcure or Difficult, or cauſeth men miſtake them ſeeming evident. For when they are grown to mans Eſtate, or be embarked in worldly Affairs, or inveſted in ſecular dignities, before they have ſtudied Scriptures, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the former Precepts: this ſeeming difficulty, either moveth them to ſeek for other Rules, more eaſie to their Capacity, or not to care for any Rule of Faith at all, or elſe to transform this which God hath given for reforming his Image in them, into the nature of their corrupt Affections. Were this Leſſon of becoming like little Children, throughly planted in our hearts, when we were Children: true Knowledge in other parts of Scriptures would grow with us, and Faith (once planted in Humility, while our hearts were tender, and eaſie to be wrought upon by this plain and eaſie Precept) albeit at the firſt but like a Grain of muſtard-ſeed, yet having got the ſtart of Pride, and deſire of ſecular glory in the Spring, ſhould afterwards flouriſh in all heavenly Knowledge, and fructifie in every good and acceptable Work, without the huſbandry, lopping, or pruning of an infallible Teacher. But if we, either through our own Wilfulneſs, or Parents Negligence, have perverted the Wayes of our Youth, that they wil not parallel this ſtraight and eaſie Rule, ſhal Gods Righteouſneſſe be prejudiced by our Iniquity? ſhal not his Wayes (this Way of Life) be equal, becauſe our Wayes be unequal? Muſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like <hi>Seneca's</hi> blind Woman, who accuſed every place, wherein ſhe could not ſee, for being too dark: muſt the Scriptures for our Blindneſſe of heart, be thought Obſcure? not in themſelves (ſaith the Jeſuite) but unto us: how unto us? or unto which of us? only to ſuch as are therefore become Blind, becauſe they have not in time, been made acquainted with this Light. For otherwiſe the Scriptures were written to Enlighten us, not themſelves, or ſuch as wrote them. And unto ſuch, as are Blinded in their own deſires, Difficult they are and Obſcure, without any reſpect of Perſons: to the Pope, as wel as to any meaner Man, not more Proud, or Carnal then He. Thus we ſee our Adverſaries cannot offer one Blow againſt us in this point, but we can make it fal more heavy upon themſelves. And wel were it, if their Objections did light heavy only upon the Objecters themſelves, for they have deſerved it. <hi>But here I muſt intreat the Chriſtian Reader to conſider well upon whom their uſual Objections of Scriptures Obſcurity are moſt likely to fall:</hi> Upon us, for whoſe good they were given; Or upon God the Father who gave them; his Son that partly ſpake them; his Holy Spirit who only taught them; his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, or other his bleſſed Miniſters which wrote them.</p>

                        <p n="6">6 Shall either the World, Devil, or Fleſh, be able to breed the leaſt Suſpition in any Chriſtian Heart; whether God who enabled the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts to ſpeak ſo plainly to the Capacitie of all ſorts of men, in every Nation, cannot either by increaſing internal Docilitie in ſucceeding Ages, or ſublevating their dull Capacitie by facilitie and plenty of external Means, repair whatſoever the Injuries of time might detract from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuitie of Writings Apoſtolical, or Evangelical. So that although the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Dialects, abſoluteneſſe of Phraſe, or Alterations of Cuſtomes, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they allude as well known then, becauſe in uſe) might breed ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie unto Poſteritie: yet (unleſſe true Faith be decayed with them, or all Characters of Gods Providence worn out of our hearts) how can we diſtruſt, whether, He, by whoſe Wiſdom, as well Divine Myſteries unheard before, as ſkill to utter them in every Language, were extraordinarily and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately infuſed into illiterate Souls, without the help or Miniſtery of Man; cannot or will not, by his good Bleſſing upon our endeavours in the ordinary Courſe of attaining ſkill in Sacred Tongues, continue the uſe of Tongues and all other good Means whatſoever, neceſſarie or expedient, either for our right underſtanding, or communicating, the infallible Truth alreadie taught, without any others infallible Aſſiſtance beſides his, who can teach us as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly by Means in themſelves not infallible, as he hath done others without any Means at all. To doubt of Gods Providence in this Point, were to doubt whether he were the ſame God ſtill: and if the ſame, he will (albeit by other Means) perform the ſame Effects ſtill; unleſſe the ſins of the Chriſtian World deſerve the contrary, and pull that Blindneſſe, which (in our Saviours time) reigned in thoſe Jews, upon themſelves, by like Hardneſſe of heart, Pride, or Hypocriſie. And if ſo they do, what ſhall this ſuppoſed Infallibilitie of the Pope avail? Is his Teaching more infallible then Chriſts was? ſhall he Looſe, where God hath Bound? ſhall he diſanull what the Almighty hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſied? ſhall he make the Scriptures clear to them, before whoſe hearts the Lord hath laid a Veil? Or ſhall he give Sight, where he that made the eye hath called for Blindneſſe? Oh that they could remember this who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their God and cannot ſee, that whoſoever accuſeth the Scriptures of Diſheultie or Obſcurity, doth indict the Omnipotent of Impotencie, in not being able to perform what by his Apoſtles he intended.</p>

For ſeeing this Blindneſſe in moſt men is not Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, at the leaſt, not Wilfull or affected, the Captions will yet demand; <hi>How ſhall they help it?

But what hope have ſinners to receive this, ſeeing he heareth onely ſuch as keep his Commandements? Will this, or any other Rule of Scripture help us out of this Labyrinth?

For, firſt, what Semblance is there between a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate mans Interpretation, or Comprehenſion of Scripture-ſence, and the putting of a Light or Candle under a Buſhel? For what though ſome one, ſome few, or more ſuch men, will apprehend this or that to be the full Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſome controverſed place in Scripture? I am (by our Churches Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) no more bound to Believe them, then I am to Believe the Pope of Rome, whom I never ſaw, nor knew. I am bound to Believe neither of them more, then if they ſhould tell me, that the whole Light of that candle which ſhines alike to all, were onely comprehended in their eyes. For by our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I may behold the ſame Light of Scriptures, which they do, as freely as they; Judge of it by mine own eyes and Senſe as well as they; not onely ſubmit my Senſe and judgement unto theirs.

And in like manner would this Doctor perſwade us, that we ſhould judge of this Light of Scriptures, onely by the Teſtimonie or Authoritie of ſuch, as ſee it ſhine in the Conſiſtorie at Rome, not with our own eyes. Had the Lord permitted but one grain of good wit to have remained in this Buſhel of Bran; not Impudencie in grain could without Pluſhing have offered to accuſe our Church for hiding the Light of Scriptures under a Buſhell; when as we contend, the free Uſe of it ſhould be permitted to the whole Congregation. But he diſputeth of the Light, as Blind men may of Colours. He lived at Ingolſtade, and the Light of Gods Word was at Rome lockt up within the compaſſe of the Conſiſtorie, ſo that he could not ſee to make his compariſon of it. Secondly, what Proportion is there between the Churches Authority, (ſuch Authority as he claims for his Church) and a Candleſtick? Let the Conſiſtory be ſuppoſed the Candleſtick, wherein the word of God doth ſhine as a Light or Candle. Doth it indeed ſhine there? unto whom? <hi>To all that will aſſociate themſelves to that Church?</hi> Come then, let every man exhort his Neighbour to repair to the Mountain of the Lord. Shall we there immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſee the Truth of Scriptures, clearly and diſtinctly with our own eyes, becauſe the Pope, or Trent-Councel holds out unto us the Books of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture? May private Spirits diſcern their true Sence in matters of Faith, as clearly as if they were a Light indeed to thee? Oh no, you quite miſtake his meaning, in making ſuch Collections; Let <hi>Valentian</hi> explicate himſelf in the end of this fourth Paragraph.</p>

For at this time, as the Glory, the temporal Power and Authority of your Church was exceeding Great, ſo were the Hopes of theſe poor ſouls, leſſe, either of purchaſing Glory by contradicting, or private Gains by diſobeying your Decrees. To attempt the one was the readieſt way to procure their utter Diſgrace; the other, an infallible provocation of greateſt Danger. Your Church had the whole Multitude of Nations as ready at her beck to applaud your cruel deſigns againſt them, as the High-Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had the Jewiſh People to approve our Saviours Condemnation. The manner of their Tortures, accompanied with ſuch certainty of Ignominy and Diſgrace, were dreadful to the ſetled and deliberate cogitations of Fleſh and Bloud; their Memory (for ought they could in human probability foreſee) was either to ſleep with their Bodies, and lie buried in their aſhes, or (if ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving them) to be perpetually ſcourged by the ſcurrilous pens and tongues of their bitter Adverſaries.

If the Scripture may be a Rule, to compoſe the diverſity of theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, moſt repugnant amongſt themſelves, may it not much more be a Rule to compoſe all Controverſies amongſt profeſſed Chriſtians, who agree in far more Principles of Faith, and Rules of Scripture, then the former did, if Chriſtians would be as ſoberly affected, and not ſtand upon the Authorities and Cuſtomes of men, the ſpecial Obſtacle that keeps the Jews from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?</p>
                        <p n="8">8 It is uſual with your Writers to argue thus, <hi>We cannot know Scriptures to be</hi> the Scriptures, <hi>but by the Authority of the Church; therefore we cannot know the true Senſe and Meaning of them, but by the infallible Authority of the ſame.</hi> The Antecedent of which Argument, as we have partly ſhewed, and hereafter (God willing) ſhal ſhew to be moſt falſe: ſo for the Argument it ſelf I only now ſay, that it may be far more probably inverted upon you, thus. The Jews may come to acknowledge the New Teſtament for the very Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of their Meſſias, and to Believe in heart, and Profeſs with their mouthes the Myſteries therein contained, by ſober and diligent comparing them with the Prophecies of the Old, without the infallible Authority of your Church: therefore they may know the true ſenſe and meaning of the Goſpel, in all Points neceſſary to ſalvation, without any ſuch infallible Authority. For it is a matter of far leſſe Difficulty, for any man of ſenſe and reaſon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce particular Concluſions from general and evident Principles, then to finde out the general and fundamental Principles, by natural Notions, or other Principles: And therefore more eaſie for any ſuch man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

And thus it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that if the Old Teſtament be a Rule unto the Jews, for finding out the Truth of the New, much more may the New, once acknowledged by them, and admitted of equal Authority with the Old, be a perfect Rule for them in matters of Salvation. And if theſe Scriptures are, or may be a Rule to the Jews, (if they will believe them) then muſt they be a Rule to all Chriſtians that Believe them. No Chriſtian I hope wil deny, but that the Old Teſtament is the Rule of the Jews: For the unbelieving Jews ſhal be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in what part of the world ſoever, for not following this Rule, which God hath commended and made known unto them, not for not acknowledging the Popes Infallibility, of which many of them never heard. And if the Old Teſtament be ſuch to them, much more muſt the whole Canon be unto us ſuch a Rule: and if we die in miſbelief or infidelity, we ſhall be judged by this Rule of Gods Law and Goſpel, which we tranſgreſſed, not by the Popes Decrees or Expoſitions of it. That many, Chriſtians by profeſſion, erre in Points of Faith, or miſtake the true Senſe and Meaning of it, or pervert it to their Deſtruction, proceeds from their Ingratitude towards God that gave it, and for their delight in Falſhood. Which is the reaſon why theſe Jews miſtake the true Meaning of the Old Teſtament.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 If any of our Adverſaries here demand, how chanceth it ſo many Jews erre in the Foundation of Faith, if the Scripture be ſuch an infallible Rule? he muſt be content to reſolve me in the like Queſtion: How chanceth it, ſo many Jews live unconverted in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and other places, either in the Popes Dominions, or where his Authority is eſtabliſhed, if the Infallibility of his Authority, or their Church, be ſuch an excellent Rule? If they reply, the Jews might believe all Points of Roman-Catholick Faith aright, ſo they would admit their Church as Judge or Miſtreſſe of Faith: the Jews might with as good reaſon rejoyn: ſo might the Romans believe all Points of Judaiſm, would they acknowledge this ſuppoſed Infallibility of Doctrine to be in their Rabbinical Expoſitions, not in the Popes Determinations. But the Romaniſt, I ſuppoſe, would deſire a Sign ere he believed them herein: and are we leſſe bound by the Rule of Faith, to deſire ſome tolerable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to theſe reaſons following, ere we believe them in this Point, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial in our judgement to Religion in general, as Subſcription to Rabbini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctrine is unto Chiſtian Verity.</p>

without the infallible Avouchment of their Church) <hi>is ſo far from ending all Controverſies of Faith, that it rather occaſions Controverſies and Diſſentions in Doctrines of Faith.</hi> If to the Jew, through his default, the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets be ſo obſcure: adde your infallible Key to open his heart to them, or them to it.

But for us to account ſuch as make profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, Inſidels, or ſuch as ſubſcribe to Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxal Doctrine, Hereticks, would be injurious and unlawfull: not becauſe the former Aſſertion indeſinitely taken is not warrantable; but becauſe no man can preciſely diſcern the Indentitie of inward Affection ſave he alone that knoweth the ſecrets of all hearts. <hi>Thus all the Blaſts of vain Doctrine they can oppoſe unto the Truth we maintain, do in the iſſue faſten the roots of Faith once rightly planted, howſoever they may ſhake the timerous or faint-hearted Chriſtian, or cauſe the weak in Faith, not cleaving to Scripture as their onely infallible Rule, and ſure Supporter, dangerouſly to reel and ſtagger.</hi> But though they fall, yet Gods Word ſhall never fail to approve it ſelf a moſt perfect Rule, beſides others, in theſe <hi>Two reſpects:</hi> Firſt, <hi>in that none can fail in that courſe which it preſcribes, or fall away from Faith, but by ſuch means as the Jew hath done,</hi> the true Cauſes of whoſe Apoſtacie, and incredulitie it hath expreſly foretold, and fully regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to Poſterity: Secondly, <hi>becauſe ſuch as it doth not, no other Rule, Means, or Authority poſsible either in the earth, or in the region below the earth, ſhall ever win to true Chriſtian Faith.</hi>

Though ſo they had done the Biſhops of Rome, or any others then living, not diſdaining to call God his Lord: their practiſe had not ſeemed ſtrange to this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father: for he knew the Servant was not above his Maſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not expect his or any mans ſhould be free from any ſuch wrong or violence which he ſaw offered to Gods Word.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Our Saviour in the fore-cited Controverſies ſaw well how earneſtly the Jews were ſet to pervert Scriptures for their purpoſe, how glad to find any pretence out of them either to juſtifie their diſlike of his Doctrine, or wreak their malice upon his Perſon. Reaſon he had as great to diſtaſt their practiſe herein as the Pope himſelf can have to inveigh againſt Hereticks for the like. Neither is there any perſon now living, againſt whom any intention of Harm can be more heinous then the intention of Murther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, nor any ſort of men (unleſſe the Jeſuites, Spaniſh Inquiſitors, or ſuch as they ſuborn) ſo cruelly bent as theſe Jews were, to ſeek blood under a ſhew of love to pure immaculate Religion. Yet doth not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our accuſe the Scriptures (though capable of ſo grievous and dangerous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction) of Obſcurity or Difficultie, or of being any way the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jewiſh Hereſie, or his perſecution thence cauſed: nor doth he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thoſe very men, which had thence ſucked this poiſonous Doctrine, much leſſe others from reading, but exhorts them in truth and deed, not in word and fancie onely, to relie on Scriptures as the Rule of Salvation. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think, (and that rightly) to have Eternall Life, Joh</hi> 5. 9. Not intimating the leaſt neceſſity of any external Authority infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly to direct them, he plainly teacheth it was the internal diſtorture of their proud affections, which had diſproportioned their minds to this ſtraight Rule, and diſinabled them for attaining true Belief, which never can be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed but by this ſquare and line.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 <hi>It was not then the reading of Scriptures which cauſed them miſtake their meaning and perſecute Him, but the not reading of them as they ſhould.</hi> Erre they did, not knowing the Scriptures, and know them they did not, becauſe they

did not read them thorowly, ſincerely, ſearching out their inward Meaning. And thus to read them afreſh, as our Saviour preſcribed them, (laying aſide ambitious deſires) was the onelie Remedie for to cure that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which they had incurred by reading them amiſſe. It were a mad kind of counſel (better befitting a Witch or cunning woman, then a wiſe man) to diſſwade one from vſing Medicines preſcribed him by men of ſkill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had incurred ſome dangerous diſeaſe, by taking the like out of his own humour, or in a fancie either without or contrary to the preſcript of profeſſed Phyſitians: yet ſuch and no better our Adverſaries advice heretofore hath been: and the ſtrength of all their Arguments in the Point now in hand to this day continues this: <hi>We muſt not make Scriptures the Rule of Faith, becauſe many Hereſies have ſprung thence, and great Diſſenſions grown in the Church, whiles one follows one Sence, and another the contrary.</hi> Whereas in truth the only Antidote againſt Contentions, Schiſmes, and Hereſies, is to read them attentively, and with ſuch preparation as they preſcribe; as <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 26.</note> not to be <hi>deſirous of vain glory, not to provoke or envie one another:</hi>

Thus no one tittle of our Adverſaries Objections <hi>(how the learned ſhould be ſure of their interpretations, when others as learned as they are as ſtrongly perſwaded to the contrary)</hi> but is as directly oppoſite unto the Certainty of true Prophets Revelations; ſeeing many, yea moſt of that Profeſſion, and (in the judgement of man) men of better gifts and places then ſuch as proved true Prophets, were otherwiſe perſwaded; uſually ſuch as the people eſteemed beſt, ſtrangelieſt deluded.</p>

by the ſame Means, diſtinguiſh the Word of God (being in like ſort read, or expounded or preached unto them) from the Word of Man? The Word remains ſtil the ſame; the Truth of it better confirmed unto the World, by the continuance of it in power and ſtrength throughout all Ages intermediate, wherein Gods Spirit (by which it was firſt manifeſted to the Prophets, and written in the Peoples hearts) hath been more plentiful then before, eſpecially ſince the Revelation of the Goſpel; moſt plentiful in this preſent (if I may ſo ſpeak) the ſecond time of Grace. Our Argument then ſtands good <hi>(A fortiori)</hi> If every private man amongſt GODS People of Old might and ought Believe, and believing Obey, his Word revealed to others, only read or expounded unto him, rejecting all contrary or erroneous Doctrines; the People of this Age muſt do the like: and all Objections poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible againſt the judgement of modern private Spirits, conclude as much againſt all private perſons of Ancient times: For, their Means of knowing the Prophets Illuminations or Viſions were ordinary; ſuch as we have now; liable to all exceptions that can be made againſt our knowledge or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the true Senſe of Scripture; But neither theirs nor our Imbecillity in knowing, or Facility of erring, was or is any juſt Exception why the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſhould not be a Rule to both.

Whether the Peoples diſtraction in following ſome one falſe Prophet, ſome another, feweſt of all, the true Prophets, moſt, their High-Prieſts and men in Authority; might exempt any from acknowledgement of ſuch Propheſies, as in the iſſue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Divine, for the Rule of their Belief? If that People, either upon the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Opinions, or the Authority of the Prieſts or others, might reject the Word of God, either preached unto them by the Prophets or read by others; or appeal from It to any viſible company of men; on whoſe decrees they might ſafely rely: then may the Romaniſts with ſome probability teach men to rely upon the decrees of their Church, for their infallible Rule, not upon Scriptures only. But if the People of thoſe times were bound to rely upon <hi>MOSES</hi> Law and the Prophets Writings, againſt all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, albeit joyntly conſpiring to teach them otherwiſe, though with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and pretences of <hi>Moſes</hi> Authority: then much more muſt theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

                        <p n="1">1 LEt it be granted, that many Places of great Moment are diverſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by learned men: what will hence follow? That not the greateſt Schollars in reformed Churches can be as ſure of their true Senſe and Meaning, as the Pope? Not, unleſſe you firſt can make it evident, that Learning or Subtility of wit is the only Means, whereby the true ſenſe of Scriptures can be found out. And this being proved; you muſt aſſure us that the Pope is alwayes better learned then others; otherwiſe he may fail as wel as they. Or if you admit not Learning for the only Means of diſtinguiſhing Doctrines, as indeed it is not; yet muſt you ſecure the world, that the Pope hath all thoſe other good Qualifications, whoſe want cauſed the learned to erre. Or if you require neither one nor other of theſe, you muſt prove that the beſt Gifts of God, the peculiar Attribute of whoſe Glory, is, <hi>to be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons)</hi> are infallibly entailed to a certain ſucceſſion of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reſpect of Learning, Wit, or Honeſty. Laſtly you muſt prove that the Holy Ghoſt was a Private Spirit, and might erre, when he ſaid, <hi>The Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Grace to the Humble,</hi> Or, <hi>the Law of the Lord, Wiſdom unto the Simple:</hi> And that our Saviours words, <hi>Ventus ſpirat ubi vult,</hi> did not import, (as he meant) that his Spirit might enlighten whom he pleaſed: For if all theſe and that <hi>Deus cujus vult miſeretur,</hi> be true; who can hinder Him or His Spirit to open the eyes of ſome leſs learned, to behold clearly the true Senſe and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Scripture, wherein many excellent Writers have either erred or
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57235:159"/>
been overſeen? or who can hinder God (if theſe places be true) to reveal his Will to little ones, and keep it ſecret from the wiſe, and mighty, becauſe it is his pleaſure ſo to do? and that for this end, that men ſhould learn to rely upon his Mercy, and Providence; not upon the Authority or Skill of Men. Or who can hinder his Omnipotency even in this Age to make his Power ſeen in our Weakneſſe? If this his Power be not limited now: then may he ſtil both reveal the true Senſe and Meaning of his Word in ſome points, unto men of leſſe Capacity in others; and furniſh them with ability too, for demonſtrating by Evidence of Argument, and ſureſt Grounds of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unto others, that this ſenſe muſt needs be the true ſenſe, and that all other Interpretations given of the ſame places, by men otherwiſe excellent for their Learning and Skill in Scripture, cannot ſtand with thoſe Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, which all ſorts of Believers ſtedfaſtly Believe. Muſt ſuch a man, or thoſe to whom God reveals the Truth by his Miniſtry, doubt of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth revealed, and miſtruſt Gods Word; becauſe others as learned, or more learned then either he that hath the Truth revealed unto him firſt, or they that take it from him, are of another mind? He muſt veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this Objection. For a Jeſuite would ſay, Why ſhould he not think others as likely to have the Spirit, as himſelf? Let him eſteem of them, as far better Scholars and men indued with as great, or greater Meaſure of Gods Spirit then himſelf; for ſo the Scripture teacheth us not to be wiſe in our own conceipt, <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>but to think better of others then of our ſelves.</hi> And again, <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 32.</note>

                        <p n="2">2 And yet both theſe Rules concern the greateſt Scholars, and moſt ſkilful Interpreters in ſome degree, as well as the meaneſt. For none is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely good, none ſo far exceeds another; but in part may be exceeded by him. Nor doth this Chriſtian Modeſty, which the Scripture thus teacheth, bind any Chriſtian ſoul, or ingenuous mind, to ſuch abſolute ſervility, as the Objection muſt inforce upon all, if it prove ought: For there is no ingenuous man, eſpecially of meaner gifts, but will in heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience acknowledge many, both Ancient and modern, for far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Scholars then himſelf: and yet be fully perſwaded in Conſcience, that in ſundry particulars he hath the Truth on his ſide which they oppugne; and the true ſenſe of Gods Spirit in ſome points wherein they have erred, or were ignorant. For neither wil an indefinite Propoſition, in matters whoſe revelation depends upon the free Wil and Liberty of Gods Spirit, and are in reſpect of us contingent, infer every particular: nor will one or ſew particulars in any point infer an Univerſal Propoſition, or ſuch as we call <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ut plurimum</hi> true for the moſt part. Now to ſay &amp; believe, that ſuch a man is a better Scholar and of far more excellent gifts, is but indefinite, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, for the extent of his Scholarſhip, or gifts beyond mine: Wherefore it wil not hence follow, that he is a better Scholar, or interpreter in this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he be ſo in many, or in moſt other particulars; much leſſe will it follow, that I am a better Scholar or interpreter then he, becauſe I am better ſeen in this one, or few particulars. The Conſequence, or Corollary of which two Aſſertions, is again as evident: <hi>[I may without breach of Modeſty think I have the Truth on my ſide in ſundry particulars, againſt him that is far better ſeen in Scriptures, and other Sciences, then my ſelf.]</hi> For albeit he were much better ſeen in both then he is: yet are his gifts meaſured as well as mine; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God hath given him a greater meaſure of ſuch gifts, then me. Wherefore, as I would willingly yield unto him in infinite others; ſo may I ſafely diſſent from him in this or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

ſmall meaſure of Gods gifts upon me; without any juſt cenſure of Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or breach of Modeſty, for entring the liſts of Compariſon with him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely. For now we are to be compared but in this one, or few Caſes; not according to the whole meaſure of Gods gifts in us; which I acknowledge far greater in him, and reverence him as my Superiour for them. And as I acknowledge him abſolutely for my better, ſo is he in theſe particulars, in ſome ſort, to yield Superiority unto me. Chriſtian Modeſty teacheth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man not to be haſty, or raſh, in gain-ſaying the Doctrine of the Ancient or other men of Worth; but rather binds him to diligence in examination of the Truth, to uſe deliberation in gain-ſaying the Opinions of men better learned then himſelf. But Chriſtianity it ſelf binds all Chriſtians, not to believe mens Authority againſt their own Conſciences; nor to admit of their Doctrines for Rules of Faith, be they never ſo excellent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they can diſcern them to be the Doctrine of that great Prophet. <hi>Cui DEUS non admetitur Spiritum: He</hi> cannot fail in any thing, and whatſoever He ſaith, or what his SPIRIT ſhall witneſſe to my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to have proceeded from <hi>Him,</hi> I am bound to Believe. But for men to whom God gives his Spirit but in meaſure, albeit in great meaſure, becauſe I cannot know the particulars unto which it extends, I neither may abſolutely refuſe, nor abſolutely admit their doctrines for true, until I ſee perfectly, how they agree with, or diſagree from his Doctrine, of whoſe Fulneſſe we have all received. And even the Truth of their Writings, to whom he hath given his gifts in great meaſure, I am to examin, by their Conſonancy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſmall meaſure of his undoubted gifts in my ſelf, ſo far as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf or others committed to my charge. And in the confidence of Gods Promiſes, for the increaſe of Faith and Grace, to all ſuch as uſe them aright, every Chriſtian in ſobriety of ſpirit may by the Principles of Faith, planted by Gods ſinger in his heart, examin the Sentences, and Decrees of the wiſeſt men on earth: to approve them, if he can diſcern them for true; to confute them, if falſe; to ſuſpend his judgement, and limit the terms of his diſobedience unto them, if doubtful; and finally to admit or reject them, according to the degrees of their Probability or Improbability, which he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſober, diligent, and unpartial ſearch directed and continued in reverence of Gods Word, and ſincere love of Truth, ſhall find in them.</p>

And if men generally ſhould have no other Ground but mans Authority, or Believe this or that to be the Meaning of Scripture becauſe ſuch a man or companie of men doth tell him ſo: beſides his wronging of Gods Spirit herein, he ſhould alſo wrong many other men, oft-times far better learned, and ſkilfull in Scriptures, more dear in the ſight of God, and better acquainted with his Spirit, then are they, on whoſe Authoritie he relies. Every one to whom God hath given a wiſe heart, and Power in Scripture, might juſtlie challenge him of Partialitie and Diſobedience, in not giving as much to his Authoritie, as to the former. But as the Truth, revealed unto him by the meaneſt of Gods Servants, binds his Conſcience to Believe it: ſo the Varietie of other mens Opinions, (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, the Authors and Favourers of them never ſo well learned, never ſo ſtiff and confident in maintaining them,) ought to be no Motive, either to diſſwade him from aſſenting unto the Truth known, or to diſcourage him in the induſtrious and ſober ſearch of it, by ſuch good Means as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his Calling. For there hath been as great Varietie of Opinions in other Sciences and Faculties, as in Divinitie: yet no later Jeſuite, nor other learned Papiſts, that I have read or heard of, for theſe diverſe hundred years, have ſought to prove, that no man can be certain he knows any thing, becauſe many think they know that which they do not. Or if any Jeſuite will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and revive the old Academicks Opinion, <hi>[That there can be no certainty of any thing, but onely an Opinion:]</hi> our Univerſities ſhall be ready to anſwer him, albeit hereby they ſhould diſenable their ſuppoſed infallible Rule as much as ours. In the mean time, holding <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Doctrine, about the certaintie of Sciences for true, they anſwer themſelves in all they can Object againſt us in this Point. For they neither denie a Certaintie in ſecular Arts, becauſe many erre: nor do they perſwade young ſtudents in their Schools, to give over their ſtudious and induſtrious ſearching into ſpeculative Sciences, becauſe many have taken much pains in them to little purpoſe: Nor do they hold it ſufficient for good ſcholars in ſuch matters, to relie wholly on other mens judgements, without any triall of Concluſions, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of Arguments, according to the Principles of thoſe Sciences which they have profeſſed. In a word, the Varietie of Opinions hath not yet occaſioned them to create a <hi>Pope of Arts,</hi> and ſecular ſciences, albeit ſuch a Creature were (by their Arguments) much more neceſſarie, or (at leaſt) leſſe harmefull in thoſe Faculties, then in matters of Religion. For in them we have no promiſe for the aſſiſtance of a ſecret Teacher, the true Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator of our ſouls, whoſe Authority is as infallible, as the Spirit of Truth. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> takes it for an infallible token that there is a Certaintie to be had in Sciences, becauſe all men think themſelves certain in their Perſwaſions of things that may be known: as well thoſe that know not the Truth, but onely think they know it, as thoſe that know it indeed. If <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (which the Jeſuites ſo acknowledge,) be good: then is their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this Cauſe moſt abſurd. Many men (ſay they) perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they know the right ſenſe of ſundry places in Scripture, when they do not, therefore no man, no private man, no man but the Pope, <hi>(qui neque Deus eſt neque homo,)</hi> by any ſearch or induſtrie, can be ſure that he hath it.

And even theſe your Foxes in this our Land, howſoever, for this publick Miſchief againſt us, and the intended Combuſtion of our Church, their Tails were tied together by your Churches knot; have yet whet their cankred Teeth as eagerly, and opened their venemous Mouthes as bitterly one againſt another, as any (but they) could have done either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us or any creatures living. But to leave private diſſentions amongſt your ſelves; your Church prohibiting men the ingenuous ſearch of Scriptures and free profeſſion of their Conſcience, tying them to ſubmit their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all adventure unto the corrupt Doctrine of your Clergie: hath ſet open a wide gap to ſuch groſſe Opinions, and monſtrous Hereſies, as no man, vnleſſe his judgement had been ſurpriſed by your pretended Authority, or

Such as held a kind of Purgatorie, or third Place after this life, Evangelical Counſels, Invocation of Saints, or the like, becauſe they thought the Scripture taught them, were deceived in theſe particular Scriptures, but yet reſerved their faithful Allegiance to Gods Word in general. Nay, even thoſe particular Errours and miſtakings of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57235:166"/>
ſenſe of Scriptures, were witneſſes and pledges of their Obedience unto the Scripture, or Word of God; when they therefore Believed them, becauſe they were immediately perſwaded in Conſcience that the Scriptures (the Rule of their Conſcience) did teach them. But while you hold the ſame O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, not becauſe you are perſwaded in Conſcience (immediately ruled by Scripture) that they are contained in Scripture, but becauſe the Church, which as ye ſuppoſe cannot erre, doth teach them; or to ſpeak more plainly, whiles you your ſelves either Believe, or teach others to Believe them or the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures concerning them; becauſe the Church, whoſe Authoritie in this and all other Caſes you acknowledge for the infallible Rule of your Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you ſo to do: you hereby openly renounce your own, and ſollicit the the people to alienate their Allegiance from God and his Word: and the paſſing over, or yielding up of ſtedfaſt and abſolute Aſſent unto any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Point in your Religion, upon theſe Grounds, is as evident a witneſſe of high Treaſon, committed againſt GOD by the partie thus believing; a ſwearing of that Fealtie, or Allegiance to a pretended Vicegerent, or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is only due to the Prince himſelf, would be in a natural and ſworn ſubject. Wherefore the ſuppoſed <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your Church is no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Means of taking up all Controverſies, if your meaning be in the former ſenſe propoſed. For <hi>it is ſo far from taking up all, that it puts an Impoſibility of having any betwixt you and as taken up,</hi> unleſſe you abjure <hi>it</hi> quite; for it makes all the reſt of your Opinions deadly, to ſuch as ſtedfaſtly Believe it, or for it, them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Your meaning then muſt be; <hi>That this Infallibility of your Church would be an excellent Means for taking up all Controverſies, if all men would ſubſcribe</hi> unto it.

And they that labour for ſuch an Union in points of Faith and Salvation, do in effect ſolicite the whole Chriſtian world to run hand in hand, but head-long, into open Inſidelitie, leſt perhaps by breaking companies, ſome might ſlide into Schiſms and Hereſies.

Falſhood? And yet might we, with more ſafety, delegate greater Authority in theſe caſes to every one, then we may to any living in matters of Faith and Religion; over which, or over our ſelves in reſpect of which we have no lawful Power or Authority. For this, and other Reaſons, ſhould we be more afraid to ſubſcribe unto any mortal mans Authority, as unto a Judge moſt abſolute and infallible, whoſe decrees we may not reſiſt, from whoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence we may not appeal in matters of Faith: then to refer our ſeves wholly unto the ſole Judgement of the meereſt natural Fool living, in matters of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Learning and natural Knowledge. For, (beſides the danger hence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewing to our ſelves) GOD our Creator, Chriſt our Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit our Comforter and Inſtructer, have far greater intereſt in our Souls and Conſciences, then either <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or any other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pher, or Philoſophie it ſelf hath in our Opinions, or Perſwaſions.</p>

                           <p>That the final Trial of this Controverſie muſt be by Scriptures: That the Jeſuites and modern Papiſts fierce oppugning all certainty of private Spirits in diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Divine Truth of Scriptures, or their true Senſe, hath made the Church their Mother utterly uncapable of any plea by Scriptures, for eſtabliſhing her pretended Infallibility.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 BUt what Chriſtian heart could have ſuſpected, that any man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the infinite Majeſtie of an Omnipotent God, filling every place with his Preſence, ruling all things by his Power, and having every leaſt Creature of the World a world of Witneſſes of his inconceivable Wiſdome, and unſpeakable Providence over the Works of his own Hand; durſt once have preſumed to think, much leſſe have opened his mouth to utter, leaſt of all have imployed his pen to proclaim, ſuch foul Impietie to the world; as that a Power ſo infinite, could not ſufficiently provide for his Church in deciding matters of Faith, (ſurpaſſing all reach of Reaſon) unleſſe he had ordained ſome one Supream Tribunal Seat on earth; the Judges whereof ſhould be but mortal men, whoſe Bodies can be but in one place at once, whoſe Voices cannot reach without the precincts of their Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; whereas the Law of this our God, (unto whoſe ſentence in matters of Faith we appeal) is, or might be (but for theſe our Antiſcripturian Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſares importunitie) every where throughout the Chriſtian World diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and, beſides the external helps of an ordinary Miniſterie or Magiſtracie: (alike common to all Nations) the Holy Spirit is every where aſſiſtant to all ſuch as ſeek him in the written Word by him revealed; whoſe live-cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are as the prints or footſteps of his wonted Motions in Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Apoſtles hearts, by which the faithful may diſcern his approach or Preſence in their own.

                           </note> They generally hold, <hi>That this Infallibilitie of the Viſible Church conſiſts directly in this; That the Holy Ghoſt is infalliblie preſent to it, and gives it the true Senſe and Meaning of Scriptures: which he doth not give to private perſons; whom in their judgements, he will not vouchſafe immediately to inſtruct;</hi> ſo that his Dictates already revealed cannot be a Rule unto them, becauſe they want his infallible Aſſiſtance for their Expoſition; and for the ſame reaſon, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they cannot be without the Churches Authority that they underſtand the Scripture aright.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 This their Aſſertion being two-fold, (for their Churches infallible Expoſitions, and againſt all private Interpretations,) is grounded upon theſe two Principles. <hi>They are to be Believed in expoſition of Scriptures</hi> fide divina, <hi>whom the Holy Ghoſt infallibly aſsiſts. They are not ſo to be Believed, whom the Holy Ghoſt doth not ſo aſsiſt.</hi> Whence what he ſaid before will follow, that no man, beſides the Pope, may believe his own interpretations of Scriptures: His, or the Churches, all muſt, nay all men muſt believe <hi>fide divina,</hi> that the Church or Pope is in all Determinations infalliblie aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt. For if we were not bound to Believe their Infallibilitie moſt infallibly, it could be no Rule of Faith, but might be rejected till we ſee it evidently proved; whereas they contend it ſhould be the Rule of Faith unto all, and by their own confeſſion <hi>a main Article of their Creed:</hi> but (according to their Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as we ſhall hereafter prove) <hi>the onely Article of Chriſtian Faith.</hi> How de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute theſe their Aſſertions are of all Grounds of Reaſon, or Rules of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath been made evident.

That no Argument can be drawn from <hi>Scripture</hi> to their ſuccour, albeit the later Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites have earneſtly ſought to ſcrape a many (for better then Scrapings are not the very beſt they bring) we are now to prove.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 That our Belief of Scriptures Truth, and their true Senſe (by what Means ſoever we attain thereto) muſt be infallible, Both agree: The Means that muſt infalliblie aſcertain or prove their Divine Truth and true Meaning unto us (ſay our Adverſaries) is the Churches Infallibilitie, which likewiſe muſt be infallibly Beleeved; otherwiſe it could not be the Rule of Faith, or Belief infallible. It ſhall ſuffice here (once for all) to admoniſh the Reader, That as often as we mention <hi>Belief of Scriptures</hi> or <hi>the Churches infallibility,</hi> in this Diſpute, we mean not any kind of Belief, but that only which is <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> ſo likewiſe, whiles we mention the Means or Proofs of either, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand onely Means or Proofs <hi>infallible,</hi> whereon Faith may immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relie, as upon a Rule moſt ſure and certain.

Secondly, if the former Aſſertion be true: then neither can the Scriptures prove the Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> nor the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57235:171"/>
Churches <hi>Infallibility</hi> prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God unto any Believer. For all Means or Arguments of Proof, ſuppoſe a Prioritie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Parties unto whom proof is to be made. And to ſay, that of two things, both Believed and known together without any Priority, the one might prove the other, were as much, as if we ſhould ſay, that a thing might prove it ſelf, and as we ſay in Schools to prove <hi>idem per idem.</hi> For <hi>the very Reaſon why we cannot prove</hi> idem per idem, <hi>is, becauſe there is no Priority of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſuch Identitie:</hi> for otherwiſe, <hi>where the thing proving, and the thing proved, are indeed the ſelf ſame, yet if there be a Priority of Conceits or Notions in the ſame thing, one of them will ſufficiently prove the other;</hi> as is evident in the Divine Attributes, none of which are indeed really diſtinct from others, and yet may one of them prove another, becauſe in reſpect of us, one of them is better known then another, and conſequently being known may prove the other. But of ſuch Attributes as are neither better known then other, or where the termes are onely diverſe, without Priority of Conceit or knowledge, there can be no proving of the one by the other. For all diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knowledge, (ſuch as is all knowledge by way of Proof or Syllogiſm,) muſt be <hi>ex praeexiſtente cognitione:</hi> And where one thing is proved by another, that which proveth muſt firſt be Believed; for the Belief of the other muſt ſpring or ariſe from the Belief of it. If a man ſhould go about to prove that the Prince was ſumptuouſly arrayed, becauſe he was ſumptuouſly apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or attired, the Proof would be ridiculous: ſeeing ſumptuous apparrel, and ſumptuous array in common ſpeech are all one, and he that knows the one, knows or believes the other. But if a man ſhould ſay, the Prince was ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly apparrelled, becauſe he wore a ſute of Tiſſue, or beſet with Pearl, the Proof were good, ſo it could be proved that he wore ſuch a ſute. For it is ſufficiently known to all, that ſuch Attire is ſumptuous: and therefore he that can make proof that he was ſo attired, hath ſufficiently proved that he was ſumptuouſly arrayed. And thus, would our Adverſaries admit, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scriptures were better known then the <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> of the Church; or the Churches <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> better known then they; the one of them might be brought to prove the other, without any fault in the manner or form of Proof; howſoever their Aſſertions in the Proof of either would overthrow either their own Poſitions, or the Principles of Faith, as appeareth in the two former parts of our Diviſion. But according to our Suppoſition in the third member, to wit, <hi>[That the Churches Infallibilitie, and the Infallibilitie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are both alike known unto us, and neither Believed before other,]</hi> the very manner, or forme of proving one by the other, would be as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abſurd, as if a man ſhould prove coſtly apparrel by ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous array: Or that one was coſtly apparrelled, becauſe he wore coſtly raiment.</p>

If thus he ſhould doubt, and yet finally reſt content with this or like ſuggeſtion; why? doth not he ſay they are his true Letters, whoſe Fidelity and Integritie the King in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters commends? no man in the world (I think) of any ordinary experience, although he had never traverſt the Schools to know the meaning of a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proof, but could perceive this reſolution to be but <hi>dolus circulatorius:</hi> and he that would be cozened with this or the like, by any Traveller of what faſhion ſoever, may eaſily be circumvented by any domeſtick Pedlar, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumforaneal Copeſ-mate. Yet is this reſolution in every point the ſelf ſame with <hi>Valentians</hi> reſolution, concerning the Roman Churches Infallibility; and the Exception which here he brings, why this reſolution of his is none, may altogether as directly and fitly be brought to ſhew, that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57235:173"/>
reſolution is no circular reſolution. Firſt, let us parallel the ſeveral parts of both reſolutions. In that reſolution of Faith which <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentian</hi> brings, All Chriſtians Believe, that whatſoever God ſaith is true; and ſo in this other reſolution it is ſuppoſed that his Majeſtie or any of his States-men firmly Believes, that whatſoever the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> writes or avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in matters of this nature, (as of civil Integritie, and Sufficiency for the diſcharge of ſuch an Office) is altogether true, and may not be ſuſpected: yet may they ſuſpect whether he wrote thus much in this mans commendations, as theſe Letters import, or no. And ſo ſaith <hi>Valentian,</hi> and other Papiſts, all Chriſtians may ſuſpect, (certain they cannot be) whether God wrote thoſe looks which we call Scripture or no. The Aſſurance which Chriſtians in matters concerning Faith, and States-men in this preſent caſe could have for their ſecurity, is altogether the ſame. For the States-man hath no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perſwade himſelf, that theſe are the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Letters, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Report, Aſſeveration, or Teſtimony of this Meſſenger, whoſe prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they concern. And ſo likewiſe by the Papiſts Poſitions, no private Chriſtian can have any other certain Aſſurance, that theſe Scriptures are the Word of God, but only the Teſtimonie or Confirmation of the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, whoſe ſtate and dignity they likewiſe ſeek to maintain by countenance of the Scriptures, whoſe miſ-interpretation did either firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, or not hinder her riſing to that height of temporal Dignity which ſhe now enjoyes. Thus finally it appears that all the reaſon or ground of Belief, which any Papiſt following the Jeſuites for their Inſtructors can have, muſt be the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Romiſh Church, whoſe <hi>Infallibility</hi> therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved out of Scripture, becauſe the Scriptures by their Poſitions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be infallibly proved to be Scriptures, or that authentick Word which only can afford ſure Proof in matters of Faith, but by this their Churches ſuppoſed Authority. As for <hi>Valentians</hi> Exception, concerning the divers Object of the Churches Propoſal, and the Divine Revelations by it propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the ſelf ſame Diverſity of Object may be obſerved in the former inſtance of the counterfeit Meſſenger, whoſe reſolution in effect is thus; You muſt Believe theſe Letters, becauſe I commend them unto you in the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> name, and you muſt Believe me in commending them unto you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whoſe words you truſt in them, commends my truſt and ſidelity. To apply <hi>Valentians</hi> Exception to this reſolution; As the Object of that the Church propoſeth, or rather of the Churches Propoſal, is the Divine Revelation: ſo likewiſe is the Object of this counterfeits Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal the often mentioned Kings ſuppoſed commendation of him.

For by their Poſitions we cannot aſſure our ſelves, that the Scriptures are the Word of God, by any other cauſe or reaſon, beſides the Churches Authoritie: and therefore by their Doctrine, the infallible Authoritie of their Church is the only Cauſe, why we Believe this Sacred Canon of Scriptures, which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, to be Divine Revelations, although it be no Cauſe by their Doctrine, why we Believe that in general Divine Revelations are true.

They wholly permit the Keyes of the Well of Life to ones mans hands; who, for his own advantage, we may be ſure, will lock it up ſo cloſe, as none ſhall look upon it but with Spectacles of his making.

Somewhat notwithſtanding, to my apprehenſion, <hi>I</hi> had obſerved, whereby Artiſts more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, but younger Divines then my ſelf (whoſe furtherance in the like, throughout all my meditations I ſtill reſpect) might be directed, for taking ſure hold of their ſlipperie <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> in this conflict: and finding my ſelf every day then other more unapt, more unwilling at leaſt, to be any Actor in quarrels of this nature, becauſe moſt deſirous to ſpend my mortal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in opening the pleaſant Fountains of immortalitie; <hi>I</hi> thought it not altogether unlawfull to diſpence with theſe labours for a while, in hope to proſecute them more ſafely and with better ſucceſſe hereafter, by ſeconding ſuch as had gone before me with my ſmall ſtrength, for intercepting theſe deſpitefull <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> which continually labour to damme up theſe ſacred Wels of Life. Many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wits and grave Divines, as well in our Engliſh as other reformed Churches, I knew, had accurately deciphered the ſpecial characters of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated moſt properties of great <hi>Antichriſt</hi> upon the <hi>Pope.</hi> But that the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Charter</hi> of the Romiſh Church, or the Commiſſion pretended by <hi>Jeſuites</hi> for the erection of it, ſhould (as the manner was to demoliſh leſſer religious houſes for building others more magnificent) extend to raze the very firſt foundations of Religion as common to Chriſtians, Jews, and Turks; <hi>that the acknowledgement of ſuch infallibilitie as they Deifie her with ſhould be more incompatible with Chriſtianitie then any Idolatry of the Heathen;</hi> that ſuch as abſolutely believe all her decrees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, truely believe no article of this <hi>Creed;</hi> with the like principal branches of Antichriſtianiſme; were points, for ought I knew, rather touched by the way, or propoſed as clear in themſelves to the indifferent and ingenuous, that judge of the Romiſh Church by the known picture of her miſſe-ſhapen lims, then proſecuted at large, or with purpoſe to pull off that artificial painting, where-with late Jeſuites have ſo beautified this uglie Monſters face, that the World bewitched with gazing too much on it cannot but love her other deformities though in themſelves moſt loathſome. For though the practiſes enjoyned by her be ſo vile, as would have cauſed Rome Heathen to have bluſhed at their menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or her other doctrines ſo palpably groſſe, that her own Sons heretofore have derided them, and as yet ſpare to ſpeak ought in particular for their defence: yet to ſalve all this it muſt ſuffice, that the Church, which cannot erre, hath now au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized them.</p>
                  <p>If any think I prejudice the truth of moderate accuſations, by laying ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie imputations upon this doctrine, as make it incomparably more deteſtable then any other, he ſpeaks not inconſequently to his poſitions, if he hold the <hi>Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> was infallibly aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, or that the Pope in <hi>Cathedral</hi> reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot erre. But he which thinks foul impieties may bring Romiſh Prelates out of favour with the Spirit of Truth, and make them as obnoxious to errors as others are, or can perſwade himſelf, that many practiſes and opinions, by that Church already authorized, are in their nature abominable and impious, muſt either accord to me or diſſent from Reaſon, Conſcience and Religion. For theſe, ſo be will but vouchſafe his ſilence or attention, joyntly proclaim aloud, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:57235:182"/>
amiſſe, either in matter of doctrine or manners, can be ſo deteſtable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this preſumptuous / groundleſſe warrant of abſolute infallibilitie, as with it; that albeit a man would ſet himſelf to practize all particulars directly contrary to what God hath commanded, or to contradict God and his goodneſſe, yet his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity without this abſolute belief of full authority derived from <hi>him</hi> ſo to do, would be but as a body without a ſoul, in reſpect of the Romiſh Churches impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, which makes the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the principal Author of Gods written Word, the abettor of all her fraud, untruths, or villanies. Briefly, as it is not the doing of thoſe materials God commands us to do, but faithfull ſubmiſſion of our Wils to his in doing them, which (as S. <hi>James</hi> inſtructs us) makes us true Chriſtians: ſo is it not the doing or maintaining of what God forbids or hates, but the doing of it upon abſolute ſubmiſſion of our ſouls and conſciences to other lawes then he hath left, which makes men live members of Antichriſt, as being animated, informed and moved by the ſpirit of errour. Now this perſwaſion of abſolute infallibility and univerſall warrant from the Holy Spirit, without condition or reſtraint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peculiar to the Romiſh Church, admitting it to be as faulty in practiſes and as obnoxious to errors as any other, none can be reputed ſo truely Antichriſtian as it. For albeit <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretended divine revelations, yet his <hi>Prieſts</hi> challenge no ſuch abſolute infallibility as doth the Pope; they make no ſecond <hi>Rocks,</hi> or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no ordinary Paſtor equivalent to their great <hi>Prophet.</hi> Whence although the Turks hold opinions in themſelves, or materially conſidered, more groſſe, and maintain ſome practices not much leſſe villanous then Jeſuites do: yet the grounds or motives of their belief, (which are as the ſoul or ſpirit of Religion) are nothing ſo peſtiferous, nothing ſo directly oppoſite to the Holy Spirit, as is this Jeſuiticall rule of faith. Nor do they either profeſſe ſuch belief in Chriſt, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for a foundation ſo elect and precious, as brings them within the Temple of God, within which unleſſe Antichriſt ſit, his contrariety unto Chriſt could not be ſo eſſential, ſo immediate or direct, as by the rules of ſacred Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie we are taught it muſt be. Yet I know not, whether the indignity of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is more apt to affect Divines and Men rightly religious and fearing God, then the ſottiſhneſſe of their arguments to perſwade it, to provoke the juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ingenuous Artiſts, which cannot endure, though in matters of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, to captivate their underſtandings to poſitions devoid of ſenſe. To require ſome probabilitie of reaſon, civil or natural, is on their part no inſolent demand, for exchange of Chriſtian faith or adventuring their inaſſurance of life eternal in the ſervice of meer forrainers whom they never ſaw. Yet unto peremptory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions no leſſe dangerous, do Jeſuites ſolicit us, not onely without any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhew of probabilitie, but quite contrary to Gods principal lawes, and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notions of good and evil; as by theſe labours every Academick may in part perceive, but more fully, if he would vouchſafe to lift more of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, then in theſe ſhort tranſeurſive diſputes I could. Nor would I diſſwade any Artiſt well grounded in <hi>Ariſlotle</hi> from peruſing the moſt learned works any ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt hath written in this argument In moſt other controverſies betwixt us and them it is dangerous, I muſt confeſſe, even for well grounded Artiſts to begin with their writings, not ſo in this:
<hi>For I proteſt in the ſight of God and his holy Angels, that as farre as I can remember the inclinations of my youth, or by them prognoſt eate how afterward, I might have been affected, I never was, I never ſhould have been ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed with ſuch great diſlike of Romiſh Antichriſtianiſme in this point, by hearing the moſt famous Preachers in this Land, or reading all the Learned Writers in Reforme, Churches, as I was by examining the labours of</hi> Bellarmin, Valentian, <hi>and others of beſt note amongst them ſeriouſly addreſſed to this purpoſe;</hi> comparing them onely with the known Principles of Chriſtianity and ſuch paſſages of ſacred Writ, as every
<pb facs="tcp:57235:182"/>
Chriſtian Artiſt ſhould be acquainted with. For the principles whereon I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I have been onely beholden to the Canon of Scriptures, for deducing of ſuch blaſphemous conſequences from them, as I charge the adverſary with, onely to that ſmall meaſure of knowledge in Ariſtotelian Philoſophy where-with my God hath bleſſed me, whiles I was bound by local ſtatutes to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Arts, purpoſely abſtaining from other writings, which with their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of my underſtanding might have bred prejudice in my affection. Since that time, although the years of my Miniſtry hardly exceed the ſpace of ordinary apprentiſhips, yet have I often wiſhed the diſcuſſion of theſe points had been then impoſed upon me by ſome experienced Divine, that would onely have given me right hold of their aſſertions. Upon this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>I would beſeech the flouriſhing Artiſts of theſe famous</hi> Academies, <hi>whom God hath furniſhed with all ſtore of munition neceſſary for this ſervice, not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect opportunities preſent.</hi> Let them defer (if ſo they pleaſe) the fruits of their labours in other points (though this be the fault of our Engliſh) until the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> of their age. But the mark <hi>I</hi> now propoſe unto them, being the evident reſolution of Jeſuitical Poſitions into thoſe groſs and palpable blaſphemies whereto they tend, which they onely ſeek to hide by Sophiſmes and artificial tricks of wit, Academical wits might diſplume them of theſe figtree-leaves, &amp; manifeſt their nakedneſs to the world, much better in the ſpring whiles their ſkill in arts were freſh and flouriſhing, whiles the ſtrength and vigour of their invention would more eaſily bend this way, then in the <hi>Autumn,</hi> when their leaves begin to fade and their ſap retire to the root, as their pleaſant grapes grow ripe. Many towardly plants in this nurcery, now able to match the ſtouteſt Jeſuit living, at his own weapon, whileſt in his mature age, <hi>(multo jam fractus membra labore,</hi> more fit to be a leader, then a Combatant in theſe encounters) he ſhal look back on his former labours, or calls to mind his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dexterity in ſchool diſputes, may take up old <hi>Neſtors</hi> complaint.</p>

And for ſuch inſtruments of the Romiſh Church, as this land uſually yields, this wrangling faculty is all the ſkill they care for, or for the moſt part make profeſſion of. Yet ſuch is the brittleneſs of the matter they are to work upon in this controverſie, that were all the Prieſts and Jeſuits harbored within the confines of great <hi>Brittain</hi> at this preſent day, but enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write all they could to any purpoſe in defence of their Mother; ſome few Artiſts of thoſe Univerſities, which out of their pride they ſeem to vilifie amongſt the ignorant, would, I dare not ſay make them bluſh (for ſooner might they make a Black-moors face of the ſame colour with his teeth) but as many of their favourers of this Kingdom, as have not ſworn allegiance to the Church of Rome, and are able to examine an argument, to be aſhamed on their behalf, even to acknowledge, that for ought theſe Mountebanks could ſay or write in their defence, the Poſitions maintained by their <hi>Maſters,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Jeſuits, were indeed idolatrous and blaſphemous, howbeit the Church it ſelf, we muſt believe, could never be vanquiſhed, becauſe no man can tell where or in what ſhape to find it.</p>
                  <p>Nor need young Artiſts fear the countenance of antiquity in this point from which their enemies ſupplies are ſo ſlender, that would they come to open
<pb facs="tcp:57235:183"/>
tryal, and bring onely ſuch of the Fathers for the ſeconds, as lived within five hundred years of Chriſt, or before the mixture of Romiſh Religion with Heatheniſm, not fully effected till a little after that time: the paucity of thoſe whoſe aid they durſt ſolicit, in reſpect of that great army, which is as reſolute as we againſt them, would make them inſtantly either yield themſelves, or forſake the field. Nor have they been hitherto able to addreſs any anſwer, but to their ſhame, to the <hi>Worthies</hi> of the Engliſh Church, whoſe labours have made the conqueſt in this quarrel eaſie to any of their ſucceſſors, that will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to follow their ſteps. Nothing remains but what beſt becomes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of young wits; to exceed the ſophiſtical diſputes of Jeſuites againſt the truth, in copiouſnes of irrefragable demonſtrations, <hi>That the allegeance they ſeek to eſtabliſh unto the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church is ſolemn Apoſtaſie from Chriſt; that the belief of it, is the very Abſtract of Sorcery, the utmoſt degree of Antichriſtianiſm that can be expected.</hi> Theſe and like points, being fortified by ſtrength of argument in the time of your Regency or farewel to the ſtudy of Arts, might be poliſhed at your better leiſure, afterwards to be reviſed and publiſhed at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of authority. Or if the zeal of Gods glory thus mightily eelipſed by this foul idol of the Romiſh Church do not as yet ſo fully move you; yet that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation which firſt wrought a deſire in me of giving this onſet, ſhould work (me thinks) in every heart, that bears any ſparkle of love unto his native countrey. For what indignity is it to think, that whileſt our gracious Soveraign is a moſt zealous Profeſſor and Defendor of the truth we teach, ſo many of his natural ſubjects our countrimen &amp; brethren, ſhould be won unto the Romiſh faction, eſpecially by importunate inculcating <hi>two Hereſies,</hi> of all maintaind by that Church, in themſelves moſt ſottiſhly improbable; and yet apparently moſt damnably idolatrous in their conſequences, if erroneous: I mean <hi>This concerning their Churches abſolute priviledge from all error, and That other of Chriſts real preſence in the Sacrament, by Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> It cannot again but add much to our grief and indignation, if we call to mind, how, when the chief <hi>Governor</hi> and publick authority of this land were for them, ſubſcription was not urged upon ſuch violent and bloudy terms unto any articles of their Religion, as unto that of Real preſence. The myſtery of which iniquity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better be reſolved then into the powerful and deceitful working of Satan, thus delighting to deſpight our Lord and Saviour by ſeducing his profeſſed ſubjects unto the higheſt, and moſt deſperate kind of rebellion he could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, upon the leaſt occaſions and ſhalloweſt reaſons. For ſuch is their madneſs in that other point, as hath been ſhewed in this: Not one inconvenience they can object to our opinion, but may be demonſtrated againſt theirs; not any fruits of Godlineſs they can pretend, but our doctrine more directly brings forth then theirs could, though we did admit it for true. For to what other purpoſe ſuch a Preſence as they imagin ſhould ſerve them, ſave only to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thoſe deſperate idolatrous practices and Litourgies of Satan touched by the way in ſome parts of theſe diſcourſes, is inexplicable; as ſhall be ſhewed more at large (without depriving that heavenly myſtery of any ſolemnity or devotion due unto it) in the unfolding of that controverſie.</p>

For this is the very Abſtract, or abridgement of that infinite Prerogative, which ſhe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth; <hi>All man muſt infalliblie believe, That to be Gods Word which ſhe commends; That not to be His Word which ſhe diſclaims for ſuch.</hi> So as onely, the former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, and indeterminate truth <hi>[Whatſoever God ſaith is true]</hi> is exempt from the Popes unlimited, tranſcendent, royal ſentence; no other word, or ſyllable of truth, which we can imagine, God hath or might have ſpoken ſince the World began, either by his own or his Sons mouth, by the Miniſtery of his Angels, Prophets, Apoſtles or Evangeliſts; but is every way abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to the Popes Monarchical cenſure.</p>

3 How certain and unfallible Aſſent unto all, or any Scriptures, may be wrought in mens hearts, without any infallible teacher already hath been, and hereafter ſhal be (God willing) in more particular ſort exemplified. In this place, it ſtood the Jeſuite upon, to have given a better ſolution to the doubt objected; which he is ſo far from unlooſing, that he rather knits it faſter; as ſhal appear, if the Reader wil firſt cal to mind; That for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of firm and undoubted aſſent to any truth propoſed, it ſkils not how infallible the truth in it ſelf or the propoſer be, unleſſe they, whoſe Relief or Aſſent is demanded, be as infallibly perſwaded of this <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the truth, or the propoſer. In this reſpect, our adverſaries plead their immunity from errour, as an Article neceſſary to be infallibly Believed, for confirmation of Gods Word, alwayes moſt infallible (as all grant) in it ſelf, but not ſo (as they affirm) to us, until it be avouched by Infallible authority.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Herein they concur with us, Both with the truth; That if, we believe it only as <hi>probable,</hi> that God ſpake all thoſe words, which we acknowledge to be moſt <hi>infallible,</hi> becauſe his; our belief notwithſtanding is not <hi>infallible,</hi> but <hi>probable</hi> or conjectural.

It is not therefore the <hi>ſuppoſed Infallibility</hi> of the Church or Pope, howſoever, but <hi>infallibly apprehended</hi> and believed that muſt ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, which otherwiſe (as is pretended) would be but conjectural. And by the former principle, (acknowledged as wel by them as us) it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows, that if we be only <hi>probably,</hi> not <hi>infallibly perſwaded,</hi> the Pope or Church cannot erre; our aſſent unto the <hi>minor propoſition.</hi> i. <hi>[unto any determinate part of Gods Word,] is only probable not Infallible.</hi> For, by the Jeſuites Doctrine, <hi>we cannot be certainly perſwaded, that God ſpake this, or that, but by the Churches teſtimony.</hi> The immediate <hi>conſequence</hi> of which two aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, compared together, <hi>is, we cannot be more certain that God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this or that then we are of the Churches Infallibility.

Seeing then they muſt of neceſſity grant (for this is the principal mark they aim at) that all muſt infallibly believe the Church hath a publick ſpirit: the difficulty removes to this point, how this infallible perſwaſion is, or may be wrought in them. Either it muſt be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scriptures, or not: avouched unto them and wrought in their hearts it muſt be, either by a publick or private ſpirit. Let us examin all the parts of this diviſion.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Firſt, if private mens infallible perſwaſion of the Churches publick, or Authentick ſpirit, be not grounded upon Scriptures acknowledged by us and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57235:190"/>
them: the Churches Authority without all controverſie, is much greater then the authority of Scriptures; if it, by this aſſertion, can be any, and the Churches not all in all. For unto that which men cannot know, whether it be true or falſe, they cannot be bound to yield abſolute or immediate obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: unto that authority, which they abſolutely believe as infallible, they are bound to yield infallible aſſent, and abſolute obedience directly, in it ſelf and for it ſelf. But by this ſuppoſition men cannot know Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly without the Churches authority, and yet they muſt infallibly believe the Churches authority without Scriptures; The Scriptures authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is either leſſe then the Churches, or none at all.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 But be it ſuppoſed that private mens infallible Belief of the Churches publick ſpirit is grounded upon Scriptures, acknowledged by us and urged by them to this purpoſe, as upon theſe, it <hi>ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt and us; I have prayed for thee thy faith ſhould not fail:</hi> The queſtion whereunto we demand an anſwer, is, whether this infallible Belief of the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority grounded upon theſe places, muſt be wrought in mens hearts by a private or publick ſpirit. If by a private ſpirit only <hi>Bellarmin</hi> believed the Churches publick ſpirit, or thoſe Scriptures truth, or true meaning, whereon he grounds it: He, and all other Papiſts (ſuch as he was when he delivered this Doctrine) neither Biſhops nor Cardinals, are ſubject to the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which he hath condemned us for, as Hereticks. For all private ſpirits, by his poſitions are abnoxious to errour, unſufficient to plant any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible perſwaſion in matters of faith; yet ſuch is this article of the Churches Authentick ſpirit, of which unleſſe men be ſo perſwaded, infallibly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they cannot be of the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition in any Syllogiſm; wherein a point of faith is concluded: and uncertain of the minor, they cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the concluſion, which, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> rightly obſerves, alwayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the weaker part. The infallible concluſion therefore of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, is; unleſſe private men may have publick ſpirits to warrant the truth of Scriptures, and the Churches infallibility thereon grounded; they cannot truely believe any concluſion of faith. It remains then we inquire; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience wil follow, if they admit private men to be partakers of publick ſpirits.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Diverſity of ſuch ſpirits they acknowledge not. If therefore private mens <hi>Infallible Aſſent</hi> unto the truth, or true ſenſe of thoſe particular Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures whence they ſeek to prove their Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> muſt be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a publick ſpirit, planted it muſt be by the ſame ſpirit, which guides, and guiding makes the Church and Pope authentick and infallible, both in their propoſal of Scriptures and declaration of Scriptures ſence. Seeing this ſpirit is one and the ſame, if it can make the Church or Pope infallible in all: why may it not make all private men (by this ſuppoſition partakers of it) alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, at the leaſt in the right underſtanding of thoſe places, which warrant the Churches <hi>Infallibility</hi> or publick ſpirit. For our adverſaries, I hope, wil eaſily grant, that the Churches publick and Authentick ſpirit muſt be moſt infallibly Believed, becauſe ſo expreſly taught in thoſe Scriptures cited by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to this purpoſe. If this publick or Authentick ſpirit, can work ſuch infallible apprehenſion of thoſe places true meaning in private hearts, why not in all others as neceſſary for them to know; that is, in all neceſſary to ſalvation? And if thus it do, why are we bound to believe the Pope, more then the Pope us, we being partakers of a publick and infallible ſpirit as wel as he?</p>

Wherefore his authority muſt be unto us altogether as great, as the authority of the Godhead is unto him; which is far greater unto him, then it is or can be to any others; for even that which is acknowledged for Gods Word, both by him and us, muſt be leſſe authentick unto us then the words of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 For though we pardon our adverſaries their former abſurdities, in ſeeking to prove the Churches authority by the Scripture, and the Scriptures by the Churches; though we grant them all they can deſire (even what ſhal appear in due place to be moſt falſe) That, whiles they believe the Popes particular injunctions, or deciſions, from a preſuppoſal of his univerſal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent authority, they do not only believe him, or his words, but thoſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57235:191"/>
parts of Gods Word, upon which they ſeem to ground his infallibility: yet our former argument holds ſtil moſt firm; becauſe that abſolute Aſſent, which private men muſt give unto the ſuppoſed grounds of their Religion, before other portions of Scripture, is not grounded upon any preheminencie incident to theſe words as they are Gods, as if they were more his then the reſt, in ſome ſuch <hi>peculiar ſort,</hi> as the Ten Commandments are in reſpect of other <hi>Moſaical</hi> Laws; nor from any <hi>internal propriety</hi> flowing from the words themſelves, as if their ſecret character did unto faithful minds, bewray them to be more divine then others; nor from any <hi>precedent, conſequent, or comitant circumſtance,</hi> probably arguing that ſence, the Romiſh Church gives of them, to be of it ſelf more perſpicuous or credible, then the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meaning of moſt other Scriptures, all inſpired by one and the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, all, for their form, of equal authority and perſpicuitie. All the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative then, which theſe paſſages can have before others, muſt be <hi>from the matter contained in them;</hi> and that, by our adverſaries poſition, is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Wherefore, not becauſe they are Gods word, or were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his Spirit, in more extraordinary ſort then others; but becauſe they have more affinity with the Roman Lord, in late years exalted above all that is called God, Father, Son, or Holy Ghoſt: theſe places above cited, muſt be more authentickly believed, then all the words of God beſides. As I have read of pictures, though not more artificial in themſelves, yet held in greater eſtimation amongſt the Heathen, and freer from contemptuous cenſure then any other of the ſame Painters doing, only becauſe they repreſented their great God <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12 Another difficultie, whereunto we demand an anſwer is, whether, whiles they aſſent, as they profeſſe, not only to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> taught (as they ſuppoſe) in the fore-cited places, but alſo unto the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which teach it: they acknowledge two diſtinct aſſents, or but one. If but one, let them ſhew us how poſſibly the Church can be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Scriptures: if two, let them aſſign the ſeveral properties of either; whether is more ſtrong; whether muſt be to the other as <hi>Peter</hi> to his brethren; or if neither of them can confirm the other, let them declare how the one can be imagined as a mean or condition of believing the other.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 An Hereticks <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Minor propoſition</hi> in the former <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmin)</hi> is but weak: A Romaniſts <hi>Belief</hi> of the ſame moſt ſtrong. Let this be the <hi>Minor.</hi> Peter <hi>feed my ſheep, or</hi> Peter <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith ſhould not fail:</hi> what reaſon can be imagined, why a Romaniſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> ſhould be ſo ſtrong, and ours ſo weak? The one hath the Churches Authority to confirm his Faith, the other hath not. What is it then to have the Churches Authority, only to know her Decrees concerning thoſe portions of Scriptures? If this were all, we know the Romiſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Decrees as wel as the Romaniſts: but it is nothing to know them, if we do not acknowledge them. To have the Churches Authority then is, to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it as <hi>Infallible:</hi> and for this reaſon is a Roman Catholicks Belief of any portion of Scripture, more certain and ſtrong, becauſe he hath the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Church, which he Believes to be moſt <hi>Infallible:</hi> and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it moſt infallibly he muſt of neceſſity Believe, that to be Scripture, that in every place, to be the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, which this Church commends unto him for ſuch. Let the moſt learned of our adverſaries here reſolve the doubt propoſed; whether there be two diſtinct aſſents, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the forementioned propoſitions: one unto the truth of the <hi>propoſition
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57235:192"/>
itſelf,</hi> and another unto the <hi>Churches infallibility.</hi> It is evident by <hi>Bellarmins</hi> opinion, that all the certainty a Roman Catholick hath above a Sectary, is from the Churches <hi>Infallibility.</hi> For the propoſition it ſelf he can believe no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then an Heretick may, unleſſe he better believe the Church, <hi>i. e</hi> believe, the Churches expoſition of it, or the Churches infallibility concerning it, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the propoſition it ſelf in it ſelf and for it ſelf. And ſo it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Churches authority is greater, becauſe it muſt be better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 Suppoſe then one of our Church, which believes theſe propoſitions to be the word of God, ſhould turn Roman Catholick, his former belief is by this means become more ſtrong and certain. This granted, the next queſtion is, what ſhould be the Object of this his ſtrong Belief; the propoſitions belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>Peter feed my ſheep, I have prayed for thee:</hi> or anyother part of Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word; or the Churches authority; not the propoſitions themſelves, but only <hi>by accident,</hi> in as much as the Church confirms them to him. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame man ſhould eſtſoones, either altogether revolt from that Church, or doubt of her authority, his belief of the former propoſitions becomes hereby as weak as it was before: which plainly evinceth, that his belief of the Church and this propoſition, were two diſtinct Beliefs, and that this ſtrong Belief was faſtened unto the Churches authority, not unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it ſelf immediately, but only <hi>by accident,</hi> in as much as the Church which he believeth ſo firmly, did teach it; for his Belief, if faſtened upon the propoſition it ſelf, after doubt moved of the Churches authority, would have continued the ſame, but now (by <hi>Bellarmins</hi> aſſertion) as ſoon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to diſclaim his belief of the Churches infallibility, his former ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the ſuppoſed propoſition begins to fail, and of this failing no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then already is, can be aſſigned. The reaſon was, becauſe the true, direct, and proper object of his ſtrong belief was the Churches authority, on which the belief of the propoſition did intirely depend, as the concluſion doth upon the premiſſes, or rather as every particular doth on the univerſal, whereunto it is eſſentially ſubordinate.</p>

                     <p>IF we rack the former ſyllogiſm a little farther, and ſtretch it out in every joynt to its ful length: we may quickly make it confeſſe our propoſed concluſion and ſomewhat more. The Syllogiſm was thus, <hi>What ſoever God hath ſpoken is moſt true. But God hath ſpoken, and cauſed to be written all thoſe words contained in the Canon of Scriptures, acknowledged by oppoſite religions of theſe times. Therefore theſe words are moſt true.</hi> The certainty of the <hi>Minor</hi> depends, as our adverſaries wil have it, upon the preſent Romiſh Churches <hi>Inſallibility,</hi> which hath commended unto us theſe Books for Gods Word. Be it then granted, for diſputations ſake, that we cannot know any part of Gods Word, much leſſe the juſt bounds, extent or limits of all his words ſuppoſed to be revealed for our good, but by the Romiſh Church: The Spiritual Senſe or true meaning of al, moſt, or many parts of theſe determinate Volums, and viſible Characters, as yet is undeterminate, and uncertain;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57235:192"/>
whereas all ponts of belief muſt be grounded on the determinate and certain ſence of ſome part of Gods Word revealed; for our adverſaries acknowledg all points of Faith ſhould be reſolved into the <hi>Firſt Truth.</hi> Hence, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to any particular or determinate concluſion of Faith, it muſt be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Syllogiſm, <hi>Whatſoever the Church teacheth concerning the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and true ſence of Scriptures, whereon points of Faith are grounded, is moſt tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>. But the Church teacheth thus and thus,</hi> (for example; That her own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is infallibly taught by the Holy Ghoſt in theſe words, <hi>Peter feed my ſheep.</hi> Peter <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith ſhould not fail)</hi> ergo, <hi>this ſence and meaning of theſe words is moſt true.</hi> And as true as it is, muſt the ſence likewiſe of every propoſition, or part of Scripture by this Church expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or declared, be accounted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Major propoſition of this Syllogiſm, is as undoubted amongſt the Roman Catholicks, as the Major of the former was unto all Chriſtians: but as yet, the Minor; <hi>The Church doth give this or that ſence of this or that determinate place,</hi> may be as uncertain indeed as they would make our belief unto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor propoſition in the general Syllogiſm, before it be confirmed by the Churches authority. For how can we be certain that the Church doth teach al thoſe particulars which the Jeſuites propoſe unto us? we have Books indeed, which go under the name of the Trent Councel, but how ſhall we know that this Councel was lawfully aſſembled, that ſome Canons have not been foiſted in by private Spirits, that the Councel left not ſome unwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for explicating their decrees, after another faſhion then the Jeſuites do? who ſhall aſſure us in theſe or like doubts? The preſent Church? All of us cannot repair to <hi>Rome:</hi> ſuch as can, when they come thither, cannot be ſure to hear the true Church ſpeak <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> If the Pope ſend his Writs to aſſure us, what Critick ſo cunning as to aſſure us, whether they be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick or counterfeit? Finally, for all that can be imagined in this caſe, only the Major of the Catholick ſyllogiſm, indefinitely taken, is certain; and conſequently no particular or definite concluſion of Faith, can be certain to a Romaniſt, becauſe there are no poſſible means of aſcertaining the Minor, <hi>[What the true Church doth infallibly define]</hi> unto his Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Or if they wil hold ſuch concluſions, as are ordinarily gathered from <note place="margin">Wherein the Papiſts make the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority greater then Gods.</note> the Trent Councel, or the Popes deciſions, as infallible points of faith: they make their authority to be far greater then the infallibility of Gods written word; yea more infallible then the Deity. This Collection they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, unleſſe it followed from their own premiſſes; Theſe for example, <hi>That a concluſion of faith cannot be gathered, unleſs the minor (God did ſay this or that determinately) be firſt made certain. But from the Pope or Churches infallibility, concluſions of faith may be gathered, albeit the minor be not certain de Fide.</hi> For who can make a Jeſuites report of the Popes Decrees, or an Hiſtorical relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Trent Councel, certain <hi>de fide,</hi> as certain as an Article of faith: And yet the Doctrine of the Trent Councel, and Popes Decrees, muſt be held <hi>de fide,</hi> upon pain of damnation, albeit men take them only from a Prieſts mouth or upon a Jeſuites faith and credit.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 This is the madneſſe of that Antichriſtian Synagogue, that acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods Word for moſt infallible, (and the Scriptures, which we have, for his word, if it ſelf be infallible. For it tels us, they are ſuch:) yet wil not have collections, or concluſions with equal probability deduced thence, ſo firmly believed by private men, as the collections or concluſions, which are gathered from the Churches Infallibility. An implicit faith of particulars, grounded upon the Churches general infallibility, ſo men ſtedfaſtly believe it,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57235:193"/>
may ſuffice. But implicit faith of particulars, grounded only upon our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Belief of Gods infallibility, providence, or written word, ſufficeth not. This proves the authority of the Church, to be above the athority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or the <hi>Deity, abſolutely conſidered,</hi> not only <hi>in reſpect of us.</hi> [that is all beſides the Pope and his Cardinals.] For that is of more authority <hi>abſolutely,</hi> not only <hi>in reſpect of us,</hi> which upon equal notice or knowledge, is to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter believed, more eſteemed, or obeyed; but ſuch is the authority of the Church in reſpect of the divine authority; ſuch is the authority of the Popes Decrees in reſpect of Gods Word. For the Minor propoſition in both the former Syllogiſms being alike uncertain; the concluſion muſt be more certain in that Syllogiſm, whoſe major relies upon the Popes infallibility then in the other, whoſe Major was grounded upon the infallibility of the <hi>Deity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 Briefly, to collect the ſum of all; The authority of the Church is greater then the authority of Scriptures, both in reſpect of Faith, and Chriſtian Obedience. In reſpect of Faith; becauſe we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Churches deciſions read or explicated unto us, <hi>(by the Popes meſſenger though a Sir John Lack-latin)</hi> without any appeal: but no part of Scripture, acknowledged by us and them, we may believe, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, or ſubmiſſion of our interpretation to the Church, albeit the true ſence and meaning of it ſeem never ſo plain, unto private conſciences in whom Gods Spirit worketh Faith. The ſame argument is moſt firm and evident, in reſpect of Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 That authority over us is alwayes greateſt, unto which we are to yield moſt immediate, moſt ſtrict and abſolute obedience: but by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Churches Doctrine, we are to yield ſupream, and moſt abſolute obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the Church; more ſupream and abſolute then unto Gods word: therefore the authority of the Church is greater over us. The Major is out of controverſie, ſeeing greatneſſe of authority is alwayes meaſured by the manner of obedience due unto it. The Minor is as evident from the former reaſon; Our obedience is more abſolute and ſtrict unto that authority, from which in no caſe we may appeal, then unto that from which we may in many ſafely appeal: but, by the Romiſh Churches doctrine, there lies alwayes an appeal from that ſence and meaning of Scriptures, which Gods ſpirit and our own conſcience gives us, unto the Churches authority; none, from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches authority or meaning unto the Scriptures, or our own conſciences.</p>

6 This is a point (as is elſewhere obſerved) wherein Satan ſeemeth to triumph over the modern Papiſts, more then over all the Heathens of the old World, whoſe ſenſes only he deluded, or bewitched their reaſon, but quite inverts all uſe of theſe mens ſenſe, faith, and reaſon, making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſts body to be preſent in the Sacrament, after a ſuppoſed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner, quite contrary to the known nature of bodies, and yet more prepoſterouſly contrary to the very end and eſſence of miracles.

For, as the Ancient Fathers have obſerved, our Saviour Chriſt did in his Inſtitution exhibit that unto us ſenſibly which before he had promiſed as inviſible, ſo that the precept of eating Chriſts bodie, and drinking his blood ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally doth bind all capable of this Sacrament as ſtrictly, as that other of eating his bodie and drinking his blood Spiritually: ſeeing this latter is the ſeal and aſſurance of the other. And as our Adverſaries acknowledge an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of Precept, for eating Chriſt Sacramentally and Spiritually, though that Precept concern not Infants: ſo in all reaſon they ſhould grant an equall neceſſity of Precept, for eating his fleſh and blood diſtinctly in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though this be not neceſſary to all men, at all times, if without neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or contempt they cannot be partakers of both. For impoſſibilitie, upon what occaſion ſoever, not cauſed through their own default, exempts them from that generall Precept of eating Chriſt under both kinds; as want of yeers, or diſcretion, doth children from any injunction, divine, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane of communicating ſo much as in one kind.

That part, which the Councels of Conſtance and Trent, upon pretences of reverence to the Lords Supper, have detained from Modern Chriſtians, the Corinthians had received unworthily; yet was not the Cup, for this reaſon, held ſuperfluous by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who onely ſought to repreſſe the abuſe, as knowing the uſe of it to be moſt neceſſarie. The matters then he meant to order, when he came, was, to ſet out this Heavenly banquet with greater decencie and ſolemnitie, not to abridge them, of any ſubſtantial or material part thereof.</p>

For they (deſirous as it ſeems to make the whole Chriſtian World as ſottiſh, as themſelves were impious) would make men believe, they could juggle away the Cup, and never touch the very ſubſtance of the Sacrament; as if the wine were not as ſubſtantial a part of the Lords Supper, as was his blood of his bodie, or humanitie. An integral or material part they cannot denie it to be; and ſuch if it be, there Apologie is as ſhameleſſe, as if a man ſhould let out moſt of anothers blood, cut off his arm, or leg, or maim him in ſome principal part, and plead for himſelf, I did not meddle with his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, meaning (as the Councel I take it here doth) his Eſſence, ſeeing he is yet as truly a reaſonable Creature, as before.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 But to debar them of that refuge, it may be they ſought or their <note place="margin">That the Cup is an eſſential and ſubſtantial part of the Euchariſt.</note> followers may yet hope to find in the equivocation of this word, <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> importing as much ſometimes as a material, or integral, ſometimes as an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part. If the Cup be an eſſential and ſubſtantial part of this Sacrament, the Councel by their own confeſſion did foully erre, in prohibiting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under both kinds: If no ſuch part it be, they might by their own rule have altogether denied the uſe of it ſo much as to the ſacrificer, or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: but ſo the very uſe and end, on which the eſſence of the Sacrament, (as of all other matters of moral practiſe) immediately depends, and by whoſe expiration inſtantly moſt determine, ſhould utterly have periſhed. The end and uſe of this ſacred Inſtitution, as our Saviour expreſſely teacheth, and the Councel grants, was to repreſent the <hi>Teſtators Death,</hi> yea ſo to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it, as we might be partakers of his bodie and blood, not ſpiritually one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but withall, (as the Trent Fathers contend) Sacramentally. Admitting then all they can pretend againſt the neceſſity of the Cup [That whole Chriſt were in the Bread alone;] yet this will not preſerve the true and fruitfull uſe of the Sacrament, nor ſalve that deadly wound, the eſſence of it muſt perforce receive from fruſtration of the end, neceſſarily enſuing the Cups

abſence. For this Sacrament was ordained, as to repreſent, ſo to exhibit Chriſts body, unto all faithful Communicants, not as intire, and whole; his bloud, not as it was incloſed in the veines: but the one, as torne and rent, the other, as ſhed and powred out upon the croſſe. <hi>This is my bloud of the new Teſtament,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>which is ſhed for many,</hi> (for all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it faithfully) <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins. His Bloud then, as ſhed and powred out, is as the loadſtar of penitent and contrite hearts,</hi> whereon the eyes of their faith, that ſeek remiſſion of ſins in this Sacrament, muſt be faſtened: for (as the ‖ Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſion.</hi> This was the complement of that ineſtimable all-ſufficient Sacrifice, that which repreſents <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> his precious bloud thus poured out, the principal part of this Sacrament, as wel in reſpect of repreſenting his death, as in applying remiſſion of ſins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in general purchaſed, and by this Sacramental Type ſealed to every one in particular; eſpecially if the Trent Councels Doctrine be true, that Chriſts very bloud, which was ſhed upon the croſſe, is really preſent in the Chalice, and might be as immediately ſprinkled at leaſt upon the lips or doors of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithful receivers heart, as the bloud of the Paſchal Lamb was upon the door-poſts of the Iſraelites. Thus as Satan the <hi>Father</hi> of lies, ſo falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuggeſted by him, draw men with pleaſure into thoſe evils, for whoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the end they become their chief accuſers.

Rather the proper effect they aimed at, was an extraordinary aſſiſtance in the practiſe of ſuch points, as already had been, or afterwards ſhould be revealed unto him.

That which had been defective in in himſelf. Was that his charity, his faith, or both? <hi>We read</hi> (ſaith Bellarmin) Peters <hi>charity did fail; that his faith did fail, we never read.</hi> In vain then doth <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> in vain do all his fellows labour, to prove our Saviour ſhould in theſe words ratifie a perpetually indeficient purity of Roman faith? for <hi>Peter</hi> was to repair in others what had been impaired in himſelf; to prevent, if it were poſſible, the like fall in ſuch as did, or to themſelves did ſeen to ſtand; to convert, reſtore and ſtrengthen ſuch, as in like, or worſe ſort had denied their Redeemer. With much greater probability might the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts ſeek to eſtabliſh a perpetual indeficient Chriſtian charity in <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, had <hi>Peters</hi> love, or charity only failed. But the bad lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Roman Clergie, would give too manifeſt evidence againſt them in this attemp: In this reſpect have theſe ſtout challengers taken upon them the defence, of a never-failing faith, becauſe not ſo eaſily confuted. For, it is a matter very hard (I muſt confeſſe) to prove, That faith can never fail, which may deny Chriſt, ſo formally and conſtantly as <hi>Peters</hi> did, without defect. The beſt is, that by their own confeſſion this place can prove, the acts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Roman faith to be no better, then S. <hi>Peters</hi> was in this denial of Chriſt. His offence, they grant, was foul, but his faith without defect. So may Popes be monſtrouſly luxurious in their lives, but alwayes infallible in their Doctrine. Reader, conſult with thine own heart, and give ſentence (as in the ſight of God) of the whole frame of their Religion, by the foundation: and of the foundation (ſuch as they willingly acknowledge faith to be of all true Religion and every Chriſtian vertue) by <hi>Bellarmins</hi> teſtimony. If <hi>Peter</hi> became (as they pretend) the <hi>Fundamental Rock,</hi> by confeſſing: that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doubtleſſe, which hath no better ground of infallibility, then <hi>Peters</hi> Faith not ſecured from a threefold denial of Chriſt, was firſt planted by the Spirit of Error, and of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Not to diſpute any longer, what it was, but who they were S. <hi>Peter</hi> was to ſtrengthen: all without exception? This juſtly may ſeem impoſſible, ſeeing the exerciſe of his Miniſtery could not extend to all Nations, much leſſe unto all ages. Yet theſe words bequeath no hereditary royal juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over all perſons, but rather injoyn perſonal acts of penitency unto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> for his former perſonal offence. He had found extraordinary mercy at his Lord and Maſters hands; and was to communicate the like unto his fellow ſervants more guilty of his offence. Chriſt after his faith had fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did convert and ſtrengthen him againſt the like temptation; and he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, was commanded to convert and ſtrengthen others. Whom? Not ſuch as by converſion might become his brethren, or rather his children in Chriſt; but rather ſuch, as were hewn out of the ſame rock, and could truly call <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, <hi>Sarah</hi> their Mother, joint profeſſors with him of

But the reprovers reply hath made the Apologie (better then which no Jeſuite can make for the Pope) moſt ridiculous ever ſince.

If many, ſometimes Popes, be now in hell (as no Jeſuite I think, will profeſſe any morall hope that all are ſaved:) What is become of the Church repreſentative, which lodged in their brains? Hath the number of glorified Saints been encreaſed by their departure from earth? Were they ever a whit more happie for being heirs to that glorious Promiſe; <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church?</hi> Or were their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that place Orthodoxal?

But now that the glory and dignity of the Romiſh Church is become ſo great, and the Ieſuites portion thereby grown ſo fat; they can be well content to ſooth up the Pope in this conceit, that howſoever his perſon may go to hell (a place it ſeems not much dreaded becauſe unknown) yet hell gates ſhall never prevail againſt his faith; which hath brought ſuch large poſſeſſions to the Church; both which he may infallibly entail to his ſucceſſors untill the worlds end.

                        <p>In what ſenſe the Jeſuites may truly deny they believe the words of man better then the words of God: In what ſenſe again our writers truly charge them with this blaſphemy.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 IF we review the former diſcourſe, we may find, that equivocation, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſought (as a knot in a bulruſh) in our writers objections, to be directly contained in their Churches denial of what was objected. Whileſt they deny that, they exalt the Churches authority above Scriptures, or mans word above Gods; this denial may have a double ſence. <hi>They may deny a plain and open profeſſion, or challenge of greater authority in their Church then in Scriptures:</hi> Or <hi>they may deny, that in effect and ſubſtance they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all authority of Scripture,</hi> ſave only ſo far as it makes for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the Pope ſhould openly profeſſe himſelf competitor with God, or, in expreſſe tearms, challenge greater authority then Scriptures have: <note place="margin">Antichrſt muſt not be a profeſſed or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemy but a ſecret under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of true Religion.</note> was never objected by any of our writers. For all of us know, <hi>the Man of Sin</hi> muſt be no open, or outward enemy to the Church, but <hi>Judas-</hi>like, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by profeſſion: his doctrine, indeed, muſt be a doctrine of devils, yet counterſeiting the voice of Angels; as he himſelf, though by internal diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind a ſlave to all manner of filthineſſe, and impurity, muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiled <hi>Sanctiſſimus Dominus,</hi> the moſt holy Lord. If the poiſon of his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were not wrapt up in the titles of divine myſteries, it would forth-with be diſliked by many ſilly ſuperſtitious ſouls, which daily ſuck their bane from it, becauſe perſwaded that the Scriptures (which they never have examined, whoſe true ſenſe they never taſted, but from ſome reliques of heatheniſh zeal, idolatrouſly worſhip in groſs) do fully warrant it. When our Writers therfore object, that the Papiſts exalt the Popes laws above Gods; (had not theſe holy Catholicks an eſpecial grace to grow deaf, as often as we charge their mother with ſuch notorious and known whoredomes, as they ſee might evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be proved unto the world, if they ſhould ſtand to conteſt with us) their meaning is plain; that the Pope, in deed, and iſſue, makes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, (which in ſhew he ſeems to reverence) of no authority, but only with reference to his own. That he, and his followers ſhould in words much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <note place="margin">The Pope and his followers have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to magnifie Chriſts autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in words or outward ſhew, for their own gain and glory could not otherwiſe be ſo great.</note> Gods word, written or unwritten, we do not marvel; becauſe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſteem men make of it, the higher ſtill he may exalt his throne, being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely enabled, by this device, to make all that belongs to God, his Word, his Laws, his Sacraments, the pretious Body and Bloud of his Son, bleſſed for ever, meer foot-ſtools to his ambition.

And (what is moſt villanous) unto whatſoever prerogatives, though moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the divine majeſty; his Paraſitical Canoniſts ſhal blaſphemouſly entitle this moſt holy Father, The Son of God, and his faithfulleſt ſervants, (Apoſtles or Prophets) muſt be brought forth to abet the forgery, as if

Yea, if it ſhould pleaſe his Holineſs to avoach <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> that theſe words, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melechiſedech,</hi> are truly and literally meant of himſelf as Chriſts Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That then he permits Chriſt the title of his ſoveraign Lord, and urges others to ſubſcribe unto his laws as moſt divine, is juſt, as if ſome Polititian ſhould ſolicit the whole body of a kingdom, ſolemnly to acknowledge one, othewiſe lawful heir unto the Crown, for their Monarch moſt omnipotent and abſolute, (whoſe wil once ſignified muſt be a law for ever inviolable, to all his ſubjects) not with intent that he ſhould in perſon retain ſuch perpetual ſoveraignty over them, but that he might have abſolute power to diſpoſe of his kingdom, as he pleaſed unto the worlds end; or to nominate others, as abſolute in his place, whileſt he ſpent his dayes as a ſojourner in a forrain land. Finally, not the moſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and deteſtable plot, the moſt wicked Pope that hath been, is or ſhall be, could deſire to effect, but may by this device be countenanced, with as great and ſacred authority, as were the beſt actions our Saviour ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took: which (as may better appear from what ſhall be ſaid in the next <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This is ſuſpitious indeed; but how ſhall I know whether the Popes Agent in doing this, do diſobey his Holineſſe? If he ſay no, muſt I not believe him? muſt I not obey him, and do as he doth, whom the Pope commands me to obey in all things? The Jeſuites are not ſo ſimple in the Popes cauſe, as they would make all other in Gods: they could tell how to limit ſuch commands, though delivered in moſt univerſal and ample termes.

But what though <hi>Moſes</hi> in the former part of this Chapter ſpeak of Idolaters, muſt this law therefore concern Idolaters. In the former part he ſpeaketh only of Idolaters, but this law is not only for them by <hi>Bellarmins</hi> confeſſion. Yet the circumſtances of the place, and the expreſſe law againſt Idolaters menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, evince, that in this Chapter, as in the former, he firſt ſets down laws concerning the true ſervice of God, and in the later part gives precepts for the obſervation of the ſecond Table, the maintaining of love, by the final compoſition of all controverſies that might ariſe betwixt neighbours. In the former law Idolaters are ſentenced to death, and Idolatry (ſaith <hi>Bellarmin)</hi> is a point of Religion; Was the Prieſt alone then to give ſentence, and the civil Magiſtrate only to execute it. There is not the leaſt pretence for it out of this Text. Any ordinary Magiſtrate might execute him that was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convicted of this crime, nor was it ſo hard a matter to judge, who was an Idolater amongſt the Jews, as it is to determin what is an Hereſie amongſt the Romaniſts. This was to be proved by witneſſes, not by Logical proof or
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57235:223"/>
force of ſpeculative reaſon: Had the cunningeſt Jeſuite in the world been taken amongſt them kneeling down before an Image and praying to it, all the diſtinctions in the Maſter of ſentences, or <hi>Aquinas,</hi> or both their Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors could not have redeemed him, againſt two honeſt men that had ſworn he had done thus much; there had been no appeal from any City in <hi>Judah,</hi> unto any higher Court; his doom had been read in the gates, and without them he ſhould (as <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaks) have put on a ſtony coat.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were only to execute the Prieſts definitive ſentence in all hard controverſies, is a poſition well deſerving execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appeal at Princes hands. And no doubt but it did ſo amongſt the Jews. The former Court, as is moſt probable, was to ceaſe, when they had a King amongſt them. And <hi>Moſes</hi> in the former Chapter, after he had given the other law for ending controverſies, gives the law for the election of their King, if ſo be they would have one: as if the former Court had then ceaſed to be the ſupream Tribunal; ſeeing all Subjects might appeal unto the King from it, in which this Soveraignty did before reſide, as being the ſupream Tribunal whence there could be no appeal.</p>

                     <p n="5">5 It may perhaps here be objected, that the King had no ſuch aſſurance of infallibility in judgement as the Prieſt had, and therefore it was requiſite he ſhould rely upon the Prieſts definitive ſentence.

                        <p>That our Saviour's injunction of obedience to the Scribes and Phariſees, though moſt univerſal for the form, is to be limited by the former Rules. That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out open blaſphemy it cannot be extended to countenance the Romiſh cauſe: that by it we may limit other places brought by them for the Popes tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent univerſal authority.</p>

                     <p>ANother place there is, which, as it ſeems hath been too much beaten heretofore, becauſe ſome of the cunningeſt Anglers for <hi>Peters</hi> tribute, begin of late to relinquiſh it.

It wil not therefore be amiſs, partly to prevent the poſſible danger of his concealed concluſion, by ſhewing the expreſſe folly of his premiſes; partly, to examin the place it ſelf, becauſe the evidence of it failing, wil be a preſumption againſt all they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of like kind, and may afford ſome farther light how we may reſtrain pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond, that in this Chapter he intended to reprehend the Scribes and Phariſees ſharply, and therefore it was expedient, he ſhould firſt commend them for ſome things, leſt all his reproofs might ſeem to proceed from paſſion, or want of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thus far <hi>Maldonat,</hi> unto whoſe anſwer we may adjoyn, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt (as <hi>Maldonat</hi> alſo well hath noted) did ſpeak theſe words unto ſuch as had ſeen his miracles, and heard his doctrine, and yet could not be his daily auditors with his other Diſciples: but were to repair to the Scribes and Phariſees, as unto their ordinary teachers, and inſtructers in the Law. Here, if we conſider the humour of rude and ignorant people (for ſuch may we ſuppoſe moſt of his auditors were as yet) it was very likely they would either be ſlow to hear, or ready to diſtaſt any doctrine that ſhould proceed from the Scribes and Phariſees mouthes, whom they had heard ſo much diſcommended by that bleſſed mouth, which ſpake as never mans did. For it is a work of great judgement, nay of the ſpirit over-ruling the fleſh, to make men reliſh their doctrine, whoſe lives and converſations they loath. And ſuch as are but ſchollars (though never ſo mean) to an excellent maſter, will uſually be puft up with a conceit of themſelves, from other mens conceit and commendations of him, and in this humour ſcorn to learn of any more meanly qualified, or of leſſe eſtimation in the ſame profeſſion. Again, there is a jealouſie in moſt illiterate minds, that their Preacher, if he follow not ſuch leſſons in his life, as he gives them, doth not teach them as they ſhould be taught, nor inſtruct them ſincerely as he thinks, but rather in policy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns them ſtrictneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>That juſtly it may be preſumed the Jewiſh Church, never had any abſolute infallibility in propoſing or determining Articles of faith, becauſe in our Saviours time it and ſo grievouſly erre in the fundamental point of ſalvation.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr proof of the Concluſion propoſed [that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had no ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute infallibilitie, as <hi>Rome</hi> pleads for,] I took it for a long time as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all, that if any ſuch authority had been eſtabliſhed in the Law, it ſhould not have varied untill the alteration of the Prieſthood. For Gods covenant with <hi>Levi</hi> was in this ſence everlaſting, that it was to endure without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, untill His ſacrifice was accompliſhed, that was a Prieſt after a more excellent order. His oblation of himſelf, was the common bond to the Law and Goſpel; the end of the one, and the beginning of the other. Nor did the Legal rites or ceremonies themſelves (though theſe moſt obnoxious to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) vaniſh by little and little, as this ſacrifice did approach neerer and neerer, as darkneſſe doth before the riſing of the Sun: rather that conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wrought upon the Croſſe, did ſwallow them up at once, as virility doth youth, youth childhood, childhood infancie. Seeing then our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſuppoſe this infallibilitie was annexed as a prerogative royall unto the Prieſthood: they cannot imagine any tolerable reaſon, why the one ſhould expire before the other was quite aboliſhed. Hence it is that moſt of them hold the Scribes and Phariſees in our Saviours time, were abſolutely infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Cathedrall conſultations.

Nor do you limit him any time, as wel in the afternoon, as in the forenoon; as wel (for ought we can gather) when drink is in, and his wits out of his head, as when he is ſober. For you hold it not neceſſary for him to uſe any long deliberation. But, if it be his wil to bind all Chriſtians to believe him, the whole Church muſt believe that he was herein directed by the Holy Ghoſt: for the Church is bound to hear their chief Paſtor: And, if he bind all men to believe him, then muſt all of neceſſity believe, that he was infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, in ſhewing that which he binds them to believe: for otherwiſe the whole Church might erre, nay were bound to erre, becauſe it is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Pope. Theſe conſequents are your own, not mine, as may in part appear from what hath been already, more fully from what ſhal be ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Beſides, the whole multitude of the Jewiſh people heard the Prieſts and Elders utter their opinions concerning Chriſt and his doctrine <hi>viva voce:</hi> we have the Popes decrees but by hear-ſay.

For all his wayes, to ſuch as mark them, are ever parallel to ſome one or other rule contained in this book of life. The Iſraelites in every age might have diſcerned the truth of his threats or promiſes, alwayes fulfilled according to the diverſity of their wayes, though thus much the beſt amongſt them would ſeldome have obſerved, perhaps not ſo much as once have compared their courſe of life, with either part of Gods covenant of life and death, unleſſe thus forewarned by their Anceſtors.

And no doubt, but the people did wel in admitting the true Prophets doctrine, before the falſe, at the firſt propoſal; the ſooner the better. But were they therefore to believe the true Prophets abſolutely without examination?

Even in buſineſſes of greateſt importance, though requiring ſpeedieſt expedition, a wiſe man will moderate his pace according to the quality of the ground whereon he goes, otherwiſe the more haſte may cauſe worſe ſpeed. The Jews were, as we are, bound to believe truths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed without delay: but, both for this reaſon moſt ſtrictly bound to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual uniformity of practiſing divine precepts already known, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with this or that particular, though offenſive to our preſent diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without indulgence to this or that ſpecial time, without all priviledge ſought from the pleaſure or diſpleaſure of men; Both bound, ſo to frame our lives and converſations, as to be inſtantly able to diſcern the truth propoſed, not by relying upon their authority that propoſe it, but for it ſelf, or from a full and lively, though a quick and ſpeedy apprehenſion of immediate homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal conſonancy between the external and the internal word. For if any part of Gods word truly dwel in us, though ſecret it may be and ſilent of it ſelf, yet wil it Eccho in our hearts, whilſt the like reverberates in our ears from the live-voice of the Miniſtery. Thus, had the Jews hearts been truly ſet to <hi>Moſes</hi> law, had their ſouls delighted in the practiſe of it as in their food, they had reſounded to the Prophets call, as a ſtring though untouched, and unable to begin motion of it ſelf, wil yet raiſe it ſelf to an uniſon voice, or as the fowls of heaven anſwer with like language to others of their own kind, that have better occaſion to begin the cry.

And becauſe the corruption of particular moral doctrines brought into the Church by humane tradition, would not ſuffer the generality of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets already believed to fructifie in his hearers hearts, and branch out uniformely into lively working faith: he laboured moſt to weed out Phariſaiſme from among the heavenly ſeed, as every one may ſee, that compares his Sermon upon the Mount, with the Phariſees gloſſes upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> If the particular, or principal parts of the Law and Prophets, had been as purely taught, or as clearly diſcerned, as the generall and common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: His Doctrine, that came not to deſtroy, but to fulfill the Law in words and works, had ſhined as brightly in his hearers hearts at the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, as the Sun did to their eyes at the firſt riſing.

For though Devils ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuffer themſelves to be commanded by men, neither of greateſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, beſt place, nor faſhion: yet this they do (as any wel inſtructed in Gods law, or illuminated with the notions of good and evil wil eaſily diſcern) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with purpoſe to bring men unto a perpetual acknowledgment of ſome divine power in them, or to performance of ſome Magical ſervice unto them; no otherwiſe then cheating mates or cunning gameſters can be wel content to ſuffer bunglers beat them the firſt or ſecond Set, in hope to entiſe them to hold play longer, or for greater wagers. On the contrary, the only Fee our Saviour demanded for all his admirable cures in this kind, was, the parties ſhould give ſuch glorie unto God alone, as that infernal crew moſt deteſted, but which the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo highly eſteemed by his calumniators, did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely require in defiance of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and all the powers of darkneſſe.

                     <argument>
                        <p>That the method uſed by the great Prophet himſelf after his reſurrection for plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, was ſuch as we teach: The exceſſe of Antichriſts exaltation above Chriſt: The Diametrical oppoſition betwixt the ſpirit of God, and the Spirit of the Papacy.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>MOſes</hi> was to be acknowledged a great Prophet, becauſe the whole hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> infallibly knew the Lord was with him in all he did; every Prophet after him to be known by the Rules which he had given, for their diſcernment; Chriſt Jeſus to be taken for The Great Prophet and Mediator of the everlaſting Covenant, becauſe in words, in works, in all his wayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwerable to Moſaical and prophetical Characters, of the Meſſiah that was to come. This ſweet Harmony of legal Types or ancient prophecies, as wel with the whole courſe of his bleſſed life, as with his ignominious and cruel death, or manner of his glorious reſurrection, I ſhould either have eſteemed or regarded leſſe, had not my Saviour himſelf preferred the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of prophetical teſtimonies before the certainty of their ſenſes that had converſed with him in their life time, admitted to conference with him after his riſing from the dead. For ſo we read of two Diſciples which had ſeen his miracles, heard his doctrine, and acknowledged <hi>him for a Prophet, mighty in word and deed:</hi> but yet diſtruſted the report of his reſurrection after it had been the ſecond time confirmed by ſuch of their fellows as had doubted with them: yea their Maſter himſelf had told them as much before his death. And had he not good reaſon then to upbraid them with diſtruſt, having now met them as live-like as they themſelves were? Was he to them <hi>a Prophet, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in word and deed:</hi> and yet not able to perform what he had conſtantly ſpoken? But what was the chief matter of their juſt reproof? That they had not believed his words, nor given due credence to his works? <hi>Dull,</hi> no doubt, they had been, in not eſteeming better of both; <hi>unwiſe,</hi> in not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of Him, that taught as never man taught: but (as in them he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us) <hi>moſt dul</hi> and <hi>moſt unwiſe,</hi> even <note n="‖" place="margin">Luk. 24. 25.</note>

2 You wil ſay perchance they did not wel in giving ſo little attention and credit to the Prophets, whoſe light ſhould have led them unto Chriſt: but now that they have light on him in perſon, without their help, only by his ſeeking them, ſhall not he who was the end and ſcope of all prophetical writings, teach them all? He will: but not by relying only upon his infallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This <hi>Edifice</hi> of Faith muſt be framed upon the Foundation laid by the Prophets. For this reaſon happily our Saviour would not bewray himſelf to be their infallible teacher, until he had made them by evidence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by true ſenſe and feeling of his ſpirit, believe and know the truth, which he taught, to be infallible. He had opened their hearts, by opening the Scriptures unto them, before their eyes were open to diſcern his perſon: for <note n="*" place="margin">Luk 24 27.</note> 
                        <hi>he began at</hi> Moſes <hi>and at all the Prophets, and interpreted unto them in all the Scriptures the things which were written of him.</hi> Stedfaſt Belief then of any mans authority, muſt ſpring out of the ſolid Experience of his ſkil, and truth of his doctrine.

                        <hi>their hearts aid burn within them, whiles he talked with them, and opened the Scriptures unto them.</hi> Though before they had received <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts witneſſe of the truth, as a Tie or Feſt to ſtay their fleeting Faith; <note n="‖" place="margin">Joh. 5. 32, 34</note>

                     <p n="3">3 Would the Pope who challengeth Chriſts place on earth amongſt his living members, and requires we ſhould believe his words, as wel as theſe Diſciples did Chriſts, but expound thoſe Scriptures unto us which Chriſt did to them, with like evidence and efficacy; could he make our hearts thus <hi>burn</hi> within, by opening the ſecret myſteries of our ſalvation: we would take him for Chriſts Vicar, and believe indeed he were infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit. But ſeeing he and his followers invert our Saviours method, by calling the certainty of both Teſtaments in queſtion, telling us we cannot know them to be Gods word unleſſe it ſhal pleaſe this Roman God to give his word for them, or confirm their truth; ſeeing this his pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is not by manifeſting the myſteries of our ſalvation ſo diſtinctly and clearly as Chriſt did unto theſe Diſciples, nor by affording us the true ſenſe and feeling of the ſpirit, in ſuch ardent manner as they enjoyed it, and yet accurſeth us if we believe not his words as wel as they did their Redeemers: we may hence take a perfect meaſure of that <note n="‖" place="margin">A brief ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the <hi>mouth of Blaſpemies</hi> ſpoken of by S. <hi>John.</hi>

For look how much he exceeds any but meer man in all theſe: by ſo much doth the Pope (though ſuppoſed as not obnoxious to any crime) make his authority and favour with God greater then Chriſts, which is the <hi>Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Mouth of Blaſpemies.</hi> The other part, equal hereunto in quantity, but for the quality more tainted with the dregs of Hell, ariſeth from that oppoſition the Popes ſpirit hath unto Chriſt; or from the luxury and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manners of the Papacy, erected by Satan as it were of purpoſe to pollute the world with monſtrous ſins, and to derogate as much from mankind, as true Chriſtianity doth advance it: finally to make the Chriſtian world as much more wicked, as Chriſts Diſciples, Apoſtles, and faithful followers are better then the heathen, Nor doth the Pope exact Belief only without <note place="margin">The chief argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought by Romiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to prove the excellency of their Church directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Unto this obſervation the Reader may adde other like deſcriptions of this ſcarlet Whore; all ſo fitly agreeing to the Papacy, as he that will not acknowledge it for the Kingdom of great Antichriſt, hath great reaſon to ſuſpect his heart, that if he had lived with our Saviour, he would ſcarce have taken him for his Meſſias; nor can the Jeſuites bring any better reaſons, why the Pope ſhould not be <hi>the Antichriſt,</hi> then the Jews did, why Chriſt ſhould not be the great Prophet. Yet this I ſay, not to diſcourage ſuch as doubt whether the Pope be that Man of ſin; or to bring them out of love with their belief, which may be ſound without expreſſe or actual acknowledgement of this truth, not as yet revealed unto them: as thoſe two Diſciples, no doubt, were neither hypocrites nor infidels, albeit they miſtruſted the report of Chriſts reſurrection; for they were farther from approving the practiſes of the Jews againſt him, then from actual acknowledgement of it. If any man thus doubt, whether the Pope be Antichriſt, ſo he do not approve his hatred and war againſt Gods Saints, or his other deviliſh practiſes, Gods peace be upon him; and in good time I truſt his eyes ſhal be enlightned to ſee the truth in this particular, as thoſe two Diſciples did in the Article of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

The Learned Doctors charitable mind would not ſuffer him to ſuſpect any publick Profeſſor of Divinity, as <hi>Sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſcus</hi> was, could be ſo ignorant in Scriptures, as not to conſider (beſides the different eſteem of Prophets, and Poets amongſt the Jews) what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>Acts</hi> 26, 22. expreſſely ſaid; <hi>I obtained help of God, and continue unto this day, witneſsing both unto ſmall and great, ſaying none other things, then thoſe which the Prophets and Moſes did ſay ſhould come.</hi> Unleſſe he could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſts reſurrection and other Articles of Chriſtian faith, out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, the Jews exceptions againſt him had been juſt. For they were bound to reſiſt all Doctrines diſſonant to their ancient Ordinances, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the aboliſhment of Rites and Ceremonies which <hi>Paul</hi> laboured moſt, knowing the Law-giver meant they ſhould continue no longer then to the alteration of the Prieſthood: but in whoſe maintenance his adverſaries ſhould have ſpent their bloud, whiles ignorant they were, (without default) of the truth <hi>Paul</hi> taught, as not ſufficiently proved from the ſame Authority, by which their lawes were eſtabliſhed. Nor <note n="†" place="margin">See Cap. 18.</note> was any Apoſtle, either for his miracles, or other pledges of the Spirit that he could communicate unto others, to be ſo abſolutely believed in all things during his life time, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets writings. For ſeeing the gift of miracles was beſtowed on hypocrites, or ſuch as might fall from any gifts or graces of the ſpirit they had: though the ſpectatours might believe the particular concluſions, to whoſe confirmation the miracles were fitted, yet was it not ſafe, without examination, abſolutely to relie upon him, in all things, that had ſpoken a divine truth once or twice. In that he might be an hypocrite or a diſſembler, for ought others, without evidence of his upright converſation, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſonance to his former Doctrine, could know, he might abuſe his purchaſed reputation to abet ſome dangerous errour. Nor do our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (though too too credulous in this kind) think themſelves bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve revelations made to another, much leſſe to think that he which is once partaker of the Spirit ſhould for ever be infallible.

whom the Godhead dwelleth bodily, is immutably juſt and holy. Many others have continued holy and righteous, according to their meaſure untill the end: but who could be certain of this beſides themſelves? no not they themſelves alwayes. And albeit a man that never was in the ſtate of grace, may oft-times deliver that Doctrine which is infallible: yet were it (to ſay no worſe) a grievous tempting of God to rely upon his Doctrine as abſolutely infallible, unleſſe we know him (beſides his ſkill or learning) to be alwayes in ſuch a ſtate. Though both his life and death be moſt religious, his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine muſt approve it ſelf to the preſent Age, and Gods providence muſt commend it to poſterity. Nor did our Saviour, though in life immutably holy, and for Doctrine moſt infallible, aſſume ſo much unto himſelf before his Aſcenſion, as the Jeſuites give to the Pope.

of God deceaſed, cannot be Judges: ſhall they therefore have no Say at all in deciding conroverſies of faith? You may not think a Jeſuite would take <hi>Jeſus</hi> Name in vain: he will never for ſhame, exclude his Maſter for having at leaſt a finger in the government of the Church: Why, what is his office? or what is the uſe of his authority, regiſtred by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Evangeliſts?

                     <p n="2">2 That in ſuch Controverſies he includes, The means of knowing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God: is evident out of his own words in the fore-cited place. For the knowledge of Scriptures he would have to be an eſpecial point of faith, yet ſuch as cannot be proved by Scripture, but by this living and ſpeaking authority, as he expreſſely contends in the eleventh <hi>paragraph</hi> of the ſame queſtion. His concluſion is; <hi>If it be neceſſary, there ſhould be ſome authority, though humane, yet by divine aſsiſtance infallible, to ſit as Miſtreſſe and Judge in all controverſies of faith, and not to be appropriated to any deceaſed, as is already proved: it remains that it be alwayes living in the Church, alwayes preſent amongst the faithfull by ſucceſsion,</hi> he means of Popes.

aſſembled together, to be diſputed or called in queſtion. Sufferance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was in his judgement no leſle prejudicial to the State Eccleſiaſtick, then unto the temporal it would be, to permit malefactors traverſe the equity of publick Lawes eſtabliſhed and known, after ſufficient proof or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion made of Capital offences committed againſt them. The marginal quotations of the Trent Councel, compared with this grave admonition, which had antiquitie-cuſtomes Canonical, as the Authour urgeth, to give it Countenance, may ſerve as a perfect Index for our inſtruction, with what prejudice the Biſhops there aſſembled came to determine, by whoſe manuduction or ſet rules they drew their ſuppoſed inerrable lines of life. Now it is impoſſible any determination, that takes it force from multitude of voyces, ſhould be either in it ſelf more certain, or more forcible to perſwade others, then are the motives or inducements that ſwayed the ſuffragants ſo to determine; and theſe in this caſe could, by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſon, be but hiſtorical perſwaſions or preſumptions. For no Jeſuite I think, will ſay theſe Biſhops had the Popes ſentence <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> to aſſure them before-hand what Councels had been lawfully called, and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; or whether all the ancient Canons they afterwards reeſtabliſhed were already as authentick and certain as they could be made: For ſo it had been a labour altogether loſt, yea a matter no leſſe prophane then rebaptization, to have confirmed them by ſuffrages of Biſhops, after their Cathedral confirmation by the Pope. Even of his Holineſſe himſelf, whoſe verdict (as in this caſe muſt finally be ſuppoſed) addes Divine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto teſtifications in their own nature fallible and meerly humane, the queſtion propoſed in the former Section remains ſtill inſoluble. For without the relation of ſome Hiſtorian, or Regiſter, or eſpecial revelation from above, no Pope can divine how many Councels have been held, much leſſe what was finally determined in every ancient Canon confirmed by the Biſhops aſſembled at Trent. Special revelations, ſuch as the Prophets had, they acknowledge none. And yet diſtinctly to tell what hath been done in times paſt, or places afar off, without relying on others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, is an extraordinary effect of ſpecial revelation, a work of higher nature and greater difficulty, then Prophetical prediction of things to come. Are then the relations of Hiſtorians, or Regiſters of Ancient Councels divine and authentick. Not without the Popes ratification: with it they are? Yes, or elſe a great part of Roman faith by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reaſon can be but humane.</p>

Conſonantly to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>final reſolution; The Firſt Verity, or divine infallibility,</hi> is that into which all Faith is laſtly reſolved. For (as we ſaid before) this is the firſt ſtep in the progreſſe of true Belief, the loweſt Foundation whereon any Religion, Chriſtian, Jewiſh, Mahometan, or Ethnick can be built. And it is an undoubted Axiom, <hi>quod primum eſt in generatione, eſt ultimum in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutione; when we reſolve any thing into the parts whereof it is compounded, we end, in the undoing or unfolding it, where nature begun in the compoſition or making of it.</hi> But he that would attempt to compoſe it again, or frame the like aright, would terminate all his thoughts or purpoſes by the end or uſe, which is fartheſt from actual accompliſhment. Thus the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect frames ſtones and timber, and layes the firſt foundation according to the platform he carries in his head; and that he caſts proportionably to the moſt commodious or pleaſant habitation: which, though laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, determines all cogitations or reſolutions precedent. Hence, if we take this <hi>ultima reſolutio,</hi> as we alwayes take theſe termes, when we reſolve our own perſwaſions, that is, <hi>[for a reſolution of all doubts or demands, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubject whereof we treat]</hi> A Roman Catholicks faith muſt, according

to his Principles, finally be reſolved into the Churches infallibility. For this is the immediate ground, or firſt cauſe of any particular or determinate point of Chriſtian faith; and the immediate cauſe is alwayes that, into which our perſwaſions concerning the effect is finally reſolved, ſeeing it onely can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie all demands, doubts, or queſtions concerning it. As for example, if you aſk why men, or other terreſtrial Creatures, breath, when fiſhes do not: to ſay they have lungs, and fiſhes none, doth not fully ſatisfie all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or doubts concerning this Subject.

To demonſtrate the final cauſe in any work of Nature, were to aſſigne a Counſellor to the infinite wiſdom of the God of Nature; in whoſe intention the end is firſt, and is the cauſe of all operation or efficiencie. Who could give, or who would demand a naturall cauſe why life ſhould be <hi>preſerved?</hi> for this is the will of him that gave it. If queſtion were made of the manner how the life of man and other creatures is preſerved, when as their heat might ſeem to choak them? A man might truely anſwer, by reſpiration: and reſpiration is from the lungs. But it is one thing to aſk, How or by what Means; another, for what End any effect is produced. The former is an inquiry of the Efficient, within theſe precincts of means or motions alwayes, prime and independent; The later of the final cauſe abſolutely, indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, becauſe <hi>it implies a contradiction to give a reaſon why that ſhould be, for whoſe ſake all other things of that rank have being.</hi> Nor is the End it ſelf (to ſpeak properly) ever produced, though oft-times in common ſpeech, we take the Effect immediately thereto deſtinated (becauſe moſt ſenſible) for the End it ſelf, as we do the ſtarre next to the Pole, becauſe viſible, for the Pole or point immoveable. Thus we confound reſpiration or actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of life with the <hi>Final cauſe</hi> why men have lungs; when as both are effects of the lungs, both means of accompliſhing Natures or rather the God of Natures purpoſe, in whoſe will or pleaſure the finall cauſe of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect alwayes conſiſts. And ſeeing nothing in Nature can preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate his will, no cauſe can be precedent to the finall. This conſideration of naturall effects tending as certainly to their propoſed end, as the arrow

                     <p n="7">7 Now that which in our Adverſaries Doctrine anſwers unto the cauſe <note place="margin">Jeſuites faith cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into any definite branch of the <hi>Firſt Truth.</hi>
                        </note> indemonſtrable whereinto final reſolution of Natures works or intentions of intelligent agents muſt be reſolved, is the Churches Authority. Nor can that, if we ſpeak properly, be reſolved into any branch of the firſt Truth; for this reaſon (beſides others alledged before) that all reſolutions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our perſwaſions or intentions, or of their objects (works of Art or Nature) ſuppoſe a ſtability or certainty in the firſt links of the chain which we unfold; the latter alwayes depending on the former, not the former on the latter. As in reſolutions of the latter kind lately mentioned (imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the order of compoſition) actual continuation of life depends on brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not breathing on it: breathing on the lungs, not the lungs mutually on breathing: ſo in reſolutions of the other kind (which inverts the order of compoſition) the uſe or neceſſity of lungs depends upon the uſe or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of breathing; the neceſſitie or uſe of breathing upon the neceſſity or uſe of life, or upon his will or pleaſure that created one of theſe for another. Thus again, the ſenſitive faculty depends upon the vital, that upon mixtion, mixtion upon the Elements, not any of theſe mutually upon the ſenſitive faculty; if we reſpect the order of ſupportance or Natures progreſſe in their production. Whence he that queſtions whether ſome kinds of plants have ſenſe, or ſome ſtones or metals life, ſuppoſeth as unqueſtionable, that the former have life, that the ſecond are mixt bodies. But if we reſpect the intent or purpoſe of him that ſets Nature a working; all the former faculties depend on the ſenſitive, the ſenſitive not on any of them. For God would not have his creatures indued with ſenſe, that they might live; or live, that they might have mixt bodies: but rather to have ſuch bodies that they might live, to live that they might enjoy the benefit of ſenſe, or the more noble faculties.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Can the Jeſuite thus aſſigne any determinate branch of the <hi>Firſt Truth,</hi> as ſtable and unqueſtionable, before it be ratified by the Churches authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?

                     <p n="9">9 Much more probably might the Jew or Turk reſolve his faith unto the Firſt Truth, then the modern Jeſuited Papiſt can. For though their deductions from it be much what alike, all equally ſottiſh: yet theſe admit a ſtabilitie or certainty of what the Firſt Truth hath ſaid, no way depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon their authority that firſt propoſed or commended it unto them. The Turks would ſtorme to hear any Mufti profeſſe, <hi>He were as well to be believed as was Mahomet</hi> in his life time; that <hi>without His propoſal they could not know either the old Teſtament or the Alcoran to be from God.</hi> So would the Jews if one of their Rabbines ſhould make the like compariſon betwixt himſelf and <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Jeſuite doth betwixt Chriſt and the Pope: who, beſides that he muſt be as well believed as his Maſter, leaves the authority of both Teſtaments uncertain to us, unleſſe confirmed by his infallibility. But to ſpeak properly, the pretended derivation of all three hereſies from the Firſt Truth, hath a lively reſemblance of falſe pedegrees, none at all of true Doctrine and reſolutions. Of all the three the Romiſh is moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as may appear by their ſeveral repreſentations. As, imagine there ſhould be three Competitors for the Roman Empire; all pleading it were to deſcend by inheritance, not by election; all pretending lineal ſucceſſion from <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. The firſt, like to the Jew, alledgeth an authentick pedegree, making him the eldeſt. The ſecond, reſembling the Turk, replies, that the other indeed was of the eldeſt line, but long ſince diſinherited, often conquered and enforced to reſigne; whence the inheritance deſcended to him as the next in ſucceſſion. The third, like the Romaniſt, pleads it was bequeathed him by the Emperors laſt Will and Teſtament, from whoſe death his Anceſtors have been intit'led to it, and produceth a pedegree to this purpoſe, without any other confirmation then his own authority; adding withall, that unleſſe his competitors and others will believe his records and declarations (written or unwritten) to be moſt authentick, they cannot be certaine whether ever there had been ſuch an Emperour as they plead ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from, or at leaſt how far his Dominions extended, or where they lay. This manner of plea in ſecular controverſies, would be a mean to defeat him that made it. For albeit the Chriſtian World did acknowledge there had been ſuch an Emperour, and that many parts of Europe of right belonged unto his lawfull heir: Yet if it were otherwiſe unknown what parts theſe were, or who this heir ſhould be; no Judge would be ſo mad as fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to determine of either upon ſuch motives. Or if the Plaintiffe, could, by ſuch courſes as (the World knows) oft prevail in judgement, or other
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:57235:269"/>
gracious reſpects, effect his purpoſe: he were worſe then mad that could think the finall reſolution of his right were into the Emperours laſt Will and Teſtament, which by his own confeſſion, no man knows beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and not rather, into his own preſumed fidelitie, or the Judges appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant partiality. So in this Controverſie, whatſoever the Pope may pretend from Chriſt, all in the end comes to his own authority; which we may ſafely believe, herein to be moſt infallible, that it will never prove partiall againſt it ſelf, or define ought to his Holineſſe diſadvantage.</p>

For albeit the Scripture ſay, that the Books of the Prophets or Apoſtles are divine: yet this I ſhall not certainly believe, unleſſe I firſt believe that Scripture, which ſaith thus, is divine. For ſo we may read every where in Mahomets Alcoran, that the Alcoran it ſelf was ſent from heaven; but we beliefe it not. Therefore this neceſſary point</hi> [that ſome Scripture is divine,] <hi>cannot ſufficiently be gathered out of Scriptures alone. Conſequently, ſeeing faith muſt rely upon Gods Word; unleſſe we have Gods word unwritten, we can have no faith.</hi> His meaning is, we cannot know the Scriptures to be divine, but by Traditions; and what Traditions are divine, what not, we cannot know, but by the preſent viſible Church: as was expreſly taught by the ſame Authour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And the final reſolution of our believing what God hath ſaid, or not ſaid, muſt be the Churches Authority.

The Reader (I hope) obſerves by theſe paſſages, How <hi>Bellarmine aſcribes that to Tradition, which is peculiar to Gods providence: Sacroboſcus, that to blind belief, which belongs unto the holy Spirit,</hi> working faith unto the former points, by the ordinary obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods Providence, and Experiments anſwerable to the rules of Scriptures.</p>

the divine perſons, the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from the Father and the Son, as from one joynt original; Original ſin; Chriſts deſcenſion into Hel, and many like, may indeed be deduced out of Scriptures, but not ſo plainly as to end Controverſies with contentious ſpirits, if we ſhould produce onely teſtimonies of Scriptures. And we are to note there be two things in Scripture, the Characters or the written words, and the ſence included in them. The Character is as the ſheath, but the ſence is the very ſword of the ſpirit. Of the firſt of theſe two, all are partakers; for whoſoever knowes the Character, may read the Scripture: but of the ſence all men are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, nor can we in many places be certain of it, unleſſe Tradition be aſsiſtant.</hi> It is an offer worth the taking that here he maks, <hi>That the ſence of Scriptures is the ſword of the ſpirit.</hi> This is as much as we contend that the ſence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Scripture.

For ſuppoſe we had as yet no full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the ſpirit, for the contradictory ſence to that given by the Church: we were in Chriſtian duty to expect Gods providence, and invoke the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits aſſiſtance for manifeſtation of the truth; from all poſſibility whereof we deſperately exclude our ſelves, if we believe one mans teſtimony of the ſpirit, as abſolutely and irrevocably, as we would do the manifeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teſtimony of the ſpirit: yet <note n="*" place="margin">Quod caput religionis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus aut cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri eſt; quam myſteriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſsimae Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis; quo trium perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum aſtruitur divinitas? hoc tamen tam parum clarè inſinuatur in ſcriptura, ut contrarium è ſactis literis ita probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter atque ut videbatur verè docuerint Ariani; ut totos 300. annos vexarint Eccleſiam, orbiſque aliquando univerſus ſe fuerit (Hieronymo teſte) miratus Arianum.

But it may be, we want ſpectacles to read them; our Church hath but the eyes of private men, which cannot ſee without a publick light: Their Churches eyes are Cat-like, able ſo to illuſtrate the objects of Chriſtian faith, as to make them clear and perſpicuous to it ſelf, though dark and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto us.

Theſe are the words, and this is the very Argument, wherein <hi>Valentians</hi> ſoul, it ſeems, did moſt delight, he uſeth them ſo oft. But to proceed: The parties Catechized thus by the viſible Church it ſelf, ſhould any Proteſtant enter Dialogue with them how they know thoſe received Scriptures to be the Word of God, could anſwer, I trow, ſufficiently to this queſtion, thus: Mary ſir, we know better then you: For we heard the viſible Church which cannot erre, ſay ſo, with our own ears. <hi>Prot.</hi> You are moſt certain then that theſe are the Oracles of God, becauſe the viſible Church (Gods living Oracle) did bear teſtimony of them? <hi>Catech.</hi> Yea, ſir, and their teſtimony is moſt infallible. <hi>Prot.</hi> But, what if you doubt again of their infallibilities? How will you anſwer this objection: <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſaith his Alcoran is Scripture; the Turkiſh Prieſts wil tel you as much, <hi>viva voce,</hi> and ſhew you, if you be diſpoſed to believe them, evident places therein, for his infallibility? <hi>Manes</hi> could ſay that he had divine revelations. The Pope pretends he hath this infallibilitie, which neither of them had. Who ſhall judge? the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory? But why ſhould you think they may not erre as wel as others? Did they ſhew you any evidence out of Scriptures, or did they bring you to ſuch entire acquaintance with their publick ſpirit, as to approve your ſelves Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Criticks of all queſtions concerning the Canon as oft as any doubt ſhould ariſe? <hi>Catech</hi> Oh no, theſe audacious Criticiſmes of private men they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deteſt, and forewarned us upon pain of damnation to beware of. For there is no private perſon but may erre, and for ſuch to judge of Scriptures were preſumption juſtly damnable. Rely they muſt for this reaſon upon the Churches infallibility, and that continually. It alone cannot; without it, all others may erre, as wel as <hi>Manes, Mahomet, Neſtorius,</hi> or <hi>Eutyches:</hi> undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly believing it, cannot erre, we our ſelves are as free from error, as he that follows ſuch good counſel given by others as he cannot give himſelf, is more ſecure then he that altogether follows his own advice, albeit better able to counſel others then the former. <hi>Prot.</hi> Then I perceive your onely hold-faſt

in all temptations, your onely anchor when any blaſts of vain doctrine ariſe, is this: <hi>The preſent Romiſh Church canndt erre:</hi> for if you doubt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doctrine taught to the contrary, aſk her and ſhe will reſolve you; or if you cannot ſee the Truth in it ſelf, yet believe without all wavering as ſhe believes that ſees it, and you ſhall be as ſafe, as if you rode in the harbour in a ſtorm. <hi>Catech.</hi> Ah yes, Gods holy name be praiſed, who hath ſo well provided for his Church: for otherwiſe hereticks and ſchiſmaticks would ſhake and toſs her, even in this main point or ground of faith, as evil ſpirits do ſhips in tempeſts: we muſt either hold this Teſt ſure, or elſe all is gone.

One there is, and no more, that can truely ſay <hi>My Eſſence is Mine own, and my Exiſtence neceſſary.</hi> Whatſoever is beſides, is but a ſhadow or picture borrowed from his infinite being. Amongſt created Entities, all eſſentially depending on <hi>Him, Accidents</hi> have a kind of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence peculiar to themſelves; yet cannot ſo properly be ſaid to exiſt, as their ſubjects, on whom they have ſuch double dependance. Nor can the Moon ſo truely ſay, <hi>my beauty is my own,</hi> as may the Sun, which lends light and ſplendor to this his ſiſter, as it were upon condition ſhe never uſe it but in his ſight. For the ſame reaſon, <hi>That for which we believe another thing, is alwaies more truely, more really, and more properly believed, then that which is believed for it, if the one belief neceſſarily depend upon the other, Tam in facto eſſe quam in ſieri, from the firſt beginning to the latter end.</hi> For of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs thus mutually affected, the one is real and radical; the other, nominal, or at the moſt by participation only real. This conſequence is unſound. <hi>[Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective knowledge depends on ſenſitive: therfore ſenſitive is of theſe two the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.]</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe intellective knowledge depends on ſenſitive, onely in the acquiſition: not after it is acquired. But this inference is moſt undoubted; <hi>[We believe the concluſion for the premiſſes: therefore we believe the premiſſes the better,]</hi> becauſe belief of the concluſion abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the premiſſes, during the whole continuance of it. This is the great Philoſophers Rule, and a branch of the former Axiom. And ſome juſtly queſtion, whether in Scholaſtick proprietie of ſpeech, we can truely ſay there is a belief of the concluſion, diſtinct from the belief of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes; or rather, the belief of the premiſſes, is by extrinſical denomination attributed unto the concluſion. This latter opinion, at leaſt in many Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes, is the truer: moſt neceſſarily true in all, wherein the concluſion is a particular, eſſentially ſubordinate to an univerſal of truth unqueſtionable.

be that infallibly believes every man is a reaſonable creature, infallibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>Socrates</hi> is ſuch.

Theſe being known, we cannot imagine there ſhould be <hi>two diſtinct Beliefs:</hi> one of the Churches general infallibilitie; another, of the particular truths or points of faith (contained in the Scripture) propoſed by it. For as in the former caſe, ſo in this, He that from the Churches propoſal believes or knowes this particular, <hi>The Book of Revelations was from God,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no increaſe of former belief: For before, he believed all the Church did propoſe; and therefore this particular, <hi>Becauſe one of all.</hi>

The doubt could hardly be reſolved, if according to our adverſaries Tenent, the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations did confirm our faith by illuſtrating the Canon of Scriptures, or making particular truths contained in it, inherently more perſpicuous: as if they were in themſelves but potentially credible, and made actually ſuch by the Churches Teſtimony, which is the firſt and <hi>Principal Credible;</hi> in ſuch ſort as colours become actually viſible, by illumination of the principal and prime viſible. But herein the grounds of Romiſh doctrine, and the inſtance brought by <hi>Sacroboſcus,</hi> to illuſtrate it, are quite contrary. For the light of the Sun, though moſt neceſſary unto ſight, is yet neceſſary onely in reſpect of the object, or for making colours actually viſible; which, made ſuch, or ſufficiently illuminated, are inſtantly perceived without further inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediation of any other light then the internal light of the Organ, in diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colours alwayes rather hindered then helped by circumfuſion of light external. For this reaſon it is, that men in a pit or cave may at noon day ſee the ſtarres, which are inviſible to ſuch as are in the open air: not, that they are more illuminated to the one, then the other; but becauſe plentie of light doth hinder the Organ or eye-ſight of the one. Generally all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, either actually viſible in themſelves, or ſufficiently illuminated, are better perceived in darkneſſe then in the light. But ſo our Adverſaries will not grant, that after the Church hath ſufficiently propoſed the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to be Gods Word, the diſtinct meaning of every part is more clear and facile to all private ſpirits, by how much they leſſe participate of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches further illuſtration. For (quite contrary to the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) the Churches teſtimony or declaration is onely neceſſary, or avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to right belief, in reſpect, not of the object to be believed <hi>[Scriptures;]</hi> but of the party believing. For (as hath been obſerved) no man in their <note place="margin">See Cap. 2. &amp; Cap. 29.</note> judgement can believe Gods Word, or the right meaning of it, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Church: and all belief is inherent in the believer. Yea this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Belief of the Churches authority, is that, which in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sacroboſcus's</hi> judgement, makes a Roman Catholicks belief of Scriptures, or divine truths taught by them, much better then a Proteſtants. If otherwiſe the Churches declaration, or teſtimony, could without the belief of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility; which is inherent in the ſubject believing, make Scriptures credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the light doth colours viſible in themſelves: a Proteſtant that knew their Churches meaning, might as truely believe them as a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, albeit he did not abſolutely believe the Church, but onely uſe her help, for their Orthodoxal interpretation, as he doth ordinary Expoſitors, or as many do the benefit of the Sun for ſeeing colours, which never think whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colours may be ſeen without it or no. For though it be certain that they cannot, yet this opinion is meerly accidental to their ſight: and if a man ſhould be ſo wilfull as to maintain the contrary, it would argue only blindneſs of mind, none of his bodily ſight. Nor ſhould diſtruſt of the Romiſh Churches authority, ought diminiſh our Belief of any divine Truth, were her decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations requiſite in reſpect of the object to be believed, not in reſpect of the ſubject believing.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Hence ariſeth that difference which plainly reſolves the former
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:57235:276"/>
doubt. For ſeeing the Sun makes colours actually viſible, by adding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or luſtre to them: we may rightly ſay, we ſee colours, as truely as the light, by which we ſee them. For though without the benefit of it, they cannot be ſeen; yet are they not ſeen by ſeeing it, or by relying upon it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of them. Again, becauſe the uſe of light is onely neceſſarie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the object, or for preſenting colours to the eye; after once they be ſufficiently illuminated or preſented, every creature endued with ſight, can immediately diſcern each from other, without any further help or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of external light, then the general, whereby they become all alike actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally viſible at the ſame inſtant. The Suns light then is the true cauſe, why colours are ſeen: but no cauſe of our diſtinguiſhing one from another being ſeen, or made actuallie viſible by it. For of all ſenſible objects ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed, the ſenſitive faculty, though ſeated in a private perſon, is the ſole immediat ſupreme Judge, and relies not upon any others more publick verdict of them. On the contrary, becauſe the Romaniſts ſuppoſed firm belief of Scriptures, or their true meaning, ariſeth only from his undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted belief of the Churches veracicie which is in the believer as in it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not from any increaſe of inherent credibilitie, or perſpicuitie thence propagated to the Scriptures: Hence it is that conſequently to his poſitions, moſt repugnant to all truth, he thinks, after the Church hath ſufficiently avouched the Scriptures divine truth in general, we cannot infalliblie diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the true ſence and meaning of one place from another, but muſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo rely upon the Churches teſtimony; and onely believe that ſence to be repugnant, that conſonant to the analogie of faith, which ſhe ſhall tender, albeit our private conſciences be never ſo well informed by other Scriptures to the contrary. The truth then of our former concluſion is hence eaſily manifeſted. For ſeeing they hold both the Scriptures and their diſtinct ſence to be obſcure and unable to aſcertain themſelves, unleſſe the Church adde perſpicuitie or facilitie of communicating their meaning to private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: ſuch, after the Churches propoſal, cannot poſſibly diſcern them any better, or more directly in themſelves, then they did before, but muſt wholy rely upon their Prelates, as if theſe were the onely watchmen in the Tower of Gods Church, that could by vertue of their place diſcern all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth. Others muſt believe there is an omnipotent God, which hath given his Law; a Mediator of the new Teſtament: but what the meaning either of Law or Goſpel is, they may not preſume otherwiſe to determine, then weak ſights do of things they ſee confuſedly a farre off, whoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſtance or difference they muſt take onely upon other mens report, that have ſeen them diſtinctly, and at hand.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 To illuſtrate theſe deductions with the former ſimilitude of the <hi>prime</hi> and ſecondary <hi>viſibles.</hi> Let us ſuppoſe for diſputations ſake, that the Sun which illuminates colours by its light, were further indued (as we are) with ſenſe and reaſon, able to judge of all the differences between them, which it can manifeſt to us, and hence challenge to be a Pope or infallible propoſer of colours. This ſuppoſition the Canoniſt hath made leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable. For <hi>Deus fecit duo luminaria, God made two lights,</hi> that is, by his interpretation, the Pope and the Emperour. Or, if you pleaſe to mitigate the harſhneſſe of it, let the <hi>Man in the Moon,</hi> whom we may not imagine ſpeechleſſe, be ſuppoſed the Sun, or <hi>Pope of colours,</hi> his <hi>Mercurie</hi> or <hi>Nuncio.</hi> As the Papiſts ſay, we cannot know Scriptures to be Scriptures, but by the infallible propoſal of the Church: ſo it is evident we cannot ſee any colour at all, unleſſe illuminated or propoſed by the Suns light. But after by it
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57235:276"/>
we ſee them, ſuppoſe we ſhould take upon us to diſcourſe of their nature, or determine of their diſtinct properties as now we do, and the Sun or Pope of colours, by himſelf or his Nuncio ſhould take us up, as Duke <hi>Humphrey</hi> did the <hi>blind man reſtored to ſight, which he never had loſt;</hi> Yea, <hi>who taught you to diſtinguiſh colours? were you not quite blind but now?</hi> as yet you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any colours without my publick light, and yet will you preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine their properties, and diſtinguiſh their natures againſt my definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence known? Muſt not he that enables you to ſee them, enable you to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them ſeen? Muſt you not wholly rely upon my authority, whether this be white, or that black? If a man upon theſe Motives ſhould abſolutely believe the Suns determinations, renouncing the judgement of his private ſenſes: could he truely ſay, that he either knew this colour to be white or that black, or another green? Rather were he not bound to ſay, I neither know white from black, nor black from blew, nor blew from green: but I know that to be white which the Sun, the onely infallible Judge of colours, ſaith is white; that onely to be black, that blew, and that green which he ſhall determine ſo to be. I may think indeed that the ſnow is white, or coals black: but with ſubmiſſion to the Suns determination.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 And yet, as you have heard at large out of the Trent Councel, and beſt Apologies can be made for it, the Church muſt be the infallible Judge of all Scripture ſence, and muſt abſolutely be believed without all appeal to Scriptures, not conditionally as ſhe ſhall accord with them. The concluſion hence iſſuing, is moſt infallible, and on their parts moſt inevitable; <hi>[Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever abſolutely acknowledgeth this authority in the Church or Conſiſtory, and yeelds ſuch obedience unto it in all determinations, concerning the Canon of Scriptures, doth not believe either this or that determinate propoſition of faith, or any definite meaning of Gods Word.]</hi> The beſt reſolution he can make of his faith is this; <hi>[I believe that to be the meaning of every place, which the Church ſhall define to be the meaning:]</hi> which is all one, as if he had ſaid, I do not believe the Scriptures or their meaning, but I believe the Churches deciſion and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence concerning them.

By the ſame reaſon it followes moſt directly; he that believes not the true ſence and meaning of Scriptures, but with this reſervation, (if the Church ſo think or determine:) doth not believe them, but the Church onely. For, as the Schoolmen ſay, <hi>Ubi unum propter aliud, ibi unum tantum.</hi> He that ſerves God, onely becauſe he would be rich, doth not ſerve God but his riches, albeit he performe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of obedience.

But the whole Church ſhould erre very groſsly in ſuch matters, ſhould it repute and worſhip him for a Saint which is none.</hi> Hereit would be obſerved, how Satan inſtigates theſe men unto ſuch Tenents, as may occaſion God and his Goſpel to be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed. Firſt, they would make it an Article of Faith, that all muſt believe as the Pope teacheth: whence it follows, that either he cannot teach amiſs, or elſe faith may periſh from off the earth. Which if it could, God were not true in his promiſes The ſureſt pledge the Chriſtian world can have of his fidelity in them, muſt be the Popes infallibility, ſo as from the firſt unto the laſt, he muſt be held as true in his dealings, as God in his ſayings. If he fail in Canonizing a Saint, whom he cannot poſſibly know to be ſuch, unleſs he knew his heart, which belongs wholly unto his maker: God muſt be a lyar, and there is no Truth in him. The final iſſue intended by Satan in theſe reſolutions is this; When men have been a long time led on with fair hopes of gaining heaven by following the Popes direction, and yet in the end ſee (as who not blind ſees not) his groſs errors and deteſtable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, they may be hence tempted to blaſpheme God, as if he had been his copartner in this coſenage. From this root (I take it) hath Atheiſm ſprung ſo faſt in <hi>Italy.</hi> For whileſt faith is in the blade, and their hopes flouriſhing,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:57235:278"/>
they imagine God and the Pope to be ſuch friends as their blind guides make them: But afterwards comming to deteſtation of this <hi>man of ſin,</hi> and his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, holding his ſpiritual power as ridiculous, they think either as deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or contemptuouſly of the Deity; or ſay with <hi>the <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 14. v. 1.</note> fool in their hearts, there is no God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 Thus Antichriſts followers ſtill run a courſe quite contrary to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">The fearful manner of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites tempting God in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> religion. For if it be true (as it is moſt true) that faith cannot utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh from off the earth; what damnable abuſe of Gods mercie and favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mankinde is this, in ſeeking, as the Jeſuites do, to make all abſolutely rely upon one in matters of Faith? For ſo if he fail, all others muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fail with him. That is, the whole world muſt be as kind ſupernatural fools to him, as that natural idiote was to his Maſter, who being demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would go to heaven with him or no, replyed he would go to hel with ſo good a Maſter, ſeeing any man would be willing to go to heaven with an ordinary friend, yea with his enemy. Though we ſhould uſe no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument but that, <hi>Avoid ye ſons of Satan; for it is written, ye ſhall not tempt the Lord your God:</hi> It ſhould, me thinks, be enough to put all the Jeſuites in the world unto ſilence in this point, did they not as far exceed their father in impudency, as they come ſhort of him in wit. For this manner of tempting God is more ſhameleſs then Divels ſuggeſtion unto our Saviour, when he was inſtanly ſilenced with this reproof. A preſumption it is more damnable to expect the protection or guidance of Gods ſpirit, in ſuch deſperate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions as <hi>Valentian</hi> here brings, then it were for a man to throw himſelf headlong from an high towr, upon hope of Angelical ſupportance. For ſeeing (as I ſaid) God hath promiſed, that true faith ſhal not periſh from off the earth; for all men to adventure their faith upon one mans infallibility, who may have leſs ſaving faith in him then Turk or Infidel, is but a provoking or daring of God to recall his promiſe. Or what more damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine can be imagined, then that all men ſhould worſhip him for a Saint, whom the wickedeſt man on earth doth commend unto him for ſuch?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 But to proceed. As the Doctrine is moſt impious, ſo are the grounds of it moſt improbable. For how can the Pope or Papiſts infallibly know this or that man to be a Saint; Seeing there is no particular revelation made of it, either to the Pope or others? <hi>I anſwer</hi> (ſaith <hi>Valentian) that the general revelation, whereby it is evident, that whatſoever the Pope ſhall decree, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the whole Church, is moſt true, may ſuffice in this caſe. Moreover</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto the Canonizing of Saints appertain theſe revelations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which heavenly joyes are generally propoſed to all ſuch as lead a Godly life. For by the Popes determination, we know the Saint which he hath Canonized, to be contained in the foreſaid univerſal propoſition. Whence it is eaſie to frame an aſſent of faith; by which we may perſwade our ſelves, that ſuch a Saint hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal bliſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 I would requeſt the Reader by the way to note the Jeſuites injurious partiality, in ſcoffing at ſuch of our Writers, as without expreſs warrant of particular revelation, hold a certainty of their own ſalvation: when as they, onely by Gods general promiſes to ſuch as lead a godly life, and the Popes infallibility, in declaring who have ſo lived, can be certain <hi>(defide)</hi> others are ſaved. But the former doubt is rather removed then quite taken away by this his anſwer, if it ſtand alone. As yet it may be queſtioned, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can infallibly know the truth of what he cannot poſſibly know at all, but onely by other mens teſtimonies, in their nature (the Jeſuite being judge)
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:57235:279"/>
not infallible, and in whoſe examination it is not impoſſible his Holineſſe may be negligent? For how men live or dye in <hi>England, Spain,</hi> or the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> no Pope can tel but by the information of others no Popes. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perhaps wil prognoſticate <hi>Valentians</hi> anſwer, as in truth I did. For when I firſt framed the doubt before I read it in him, me thought it ſtood in need of ſuch a reply, as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2 c. 31. Parag. 6.</note>

                     <argument>
                        <p>What danger by this blaſphemous Doctrine may accrew to Chriſtian States: that of all hereſies, blaſphemies, or idolatries, which have been ſince the world began, or can be imagined till Chriſt come to judgement: this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Jeſuites, is the moſt abominable and contumelious againſt the bleſſed Trinity.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 WHat the conſequences of theſe poſitions may be, none can doubt. No leſs they are then I have ſaid; a reſigning up of mens ſouls and conſciences into the Popes hands, a conſecration of hearts, minds, and bodies, to work any miſchief imaginable at his appointment. For what if the Pope upon the relation of <hi>Ravilliacks</hi> ſtubbornneſs, (they would ſay conſtancy) in his torture, or <hi>Catesbyes</hi> praying to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at his death, ſhould Canonize both for Saints, and enjoyn the Chriſtian world ſo to honour them: Every bloody Aſſaſinate would pray unto the one for good ſucceſs in acting his blood-thirſty deſigns on Princes bodies. And if it ſhould pleaſe the Pope ſo to determine, all men ſhould ſtand bound to give ſuch ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as by their Doctrin is due to Sacred reliques, unto that bloody knife which hath been ſheathed in <hi>Ravilliacks</hi> Soveraigns breaſt. Every deep diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Polititian, or ambitious cholerick diſcontented ſpirit, would burn incenſe, ſaltpeter, ſulphur, and brimſtone to the others image, in hope of better ſpeed in undermining ſtates.</p>

If it ſhall pleaſe the Pope to authorize murther, though of the Lords anoynted; God <hi>the Son</hi> muſt be the chief Aſſaſinate to give power and ſtrength, and heaven for the reward unto the Actor. If pleaſed he be to give way to inceſt, as for the Uncle to marry the Neece, a fornication not named but with diſtaſte amongſt the ancient heathens, (I would abhor to ſpeak it, would they be aſhamed to give juſt occaſion:) the Holy Ghoſt muſt not diſdain to be his Bawd or Pander.

For knowing the <hi>breach of peace</hi> was fully reſolved upon by the State of France, he thought it a point of warlike wiſdom to begin with the enemy in his own land, rather then expect his onſet upon notice of war proclaimed: and fair opportunity (as he apprehends it) being offered from an inſinuating <hi>Heremites</hi> diſcovering of the ſituation, and readieſt way of expugning <hi>Doway,</hi> he attempts the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal of it; but prevented of his purpoſe by an <hi>old woman</hi> that awaked the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> he deemed it a ſhame to return home with empty hands; though fil them he could not, but with <hi>juſt imputation of being the firſt that had actually broken the league, as afterwards his venerable perſon was the firſt upon whom theſe perfidious Aſſaſinates, and actors in the Pariſian maſſacre did practice their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended butchery, contrary to the oath and faith which they had given him.</hi> God grant ſuch, as in <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> do moſt deteſt, be never tempted by like opportunities to imitate the worldly policies of the <hi>Papacy;</hi> that all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations to prevent their malice, may alwayes reliſh more of the <hi>Doves</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and integrity, then of the <hi>Serpents</hi> ſubtlety.</p>

                     <p>But to proceed; not the infidelity of Turk, of Jew, or Saracen, not malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Apoſtacie is to be compared with this kind of Idolatry, and blaſphemy we now diſpute againſt. The Turk calumniates the Croſs, the Jew accuſeth Chriſt himſelf as an impoſtor: but neither make him Author, or approver of ſuch impieties as they commit. The Jeſuit Fathers ſuch prodigious villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as his ſoul from Satans ſuggeſtion hath conceived, upon his Saviour: all other Hereticks, or Idolaters, Turks, Infidels, or Apoſtates, do then onely, or principally offer contumelies unto Chriſt and Chriſtianity, when they open their mouths, and vent their bitterneſs againſt him. But of this Whore and her attendants, that Proverb is moſt truely verified, <hi>Sive ſcortum benedicat ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve maledicat perinde eſt.</hi> The contumelies offered by them to Chriſt are all one, (always moſt grievous) whether they bleſs or curſe; whether they magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or blaſpheme his holy Name. Whileſt they profeſs ſuch abſolute Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Pope, the Son of perdition, <hi>Chriſts</hi> greateſt enemy, in taking our Redeemers praiſes in their mouthes; they do but adde prophane ſcurrility unto blaſphemy, uſing him herein more contemptuouſly then the Souldiers, which bowed their knees unto him, but buffet his face; ſalute him as a King, and yet wound his head by putting a crown of thorns upon it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 But ſome out of charity, not to be blamed, will here demand: Do all the maintainers of this ſtrange Doctrine expreſly and wittingly conceive as meanly, or deſpitefully of Chriſt, as theſe diſſolute Roman Souldiers did, though willingly (for their own advantage) to cloak their ſecret ſcoffs, and mockery of his ſpiritual Kingdom with outward demeanure, more decent and reverent then the others uſed? Do all the learned of that Religion in heart approve that commonly reported ſaying of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, <hi>Quantum profuit nobis fabula Chriſti?</hi> and yet reſolve (as Cardinal <note n="*" place="margin">Inde, Carafa Lutetiam regni Metropolim tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificis Legatus ſolita pompa ingreditur, ubi cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſignum crucis, ut ſit, ederet, verboru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quae proferri mos eſt, loco, ferunt cum, ut erat ſecuro de numine animo, &amp; ſummus religionis deriſor, occurſante paſſim populo &amp; in genua ad ipſius conſpectum procu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, ſaepius ſecreta murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione haec verba ingeminaſſe. <hi>Quandoquidem populus iste vult decipi, decipiatur.

For mine own part, as yet, I cannot think ſo; though, I have been friendly cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ſaying the contrary. Many of them, I am perſwaded, think they honour Chriſt as much, as the beſt in the reformed Churches do. But doth this their conceit, or imaginarie love to him, leſſen their wrong, in reſpect of thoſe contumelies offered him by the heathen? Rather (in the learned) it is a Symptom of that grievous plague, inflicted upon the Jews, <hi>That ſeeing, they ſhould not ſee, that hearing, they ſhould not hear, nor underſtand:</hi> no ſign at all of better
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:57235:284"/>
reall affection towards Chriſt, but rather a token of greater ſervility unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or of that ſtrange ſpiritual drunkenneſſe ſpoken of by the Evangeliſt. Their hearts and heads are not acquainted; the one endites what Satan ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, and moves their outward members to act what he commands; the other interprets all done in honour of Chriſt, as if a man ſhould be ſo deeply intoxicated with ſome pleaſant poiſon, as to enforce it upon his deareſt friend, for an extraordinary dainty. Finally, that theſe great Clerks ſhould thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Chriſt for the Redeemer of the world, and yet admit every Pope for his Compeer, and thus devoutly embrace the doctrine of Devils, is an undoubted document, they are the ſworn-followers of <hi>Him, whoſe comming is by the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes, and lying wonders, and in all deceiveableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe amongst them that periſh.</hi> That which eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cauſeth many of us to doubt, whether the Jeſuites do not aequivocate, when they ſpeak well of Chriſt, is, becauſe their learning and judgement are, on the one ſide ſo great, and this imagination on the other ſo prodigiouſly abſurd and ſottiſh, as one cannot poſſibly better brook the others company in the ſame heart or brain, then the moſt flouriſhing Prince, or Potentate in the World, could the beaſtlieſt ſluttiſh <hi>Shee fool</hi> living for the onely conſort of his bed; howſoever theſe cunning Panders, in pride of their nimble wits, may hope to betroth more ſimple ſouls unto this out-caſt of hell. And though experience in ſome ſort hath proved it true, that no opinion was ever propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo abſurd, but found ſome Philoſopher for it Patron: yet this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Popes tranſcendent authority, farre exceeds the limits of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments or obſervation made in Philoſophers, anſwerable to the former Axiom. Notwithſtanding the more their infatuation (of whom we ſpeak) exceeds the bounds of all folly or vanity meerly natural, the more it aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to us the truth of the Apoſtles prediction in the place late cited. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>becauſe they received not the love of the truth, therefore hath God ſent them ſtrong</hi>

For were they not men of rare wit and exquiſit learning; were not this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion withall, of all that are or can be imagined the moſt ſottiſhly improbable, and prepoſterouſly impious; the print of Gods finger, thus confounding their brain, could not be ſo eminent or diſcernable. The <hi>firſt bait, caſt out by Satan, was but to draw the Romiſh Clergie unto practices, ſo ſuſpitious amongst the people that they could not be juſtified, but by a conceit of infallibility:</hi> and not check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pride, being challenged of error in doctrin, and impiety in their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; the Lord gave them over to believe <hi>this monſter of falſhood and untruth,</hi> a bottomleſſe pit of hypocritical prepoſterous blaſphemies.</p>
