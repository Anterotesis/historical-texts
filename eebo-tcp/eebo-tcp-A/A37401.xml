            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>"POLONIAN LIBERTY": THE FIRST ENGLISH RECOGNITION OF JOHN SOBIESKI</head>
            <byline>WRITTEN BY JOHN MILTON THE RAREST OF ALL HIS FIRST EDITIONS IN ENGLISH</byline>
            <p>50 [MILTON, John.] A Declaration, or Letters Patents of the Election of this present King of Poland John the Third . . . containing . . . his eminent Services in War, especially in his last great Victory against the Turks and Tartars, whereof many Particulars are here related, not published before. Now faithfully translated from the Latin Copy. London: Printed by Brabazon Aylmer . . . 1673.</p>
            <p>Sm. 4to., full crimson morocco.</p>
            <p>First editon of Milton's last publication, which, "like his first, appeared anonymously . . . a final reminder that its translator was a man of broadly European culture, interested to the end in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>national affairs" (Parker, I, 638).</p>
            <p>This version in the English language of the Latin document—"newly arrived from Poland" describing the election and accession of John Sobieski to the independent throne of Poland—"would seem to be the rarest of all Milton first editions . . . except for the privately printed <hi>Epitaphium Damonis</hi> [in Latin, <hi>c.</hi> 1640, British Library unique]" (Parker, II, 1151).</p>
            <p>Only five other copies are known; the British Library, Christ's College, Cambridge, in U.K., and, in America, Texas, Yale, Indiana (Harmsworth). New Wing adds Library of Congress (perhaps— Harmsworth) and Harvard, which Parker indicates has been missing since 1947 (it has since been found, we are pretty happy to say). Parker's note at II, 1212, remarks that "the exhibition catalogue of the Illinois <hi>Collection of First Editions</hi> . . . claims to include `every first edition of Milton's works', but omits this one".</p>
            <p>New Wing D 779; Parker, II, 1151, 1212, App. 2, no. 80. Masson, <hi>Life of Milton,</hi> VI, 725-7.</p>
            <p>72. <hi>LR,</hi> v. 83-84; Phillips (1694), p. liii (not in Darbishire); Masson, VI. 725-7. The collation of <hi>A Declaration</hi>: 4<hi rend="sup">0</hi>: A-B<hi rend="sup">4</hi>; pp. [ii], 12, [2]. The contents: pp. [i-ii], blank; p. [1], title; p. [2], blank; pp. 3-12, text; pp. [13-14], blank. It is through Phillips that we know of Milton's translation of this work. Wood and Aubrey omitted the <hi>Declaration</hi> in their bibliographies, but Toland noticed Phillips's entry, and the translation was reprinted in 1698. There is no reason to doubt Phillips's attribution; the publisher, Brabazon Aylmer, also published Milton's <hi>Epistoloe</hi> in 1674, and later his <hi>Brief History of Moscovia.</hi> French wrote that `No satisfactory explanation for his [Milton's] having performed this unusual task at this period in his age has been offered', but surely none is needed beyond the business acumen of Aylmer, who, if he did not request the translation, readily saw the need of it.</p>
            <p>Milton's name does not appear. This may be a reason for the great scarcity of surviving copies. Wing (D779) lists only three, but the following five or six libraries, perhaps with some others, have copies of the first edition: British Museum, Christ's College, Harvard (missing since 1947), Indiana (Harmsworth), Texas, and Yale. Except for the privately printed <hi>Epitaphium Damonis</hi> (1640?), this would seem to be the rarest of all Milton first editions, though some additional libraries may have copies catalogued solely under `Declaration', or `John III', or `Poland', or `Sobieski'. <hi>Articles of Peace</hi> (1649), containing Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's anonymous 'Observations', is a close third in scarcity, with only ten copies known to me.</p>

            <p>WE Declare by these our present Letters unto all and single Persons whom it may concern: Our Commonwealth being again left Widowed, by the unseasonable death of that famous MICHAEL late King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who having scarce reigned full five years, on the tenth day of <hi>November</hi> of the year last past, at <hi>Leopolis,</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his fading Crown for one Immortal; in the sence of so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46271:4"/>
mournful a Funeral and fresh Calamity, yet with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage, mindful of her self in the midst of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, forbore not to seek Remedies, that the World may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand she grows in the midst of her losses; it pleased her to begin her Counsels of preserving her Country, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it from the utmost chances of an Interreign, from the Divine Deity, (as it were by the only motion of whose fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) it is easie that Kingdoms be transferred from Nation to Nation, and Kings from the lowest state to Thrones; And therefore the business was begun according to our Countrey-Laws and Ancestors Institutions. After the Convocation of all the States of the Kingdom ended, in the month of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> at <hi>Warsaw,</hi> by the common consent of all those States on the day decreed for the Election the 20th of <hi>April</hi>; At the report of this famous Act, as though a Trumpet had been sounded, and a Trophy of Vertue erected, the wishes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Forreign Princes came forth of their own accord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Field of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Liberty, in a famous strife of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and good-will towards the Commonwealth, every one bringing their Ornaments, advantages and Gifts to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: But the Commonwealth becoming more diligent by the prodigal ambition used in the last Interreign, and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and disagreeings of minds, nor careless of the future, considered with her self whether firm or doubtful things were promised, and whether she should seem from the present state to transfer both the old and new honours of <hi>Poland</hi> into the possession of strangers, or the military glory, and their late unheard of Victory over the <hi>Turks,</hi> and blood spilt in the war, upon the purple of some unwarlike Prince; as if any one could so soon put on the love of the Country, and that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was not so much an enemy to her own Nation and Fame, as to favour strangers more than her own; and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour being found in her, should suffer a Guest of new Power to wax proud in her; therefore she thenceforth turned her
<pb facs="tcp:46271:4"/>
thoughts upon some one in her own Nation, and at length abolished (as she began in the former Election) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach cast upon her, under pretence of a secret Maxime, <hi>That none can be elected King of</hi> Poland <hi>but such as are born out of Poland</hi>; neither did she seek long among her Citizens whom she should prefer above the rest (for this was no uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or suspended Election, there was no place for delay;) for although in the equality of our Nobles many might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, yet the vertue of a Hero appeared above his equals, therefore the eyes and minds of all men were willingly and by a certain divine instinct turned upon the High Marshal of the Kingdom, Captain of the Army <hi>Iohn Sobietski.</hi> The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vertue of the Man, the High Power of Marshal in the Court, with his supreme command in Arms, Senatorial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with his civil Modesty, the extraordinary Splendor of his Birth and Fortune, with open Courtesie, Piety towards God, love to his Fellow-Citizens in words and deeds; Constancy, Faithfulness, and Clemency towards his very enemies, and what noble things soever can be said of a Hero, did lay such Golden Chains on the Minds and Tongues of all, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and People of <hi>Poland</hi> and of the great Dukedome of <hi>Lituania</hi>; with Suffrages and agreeing Voices named and chose him their KING; not with his seeking nor precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate counsel, but with mature Deliberations continued and extended till the third day.</p>
            <p>Certainly it conduced much for the honour of the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Elect, the Confirmation of a free Election, and the eternal praise of the People electing, that the great business of an Age was not transacted in one day, or in the Shadow of the night, or by one casuul heat: for it was not right that a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro of the Age, should in a moment of time (and as it were by the cast of a Die) be made a King, when as Antiquity by an ancient Proverb has delivered, that <hi>Hercules</hi> was not begot
<pb facs="tcp:46271:5"/>
in one night; and it hath tought that Election should shine openly under a clear Sky, in the open Light.</p>
            <p>The most serene Elect took it modestly that his Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be deferred till the third day, plainly shewing to endeavour, lest his sudden facility of assent being suspected, might detract from their Judgment, and the World might be enforced to believe by a more certain Argument, that he that was so chosen was elected without his own Ambition, or the envy of corrupted Liberty: or was it by the appointed Counsel of God that this debate continued three whole days, from <hi>Saturday</hi> till <hi>Munday,</hi> as if the <hi>Cotimian</hi> Victory (begun on the Saturday, and at length on the third day after accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, after the taking of the <hi>Cotimian</hi> Castle) had been a lucky presage of his Royal Reward; or, as if with an auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Omen,</hi> the third day of Election had alluded to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal name of <hi>IOHN</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>The famous Glory of War paved his way to the Crown, and confirmed the favour of Suffrages to his most serene E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. He the first of all the <hi>Polonians</hi> shewed that the <hi>Seythian</hi> swiftness (troublesome heretofore to all the Monarchies of the World) might be repressed by a standing Fight, and the terrible main Battalion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> might be broken and routed at one stroke. That we may pass by in silence the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rudiments of Warfare which he stoutly and gloriously managed under the Conduct and Authority of another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Swedes, Muscovites, Borussians, Transylvanians</hi> and <hi>Cossacks</hi>; though about sixty Cities taken by him from the <hi>Cossacks</hi> be less noised in the mouth of fame; yet these often and prosperous Battels, were a <hi>Prelude</hi> to greatest Victories in the memory of man. Miriads of <hi>Tartars</hi> had overrun within this six years with their plundering Troops the coast of <hi>Podo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>; when a small force and some shattered Legions were not sufficient against the hostile assault, yet our General knowing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46271:5"/>
not to yeeld, shut himself up (by a new stratagem of War) in <hi>Podhajecy,</hi> a strait Castle, and fortified in haste, whereby he might exclude the cruel destruction which was hastening into the bowels of the Kingdom, by which means the Barbarian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded and routed, took Conditions of Peace; as if he had made his inroad for this only purpose, that he might bring to the most serene Elect, matter of Glory, Victory.</p>
            <p>For these Four last years the famous Victories of <hi>Sobietski</hi> have Signalized every year of his Warlike Command on the <hi>Cossacks,</hi> and <hi>Tartarians,</hi> both joyned together; the most strong Province of <hi>Braclavia,</hi> as far as it lyes betwen <hi>Hypa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> and <hi>Tyral,</hi> with their Cities and Warlike people, were won from the <hi>Cossack</hi> enemy.</p>
            <p>And those things are beyond belief which two years ago the most serene Elect, after the taking of <hi>Camenick,</hi> (being undaunted by the Seige of <hi>Laopolis,</hi>) performed to a Miracle by the hardness and fortitude of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Army, scarce consisting of three thousand men, in the continual course of five days and nights, sustaining life without any food, except wild herbs; setting upon the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> he made famous the names of <hi>Narulum, Niemicrovia, Konarnum, Kalussia,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Towns before, by a great overthrow of the Barbarians. He slew three Sultans of the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi> descended of the royal <hi>Gietian</hi> family, and so trampled on that great force of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that in these latter years they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain their Courage or recollect the Forces. But the felicity of this last Autumn exceeded all his Victories; when-as the fortifications at <hi>Chocimum,</hi> famous of old, were possessed and fortified by above forty thousand Turks, in which three and forty years ago the <hi>Polonians</hi> had sustained and repressed the Forces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, drawn together out of <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> fell to the ground within a few hours; by the only (under God) Imperatorious Valour and Prudence,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46271:6"/>
of <hi>Sobietski</hi>; for he counted it his chief part to go about the Watches, order the Stations, and personally to inspect the preparations of Warlike Ordinance, to encourage the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with voice, hands, and countenance, wearied with hunger, badness of weather, and three days standing in arms; and he (which is most to be admired) on Foot at the head of the foot-forces made thorough and forced his way to the Battery, hazarding his life devoted to God and his Countrey; and thereupon made a cruel slaughter within the Camp and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the Enemy; while the desperation of the <hi>Turks</hi> whetted their valour, and he performed the part of a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and valiant Captain; at which time three <hi>Bashaw's</hi> were slain, the fourth scarce passed with difficulty the swift river of <hi>Tyras</hi>; eight thousand <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> twenty thousand chosen <hi>Spachies,</hi> besides the more Common Souldiers, were cut off; the whole Camp with all their Ammunition, and great Ordinance: besides the <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Phrygian</hi> wealth of luxurious <hi>Asia,</hi> were taken and pillaged, the famous Castle of <hi>Cotimia,</hi> and the Bridg over <hi>Tyras,</hi> strong Fortresses, equal to Castles on each side the River, were additions to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Why therefore should not such renown'd Heroick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be crowned with the legal reward of a Diadem? All <hi>Christendom</hi> have gone before us in example, which being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the recovery of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Godfrey of Bullion,</hi> on their own accord gave him that Kingdom, for that he first scaled the walls of that City. Our most serene Elect is not inferior, for he first also Ascended two main For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The moment of time adorns this Victory unheard-of in many ages, the most serene King <hi>Michael</hi> dying the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it were signifying thereby that he gave way to so great valour, as if it were by his command and favour, that this Conqueror might so much the more gloriously suceed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46271:6"/>
from the Helmet to the Crown, from the Commanders Staff to the Scepter, from his lying in the Field to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Throne.</p>
            <p>The Commonwealth recalled the grateful, and never to be forgotten memory of his Renowned Father, the most Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious and Excellent <hi>Iames Sobietski,</hi> Castellion of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia,</hi> a Man to be written of with sedulous care, who by his Golden Eloquence in the publick Counsels, and by his Hand in the Scene of War, had so often amplified the State of the Commonwealth, and defended it with the Arms of his Family. Neither can we believe it happened without Divine Providence, that in the same place wherein forty years ago his Renowned Father Embassador of the <hi>Polonian</hi>-Common wealth, had made Peace and Covenants with <hi>Cimanus</hi> the Turkish General, his great Son should Revenge with his Sword the Peace broke, (Heaven it self upbraiding the perfidious Enemy). The rest of his Grandsires and Great-Grandsires, and innumerable Names of Famous Senators and great Officers have as it were brought forth light to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Elect by the emolous Greatness and Glory of his Mothers descent, especially <hi>Stanislaus Zelkievius,</hi> High Chancellor of the Kingdom, and General of the Army, at whose Grave in the Neighbouring fields, in which by the <hi>Turkish</hi> rage in the year 1620 he died, his victorious Nephew took full revenge by so remarkable an overthrow of the Enemy: The immortal valour and fatal fall of his most noble Uncle <hi>Stanislaus Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovitius</hi> in the year 1635, Palatine of <hi>Russia,</hi> doubled the Glory of his Ancestors; whom desirous of honour and not induring that sluggish Peace wherein <hi>Poland</hi> then slept secure, valour and youthful heat accited at his own expence and private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, into the Taurick fields; that by his footing and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Warlike Polonian discipline, he might lead and point the way to these merits of <hi>Sobietski,</hi> and being slain by <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miz</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46271:7"/>
the Tartarian Cham, in revenge of his Son by him flain, he might by his Noble blood give lustre to this Regal Purple; neither hath the people of <hi>Poland</hi> forgot the most illustrious <hi>Marcus Sobietski</hi> elder Brother of our most serene Elect, who when the Polonian Army at <hi>Batto</hi> was routed by the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans although occasion was offer'd him of escape, yet chose rather to die in the overthrow of such valiant men, a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for his Countrey, than to buy his life with a dishonourable retreat; perhaps the divine Judgment so disposing, whose order is that persons pass away and fail, and causes and events hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen again the same; that by the repeated fate of the <hi>Hunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> the elder Brother of great hopes removed by a lamented slaughter, might leave to his younger Brother surviving the readier passage to the Throne. That therefore which we pray may be happy, Auspicious and fortunate to our Orthodox Commonwealth, and to all Christendome, with free and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Votes, none opposing, all consenting and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by the right of our free Election, notwithstanding the Absence of those which have been called and not Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, We being led by no private respect, but having only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the Glory of God, the increase of the ancient Catholick Church, the safety of the Commonwealth, and the dignity of the <hi>Polish</hi> Nation and Name, have thought fit to elect, create, and name, <hi>IOHN in Zolkiew and Zloczew So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bietski,</hi> Supreme Marshal General of the Kingdom General of the Armies, Governour of <hi>Neva, Bara, Strya, Loporovient,</hi> and <hi>Kalussien,</hi> most eminently adorned with so high endowments, merits and splendor, to be <hi>KING</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> Grand-Duke of <hi>Lituania, Russia, Prussia, Mazovia, Samogitia, Kyovia, Volhinnia, Padlachita, Podolia, Livonia, Smolensko, Severia,</hi> and <hi>Czerniecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> as we have Elected Created Declared and Named Him; I the afore said Bishop of <hi>Cracovia</hi> (the Archiepiscopal See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vacant) exercising the Office and Authority of Primate and
