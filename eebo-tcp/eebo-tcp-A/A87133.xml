            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

You ſee that all Councils, all things are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Rota,</hi> upon the wheele: from that <hi>Rota</hi> onely which I ſuppoſe you meane; what came forth, came forth unfoiled, and as it went in. We do not by this trial deſpaire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with a little fenſe, the right inſtitution of ſuch a ſocietie may come to compare with Picadilly, play-houſes, or horſe-matches, but if theſe be yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, then indeed</p>

               </q>
Thus applied there may be ſenſe in this quotation: So for your other, had it been affixed unto your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer book, and applied to your ſelf, or thoſe unto whom you wrote journey work for Oligarchy, it might have been well ſaid as in <hi>Aſinar:</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <head>To your Preface.</head>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> ſaies, That without a national Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there can be no libertie of conſcience. And you anſwer, That in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> there were National Religions; therefore in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> there was no libertie of conſcience; which is ſo much the more abſurd in that you cite <hi>Petit:</hi> for confirmation of your conſequence, who affirms the contrary, and that by undeniable authorities, as may be ſeen in the ſecond, third, and fourth pages of his diſcourſe upon the <hi>Attick</hi> Laws, the ſum whereof amounts unto thus much, That albeit there were in <hi>Athens</hi> Laws for the National Religion, yet it by Law was in the <hi>Areopagites</hi> alſo to give liberty unto any other way of worſhip, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſo given was Law, and became a mans right, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were to a publick or private way of worſhip in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168818:2"/>
which manner it is affirmed &amp; proved by the ſame <hi>Petit,</hi> that into <hi>Athens,</hi> beſides the National Religion of that Countrie, were introduced the Religions of almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other countrie. The ſame he affirmeth of <hi>Rome,</hi> where notwithſtanding the National Religion therein eſtabliſhed by <hi>Romulus,</hi> it is vulgarly known that ſcarce any Countrie was ſubdued by them whoſe Religion they did not inſert into their own.</p>
               <p>And where is your truth, who ſay, That Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> entertaines us with diſcourſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> trial at <hi>Athens.</hi> Where doth he ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> was tried there? or what ſaith he of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching there, other then is affirmed by other pens, as that particularly of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius?</hi> But out of this you fall merrily, as thus: Once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time there was a man called <hi>William Thomas,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> muſt for evermore be one and the ſame man.</p>
               <p>This is your way of diſputing, which you carry on in like manner, for example thus.</p>
               <p>Every man is to be taxed for that eſtate whereof he is not owner.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Oceana</hi> is an eſtate whereof Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> is not owner.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Oceana</hi> is an eſtate for which we are to tax Mr. <hi>Harington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the minor be denied, as that <hi>Oceana</hi> is an eſtate whereof Mr. <hi>Harington</hi> is not owner, your diſcourſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this or the like proof of it.</p>
               <p>Where any one man and no other is the conſtant defender of one aud the ſame eſtate or propriety, that one and the ſame eſtate or proprietie is not his but ſome others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168818:3"/>
But Mr. <hi>Harington</hi> and no other is the conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of <hi>Oceana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Oceana</hi> is no eſtate or propriety of Mr. <hi>Harringtons,</hi> but of ſome other. Now if it pleaſe you</p>
            </div>

               <head>To the Body of your Work.</head>
               <p>Sir, to a man who pretends not to underſtand a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it is no ſhame not to underſtand that language: but it is a ſhame to a man, and a Schollar who pretends to ſenſe, not to underſtand ſenſe. If I ſhall make it plaine that in this point you come ſhort, I ſhall have vindicated the Greek of your Authours from your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant application of the ſame, without troubling the Reader with any more languages then his mother tongue. You, in pretending to have found <hi>Oceana</hi> light, weigh only <hi>Sparta,</hi> nor that truly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Senate of <hi>Sparta</hi> was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> you argue, That it was not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eligible by the people; whereas all Authors, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Ariſtotle, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. affirm, That the Magiſtracies in <hi>Sparta</hi> were all choſen by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as that of <hi>Senator;</hi> or choſen, and alſo born by the people, as that of <hi>Ephori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the miſtakes you lay unto Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> in the Greek, as, That the Tribes in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> were pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent to the Oracle, what maketh that to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? And that the word <hi>Obae</hi> doth not ſignifie <hi>Linages,</hi> you will hardly perſwade, ſeeing <hi>Aymiot,</hi> thought to be as good an Interpreter of the Greek as Mr. <hi>Stuls,</hi> in rendring the Oracle, hath theſe words, <hi>Aprez que tu auras diviſé le peuple en ligniees.</hi> But I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168818:3"/>
the Reader with forreign Languages; things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable ſhall hereafter be brought for interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words you diſpute at a dear rate, giving ſo much Greek for two pence as you have made not worth an half penny. Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> ſtates the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Sparta,</hi> thus,</p>
               <p>Lycurgus <hi>inſtituted a Senate eligible by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for life, with right to debate and propoſe, and a popular Aſſembly with power to reſolve. To which he adds the place in</hi> Plutarch. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus tempered the form of this Common-wealth: it ſeemed nevertheleſs to them who came after, that the ſmall number of thirty perſons <hi>(and for life)</hi> whereof this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate conſiſted, was the cauſe of greater force and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the fame then was convenient; for which cauſe to hold in this ſame Senate, they <hi>(the people)</hi> gave them the Senate, <hi>(as Plato ſaith)</hi> the curb, which was the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> Magiſtrates created about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years after the death of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Theopompus,</hi> who to his wife reproaching him in diſdain, that he muſt thus baſely leave his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom leſs unto his Succeſſors, then he had received of his Predeceſſors; <hi>Made Anſwer,</hi> That he ſhould leave it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in regard that it would be more firm and durable.</p>
               <p>Hereby it is apparent, when the Senate upon theſe advantages of fewneſs, and for life, began to propoſe perverſely unto the people, then the people began to <hi>add, diminiſh, pervert and evert what the Senate propoſed,</hi> that is, they began (as in like caſes is inavoidable) to debate. And the people thus taking upon them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Theopompus</hi> being Kings, indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add unto the fundamental Lawe, <hi>That if the</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168818:4"/>
                  <hi>people did not determine well, then the Senators and the Kings ſhould stop the procedure.</hi> Hereupon, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their fundamental Laws, the people erected the Court of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> conſiſting of annual Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates choſen by and out of themſelves, and with power to queſtion any of their Kings or Senators upon their lives, that ſhould go about to pervert thoſe Laws. Thus by this patch of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> came that flaw in <hi>Sparta</hi> (wherewith Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> for that reaſon propoſing otherwiſe, is not concerned) to be amended. And this is the account he gives of that Common-wealth, which you, perverting the whole ſtory, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to weigh otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inferring that the people were guilty of thoſe miſcarriages, which it is plain proceeded from the Senate, and were rectified by the people, in the inſtitution of that <hi>Curb upon the Senate</hi> (as is plainly ſhewn by <hi>Plutarch)</hi> in the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You infer from you know not what, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate had a Negative Vote, and yet confeſſe that the people had no right to debate. Whereas to leave words or <hi>Canting,</hi> (for yonr Greek, as you uſe it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more) and come as I ſaid to the undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Teſtimony of things or of ſenſe. If the popular Aſſembly had no right to debate, how ſhould the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate have a Negative? Or if the popular Aſſembly had right to the reſult only, then who but themſelves could have the Negative? <hi>Contra rationem nemo ſobrius, contra experientiam nemo ſanus.</hi> For that which you alledge out of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> as that he calleth the Senate of <hi>Sparta</hi> Lords of the people, it can (conſidering the nature of this Common-wealth, which <hi>Iſocrates</hi> to the <hi>Areopagites</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:168818:4"/>
affirms to be popular) be no otherwiſe underſtood, then as they who have the like function, I mean of debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and propoſing unto the Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are called Lords of the Articles. Lord in this ſenſe as you (in great letters ſetting a mark upon your ignorance, aud not interpreting your text) would imply, doth not ſignifie <hi>Sovereign,</hi> for neither are the Lords of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles <hi>ſovereign,</hi> nor doth <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> affirm that of the Senate of <hi>Sparta.</hi> But where the Propoſers are few, and for life, as in <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> and as the greater No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Officers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they may in ſome ſenſe be called Lords of the people, though not they, but the people have the reſult.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> hath long ſince ſhewed that among the Greeks, the words <hi>Oligarchy</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi> were underſtood in ſuch manner, that where the popular Aſſembly had the reſult only, there the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was ſometimes called <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the propoſing Counſel conſiſted of few, and for life, as in <hi>Sparta;</hi> and where the people had not only the reſult but debate alſo, that was called <hi>Democracy,</hi> as in <hi>Athens.</hi> Hence that an Oligarchiſt in your ſenſe, or one that hath endeavoured to make <hi>Helots</hi> and <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites,</hi> or ſervants of ſuch as are now his Lords and Maſters, is no Ideot, there is no conſequence, even for what hath happened in our dayes. <hi>Quid verba audio, cum facta videam?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
