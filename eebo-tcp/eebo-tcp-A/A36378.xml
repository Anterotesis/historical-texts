            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
Speech spoken by
the Earle of DORSET, unto
His Majesty at OXFORD,
concerning the Warre now
in ENGLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Most gracious Soveraigne:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not altogether unsensible of this
businesse, wherein I am now called to
give my advice, I know I shall suffer
some disadvantage, being an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
by Nation and Education, and the best bloud
that runs in my veines I have extracted thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
my fortunes have their scituation within
these confines. What I shall now speak, is not
meerely <hi>ex animo, sed ex corde:</hi> some may haply
impute it as proceeding from strength of affection
to that place and people from whence I came; but
I doe protest, my zeale to your Majesty shall at
this time suspend the agitation of such principals,
and I will set aside all particular relations, and
looke upon the question as it is, and not as passion
and affection may set it forth.</p>
            <p>The question is concerning Wars, an unknown
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54663:3"/>
subject, sweet to those that have not tryed it, yet
the worst of war is usuall in the close: And if the
conclusion of the most advantagious war that ever
was waged, when all reckonings bee cast up, the
Conquerour hath had little whereof to glory. But
this is not a warre betweene a King and a stranger,
but between a Soveraigne and his Subjects, a neare
relation, and they had need to be weighty motives
that shall dissolve this knot; subjects are easily
lost, we see the worke is every day, but once lost,
are hardly regained. Affections are like to cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall
glasses, which broken, are hardly set together
againe.</p>
            <p>But these are not subjects, as the kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
speaketh of, <hi>A people that I know not are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto mee;</hi> but your Majesty may say of them,
as <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Eue,</hi> that was found out of his rib,
<hi>Flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone;</hi> or rather as
<hi>David</hi> of his subjects in the day of his Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>For my brethren and companions sake;</hi> for your
Majesty being theirs, and they yours by a double
tye, you are not only <hi>Rex factus,</hi> but <hi>Rex natus:</hi>
And therefore the union being so straight, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
had need be weighty, that shall cause a man to
set his owne house a fire, and to destroy the worke
of his owne hands.</p>
            <p>Now let us consider two things: first, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Warre, secondly, the motives unto it,
whether they be <hi>Tanti,</hi> and of such moment, that
a King should hazard the uncertaine chance of
warre, and the miseries that accompany it, rather
then to forgo the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54663:3"/>
For the first, it is a good note of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that
<hi>Bellona</hi> should be <hi>ultimum refugium,</hi> because it is
the worst refuge. And if we consider of the wisest
Kings that ever ware Scepter in the latter times,
how willing they were to deliver the stroake of
warre almost upon any termes.</p>
            <p>If your Majesty consider but the practise of
King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh,
which of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in the large List and
Catalogue of all their Kings, cannot point forth
two of more deepe and profound judgement, and
better versed in the mystery of Government; yet
what meanes they use (or rather did use) to divert
the course, if at any time it did come within their
Channell; they counted it no dishonour to yeeld
to their Subjects demands, though sometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and unreasonable, nay, themselves to bee the
first seekers, and propounders of Peace. And so by
this meanes, when the storme was over, and things
come to be debated upon the great Corpit, they
were masters of their own ends, and their subjects
affections, and so obtained the victory without
striking a stroke.</p>
            <p>These wise Kings considered the end of war was
uncertaine, and the event various, and he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
one Errour in the warre, especially when
the seat of it is in his owne Kingdome, seldome
times to commit a second: wee need not to goe far
for instances, <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and <hi>Edward</hi> the
second will be fresh presidents for any that shall
endevour to buy the experience hereof upon such
deare termes as they did. It should be in the body
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54663:4"/>
Politique, as it is in the body naturall. Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
should never be used, but when the humours
are so predominant, that no other course will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them, and that unlesse they be expelled, they
will occasion desolation.</p>
            <p>But blessed be God there is no such necessity in
the case, there are some rough humours in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Politique, it <unclear>cannot</unclear> be denyed, and some it may
bee that worke obstruction in some of the lesser
pipes of government, but when your <hi>Vena Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> are full of the royall spirits in
them, have their proper influence and motion
without any opposition. What is now to be done
by force is not fit for every <unclear>subject</unclear>, some humours
are to be expelled by <hi>lena <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ines,</hi> when all purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make them malignant. There are three means
to be used that have not been tryed, any of which
are better then the meanes prescribed. The first
removes the occasion; this can bee no impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Scepter, the wisest Kings have had
their oversight in government, which a wiser day
have taught them to recall.</p>
            <p>Your Father reigned gloriously, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the affections as wel as the body of the English,
yet he never sought the obtruding of <hi>minimus infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi>
and yet none more zealous of a Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
then he: it is an act of the extreamest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hazard the substance for a shadow, not worthy
to be contended for: And if your Majesty were
Master of your own desires, it would not adde one
cubit to your stature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if this like not, let time work it forth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54663:4"/>
and by this meanes swallow up the hooke or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxor,
the proposall of it left, recreets distastefull
things, works most at first, least afterwards; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
your Majesty may work them to that (which
for the present) they wil rather dye then embrace:
We see how by degrees the Romans brought a
Royall slavery upon the world, which if they had
at first propounded upon down-right termes, had
hardly been accomplished: If ever Norman <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
by degrees brought the English to weare the
yoke, which if he had at the first tendred, he either
must have missed his ayme, or Norman no people
to employ; so impatient then were the English
Nation to heare of a Conqueror, and we see it is
sometimes costly.</p>
            <p>What if your Majesty should seem to yeeld to
the demands of the English now, and give the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of a faire game, cannot your Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the objects by degrees, turne the humours
some other way for a more seasonable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to scrue in things by instruments more fit and
lesse subject to exception; the proposall of the
course I hold more certain, more safe, more secure,
which knowes no law, but devoures all the other.
And I hold that Kingdome most miserable which
is forced to make use of a remedy worse then the
disease.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the first, there is no necessity of
Warre, <hi>Rebus sic stantibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, these things in agitation are not <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
of such consequence as should require such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
adventure, as to hazard a kingdom at a cast.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54663:5"/>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> wisely compared those that know onely
to propose the means to such as fish with a golden
hooke, the losse of which hooke is of more conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
then the fish they can take; truly to speake
plainly what I think, they that advise war in this
case, know not what it is to get, nor greatly care
for the losse of a Kingdom, so they may play their
own games, and fish in troubled waters; suce coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours
as these were the Bishops of <hi>Rosse</hi> to the
late Queene of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Brookes</hi> to
that miserable King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who was the cause
and occasion to bring the <hi>Turke</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and
the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> both which Nations have
cause to wish that they never knew the way thither
againe.</p>
            <p>Three Reasons have been given to perswade to
war, I will not now Answer, but leave to him that
is better able, and instructed to such a purpose;
whereof considering <hi>nulla salus Bello, nulla necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
Belli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Advice to your Majesty is not to use warre,
but when the end of it is a certaine or probable
peace, and when there is no way left but that only
to obtaine it.</p>
