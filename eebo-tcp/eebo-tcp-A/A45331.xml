            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for to nourish the haire, or to wear long haire, and then the Apostles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is cogent. <hi>q. d.</hi> 'Tis both a sinne and a shame, and that by the dictate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for a man to weare long haire: But if a woman have long haire, it is a glory and ornament to her, for her haire was given her for a covering; it is a shame therefore for her to be shorne or polled, but she must be covered, because of the Angels, who observe their immodest and indecent carriage: yet, if any man list to be contentious, and will rather stand to justifie these unseemly fashions, let it suffice him, that we have no such customes of immodesty and indecency, nor any of the other Churches of Christ, so as he shall be singular in this his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The Scripture no where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns a long Beard, but it oft condemns long haire. 3.

Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is our Rule, condemnes long Haire, and the practice of Gods dearest servants walking up to the Rule, may confirme, comfort &amp; encourage us against it.

And shall we forsake our civill, modest guise for feare of their vaine censures? <hi>Let them returne to thee, but goe not thou to them.</hi> Gods people are called light, and they must be like fire, which turnes all things into it selfe, but it is turned into none of them; they must persist in graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes, and draw others to them, but in no wise must they turn to the wicked,

                  <p n="5">5. Lying is unlawfull; but this painting and disguising of faces, is no better than dissimulation and lying; they teach their faces to lye, and to shew what it is not; and so by deceiving others, at last they deceive themselves, getting deformity <note place="margin">Fucus faciei est deformatio Dei ipsius operis in nobis, &amp; damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis. <hi>Danaeus.</hi>

modest wayes, but not by sinfull, immodest, lustfull guises; let them be as carefull as they please, to please their Husbands in all that good is, and without guile: for as Servants must observe their Masters commands onely in the Lord, so Wives must observe their Husbands commands no further than may stand with Gods glory, remembring they have an Husband in Heaven. And if they themselves would not be cheated so as to take an old, painted, deformed man, instead of a fair, lovely man, why should they goe about to put such fallacies on men, that themselves cannot endure? True, a man or woman may cover a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall defect by lawfull meanes; but by no meanes may they set a new face, or forme on the body, for this were dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, which is condemned in deedes, as well as in words.</p>

world. These are Leprosie-spots, not Beauty-spots, spots that defile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base, but no whit adorne the wearers of them. Such spots, many times, are the husbands blots. Christs Spouse knowes no such spots, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 7. she is wholly fair, and there is no <hi>spot</hi> (of wilfull pride or vanity) in her: her modest, grave, and plaine attire we must follow, and not the fashion of every vaine fantastick person.</p>
