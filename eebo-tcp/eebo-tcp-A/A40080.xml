            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I thank you for your Charity; I perceive you can read my disturbance in my Face, and seeing you invite me to discover the reasons of it, I will conceal nothing from you.</p>
               <p>There are no Temporal Affairs which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any disquiet to my thoughts: it's nothing of this Life, but what concerns the next, which is the cause of the perplexity, which (I perceive by you) is so visible in me. I must confess that of late, I have read the Books, and frequented the Company of some <hi>Quakers:</hi> and to my Apprehension, they argue strongly. They positively affirm that they are the People of God. You implead them for Cheats and Impostors: If they be in the right, God forbid, that I should be found in any other way: if you be in the right, I am sensible of my danger, if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert you: for mine own part (if I know mine own thoughts) I have no passion, or interest to gratifie, besides the Salvation of my poor Soul, and gladly would I do for the best, God direct me. If you can convince, me that these People walk in any perverse way, I shall soon abandon all communion with them, but if you cannot so do, you must not wonder, that I wholly joyn with them, in the exercise of Religion.</p>

               <p>I thank you for your freedom, and commend your serious inclinations, and I wish you well advised in the conduct of them. I must confess that I have been often told, that you have frequented the Company of <hi>Quakers:</hi> and am confirmed in that report by your own confession; yet am not a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that you are not so far gone, but that you are willing to try the Spirit of <hi>Quakerism,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will altogether yield to the Delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. Therefore I pray declare the Grounds of your Dissatisfaction; and so long as you keep within the bounds of your wonted Modesty, and Humility (so rarely to be found amongst those of that Sect) I shall not despair to give you full satisfaction in your most important Scruples.</p>

               <p>I am glad that you sent for me, and more glad that I had the good Manners to be ready at your Call: and take it not for flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery if I tell you, that the Respects which I bear to your Person, are most sincere and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; therefore shall I the more willingly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my Disgusts, and the cause of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Dissatisfaction.</p>

               <p>Being upon a certain time, at a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Meeting, a Notable Speaker (being there) propounded this to the Consciences of the 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55698:6"/>
Hearers; Whether any among them could affirm, that he had received any Spiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by his long frequenting of the <hi>Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-houses?</hi> and bad him, if after enquiry he found no profit by it, further propound this Quaery to himself, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> for if God had any regard to the Priests, or their Worship, he would not be wanting to give a Blessing to their Ways, to which (said he) experience shews the contrary. Now comparing what he said, with the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mine own heart, the words became a great wound in it, and made me conclude, that all this while I have been in a wrong Box; and that if the present Ministry were from God, it would have witnessed it self by its efficacy.</p>

               <p>Let me tell you here, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for you to give any right judgment of <note place="margin">Some Mens not profiting under the present Ministry, not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> the efficacy of any Divine Ordinance by the present apprehension you have of its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon you, neither is the goodness or badness of the Ministry, to be measured by the want of a sensible effect upon the hearts of indisposed, and careless Hearers, but from its agreeableness to the Divine Institution, and real tendency to its proper end, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls. Was <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Barrenness imputable unto <hi>Jacob?</hi> The Sower in <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. sows his seed, and we read of a great miscarriage, but where was the fault? in the Seed or Soil?

who had mingled Tares therewith? <hi>Isaiah</hi> of old complained, that he had <hi>laboured in vain, and spent his strength, for nought, and in vain, Esai.</hi> 49. 4. Did this Confession of his, render him a false Prophet? Or did <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi>'s ill Success in his Ministry, accuse him, and excuse that Rebellious People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom he exercised it? Many that heard Christ himself received no benefit; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Tears he shed over Stiff-necked <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;</hi> Must their Non-proficiency blemish the Excellency of his Doctrine? A Man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd in his health, may receive good food, which may turn to unwholsome Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; Is the meat, or the disorder of his Stomach to be blamed? I wish that some of our most Zealous Separatists, would here consider, that we must not esteem that, most powerful, and profitable, which produceth only Sensible Consolations, working upon the tender Inferiour Faculties of the Soul: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the strong grown Christian (such as the <hi>English</hi> Ministry designs to make men) hath his Religion seated in the Rational Powers, and measures not the goodness of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry from those little warmths, heats, and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes (which Weak Heads admire as Divine Fires) but from its tendency to uniform, through, conscientious Obedience, that is, the performance of all Duty in its Latitude, both to God and Man, together with our selves: Real profit is obedience, and holiness 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55698:7"/>
of Life; not Talkativeness, Censoriousness, singularity, some little warmth of affection, or hasty conceits of Gods favour: so that if you state the question right, it will be this; not whether you have profited by our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, but whether you might not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, had not the fault been in your selves? Alas! it's our hearts grief, that our people should come into the Church, as the beasts into Noah's Ark; go out beasts, as they came in beasts; or like unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine, no fatter for all their feeding. Can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Divine justice will charge upon the Ministry the non-proficiency of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when the neglect is not in them? who then so miserable as they? but that which is the comfort of all good Ministers is, that they must give an account of their labours, but not of the success of them. We are Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for Christ; now Embassadours are not to be judged by the success of their Embassy, but by their integrity, and a due regard to their Instructions. It will not be ask't us at the great day what souls we have gained, but what faithfulness we have used in our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration; and our reward shall be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Labours, and not according to the success of them as you may be informed from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</hi> The dust <note place="margin">

               <p>We acknowledge no such thing; for we cannot yield our errand to be fruitless, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the most obdurate, and impenitent (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15, 16.) to whom it is the <hi>savour of death, unto death,</hi> for the glory of Gods revenging justice to those that have rejected his mercy.</p>

               <p>No, for (blessed be God) we can give a more comfortable account of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours then this: For if you, and others have not profited by our Labours, we can instance in those that have; who have given large testimonies of their proficiency, by the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary holiness of their lives, and will be one day dreadful witnesses, against the despisers of that Ministry, and the publick ordinances, which those holy Souls so profited by.</p>

               <p>It cannot be denyed, but that many have frequented those Ordinances <hi>(as you call them)</hi> yet have truly reaped no benefit by

               <p>I shall yield to the matter of fact, but not to your placing of the fault. Shall the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances, or those to whose Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are committed, be blamed for the ignorance or negligence of the hearers?</p>

               <p>That there are scandalous Ministers in the World, is too sad a truth; and which indeed ought to be lamented in the most brinish tears; But then it ought to be consider'd, that in a setled National Ministry (such as ours is) consisting of great Numbers in Holy Orders, it cannot be expected to be otherwise, but that some men, for a corrupt Interest, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55698:10"/>
themselves into these sacred Offices; which is not to be charged upon our function, since there was a <hi>Judas</hi> among the chosen twelve. But then, as a little blasted Corn makes a great show in a Field, yet when ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, will lye in a small Room, so I hope these scandalous Ministers will prove but few, when compared with the number of such, that truly thirst after the Honour of God in a faithful discharge of their Duty.</p>

This age is so maliciously wicked, that every seeming fault in a Clergy-man is aggravated to the highest pitch; every Mole-hill is made a Mountain, and every Mote a Beam. Let our actions be never so innocent; a wrong construction is put upon them, to render us odious. If a Clergy-man mannage his outward affairs by Prudential rules, and frees himself from the charge of Infidelity <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note> by caring honestly for his Family; then he is covetous; If he be free and bountiful, then he is Prodigal.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>The reason is, that custome has so far prevailed that sometimes we say <hi>Thou</hi> to express a familiarity; to another <hi>You</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a civil respect.</p>

               <p>Now you speak out, and here let me tell you that the <hi>Quakers</hi> will triumph in the advantage you have given them, for when you address your selves to God, you say <hi>(Thou)</hi> when to men, you say <hi>(You)</hi> the consequence of all is, that you give more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to man, than God.</p>

               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> will find that they have no occasion to triumph; no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of respect being appropriated to <hi>You</hi> or <hi>Thou,</hi> or any other words, but what they have by custome, and common usage, which in the present case hath taught us to use the word <hi>Thou</hi> in a different sense, in Temporal and Spiritual relations: and thus it's only in Civil matters that we say <hi>(You)</hi> to a single person: but in Religious Offices we say <hi>(Thou)</hi> to the greatest Personages on earth, as will appear by consulting the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Church. Whosoever is to be Baptized, the Form of words run thus, N. <hi>I baptize thee,</hi> &amp;c.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>But while you make use of the term <hi>Thou</hi> in Religious Offices, why are you not as much bound to use it in Civil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>We suppose the use of <hi>(You)</hi> or <hi>(Thou)</hi> to be a matter in it self wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and morally neither good, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55698:13"/>
 and therefore no matter of Conscience, nor just occasion of Scruple; but a thing imputable to innocent custome, which until you can prove sinful, or unlawful, or any where in Scripture prohibited, see, how you can clear your selves of the guilt of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, Pharisaism, <hi>by laying heavy burdens</hi> upon the Consciences of men, when indeed God has left them at liberty.</p>

               <p>I begin with that in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;</hi> which Text I understand thus; that from God Almighty's Example, we are not to give any outward respects to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of men.</p>

               <p>That you put a false interpretation upon these words, will evidently appear, if you throughly consult the foregoing passages of that Chapter; especially if you call to mind, what the vision of the Sheet to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the vision of an Angel to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> did truely import: the sense of the Text under debate appearing to be no more than this; that the Partition Wall is now to be broken down, and that the Gospel is Catholick, that is, of an universal concern, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within the narrow limits of one Nation or people; but like the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which shines on all. No matter now where our Country is, who were our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, or what our present circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are, as to the flesh: for God hath no respect to our personal capacities, whether we be <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> Bond or Free, Rich or Poor, Noble or Ignoble, <hi>in reference to our salvation:</hi> The qualifications he now looks at, is <hi>fearing him, and working righteousness,</hi> and then we need not fear but to be <hi>accepted of him.</hi> This will now tell you what is meant
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55698:14"/>
by respecting persons in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s notion, and you will find the like case in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>for there is no respect of persons with God.</hi> What is there meant by respecting persons in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sense, the foregoing Verse will inform you, <hi>But glory, honour, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.</hi>

               <p>But suppose these words do wholly relate to the Calling in of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> yet the four first verses of 2 <hi>Jam.</hi> will come home to my purpose; the words are these, <hi>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons; for if there come a man into your assemblies, with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come a poor man in vile raiment, and you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to him that weareth the gay cloathing, and not to the poor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Are not you then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in your seives, and become judges of evil thoughts?</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>This Supposition will appear to be well grounded, when we consider that the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Law, whereby it was provided that when a Rich man and a Poor had a suit together in their Courts of Judicature, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both must Sit, or both Stand in the same rank, to avoid all marks of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

               <p>But is it not a more agreeable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to say, that the Apostle by <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> means all Civil Meetings whatsoever? that when Christians meet at a Feast, or in any place, on whatsoever occasion, they should shew no civil respect whatsoever, to one more than another?</p>

Where difference and degrees of honour and place are evidently allowed by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, plainly intimating, that as one place is higher than another, so some persons are more honourable than others; and as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship is only due to God, so Civil worship or respect, is due to man; yea and to one man more than another.</p>

               <p>With ease: for in the same notion that we are forbidden to call Master, we are also forbidden to call Father: for in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verse of the Text objected it's said, <hi>Call no man Father upon earth.</hi> So then the <hi>Quakers</hi> bring this Tenent to this strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, that a child must honour his father, but must not call him father, that a Servant must obey his Master, but must not call him Master.

               <p>For your satisfaction herein: you must know that the Scribes and Pharisees had so far incroacht upon Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick and Regal offices, that they had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped an absolute Authority, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Faith and Consciences of men; imposing the traditions and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own Brains as so many absolute Laws in the Church of God, and not only so, but assumed Titles answerable to those usurpations which were <hi>[Rabbi] [Father]</hi> and <hi>[Master]</hi> and some of these great <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure cheats</hi> were as Lordly in their <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop in the Conclave, or as <hi>George Fox</hi> is said to be at <hi>Devonshire</hi> house.

               <p>Because our Saviour elsewhere saith, <hi>when you come into a bouse salute it, Matth.</hi> 10. 12. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. seems to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wholy composed of Salutations as you may see at large. See also <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. To all this I may add the reason of the thing, which will render the objection more frivolous: for a saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only an outward testification of love and affection. And can any be so senseless as to suppose the Religion of love forbids your Characters and expressions of it? the usage is Christian and commendable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Prayers and well-wishes to those we meet, and is a testification of our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Image of God, wheresoever we do meet with it, and of our respect to humane nature.</p>
               <p>And for your further confirmation I have this to add, that the practice of the Saints herein, do's sufficiently vindicate the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the thing. I begin with <hi>Jacobs</hi> demeanour towards his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. Where you will find that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55698:18"/>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> calls himself no less then five times his Servant, and called <hi>Esau</hi> eight times his Lord, and when they met bowed seven times before him: which Civility and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in all probability he learned from his Grand-Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom we read that <hi>he bowed down himself to the Children of the land, Gen.</hi> 23. 12. When <hi>Eli</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Hannah</hi> supposing she had been drunk, the mistake whereof might have provoked her being Innocent, yet she made no passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reply: but said, <hi>no my Lord, for I am a woman of a sorrowful Spirit,</hi> I <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 15. Pray observe with what civility <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> congratulates <hi>Davids</hi> return, at every address, it is, <hi>My Lord the King, let him take all, for as much as my Lord the King is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in peace,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 30. Next I will shew you that there is the same strain along in the new Testament. St. <hi>Luke</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating his Gospel to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> salutes him with the Title of <hi>most excellent Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Chap.</hi> 1. 3.

And there is one thing more which is to me very remarkable, that Friendship is a great Moral and Christian duty: but then take <hi>Friend,</hi> as it is a civil Title, and we shall find that our blessed Saviour gives it even to that infamous Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 27. 50. <hi>Friend where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou come?</hi>

               <p>You expect that all good Christians should joyn in Communion with you; and what reason have they so to do: when in your Service-book you confess your selves not only Sinners, but <hi>Miserable Sinners,</hi> and would you have us joyn with sinners?</p>

               <p>I must confess that I took up this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument too hastily from one <hi>Levingston:</hi> but I pray resolve me, whether the publick form of Confession be not contradictory to that Evangelical Doctrine of an unsinning state of perfection even in this life?</p>

               <p>If Confession of sin be a Christian duty (as all who own the Scriptures must acknowledg) then are we not only innocent in the practise of it, but consequently the <hi>Quakers</hi> notion of Perfection is utterly false.</p>

Where you have not only a precept but a pattern from God himself; shewing that the perfection there required isan unsinning perfection.

To every particular whereof I will answer when I have told you, that this Doctrine of perfection was first broached by the grand Heretick <hi>Pelagius</hi> whose Opinion and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the <hi>Quakers</hi> have stoln; but it was condemned by the Ancient Christians in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Councils, and also confuted by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pens of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <hi>Orosius,</hi> who all lived when it first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World. And it will be little to your credit to lick up the vomit of such as <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and oppose the Doctrine of the Fathers. But to go on to your Arguments. I begin with the Text, <hi>be ye perfect,</hi> &amp;c. in which words, our Lord aims only, from God Almighty's example to press Charity and Mercy to the highest degree: and this will evidently appear from the context. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin therefore with the 43 <hi>verse</hi> and so on, where you will find that our Saviour press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty of Charity and Mercy, urgeth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55698:20"/>
its extent not only to Friends, but also to Enemies. For should Christianity oblige our Charity no further than to Friends, the civility of Heathens would vie perfection with it; the Philosophers of old having taught that in their Schools of Morality; but to love Enemies is the perfection of Charity, a Law peculiar to Christianity. <hi>Be perfect,</hi> that is, <hi>love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you.</hi> Be perfect <hi>even as your Father is perfect,</hi> who having commanded you to love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doth himself give you an Example for your imitation, <hi>for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil, and on the good, and sendeth Rain on the just, and on the unjust.</hi> And that this is that our Saviour principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by this precept, will be clear from all contradiction, if we observe how St. <hi>Luke</hi> pens this very Sermon on the Mount. You will find these passages in <hi>Luke 6.</hi> beginning at <hi>vers.</hi> 27. <hi>love your Enemies, do good to them which hate you,</hi> &amp;c. and instead of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> expression, <hi>be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> &amp;c. his words are, <hi>be ye merciful even as your Father is merciful, ver.</hi> 36.</p>

               <p>I should be very much convinc't with your reasons but for the clause of the Text, which you take no notice of: where God Almighty's example is propounded to us for our imitation. And here I may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55698:20"/>
add another Text of the like importance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. intimating that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be holy <hi>as he is holy,</hi> and if we could not be unsinningly perfect and holy, in vain is the precept propounded to us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Could you rightly distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween equality and similitude, your objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would disappear in a moment. For you must know that it is one thing to be perfect after the measure of Divine perfection and Holiness; and another thing to be so, after the manner and nature of it: after the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, is impossible; shall the creature mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure Perfections with the Creator? the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Angels themselves are in his sight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively impure. And shall degenerate man vie perfections with the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty? a presumption which brought <hi>Lucifer</hi> from his station to what he is. But though <note place="margin">The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity though not the quantity; the sort and kind, though not the degree.</note> we cannot Equal, yet we may Imitate the Divine perfections, which is the only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Text. Take this familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to express my meaning by. A Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Master sets his Scholar a Copy, with a charge to imitate it: you must only construe his meaning to be such, that he must frame his letters according to the form of those Characters, which are set before him; and not that he expects he should write accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the perfection of the Copy. So when our Lord saith, <hi>be ye perfect even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is perfect,</hi> the words cannot be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood 
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55698:21"/>

               <p>Now I will shew you from this very instance which the <hi>Quakers</hi> use to prove perfection by, according to their notion of it, that it overthrows the tenent which they think to establish by it, and that by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 20, 21. where we read that <hi>Noah was drunk &amp; uncovered in his Tent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be added that some of great note, do expound, <hi>perfect in his generation,</hi> to be meant comparatively, that is, in respect of the men of that Age. <note n="†" rend="inter">

               <p>Your next instance is of <hi>Job,</hi> of whom the Scripture saith that <hi>he was perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> and that, <hi>he feared God and eschewed evil, Job</hi> 1. 1.

               <p>As perfection is attributed to the Saints in this life, it generally signifies no more than sincerity, and uprightness, a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God with a single heart, without Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and Guile: and this you will find in such Bibles as have Marginal notes in them; <hi>perfect in Gen.</hi> 6. 9. is noted upright, and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 1. upright and sincere; and by observation you may find the like in more places: for the word in the Original might as well be translated upright, as perfect.

               <p>That the <hi>Quakers</hi> have a wrong notion of this Scripture, I hope to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to the meanest capacity; but before I proceed, will you allow me this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truth, that the Holy Scriptures do no where contradict themselves?</p>

               <p>This being granted, the Text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our debate cannot be interpreted to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, that any in this life hath gotten an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute conquest over all sin, and that for two reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because St. <hi>John</hi> here would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict other plain Texts, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 46, <hi>for there is no man that sinneth not: Prov.</hi> 20. 9, <hi>who can say I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? Rom.</hi> 3. 23, <hi>for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55698:23"/>
Secondly, because St. <hi>John</hi> would not only contradict others, but himself also, having plainly said, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us:</hi> to all which let me add, that it would be otherwise strange that our Lord should teach his Disciples to pray, as often for the forgiveness of their sins, as for their daily bread; whilst that we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that when they so prayed, they had no Trespasses to forgive, which very instance being inconsistent, is enough to answer the objection.</p>

               <p>The meaning of the words is this, 1. he sinneth not that sin unto <hi>death, ver.</hi> 16. by some expounded to be the unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost. Nor 2. doth he live in a wilful course and trade of sin, 1 <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. he makes not sin his business, he works not in it as a man doth in his trade, which is the true sense of the Greek word in the Text: and that is the reason why wicked men are called in Scripture <hi>workers</hi>

               <p>The objection will soon be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by considering what the Apostle means by the <hi>seed of God,</hi> which is a new firm Principle of Grace, and Holiness, wrought in him by the Spirit of God, by which he is kept from habits of wilful and deliberate sins, and thus he cannot sin: not through any Natural, but Moral impossibility, I say: <note place="margin">Id tantùm possumus quod jure possumus.</note> he Morally cannot do so, the powers of his Soul being acted and inflamed by such a Divine Principle of Grace and goodness, as will not suffer him to live in any known sin whatsoever. If he does; he falls from that Holiness, and forfeits the Divine relation, and can no longer be said to be born of God, no more than he that has carried the repute of an honest man, can after wilful breaches of Justice, and Honesty, challenge that worthy Title.</p>

               <p>You cannot think that the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had a state of such perfection, as to make it impossible for him to sin, for you know, he did actually fall; such a perfection he never lost, nor did Christ gain such a

state for us in this World: We are indeed by Christ, and the grace of God put into such a State, as that we may perform that which is necessary to our Salvation under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, even that which God will accept of, through his mercy; that is, we may please God, considering what he now expects, and accepts through Christ, as well as <hi>Adam</hi> could, considering what God required then. But if you will stretch this sentence to be meant of an equal perfection, to <hi>Adam's</hi> in this life, you discover gross Ignorance in the mis-timeing that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of yours which you are not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this present mortal state, but to the life to come: here we have but the earnest and first fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14, therefore it is that, <hi>here we know but in part, and Prophesy but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9.

bring this subject to a conclusion, give me leave to add, that to argue a state here free from sin, is to argue against matter of fact, and the clearest conviction and experience; for we read of failings in the best of men, and have not such their shares of troubles and vexations in this life?

               <p>What our Lord condemned in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> was their pride in chusing the high places in the Synagogues, in a vain presumption that they exceeded all men in Learning and Holiness: herein the <hi>Quakers</hi> discover not our pride, but their own Ignorance; for it is not for preeminence, that we use our Pulpits, but for convenience; not that our persons, but that our voices may be exalted: and herein we aim not at glory to our selves, but edification to our People: and this is according to the example of <hi>Ezra, Neh.</hi> 8. 4. who did erect a Pulpit of wood, not in obedience to the Ceremonial Law, because it was no where commanded by it, but that he might stand above the People, that he might be the better heard, while he interpreted the Law to them. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you let us not so far humour the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> as to take notice of all their idle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, and cavils; but if you have any thing of moment to object against us, I am ready to give a reply to it; and further to engage you to give credit and attention to what I say, I profess to you that I have not spoke any thing hitherto, but what I am perswaded in my Conscience, is agreeable to sacred truth, and I hope you will believe me without an Oath.</p>

to question it: for what more expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden than swearing? what so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to that sacred truth you profess to own?

But seeing you hold the lawfulness of it, I hope you will prove it out of Scripture; and if you can make it in any case a Duty, and an act of Religion, I shall then change my Opinion of this generation, which I esteemed most impious, and on the contrary, think it very Religious through the multitude of Oaths that are so frequently in it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> will answer you, for his words imply that they were. Therefore he tells Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> that he failed in his instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, David,</hi> and others swearing, for they lived under the first Covenant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>If <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> by the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant means the Covenant of works, he shews a great deal of Ignorance and folly, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Abraham</hi> and others after him lived under that Covenant. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed any further upon this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning Oaths, I shall make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression to unfold, this necessary point of Religion about the nature of the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; wherein (as in many other things) the <hi>Quakers</hi> are grosly Ignorant and Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
               <p>You must know then, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Covenant, which God out of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious condescension hath vouchsafed to enter into with man, according to the different state and condition he found him in: The first was made with <hi>Adam</hi> (for himself and his posterity,) whilst he remained in the state of Innocency; And this by Divines is called the Covenant of works, because an exact obedience was required from him, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promised him upon that obedience. 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55698:28"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> violating that Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by falling from his Original happy state; he and all mankind are made utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving any benefit thereby. And now we are to consider man in another state <hi>(viz.)</hi> of sin and misery. And Gods compassion was such, that he was pleased to enter into a second Covenant with him, according to the degenerate estate he was faln into: and this is usually called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; because a more superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant measure of grace is seen, and infinitely more favour shown, in Gods entrance into Covenant with Man in his lapsed condition, for his restitution and reconciliation, than in his state of Integrity for his preservation.</p>
               <p>This latter Covenant God made with <hi>Adam</hi> soon after his fall, in these words, <hi>The seed of the Woman shall break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that is, God shall send his Son <hi>Jesus,</hi> who shall be born of the seed of the Woman, and he shall destroy the power, and dominion of the Divel. And this afterwards he plainly repeated to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 22. 17, 18. And entails this promised seed to his Loyns. But his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> that Type of this promised seed God commands him to offer up, on Mount <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riab;</hi> which command, when he was about to execute, a countermand stays his hand, and a <hi>Ram</hi> is by Gods good Providence provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a Sacrifice; to intimate to us, that the 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55698:29"/>
promised seed was not then to be offer'd up, but should be suspended for a time, and that in the mean time God would accept the Sacrifices of <hi>Rams, Bulls, Goats,</hi> &amp;c. as Types, and Figures, that the promised seed should in due time offer up himself, a full propitiatory Sacrifice, Oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole World.</p>
               <p>Now to say that <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were under the first of these Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Covenant of works, is notoriously false; for that Covenant was but a small time in force, and after <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, but a small time of use, because it could not give life, none living under it but <hi>Adam;</hi> all hopes of Salvation ever after, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the grace of the second Covenant, which is the only plank after Shipwrack.</p>

               <p>But do we not read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. of an old Covenant which was to be done away, <note place="margin">The old and new Covenant signify the old and new dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same Covenant of grace.</note> and a new Covenant to succeed in the room of it?

               <p>That <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> lived under the old Covenant there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I readily grant; but that, that was a Covenant of works, I utterly deny; which that you may apprehend, you must know, that the Covenant of grace, though one and the same in substance from the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulging of it to <hi>Adam,</hi> unto the end of the 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55698:29"/>
World, yet is according to the several forms or modes of its administration, distinguished into Old, which was to be abolished, and New, which was never to be antiquated.</p>
               <p>In the times of the Old Testament the Covenant of Grace was administred by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, Prophesies, Sacrifices, &amp;c. foresig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Christ to come, which for that time were sufficient to build up those who then lived in faith, in the promised Messiah, by whom they had remission of sins, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation. Under the Gospel when Christ the substance was come, those Types and Ceremonies were abolished; and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in which this Covenant is dispensed, <note place="margin">Non est divisio ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris in species, sed su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ide</note> are the preaching of the Word, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper. So that the words <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> are not applicable to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as to the substance of it, but only to its various dispensation. Now that the Covenant in Old Testament times was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, the same in substance with that under which we live in Gospel times, I prove thus: That Covenant which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christ, by whom eternal Salvation may be attained, and which offereth pardon of sin, and acceptance to favour upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, must needs be a Covenant of Grace: but the Covenant delivered in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as that in the New, is such a Covenant, as appears from these Scriptures,

of this discourse; in order whereunto, I shall pitch upon this method following. First, I shall shew you that these words do not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally forbid all manner of Oaths, in that large sense you take them. Secondly, I shall endèavour to give you the true sense of the words, and shew you what sort of swearing is there forbidden.</p>

               <p>It will very much contribute to my conviction if you do, as you say; Pray you therefore first prove to me, that the words do not forbid all manner of Oaths, in that large sense wherein we take them.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I shall do it in this order. First, by proving it an act of Natural Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Secondly, an act of necessary justice and charity towards men. Thirdly, that it is therefore a part of that moral and eternal Law, which our Saviour professeth he came not <hi>to destroy, but to fulfill.</hi> And fourthly, that we find it practised in the New Testament.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>I much desire to hear the first par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prov'd <hi>(viz.)</hi> that an Oath is an act of Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it first by Reason. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by consent of Nations, thus. That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">E.</note> we glorifie God and adore his Attributes, is an act of Religion; but by an Oath (rightly taken) we glorifie God and adore his Attributes, therefore such an Oath is an act of Religion. The first part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55698:32"/>
is evident of it self, for what else is Religion, but to adore and glorifie God in the humble acknowledgment of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. And that we do, by an Oath (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently taken) glorifie God, is clear from the nature (and definition) of it; for an Oath is a religious appeal unto God, the searcher of all hearts, as a witness of what we assert, or promise, and the avenger of perjury. Now that by such a reverent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal unto God, we glorifie him; appears, in that we do therein make acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1. Of God's existence and being; for <hi>he that cometh to God must believe that he is, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and an Oath certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is one sort of coming to God, being an immediate appeal to him, as Witness and Judge. 2. Of his Omnipresence and Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that he is present in all places, and at all times, according to <hi>Psalm 139. Whither shall I go from thy presence, &amp;c.</hi> How could we call upon him either as Witness of our sincerity, or Judge of our hypocrisie, if we did not believe him within hearing? and therefore the not having God before our eys is in Scripture, the description of the most profligated wretchless state of sin. 3. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we acknowledge his Omniscience, that he is in the Apostles stile <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of hearts; that all things are naked and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the eyes of him with whom we have</hi> (then more immediately) <hi>to do.</hi> 4. His
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55698:33"/>
truth and veracity, a Witness brought into the Court, that cannot lie, nor be impos'd upon: as saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</hi> 5. His provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and paternal care of the concerns of mankind, taking the cause of the righteous into his own hand, and helping them to right, that suffer wrong. 6. His superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or rather supremacy, over all things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>For verily men swear by the greater.</hi> Therefore in swearing by him, we own him to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and most high. 7. We herein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his vindictive justice, as he is a Revenger of Perjury; such an one as will by no means patronize iniquity, fraud, or guile, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. and will both bring sin to light, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. and punish it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. So that I hope you see by this time, that an Oath (rightly circumstantiated and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>(viz.)</hi> in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 2.) is a comprehensive part of Religion; It being such a solemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, where by we glorifie God's Existence, Omnipresence, Omniscience, Truth, Providence, Superiority, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Justice; How can you think it less then a duty, fit to be commanded by God, and to bear a part in the Moral Law; as indeed we find it doth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him, and swear by his Name.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 2.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55698:33"/>
                  <hi>Thou shalt swear the Lord liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness.</hi>

               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>I had thought that an Oath had been so far from glorifying God, that it had been the only prosanation of his Name.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>

               <p>Therefore to confirm you further, I shall resume the method propos'd, and prove that an Oath is an act of Religion, out of the light of Nature, and the consent of Nations; as is evident to such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in ancient Authors. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the great Philosopher saith, <hi>An Oath is the most venerable thing that pertains to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                  </note>. <hi>Cicero,</hi> the learned Oratour, gives this account of an Oath: <hi>An Oath is a religious affirmation, and what you affirm or promise by taking God to witness, ought to be kept, that is, such an Oath binds you to performance</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Est jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jura ndum affirmatio religiosa, quod antem affirmate, quasi Deo teste, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseris, id tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est.</note>.

And therefore anciently Captains of War, in listing their Souldiers, did alwayes bind them to their fidelity with an Oath; which Oath was had in so great reverence with them, that they honoured it with a religious title, calling it a Sacrament (or religious Solemnity) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> (that excellent Moralist) saith, <hi>Religion</hi> (that is that military Oath which they call'd a Sacrament) <hi>is the chiefest bond of fidelity in the Militia</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Those testimonies do signifie the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal consent of mankind in this point, and that it is ingrafted in our natural principles of Reason and Conscience, and therefore is a part of that Law of Nature which our Lord <hi>came not to destroy, but to fulfil,</hi> and perfect:

               <p>If you look into the holy Scriptures, as well in the New, as the Old Testament, you'l find that the primary designation and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Oath, is for confirmation, and the end of all strife, as you may be inform'd from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. than which, nothing can have a more moral consideration, or have more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate respect to Justice and Charity.</p>

               <p>But if men will be nought, they may forswear themselves as well as lie; and he that makes no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of a lie, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will he make of perjury?</p>

               <p>Conscience does not dread all sins alike, some sins it can swallow down glibly, others not without regret: and in this case, you must consider, that an Oath is a much strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bond to the conscience than a bare Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony: for such is the power of natural conscience, even in the breasts of bad men, that multitudes, who fear not a lie, yet do dread the solemnity of an Oath, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of perjury.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that the ends of justice and charity are so much served by the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious use of an Oath (as hath formerly been prov'd;) would not the abolishing of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the honour of Christianity? for while the Apostle saith, <hi>An Oath for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is the end of strife;</hi> if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55698:35"/>
an Oath, you take away that which by God is ordained to be the most effectual means of ending it, and so make Christ not so much the Prince of Peace, as Discord; by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him the abolisher of that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to compose it.</p>

               <p>I should think your Discourse very reasonable and convincing, did I not find in the Text I mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 37. after Christ had said, <hi>Let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay;</hi> he adds, <hi>for whatsoever is more than this, cometh of evil.</hi> If all Oaths then be evil, how dare you call them good, or plead for the lawfulness of them?</p>

               <p>That you mistake the Text, I shall give you account in its due time and place. But that all Oaths are not evil in themselves, you may be satisfied, not only by what has already been said of their morality, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, but further by these following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: 1. In that by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession they were once lawful, therefore not morally evil. 2. By the example of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patriarchs before the Levitical law was given, therefore not ceremonial. 3. By the examples of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Angel, after the Gospel was promulg'd, therefore against no Gospel Precept. I begin with the first; By your own confession they were once law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under the Old Testament, and till you prove them repeal'd, must be so still, and therefore are not of themselves evil.</p>

               <p>But doth not all good and evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Divine will, and not upon the nature of the thing commanded? So that things are good or evil for no other reasons, but because they are commanded or forbidden.</p>

               <p>Should you indeed consult some of the Writers of this Age, (whose learning, I doubt, surmounts their piety) you would find them of this opinion: such as the Dutch <hi>Szydlovius,</hi> who tells us that all that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count now wicked, could by a Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment immediately become good; and I am sorry that we have instances nearer home, even in our own Nation; such as by their Writings have not a little contributed to the debauching of this present Age. But let me tell you, that the reasons of good and evil, are eternal, and were eternally, lodged in the Divine Nature: For God is not a meer, arbitrary, wilful being; his will is not a blind <hi>impetus;</hi> but acts by the dictates of Divine Wisdom, the disposition of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature, and the rules of eternal Justice <note n="*" place="margin">

So that what has an intrinsick goodness in it, was agreeable to the Divine Nature, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to all Divine Commands; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is evil in it self, was eternally repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his holy Nature.</p>

               <p>I say it is the most horrid contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to affirm, that God can will any thing that is disagreeable to the eternal rectitude of his Nature, as all sin is; and I appeal to your own faculties, whether love, meekness, truth, justice, purity, &amp;c. be not more sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his holiness, and commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to us by their inward goodness, more than hatred, murther, theft, lying, impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the like. If we had not these chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of goodness impress'd upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, we should loose a main argument for the Divinity of the Holy Bible; and a false Religion, would bid as fair for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as the true; miracles themselves being not able to ingage my faith, if the Doctrines to be confirm'd by them, be not agreeable to my reason, and natural conscience; to which God himself makes his appeal, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 5, 7. The heathen world, could never be brought to the embracement of the true Religion, were there not, besides the will of the Law-giver, a natural congruity in it, with their judging faculties; so that good, and evil, are not only so, because commanded and forbidden; but because they are so in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and were for ever so.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you for this profitable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression I have caused you to make, and shall now desire you to return to your old sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55698:37"/>
 concerning which I have this scruple to propose unto you, <hi>viz.</hi> that those instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein an Oath is acknowledged to have been lawful, are taken out of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, which is now repeal'd by the Gospel.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>If it were so (as it is not) yet their having been once lawful and commanded by God, proves undeniably, that they are not evil in their own nature, for whatever things are so, can at no time, and upon no tearms, be ever commanded, or countenanc'd by God, being eternally repugnant to his Will and holy Nature; (as hath been before shown to you.)</p>
               <p>But that an Oath is not a part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, is clear from what hath been said concerning the morality of it, which proved it a part of natural Religion and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which are the things that distinguish the Moral from the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>This will further appear, if you consider that the Ceremonial Law is a systeme only of types and shadows, and of things to come, that is, of the Messiah, and the blessings of the Gospel; for whatever was purely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, was purely typical; but the Law concerning an Oath was not a type of any thing to come, but had its proper and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual usefulness, therefore was no part of the Ceremonial Law. If you say it was a type of any thing pertaining to the times of

the Gospel, shew what was its Antitype, or thing represented by it; but if you cannot find an Antitype for it in the Gospel, you may then be satisfied, that the command of swearing was no part of the Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>The second Argument to confirm you, that Oaths are not evil in themselves, nor part of the Ceremonial Law, is taken out of the Examples of the holy Patriarchs; with whom an Oath was of authentick use, and held sacred, before the delivery of the Levitical Law.</p>
               <p>I shall begin with <hi>Abraham, the Father of the Faithful, Gen.</hi> 21. 23, 24, 31. where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> made a Covenant and confirm'd it by Oath interchangeably; and (what is observable in that passage) <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the very place, where they swore to each other, a name, which was to be <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> a memorial of that solemnity, calling it <hi>Beersheba;</hi> in English, <hi>the well of the Oath.</hi> Consult also that other instance, in that holy man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 2, 3, 9. and it is not to be thought that <hi>Abraham</hi> would give his servant an Oath rashly, nor exercise his authority to impose on his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>The same is also confirmed by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Isaac,</hi> making a Covenant, and swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 26. 28, 31. as also by the example of <hi>Jacob,</hi> making a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55698:38"/>
 and swearing to his Uncle <hi>Laban, by the fear of his Father</hi> Isaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 53. An Oath therefore having been so sacred and authentick with those holy Fathers, before the Law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it was no part of the Levitical, but of that Moral Law which (as has been said) our Saviour prosesseth he came not to destroy.</p>

               <p>Had the <hi>Quakers</hi> liv'd under the Old Law, they would certainly have been convinc't by what you have said of its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and not only so, but usefulness, having been made an instrument of estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing such happy leagues and bands of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; but to us that live under the Gospel, are not our circumstances alter'd with the dispensation, and by the prohibitions alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy quoted?</p>

               <p>I say the Gospel dispensation does not repeal any Law, that is Moral, and of <note place="margin">3.</note> continued usefulness (as hath been said) and such is this of a lawful Oath: for that Law, whose reason and usefulness is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and the same to us under the Gospel, as it was to them under the Law, is it self perpetual, and therefore not repeal'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Rationes boni &amp; mali sunt aeternae.</note> new dispensation. So that unless you can tell me some use it was to them which it is not to us, you can have no reason to believe it was any of those Laws which our Saviour came to abolish; there being as

See <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14. 16, 18. where God, (who can do nothing that is immoral, or unbecoming his holiness) swears in these words, <hi>As I live, &amp;c.</hi> here God swears by his life; and is it not as much an Oath in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to swear by Gods truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>As God is true, &amp;c.</hi> And those other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>By my self have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast</hi>

And for these, or what other forms of Oaths, we find in Scripture, whether in more, or fewer words, they all do invocate God both as Witness, and as Judge, both to attest, and revenge it if we perjure: for the Swearers consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does tell him, that if God be called in to witness a lie, he will both detect, and revenge it. All this is in the sense of every Oath: So that that form in the close of our publick Oaths, <hi>So help me God, &amp;c.</hi> hath neither any thing new in it, nor any more, than is included in the sense of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oath; for execration, is implyed and understood wheresoever it is not express'd, even in those Elliptical forms of swearing us'd by God himself, whether express'd by a bare attestation, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Psalm</hi> 89. 35. or by a bare exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration only, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 95. <hi>ult.</hi> according to that of the Learned Casuist (Bishop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson de juramento, p.</hi> 15.) <hi>Omne jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum quocunque modo prolatum, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Every Oath, in what manner soever it is utter'd, either expresly, or implicitely, invocates God both as Witness, and as Judge; and even a bare attestation <hi>Subin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert execrationem</hi> (as he saith) infers an execration, as its necessary consequent: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>You are to consider in what sense the Apostle forbids us <hi>to speak evil of no man.</hi> You are not to imagine his design in that Text, is absolutely to restrain us from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving true characters of evil and unworthy men (upon a just occasion;) then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had been faulty in speaking evil of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith. <note place="margin">i Tim. i. 20.</note> Besides, how should we reprove, or how should justice upon the most notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 14.</note> be administred, if their faults may not be spoken of? Therefore the words cannot bear a general interpretation, but must be taken with a limitation: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a monstrous train of absurdities must attend such an exposition. But I do 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55698:41"/>
conceive that the words do relate to that horrid custome of reflecting upon the good names and reputations of men in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converse, whereby we may deprive our Neighbour of that which is as dear to him, as his life, or livelyhood. So that 'tis speaking evil, detractingly, untruly, or maliciously, or without just occasion, in our communication, which is the thing there prohibited by the Apostle.</p>

               <p>I must confess, you have given the true meaning of the Apostles words. And I hope you will not abridge me of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which you take your self, in freeing the Texts under debate from a wrong constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them.

               </p>
               <p>You are not to suppose that 'tis our Lord's design to forbid all manner of Oaths upon what occasion and solemnity soever they may be tendred; then (as hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been shewn) St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not only been faulty in making so honourable a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Oath, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 16. but much more faulty in taking an Oath himself, and then both he and the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. had fall'n under the charge of Antichristianism. Therefore (according to your phrase) the words cannot bear a general interpretation,

               <p>Seeing our Saviour in that gracious Law of his has forbid nothing that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good, nothing that is either indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or expedient, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. it must needs follow, that an Oath is no further for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, than as it is evil; that is, when it prophanes the Name of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 12. and 28. 58. or doth any way dishonour him, which an Oath doth, when it is false, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent, or needless. In these instances an Oath, being so dishonourable to the Divine Majesty, is absolutely forbidden, namely, all swearing by the creature, or by any thing propos'd to our vain fancy (that being to make an Idol of the creature, and to set it up for a God) as also all swearing by the express name of God in mens ordinary <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> which is for the most part so full of passion, and vain transportation, as to expose men to the frequent abuse of Gods Name, and the danger of perjury.</p>
               <p>And therefore I must inform you that our blessed Saviour took the occasion of this prohibition from the gross errors both of 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55698:42"/>
Jew and Gentile about this point, and from the wicked customs of common swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prophaneness, which by those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were encouraged. I will therefore shew you, first what those evil customs were, and then give you the sense of the words as they lye in the Text, and are accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the healing of those corruptions in doctrine and practise.</p>
               <p>The erroneous glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees, and the Jewish Doctors taught, that while they abstained from the mention of Gods Name, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to swear by the Creature as oft as they pleas'd; and that such swearing (though falsly) was no perjury. See <hi>Mattb.</hi> 23. 16, 18, 21. There you will find, that they made nothing of swearing by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Altar, or by Heaven, supposing it did not bind the Conscience. Secondly, that it was lawful at any time to swear by Gods Name, so that they swore nothing but truth, and <hi>performed their Oaths unto the Lord.</hi> And these opinions, it seems, the Jewes thought consistent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with that part of the Law ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 33. <hi>You have heard that it hath been said by them</hi> (or rather to them) <hi>of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thy self.</hi> And according to those corrupt Doctrines, they acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear or measure, by that wretched custom 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55698:43"/>
of common swearing. To the confuting of which Doctrines, he accommodates his answer in the verses following. Against the first of them, <hi>viz.</hi> swearing by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he opposes that prohibition in the 34, 35, 36 <hi>verses. But I say unto you, swear not at all, neither by Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Against the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> swearing by the Name of God in our ordinary converse, he gives this precept, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Let your communication be yea, yea, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>But does not our Saviour say there, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and so do's he not general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid all Oaths whatsoever?</p>

               <p>To ease you in this scruple, let me tell you what advice I heard a famous Judge give to a Jury; <hi>You must not</hi> (said he) <hi>determine by bits and parcels of what you have heard attested, but you are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your whole evidence, and accordingly bring in your verdict.</hi> So let me tell you, that to give the true account of any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you are not to imitate the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who determine upon such bits and scraps, as they steal out of the Word of God; by which means they make one part of the Scripture contradict another, and so expose themselves to the greatest errours imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but to find out the true sense of any Scripture, you must determine according to the whole evidence, by comparing the parts of it together with each other, and by 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55698:43"/>
considering the scope of the Text, from the whole so compared, and considered, to gather the true meaning of it. And so here in this place you are not to take these words single by themselves, for you see they stand not alone, and are not a whole sentence by themselves, but are immediately conjoyned in a continued discourse with other words, which do restrain, and limit them. So that when he sayes, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> he adds, <hi>neither by heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor by the earth,</hi> &amp;c. so as the prohibition is limited to those things the Jewes were wont to swear by, in order to the reforming of that evil custome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: and therefore to each of those Oaths which he forbids, he adds a reason to convince them of their errour. He bids them not swear at all by Heaven, <hi>because it is Gods throne,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had said, The Pharisees teach you that swearing by heaven, by earth, by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by your head (by the Temple, by the Altar, &amp;c. <hi>Matth. 23.)</hi> are no real binding Oaths; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to swear by them falsly is no perjury; <hi>But I say unto you, swear not by heaven, for it is Gods throne,</hi> and therefore includes him that sits on it, so that he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and him that sitteth thereon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 22. and therefore his Oath is as really binding both to the sin and punishment (if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear) as if he had sworn expresly by the
<pb facs="tcp:55698:44"/>

               <p>The Apostle St. <hi>James</hi> do's mean only all Oaths of that kind there mentioned, and then so much used by Jew and Gentile; for he leaves out some of those, which our Saviour had instanced in, and breaks off with this clause, <hi>nor by any other oath;</hi> which implyes his meaning to be, that as we are not to swear by heaven, nor the earth, so neither by any other such like Oath, which our Saviour had forbidden, <hi>(viz.)</hi> neither by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor by the Temple, the Altar, &amp;c. and consequently by no created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for if Christ has not forbidden all kinds of Oaths, St. <hi>James</hi> has not; for <hi>the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>

               <p>The Apostles themselves took texts out of Scripture, to expound and apply them.

And they both preached Christ out of the same text, namely, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 10. And the whole fourth Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> is but an enlarged discourse upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, you may consider, the Apostles and we act under different circumstances: They might sometimes, without a Book, speak by the sole authority of infallible inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But now such extraordinary gifts being ceased, we take texts, to shew we have no other Doctrine to deliver but what is taken out of the written Word of God: And our only work is to explain and apply the same.

His quarrel is, that we take Texts to get mony with them, and that some insist a quarter of a year, or half a year upon a Text, which I think very few do, nor any but when their Text has such plenty and variety of matter in it, as requires much time in the handling of it, which is a thing that hath no unlawfulness in it at all, and therefore is far from being a just cause of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from us.

               <p>No, they are not, for whatsoever is necessary to salvation, either to be believed, or to be done, are in some place or other in holy Scripture fitted to the most vulgar capacity and shallowest understanding, as (for example) the history of Christs birth, death, resurrection, and ascension is, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be believed, so plain to be understood (though yet it hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the mis-interpretation of the <hi>Quakers</hi> and some Hereticks, and from plain History turn'd into meer Allegory;) Then the duties of the first and second Table of the Law, and the Love of God and our Neighbour; all the Evangelical

               <p>I am ready to gratifie your desires, and begin with the first cause, namely, the want of learning, which is derided by <hi>Hubberthorn,</hi> and censur'd by those that know it not. And here you are to take special notice, that Learning is by the Holy <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 7</note> Ghost declared so necessary for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of difficult passages in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the cause of the wresting them is attributed to the want of it, in these words, <hi>which the unlearned and the unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wrest, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. Besides, I have this to say for the honour of Learning, that <note place="margin">Eruditio non habet inimicum praeter ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantem. Ignoti nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la cupido.</note> none do vilifie or speak disdainfully of it, but such as are unacquainted with it. It would be strange to hear a man that was born blind, discourse of colours. Ask such an one what apprehension he has of them, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he will tell you that he does suppose colours to be fish or flesh, or else a crack of thundex; for the true notion of colours is only to be apprehended by the Organs of sight; so that, as no colour can be discern'd or judg'd of by any but those that see it, so neither Learning by any but those that know it. And it is as impossible for unlearned men to be able to judge aright of Learning, as it is for blind men to judge of colours, or to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55698:54"/>
distinguish betwixt black and white; for 'tis peculiar to Wisdom, that she is justifi'd of her children only, because none but they can be competent Judges of her.</p>

               <p>I cannot but confess all this to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reasonable, but yet methinks, if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had so great regard unto Learning, 'tis very strange that he should make use of illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate persons, fishermen and such like, to be the first preachers of his Gospel.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>That argument diminisheth not the reputation of Learning; for 1. Though the Apostles were unlearned when Jesus called <note place="margin">1.</note> them, yet to the eternal honour of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he made them learned in all tongues by a miracle, before he sent them abroad to teach all Nations; teaching us thereby, that men wholly illiterate are not fit to preach the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And again, if you will rightly consider, how the case then stood, you may observe, <note place="margin">2.</note> there was great reason for it, (and it was a great instance of Divine wisdom in calling such men) <hi>viz.</hi> in order to the most success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promulgation of the Gospel, and the glory of God: For had our Lord chosen the Philosophers and learned Rabbies of the time, his whole Doctrine might have been opposed with greater force of argument, and would have lost much of its due repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by being ascrib'd to such mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, as if its success had been wholly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55698:54"/>
owing to their skill and learning, and not to the mighty power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 5. It would (as to that particular) have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that stamp of Divinity which the miracle of their inspired learning set upon it. Which was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s case with the men of <hi>Corinth:</hi> Some Malignants there knowing his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be altogether scholastical, took an occasion thence secretly to undermine his authority in the Church of God, as though he had wrought upon the people only by his learning and policy; which occasion'd those protestations of his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>That his preaching was not with the enticing words of mans wisdom, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of the Gospel being thus atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by miracles, infidelity became utterly inexcusable; and among the many miracles he wrought for the confirmation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, That was none of the least, that he should endue ignorant and unlearned men with such mighty gifts; a thing which the whole Council of the Jewish <hi>Sanedrim</hi> were astonish'd at, as you may see in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13.

                  <hi>thirsty, their souls fainted in them,</hi> they had there no opportunity of plowing and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was a time extraordinary; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to manifest his greatness and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, supplies them by as extraordinary a Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> by raining down <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven to supply that necessity; but when the children of <hi>Israel</hi> came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where the earth was fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and where they had opportunity both to plow and sow, <hi>then Manna ceased.</hi> So <note place="margin">Jos. 5 12.</note> upon the first plantation of the Gospel, the world might fitly be compared to a barren Wilderness, no Universities consisting of a Gospel education (as it was impossible there should) wherefore Christ supplies that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness, by those extraordinary qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and gifts which he gave unto men; his Disciples were to plant the Gospel in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and probably understood no language but the <hi>Syrian</hi> (their own mother tongue;) he therefore rains upon them not <hi>Manna,</hi> but <hi>cloven Tongues,</hi> whereby they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated to preach the Gospel to all People,

and Nations under Heaven; and what they wanted in education was supplyed them by a miracle.

tell him that he ought so to do, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because Christ fed five thousand with a few loaves, and fewer fishes: Compare but the other case with this, and you will find them exactly parallel, and that it is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and absurd, to depend upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary revelations and miracles, while we neglect the ordinary means under which we live, as it is for a Husbandman wholly to give over husbandry in expectation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided for by daily miracles; for though Gods hand be not shortned, but that it is in his power to give the Church now the same gifts of tongues, of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the rest, as he was pleased to do in the primitive age of the Church, yea, and to feed us (without our industry) with <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quails,</hi> as he did his Church in the Wilderness, or by the Ravens, as he did <hi>Elisha;</hi> or to make the small provisions we have, to abound by an inexhaustible increase, as he did the Widows barrel of meal, and cruse of Oyl: and (in the Gospel) the five loaves and two fishes; though he could soon introduce the <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55698:56"/>
wrap us into the third Heaven, and rest us in Paradise; though this be in his power, yet we see it is not in his will; It is not his pleasure thus to dispense his favours, nor to pour out his blessings all at once: For though the Divine power and Goodness too, be both of them infinite, yet do not engage God (though an Almighty Father) in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, to act like natural Agents, both alwayes and <note n="†" place="margin">Semper &amp; adulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum posse.</note> all he can.

               <p>That the Spirit helpeth us to understand old truths already revealed in Scripture, we confess and pray for his assistance therein, but to pretend to such miraculous inspirations as the Apostles once had, or to new revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beyond what was discover'd to them, is a horrible cheat set up at first by St. <hi>Francis</hi> and St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and some other Fanatical Friers and Nuns of the Romish Church, whose steps the <hi>Quakers</hi> do now follow, but the delusion and falshood of such pretences will appear, if you consider</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55698:57"/>
8, 9. and in the close of that holy Book, a woe is denounced to all that should add any thing to it, or take any thing from it; So that they who would make new additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by daily inspirations, make God himself a lyar in commending that to us for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule which needs continual additions; and the preaching of Christ and his Apostles at this rate must be thought imperfect, and that Word which should try the Spirits must submit to every new revelation; Nor do the Papists more dishonour Gods Word by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Traditions of equal value to it, than the <hi>Quakers</hi> by esteeming their new revelations to be as much from the Spirit of God.</p>

Consider how contrary these new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are to Gods constant method, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they came naked, without any miracles to attest them, for when did God ever send any new Doctrine into the World, and did not also give the Preachers thereof a power of working miracles to confirm that it was from him? <hi>Moses</hi> had this power when he was to set up the Law; Jesus when he was to preach the Gospel to the Jews; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles when they were to convert the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: But as St. <hi>Austin</hi> notes, when once the World did believe, this power ceased, which was only given that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

And where is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of these men, that take a sentence out of the Word of God, to make it prove it self dead and stupid. If those places quoted by them, contain sense and reason, why do they brand that Book with such contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters, by calling it dead and sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less? But if those places do truly contain no reason in them; why are the <hi>Quakers</hi> so sensless themselves, to produce reasons from them? Though the Leaves and Letters have no natural life in them, is therefore the sense of the Scriptures dead? And hath it no rational importance in it? And are not the <hi>Quakers</hi> a company of fine Cheats, to take a Bible (as some in my presence have done) and cry, <hi>Look at this, is this quick and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi> as if the life natural, and bodily sense,

Is not this a way to evacuate to the Vulgar all Commands, and all Laws that are not given to every one by audible voice? Yea, and to render every thing insignificant, that does not walk and speak? Is not this the very immediate way utterly to make void the written Word and Laws of God, and to send us streight either to Enthusiasms, Dreams and Phantasms, or else to oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, &amp;c? Is there not something of a Fanatical <note n="†" place="margin">Ex pede Herculem,</note> Jesuit here? no doubt but these are fine wayes to decoy an illeterate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as being very agreeable to them, who envy Learning, because it is out of their reach, and who are more desirous to be led by fancy, than by Laws; and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to have all Laws of God and Man, call'd dead Letters, to introduce their own fancies and pretended inspirations. But I pray you consider, is there no use of Books, and Writings? If you make void the Holy Scriptures, because they are written, you do by the same argument make void all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Records, and all <hi>Quakers</hi> books also; yea, by this means you make void your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's

If these have truth, force, and vertue in them, why should you deny that the Holy Scriptures, by those heavenly truths, those divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and threatnings written in them, have power and vertue by the grace of God to awaken and quicken the reader or hearer to New life, and obedience, which is the meaning of its being termed <hi>quick and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Let me further argue with you; Do we not understand one anothers minds by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles as well as Discourses, by words that are written, as well as words that are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? may you not read sense as well as hear it? And I appeal to your own conscience, whether you may not read as good sense in the visible Letters of the Bible, as you can hear, either out of the mouth of a <hi>Quaker</hi> or a <hi>Jesuit?</hi> And I cannot but wonder, that

you, whose judgment I have formerly had a better esteem of, should now be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so far besides your reason and senses: Will you call the Ten Commandements (written by the finger of God on two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone) useless and insignificant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, because they were on Stone? Can your eyes and reason read no sense in them? and whilest you have read the commands and threatnings of God, hath your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science been so dead, as not to find any life and power in them? And though you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the Leaves and Letters, yet dare you say that you had no reverence for the Word of God, when you have heard it from the mouth of your Minister, preached with a lively and audible voice?</p>

               <p>I remember it very well, and you may remember the reply I made, That Learning was so far from being opposed by that Scripture, that it is a mighty argument for its justification: I perceive the <hi>Quakers</hi> understand not the meaning of the word <hi>tongues</hi> (which the Scripture saith are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) for by them is only meant, that the <hi>miraculous</hi> supplies in the gift of tongues, and understanding all languages by <hi>inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> given to the Apostles and primitive Christians be now ceased, as we see they are: the Gospel being sufficiently promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and by these and all other Miracles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be Divine. And yet there remains a necessity of interpreting and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55698:64"/>
these original tongues, <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> in which the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it being impossible that without the knowledge of them, the Gospel should have been translated and communicated to us. And we have great reason to be truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the Scriptures are translated into the Vulgar Languages, but then we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Learning of the Translators; and if Learning was at first necessary for the translating of the Scriptures, it is still as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the interpreting of them. And while I observe how the <hi>Quakers</hi> persecute the Clergy with the venom of their tongues, and abhor their works for the ill will they bear unto their persons, my wonder is that they should look into our English Bible, it being translated by Clergy-men, and with the help of that Learning, which the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> so much despise and abhor.</p>
               <p>So that Learning has a strong argument from the Text which you bring in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of it. For if the extraordinary gift of Tongues be ceased, while there is still a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of understanding those Tongues for the translation of Scripture, I pray by what way and means must <hi>We</hi> attain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, but by the ordinary means of study, industry, or University education? And do you not see that 'tis Learning and learned Men that the good Providence of God hath made so highly instrumental in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55698:64"/>
the service of his Church. So therefore (with <hi>Balaam)</hi> those whom you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to have curst, you against your wills have blest: and the argument by which you thought to have overthrown Learning, proves an establishment of it; and I thank you for reminding me of what I had like to have forgot.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In the right timing of the passages therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In applying of Scripture seasonably and properly, on each occasion.</p>
               <p>Now as to the first, you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that there are several senses in which the Scripture-words and phrases are to be variously understood and interpreted, as namely literal, moral, mystical, and tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Though these be hard words, yet I hope to make them easie in the explication of them by Scripture-instances. In the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral sense you understand Scripture accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bare import of the words: The Moral is when the sense goes higher than the words, being back't by reason and the law of nature: The Mystical sense is that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55698:65"/>
which is still more hid, and by the design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Holy Ghost, looks further than either of the other.</p>
               <p>I will now produce one Text, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it all these three senses, it is in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 18. the words are these, <hi>Thou shalt not muzle the Ox that treadeth out the corn.</hi> The literal sense is, that every good man is merciful to his Beast; and that the poor Creature toyling for us, ought to have a maintenance from us. The moral sense, taken out of the principles of Equity, and the Law of Nature by reasonable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is, <hi>That the labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> The Mystical sense <hi>(viz.)</hi> the still further intendment of that Law, was a Divine ordination, that they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Ministers of the Gospel ought to be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9, 12.</p>
               <p>Now as some Scriptures will bear a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral sense with the moral, and the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, there are yet other Scriptures that will not, therefore in the fourth place such Texts as these are to be interpreted <hi>tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</hi>

               <p>What do you mean by that?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Such a figurative expression, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are several sorts, which you will meet with in the reading of the Scriptures; Some are <hi>metaphorical,</hi> which is a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expression, when another thing is made
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55698:65"/>
use of to express our meanings by, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken literally, as that of <hi>John</hi> 15. 1. <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying of the admirable effects of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, useth these expressions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 6, 7, 8. <hi>The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a little Child shall lead them; And the Cow and the Bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down together: and the Lion shall eat straw like the Ox; and the sucking Child shall play on the hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child shall put his hand on the Cockatrice den.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you suppose that this Scripture is to be understood literally, as if a time were coming, when there should be a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement among the Creatures, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural antipathies being taken away? No, these are but so many <hi>metaphorical</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of the excellent temper of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; that the doctrine thereof, will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a real change in our natures: That <hi>that</hi> savage, waspish, crusty humour of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural dispositions, shall by the Christian laws and the Spirit of Christ, be transformed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the meekness and innocency of a Lamb. And when our Lord bids us put out and cut off our offending eyes and hands, he hath no design to provoke us to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55698:66"/>
dismember our selves; no, 'tis our dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sins and beloved vices which he levels at.</p>
               <p>Again, as some Scriptures are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted <hi>metaphorically,</hi> so others <hi>allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vically,</hi> which is by continuing of a Trope; and this you have in the case of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Sinai</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> which the Apostle calls the two Covenants, and saith they are an Allegory, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. &amp;c. to the Chapters end; for so far you will find the explication of the Allegory continued. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, there are other Scriptures which must be interpreted by an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind of Trope or Figure; when the truth of the thing affirmed, lies not in the letters, but in the priviledge of the phrase, as <hi>John</hi> 21. 25. <hi>And there are also many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which Jesus did; which if they should be written every one, I suppose that the World it self could not contain the Books that should be written.</hi> Where the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist takes a Rhetorical liberty, that he might with greater elegancy express, that our Saviour was not idle in this life, but marvellously busie and active in it.</p>

               <p>The necessary use of Learning, lest we confound the senses of Scripture, and take that Allegorically which we ought to take literally, and that literally which we ought to take figuratively.

               <p>After all these, there remains a necessity of being acquainted with such Histories, as give us a relation of those Rites, Opinions, Customes and Proverbs, in use among the Jews and neighbouring Nations, to which the Scriptures in many places have particular references, without the knowledge whereof 'tis impossible we should understand a Book of so great Antiquity, or read it with that judgment, estimation, relish and delight, as we should do, did we discern the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and allusions that in it are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made to them.</p>

               <p>I have had many scruples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and find those Scruples much augmented by a Book of <hi>Ed.

 and that we may as well turn back to Circumcision, Sacrifices, and burnt Offerings, as to the payment of them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>He thus proves it; <hi>Tithes are now not to be paid according to the first Covenant, neither is the first Priesthood to be upheld that once gave and received Tithes, now should we pay Tithes according to the first Covenant, and uphold any part of that Priesthood, which took Tithes, &amp;c. then should we deny Jesus Christ to be come in the flesh.</hi>

               <p>I shall not trouble you with such reflections, as I may justly make upon the ignorance and confidence of your Author; nor of your own weakness and credulous temper, in being moved by such arguments: to which I now make my reply; wherein you may observe that <hi>Burroughs</hi> is as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the nature of the first Priesthood which took Tithes (which he saith is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) as he and his Brethren are in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the first and second Covenant, of which I have already given you an account.</p>
               <p>If by the first Priesthood, he means that of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, then it will be apparent, that he hath presented to the King and Councel a notorious falsity, by affirming it to be the first Priestood; there being before him a 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55698:73"/>
Priest to whom <hi>Levi</hi> himself paid Tithes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9. Or if by the first Priesthood he means that of <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s, the falsity will be no less notorious in saying that Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is ended, which Christ himself exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 17.

               <p>To affirm that the Clergy now claims their Tithes, by vertue of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, is a most wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; for we disown all such titles to them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>Then the question is, Whether Tithes are not purely Ceremonial? and so established by Christ.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Tithes cannot be called purely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, because paid by <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec</hi> four hundred years before the Law, and vowed two hundred years by <hi>Jacob</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was delivered.</p>
               <p>That the exact Tenths of the Holy Land should be brought in kind to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and paid there, was Ceremonial, and confined to the legal dispensation. But that the Priest should have an honourable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, is a right, founded not only in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural justice (as a due reward for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55698:74"/>
 but as a homage to God, whose ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worship is concerned in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and therefore not abolished by Christ: <hi>These things you ought to have done;</hi> for as God doth challenge part of our time for his service and worship, so also a share in our proprieties and substance for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>I wish you would more clearly take off the charge of Judaisme which lyes upon the Clergy, by their pretences to Tithes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Should we challenge and receive our Tithes as they were due to the <hi>Levites,</hi> our Coffers would be much fuller than they are, and the impositions much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier upon the people: for besides the Meat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, Sin-offerings, Shake-offerings, Heave-offerings, and the Shewbread, as also of all Eucharistical Sacrifices, the breast and the shoulder, and the Offerings for Purification; I say, besides these, the Priests were to have the First-fruits of Wine, and Oyl, and Wool, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 4. yea, and of all things else which the Earth brought forth for the use of man, the First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of the Dough, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 20, 21. So that when all things were computed, there was not left five parts, instead of nine, to the owners. And therefore you being eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the charge and trouble of all those payments and offertories to the Priests,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55698:74"/>
which the Jews paid as supernumerary, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above their Tithes, you have little reason to grudge the Gospel-Ministers that proportion allowed them by the Christian Laws, which is much short of what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the Legal Minister.</p>

               <p>I understand by what right the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> demanded their Tithes, and the rest, namely by the Law of God; but then by what Law of God do you demand your Tithes now under the Gospel?</p>

Now to make you a good property in this Estate, you must shew either some positive Scripture for your right to hold the same, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from Christ or the Apostles, that they had Freeholds and Copyholds, or else if you cannot so do, will you not fall under the same condemnation you have past upon us?</p>

               <p>So I will, when your Deed is made good by the Law of God.</p>

               <p>So 'tis sufficient that our Tithes are setled by the same Laws: When you have said all you can against them, they will be found to be as equitable as any other property whatsoever: And if you judge us unjust, in taking of the tenth, by the same argument you will condemn your selvcs of nine times greater injustice for taking of the remainder.</p>
               <p>The sum of all will amount to this, that Tithes are due by either Divine or Human right, or both; If we enjoy them by a Divine right (as we do, at least a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the general) you kick against the pricks in with-holding them; If by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man right, you will involve your proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the destruction of ours, because none of the Laity can shew any other right to their temporal properties, than Human Laws; And if we have both Divine and Humane right to our Tithes, as they are a setled Maintenance, we enjoy them by the strongest title in the world; So that the

               <p>Before we proceed any further in this controversie, there is one material point to be discussed, which will bring the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Tithes to a speedy issue; and 'tis this: Do you suppose that temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, have sufficient power to establish temporal rights?</p>

Yea, Christ himself hath so far honoured Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that he submitted himself not only to the private authority of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but also paid homage to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Government, as you may see in that remarkable instance, in giving Tribute, <note place="margin">March. 17; 27,</note> though he was put to the expence of a miracle for it.

He declared his Kingdom not to be of this World, he took not upon him the judicial cognizance of any offence whatsoever. He left the woman taken in Adultery, and all other offenders to the ordinary course of Law. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was not to diminish the Authority of Princes, but to fix in the hearts of men the true principles of holiness and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to rule there as a Spiritual Prince; whilst in Temporals he left them to a due

               <p>The inference I draw from hence, is, That in Temporal affairs, an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn srom a Temporal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (where the thing is equitable and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable) is a good and convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that in two respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because Christ having disclaimed all exercise of Authority in Temporal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there is now, no other way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining them than by recourse to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Powers.</p>

And it's very observable, that those Powers they were then to be subject to, and the King they were to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, were heathenish and tyrannical; which teacheth us, that Dominion is not founded in grace, and that the demerits of Princes do not absolve Subjects from their duty of obedience.</p>

               <p>This is another mistake; For Tithes being given to God for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Ministry, no blemish in the dedication of them can alter their Property. To make my assertion good, a parallel case in Scripture shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55698:81"/>
 That which comes most near it, is the case of the Two hundred and fifty men who offered Incense: Yet there was a vast difference between them: The Two hundred and fifty offered in a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, rebellious manner, and these in an ignorant zeal (as some suppose, but we do not grant;) But that which will give us most light into our present case, are the Censers which were so offer'd, which you will find, notwithstanding that damnable sin committed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of them, yet because they were offer'd to God, they were not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated to common uses. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 37. <hi>Speak unto</hi> Eleazar <hi>the son of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Priest, that he take up the Censers out of the burning, &amp;c. for they are hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</hi> From hence you may learn how dangerous a thing it is to meddle with any thing that hath been given to God. For you see the reason given why the Censers were not alienable, was because they were hallowed by being offered before the Lord. Therefore saith a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rabbi, they were unlawful for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">

               <p>This I know is one of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Arguments of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to cast a mist before the eyes of their ignorant Followers; but suppose it had been so, they would not have been less hallowed than the Two hundred and fifty Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers were, and so consequently the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them no less impious; yet I deny your assertion, that Tithes had their institution from Popery; And I have good grounds for what I say, for Tithes were setled upon the Church, before Popery had made her encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it. For Popery is not of that antiquity (as some do vainly and falsly boast;) Though they shew their old <note place="margin">See the Advice to the Roman Catholicks.</note> shooes and mouldy bread, yet upon a strict enquiry, they will be found to be but so many Gibeonitish Cheats, and that their tenents and corruptions are not of that antiquity as is pretended by them.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55698:83"/>
continues still in force, now there is as much reason for Tithes in the times of the Gospel, as there was in the times of the Law: And lastly, they argued from that Analogy which the Apostle makes between the Levites Maintenance under the Law, and the Ministers Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance under the Gospel, <hi>even so hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord ordained, &amp;c.</hi> The other side as briskly maintaining that Tithes were due only by the Laws of the Land. When they had all spent their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Elector himself gave the determination thus, One party I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (saith he) is for the Divine, another for the Human right of Tithes; yet both sides agree and acknowledge them to be a <hi>right,</hi> therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my duty, to maintain <hi>right,</hi> I am bound to justifie and uphold Tithes.</p>
               <p>After all this out-cry against Tithes, do the <hi>Quakers</hi> think the paying and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them to be a sin?</p>

not settle Tithes, Lands, or Moneys upon the Clergy, then they do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose; if not, they do but beat the Air with empty words, and you have reason to look upon them (as indeed they are) a company of Cheats and Impostors.</p>

               <p>There is not the same reason; for every Landlord will tell you that he (or some for him) purchased their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Tenements upon a valuable considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>You cannot be ignorant that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Purchaser buys his Land according to the Rent it gives, and every Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant payes Rent according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies he enjoys. Now if a Tenant stand charged with Tithes, Taxes, chief Rents, and the like, these are computed to every Occupant, according to which he models his Rent: and though he pays these dues and duties (as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) yet are they no inconvenience to him, because he pays less Rent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration thereof. Neither is it any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the Landlord, because his purchase was according to that Rent, and the Land he bought, he knew (or might have known) was lyable to these charges.</p>

               <p>Here must needs be some mistake, for were I to sell my Estate, I could not have so much for it by a considerable sum, because it stands charged with the payment of Tithes: And if this be no grievance, judge you.</p>

               <p>I confess the Apostles had not the Tithes in their dayes, and you ought not to bring this for an Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not have them if they would; for they were not only perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Civil Authority, but the <hi>Levites</hi> themselves were in possession of them; which they kept during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their Nation and Temple. Besides, you ought to consider, that Tithes, or any other fixed Maintenance, was utterly inconsistent with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed state of Life; being to preach the Gospel in all Nations, they became an improper Maintenance for them; and besides, you are to consider, that the Apostles needed them not, for as they had their Gifts, so their Maintenance by a miraculous Providence. <hi>Luke 22. 35. And he said unto them, when I sent you without Purse, and Scrip, and shooes, lacked ye any thing? and they said, Nothing.</hi>

               <p>If you conciude that we must be in all things, as were the Apostles, then must you of the Laity, now do as the Laity did then, who <hi>sold their possessions, and laid them down at the Apostles feet, Acts</hi> 4. And I can argue the one, with the same reason you can the other. But I have one Query, wherein I shall desire your answer, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Quakers</hi> think it lawful to pay the King his Revenues?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Therefore, for Conscience sake, they ought to pay us our Tithes, 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the King commands it; 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath so considerable a Revenue out of them, I mean the First-fruits and Tenths, which is one of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Flowers belonging to the Crown. Now how can we pay the King his dues out of our Tithes, if we receive them not? So that in becoming ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Clergies right, the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> are indeed enemies to the King's rights, by which the Government is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and supported.</p>

               <p>But do you not think it a sad thing, that the poorest person should be as lyable as the richest to the payment of Tithes?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>This is no more injustice, than for a poor man to pay Rent to his Landlord; and the charge might as well, nay much more, reach the Priests under the Law, as the Clergy in the time of the Gospel; and it's well known that the most poor and needy are no sufferers by the payment of Tithes, but rather gainers; for by this means, they find that relief, which they could not have if it were otherwise.</p>

               <p>Do you call the receiving of their rights, a selling of their peoples souls? what a wretched uncharitableness is this; You know the King has twelve Judges, who are to moderate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine betwixt party and party, and these have an honourable allowance from the <hi>Exchequor,</hi> will you therefore say that they are Hirelings, and sell Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? and is not ours the same case?

               <p>I hope many of us can appeal to the Searcher of hearts, that we embraced the Ministry upon better grounds than Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Interests.

And thô the Secular care of some of the Clergy, for the maintenance of their Families, have been excessive; yet what doth this prove against the Ministry it self, or against other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who principally intending and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the salvation of the Souls commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their charge, do in the mean time both receive, and imploy their Tithes with a good Conscience, to none but necessary and charitable uses?

               <p>The Minister is not to blame for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or lack of that benefit, but desires they would enjoy it, while he is attending his Office. Shall then their publick contempt of Gods Ordinances, give them a priviledge to invade another mans right and property? and because they neglect their duty, shall therefore our Free-hold suffer? If our prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were precarious, or did we wholly depend on the good will of our people for what we enjoy, your Argument then would have a better face; but as for our tithes they are ancient setled maintenances, and therefore we look upon our selves to be no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the people for the payment of them, than a Land-lord is to his Tenant for the payment of his Rent, as I have proved to you before.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>I must confess my self to have lived under a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in these things: But I have another thing to tell you, which has a long time been a great offence to me; and that is to see Clergy-men go to Law for their Dues, and sometimes for small and inconsiderable sums, to the great dishonour of their Function, and Reproach of Religion it self.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>If it be their dues they sue for, then the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of them by Course of Law, (when fair means have proved fruitless) will have no injustice in it; so that indeed you misplace the Crime, which is not in him that brings the Action, but in those who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven just occasion for it. The High-way-thief may as well implead the Justice of an Hue and Cry,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55698:89"/>
as the Quakers such a lawful Prosecution.</p>
               <p>Whereas you say, The Action is sometimes for an inconsiderable sum, The less the sum is, the less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse men have for the Non-payment of it. If a Noble man (be his Patrimony never so large) sue for the smallest Chief-rent belonging to his estate, it's thought neither injustice nor uncharitableness in him so to do; because thereby he does but secure his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Now a Clergy-man in suing, though for his smallest dues, hath not only as good a right, but a more noble end, because it is for the securing of that, which is not so much his own, as Gods Title, and dedicated to his service to all generations; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Incumbent upon each Benefice is obliged in Conscience <hi>entirely</hi> to preserve God's and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Right, and that not only for himself, but for his Successors to all Posterity. This therefore appearing thus to be his duty, is by your injuriously accused for Covctousness, Oppression, or Uncharitableness, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greater uncharitableness in you to judge so) for as for those in his Parish who are truly needy and in distress, he may not withstanding this, relieve them according to his ability, in such ways and seasons, as his discretion shall see most expedient, without yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up any thing of the Churches dues to those who do wilfully either deny, or neglect to pay them.</p>

are Laws, where men are denied the use and benefit of them? Laws are designed for the exercise of distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive justice, to help them to right that suffer wrong: and thereby to be a hedge and fence to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans right and property: Therefore going to Law (upon a just Action) is no more, than making an honest appeal to the Government for remedy, which cannot be unlawful; till Government it self be proved so.</p>

If you read on in that Discourse of the Apostle, you will find that the fault he reproves in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> is not all going to Law upon necessary and just occasions, but their bringing their private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and disorders, <hi>before the unjust,</hi> that is, before the Unbelievers (which were the Heathen and Infidel-Judges) as he interprets himself in <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>But brother goeth to Law with brother, and that before the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> Which would have been to the scandal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Christianity among those who hated it, and who would improve such occasions to bring it into greater derision. And he exhorts them <hi>v.</hi> 7. rather to take a great deal of wrong, and to suffer themselves to be defrauded, <hi>(viz.</hi> in their private rights) than thus to go to Law one with another, to expose their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Profession to so open Contempt, and to give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the enemies of God to blaspheme.</p>
               <p>But fourthly, Though the Apostle there forbid all such unbrotherly contentions, and bringing them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infidel-Judges; yet he there (if you mark) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them a Judicature, before which they might lawfully bring their reasonable and just Complaints, that is, a Christian Judicature, consisting of <hi>Believers, v.</hi> 1. And expostulates with them sharply for not having appointed such a Court among themselves, before whom wronged persons might bring their Causes pertaining to this life, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. While there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we live under a Christian Prince governing us by Christian Laws, and appointing us Courts consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christian Judges, we cannot suppose our selves to be in the fore-cited Scripture forbidden to make application to them in cases just and necessary.</p>

               <p>I have given you diligent attention, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thank you for the satisfactory account you have given me, for I must needs acknowledge my self convinced by you of the unreasonableness of my scruple, and of taking any Scripture in such a sense, as makes void all Law and Government: But when I come in a Quakers Meeting, I fear, new doubts will arise, and when I hear them speak such things as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer, I am apt to conclude their Arguments to be unanswerable.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>If so: then you have reason to observe in your self such an unstableness of mind, as is common to the vulgar; no question but your wavering mind would be under the same perplexities, did you frequent the meetings of other Separatists. A <hi>Jesuite, Socinian, Pelagian,</hi> nay, A <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> might bring such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in vindication of their respective Heresies and Tenents, as might puzle you to give a solution to; would you therefore conclude them all in the right? If you hear the Quakers bring such reasons in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their tenents and ways, as your self cannot answer, will you conclude they are unanswerable? And because you know not a way to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> will you therefore suppose, there are no such Countries, at least no way to them? The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this instability of yours, should teach you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Humility, not to look upon your self as a person fit to trust to your own judgment, not to be confident in your own opinion, nor to lean to your own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5.</p>

2. Prudence, to withdraw your self wholly from the Meetings of those, by whose Sophistries your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in most danger to be perverted, and to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away from those good Principles you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recover'd, and of the soundness and reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whereof you have already confess'd your self convinced and satisfied. For to be led away by a gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding humor to every Conventicle and irregular Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a presumption, which may provoke God to withdraw his protection from you, and to give you up to a spirit of delusion, which makes it very necessary to advise you to keep out of harms way, and the reach of so taking an Infection.</p>
               <p>And 3. it is hence fit and seasonable to exhort you to be willing to be taught, and to that end to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto pious and sober men, especially Ministers of the Gospel, who, being by their education and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, separated to Study and Devotion, are the fitest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to advise you and resolve your scruples, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as, by your own experience and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have administer'd to you the most rational satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. You are ready to consult a Physitian in order to your health, and to take the advice of a Lawyer for the settlement of your estate, and methinks in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion and Conscience, a Divine will be no less fit to be consulted with. <hi>The Priests lips should keep knowledge, and they should</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>seek the Law at his mouth, for he is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts.</hi> And in case of doubts our Church adviseth you to consult either your own, or some other discreet and learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Gods word, &amp;c. <note n="*" place="margin">Exhort to the Communion.</note> And when 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55698:91"/>
you have compared the Discourses of the Quakers and the Ministers of our Church together, and weigh'd them well, and consider'd them in your heart, I doubt not but you will judge our Doctrine to be in your Conscience most agreeable to right reason, and to make most to the honour of God, and the promoting of godliness, righteousness and sobriety, wherein the sum of Religion consists. <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> Iu which things you will find the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church far to exceed the new upstart tenents of the Quakers.</p>

               <p>You cannot call their Doctrines new, when they are the same which the Primitive Christians had in the Apostles days.</p>

               <p>You may easily perceive this to be a manifest untruth: For you know the Primitive Christians were quite different from the Quakers; They did not contemn the two great Ordinances of the Gospel, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, but with due veneration received both, as I am ready to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at large, when there is occasion for it. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians had Bishops and Deacons to govern and teach them, and when they had them did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile them, as do the Quakers; And these were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Functions by prayer and imposition of hands. The Primitive Christians had no Women<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachers, being observant of Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> injunctions, who said in plain words, that it was <hi>a shame for a woman to speak in the Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians had no silent Meetings, as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have, and when you hear again of any more such pray ask them, how reasonable it is for them to call
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55698:92"/>
Preaching Ministers dumb dogs. The Primitive Christians did not contemptuously call the Temple, nor the <note n="†" place="margin">See Psal. 74. where you will find them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (in the old Translation, v. 9.) the Houses of God, and (in the new, v. 8.) the Synagogues of God; being dedicated to his Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> Synagogues, nor houses of Prayer, Steeple-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but resorted to them to teach the people, and perform their Devotions. Thus did our Saviour <hi>Job.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 16. and so did the Apostles <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and <hi>cap.</hi> 13. 5. But it may be made evident that 'tis not the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but the Scribes and Pharisees whom the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do imitate, who place Religion in external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances, while they neglect the weightier things of the Law.</p>
