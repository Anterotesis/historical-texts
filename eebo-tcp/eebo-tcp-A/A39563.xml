         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I ſhould go unarmed into the field to meet the Muſes, the wiſhes of a few might eaſily perſwade me, ſince my own affections drew me; by which Incitement egged on as by Spurs, I recalled my now old-grown Genius from the Camp to the Court, from the War to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate the return of the Lord-Chief-Generall. And who in ſuch ovations would not even be wrapt beyond himſelf? Who can contain his joy within bounds at ſo ſolemn, ſo publike a
<pb facs="tcp:61486:8"/>
Triumph? That we may the better perceive the effects of this rejoycing, we muſt firſt weigh the cauſes. Caſt your eyes then upon our conducting General, whoſe heroick acts (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding even the utmoſt limits of belief) to the preſent age proclaime their own triumph, and amazes ſucceeding generations with their greatneſs. Conſider how with more then <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean</hi> ſtrength he ſtrook off the Head of thoſe <hi>Hydraes</hi> of ſuperſtition with his Conquering Sword! How many <hi>Centaures</hi> breathing forth nought but ſlavery hath he tamed! How many Troopes of enraged enemies hath he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and offered them ſo humbled as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſatisfactory victims to the publike liberty! Hence it proceedes that war is baniſht from
<pb facs="tcp:61486:8"/>
our borders: hence is it that the ſerener beams of Concord have ſo cleerly darted down upon us: O the happineſs of <hi>Brittain</hi> grown even beyond expectation great! For who can but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire ſo many the elaborate endeavors of the Parliament? Who will gaynſay you the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upholders of our State? Who but will confeſs the immediate providence and Divine Finger of God to be ſeen even apparently in the victorious, atcheivements of our Generall; In the acts of our Parliament, the Supreme Authority; And in your own conſultations and deſignes? That therefore the happineſs of our eſtabliſhed Common-wealth may the more largely be notified to all the world, weigh we but equally in the ballance of our
<pb facs="tcp:61486:9"/>
ſerious conſideration the tottering baſis even of the moſt firmly ſeated thrones; but if your enemies are yet ſo ſtubborn that they will not be convinced thereby, let them peruſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent peece with a little ſeriouſneſs that cleerly declares the Prerogative of Kings, and evidently defends the Priviledges and liberty of the people: but whereto tends this? I will not obtrude upon your wiſdoms trifling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, or vain relations: for I have onely mentioned theſe few, that all your malicious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies may know, and knowing confeſs, that God alone is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that he <hi>puts down Princes</hi> from their Thrones, and diſpoſes of the powers of the world after his own pleaſure.</p>

Away then you malicious enemies of order; and ſince ye acknowledge all powers to come from God, obey the <hi>preſent</hi> as Gods ſtewards placed here by himſelf for the governing of the Common-Wealth. Me-think, even our publike profeſſion of Religion ſhould draw us to this, if our own ſecurity alſo did not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper the ſame; for it is ſomwhat an inhumane thing to reſiſt our common, our publike Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and altogether repugnant to reaſon, to kick againſt the Pricks. But I deviate from my firſt propoſition; and humbly beg your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, moſt worthy Fathers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, hoping you will cheriſh theſe firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of my duty under the wings of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent protection: Which have betaken
<pb facs="tcp:61486:10"/>
themſelves with a bluſhing humility to the ſanctuary of your Honors goodneſs. An Olive is ſometime brought in amongſt the coſtlyeſt dainties and well relliſht too; ſomtimes the Ivy doth happily grow and increaſe among trees of a greater tallneſs: And you, moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſuffer this low-growing Ivy to creep forth among the Laureat Cypreſſes of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minencies. If you approve of theſe my deſires, and favor my preſent endeavors, you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe new life and confidence into me, who may enterpriſe a greater work worthy acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, perhaps both from your ſelves and future ages.</p>
