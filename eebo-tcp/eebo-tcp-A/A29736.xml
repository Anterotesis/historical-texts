            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EPILOGUE, &amp;c.
OR,
Some Remarks on the late Debate
about the Usefulness of VOMIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
in <hi>FEVERS.</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THO I have been much solicited, to
shew my Opinion, about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
betwixt the two <hi>Physicians,</hi>
concerning <hi>Vomiting in Fevers,</hi> in
regard of its Affinity with the
Practise of <hi>Purging in Fevers,</hi> which was
mantain'd by me some years agoe, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
oppos'd by a certain <hi>Club</hi> of <hi>Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
I yet delay'd to give my Sentiments
therein, until I should see whether the
<hi>Learn'd Colledge</hi> of <hi>Physicians</hi> would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
therein, and what would be their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
and Suffrage: For the Eyes of all
Men were upon them, expecting that they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97772:3"/>
would do something in it, whose Province
it is, either to compesce or determine such
Differences among their own Members,
that the World might receive Satisfaction
in these Controversies, which concern our
Lives and Health; But whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not that it belongs to them, or that
they know not what to do therein, I am
ignorant: For there is neither any thing
done that way, nor intended so far as I can
learn: Thus in the great Concern of Life
and Health, every one is left to his own
Capricious Opinion, at Hap-hazard, to
take up with what he pleases, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beholden to them for Light and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ection
in such important and intricat
Concerns, what to sollow or what not:
As whether or not a Patient that has been
made Vomit only with Whey, may be
said to have been vomited by a <hi>Physician,</hi>
and the Direction ought to be found upon
the <hi>Apothecarie's File;</hi> and whether a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter
being given by a <hi>Physician</hi> in a <hi>Fever,</hi>
and the <hi>Apothecarie's File</hi> refer'd to; One
would think it had rather been an <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Vomit,</hi> than a Vomit of Whey. And
whether after twice Vomiting of a Patient
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97772:3"/>
with Whey, and purging him with two
lenient Potions, and two Clysters, may
one Ounce of <hi>Vomiting Wine,</hi> with three
<hi>drams</hi> of <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Buckthorn</hi> be given the 9<hi>th</hi>
day of a <hi>Fever?</hi> Or whether there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
as much hazard in <hi>Plentiful Purging,</hi>
as Bystanders apprehend, who never were
acquainted with the <hi>Purging Method in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?</hi>
And whether or not by the vain Fears
of Friends and By-standers, a Faithful and
Expert <hi>Physician</hi> may be blunder'd, and a
good Method disgrac'd? And whether dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
and triffling with a <hi>Fever,</hi> tho less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable,
be not more dangerous, and
often of more fatal consequence, than <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Purging?</hi> And whither upon any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Purging, the <hi>Quieting Medicine</hi>
being a ready Remedy, since in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Case it was not given till the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>'s
return to the <hi>Patient;</hi> May it be
thought there was no need of it before that
time?</p>
            <p>These I take to be the most material
Points in this Debate, which seems to be
handled with a little more Heat and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
than is consistent either with the
Import of the Matter, or Dignity of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97772:4"/>
Members of so Judicious a <hi>Society,</hi> who
would be expected to treat all their Matters,
and seek to advance the Improvement of
Medicine, in Candor, Amity, and Peace.</p>
            <p>Now, if I may lawfully interpose my
Sentiments in these Matters, since the same
has such Relation to the Debate about <hi>Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Fevers,</hi> wherein the rest of the <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
being concerned either as immediat
<hi>Actors, Inciters,</hi> or <hi>Connivers,</hi> so exercised
me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there passed betwixt us no fewer
than eight Pieces in Print: Which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
in another Sub-division of the <hi>Colledge</hi>
it self, whereby they are now split into two
halfs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and parties, into <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins,</hi>
which Rent still continuing, has of late
broken out into this new Debate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there has passed five Peeces.</p>
            <p>However others may think of all this,
my humble Opinion in the first place is,
That this last Contest has made so plain,
profitable, and pleasant a Discovery, that
it may attone for the Scandal of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Divisions, Animosities,</hi> and <hi>Ruptures:</hi>
O blessed <hi>Breach,</hi> and happy and fortunat
<hi>Rent!</hi> that has brought forth so much Light
to <hi>Medicine,</hi> that does so far approve of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97772:4"/>
               <hi>Usefulness of Purging in Fevers,</hi> as to allow
of <hi>Vomiting</hi> therein also, as may be seen in
the Papers on both sides; And as <hi>ex malis
moribus oriuntur bonae leges, Ill manners beget
good Laws;</hi> So we may see <hi>Debates, Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>Differences</hi> may bring profitable
Things to Light, which would have been
otherwise hid: As <hi>Sampson</hi> kill'd more <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi>
at his Death, than in all his Life;
So it may be hop'd that this <hi>Division</hi> and
<hi>Debate</hi> may occasion the killing of more
<hi>Fevers</hi> than their Concord either ever did,
or in appearance would have done. And
as the best Antidote for the Venom of the
<hi>Viper</hi> is the <hi>Viper</hi>'s flesh, so it is hop'd this
wound may prove the true Cure of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
opposition this way of treating of
<hi>Fevers</hi> has formerly met with.</p>
            <p>And who would not rejoice to see such
clear Light arise in Our <hi>Horizon</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi>
as to behold the Credit and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Sagacious Dr: Sydenham,</hi> avouched
and mantained, and his Judgement and
Candor in his Writtings fully asserted by
both Parties: And especially his method
of Treating <hi>Fevers by purging,</hi> which had
been too long and too much opposed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97772:5"/>
in this place, to the unspeakable loss of
<hi>Medicine,</hi> and <hi>Detriment of Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho <hi>Dr. Sydenham</hi> in his last work,
his <hi>Schedula monitoria,</hi> only appoints purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Fevers,</hi> and does not go the length
of <hi>Vomiting.</hi> Those disputants seem so far
to approve thereof, that both of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of giving <hi>Vomits,</hi> in some cases also;
for which the Authority's brought by the
One, seem to be needless, since it is not
denied by the other party; But since these
Authorities may make the Reader appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that the <hi>Purging</hi> in <hi>Fevers,</hi> is no new
Method and Practice: and that it was in
use before Dr. <hi>Sydenhams</hi> time. It is to be
remarked, that <hi>Purging</hi> and <hi>Vomiting</hi> in
<hi>Fevers,</hi> were used only now &amp; then before
his time, and as some Indications did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
but were not used generally, or in great
and dangerous <hi>Fevers,</hi> because the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
oft times raised by the Operation of
the <hi>Purgative</hi> or <hi>Vomitive,</hi> did frequently
Exasperat the <hi>Fever,</hi> which made the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician</hi>
often times Repent his use thereof;
And so Purging and <hi>Vomiting,</hi> was wholly
laid aside with us, and the Cure Commited
to <hi>Cooling ptisans, Emulsions, Clysters, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97772:5"/>
Iuleps, &amp;c.</hi> And that oft times with
as litle Reason as Success: For the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
going to a <hi>Crisis,</hi> the Patients Life was
alwayes in hazard, because in every <hi>Crisis,</hi>
Nature stands as it were Hovering and
<hi>In suspense,</hi> as it were with an equal Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
indifferent to Life or Death, which
may be casten as with a grain, and he that
suffers the Disease to go to a <hi>Crisis,</hi> does
just as if he would throw the Dice upon his
Patients Life: Whereas Dr: <hi>Sydenham</hi>
considered that the Evacuation of the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick
Matter,</hi> did profitably intercept the
<hi>Crisis,</hi> and was the thing indicated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Cure of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and that it
could be done by <hi>Purging</hi> &amp; that any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
raised by the Operation of the <hi>Purge</hi>
might be Commodiously allayed, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Paregorick, Pacisick,</hi> or <hi>Quieting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,</hi>
and thus the <hi>Morbifique</hi> matter, might
be <hi>Evacuated,</hi> and a <hi>Hazardous Crisis,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
prevented, without any Superveeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Commotion, or the Exasperating the
<hi>Fever,</hi> whereby the Patient had the direct
Benefit of the <hi>Purging,</hi> without the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
and Noxious effect thereof.</p>
            <p>And as there are two wayes of these <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97772:6"/>
so there are two several wayes of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
of this <hi>Method,</hi> for sometime these <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
are more <hi>Slow, Long,</hi> and <hi>Chronical</hi> in
their Motion and progress; And sometimes
they are more <hi>Rapid, quick</hi> and <hi>Peracute,</hi> and
come quickly to an end either to <hi>Health</hi> or
<hi>Death;</hi> In the <hi>Slow</hi> and <hi>Long Fever.</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Purges</hi> Repeated at intervals are most
Convenient, and there the quieting Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
is Scarce needed: but in the quick and
<hi>Peracute Fevers,</hi> sharpe <hi>Purges</hi> and <hi>Vomiters</hi>
which work speedily, must without delay be
given: For the <hi>Slow</hi> and <hi>Lenitive Method,</hi> in
a <hi>Peracute</hi> and <hi>quick Fever,</hi> never stops its
<hi>Course</hi> nor obviats its <hi>Carrier:</hi> And as this
seems most reasonable and suitable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
so it is very conform to the Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise
of an Eminent <hi>Author</hi> Dr. <hi>Panthot Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
of the <hi>Colledge</hi> at <hi>Lions,</hi> who in a Book
lately emitted by him, shews that as the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use of <hi>Cordials,</hi> in <hi>Fevers</hi> is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because moving the <hi>Humours</hi> with a fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Agitation,</hi> they Drive them to the head.
So he used only <hi>Bleeding</hi> and frequent <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi>
with <hi>a Laxative Ptisan</hi> taken seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times a day, without delaying <hi>Purging,</hi>
as <hi>Hippocrates teaches,</hi> to the end of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97772:6"/>
And if <hi>Dosings, Ravings, Convulsions</hi>
or any other Frightful Symptoms did arise,
then <hi>instantly,</hi> and without <hi>Hesitation,</hi> he
appoints <hi>Emetique Wine</hi> to be given, than
which he knows not a better Remedy. And
there is an Abstract of his Book to be seen
in the <hi>Miscellany Letters of the works of the
Learned</hi> Emitted at <hi>London May</hi> 1695.</p>
            <p>Now as to the controverted case betwixt
the two <hi>Disputants.</hi> If, <hi>Dr: O:</hi> when
he came to the Patient, who was treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only with gentle <hi>Purgatives,</hi> and found
him under any pressing <hi>Symptoms,</hi> and the
<hi>Fever</hi> growing, I humbly suppose he did not
amiss, to give <hi>Emetique Wine,</hi> and in such
<hi>a dose</hi> as the Patient cou'd bear. And to say
the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>doses</hi> of <hi>Emetique Wine</hi> are very
various, according to the Disposition of
Patients, and their Easiness to be moved,
some taking two ounces for <hi>a dose,</hi> and
other only two drams.</p>
            <p>And considering that upon any exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
effect of the <hi>Purgative</hi> or <hi>Vomitive,</hi> the
<hi>Pacifique</hi> or <hi>Quieting Medicine</hi> is instantly
to be given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in regard in this case, it was
not given till the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> return, we may
construct in Charity that there was no need
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97772:7"/>
there obefore, and the Bystanders and
Friends their apprehensions and fears about
the patient might be groundless, they never
having seen any in a <hi>Fever</hi> treated so, for
the <hi>Purging</hi> method in <hi>Fevers</hi> had always
been <hi>Disguised</hi> and <hi>couched</hi> by <hi>Physicians;</hi>
and the Bystanders keept always in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
about it, (As witness somes calling the
effect of a <hi>Purgative</hi> quietly given, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
looseness which would carry off the
<hi>Disease,</hi>) &amp; if these Fears were improven by
any upon sinistrous designs, they could not
do a more wicked thing, that being the way
to fright timorous People from the use of
this profitable practise of purging in <hi>Fevers.</hi>
And both Reason and Experience will shew
to these that are acquainted with this way
of Cure, that theres more Danger oft times
in the neglect of plentiful <hi>Evacuations,</hi> than
by the use of them, But as 'tis not good to
overact a Cure, so it is not safe to Dally
and triffle away time, which is sometimes
very Precious, <hi>Occasio praeceps, Oportunity
Slips</hi> and <hi>Medio Tutissimus ibis, the midle way
is the Safest,</hi> But in my humble opinion a
Patient that survived so great and so Plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Evacuations,</hi> would not probably have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97772:7"/>
been cured without pretty considerable ones,
and some more they <hi>Dalling</hi> and <hi>Triffling</hi> or
<hi>Couching</hi> and <hi>Dissembling</hi> the method. But
since our Disputants seem to be agreed about
the substantials of this way of treating <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
by <hi>Purging</hi> and <hi>Vomiting,</hi> Pray let them
not <hi>squable</hi> about the Circumstantials, and let
them strive to out do on another in Effectual
and Speedy Curing, without either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
the Method, or shooting short of it:
And I can tell them from Experience,
that its hard to be believed, how great
<hi>Evacuations</hi> in many cases are not only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
but also required in the Cure of
<hi>Fevers,</hi> which we may the more freely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon, having the <hi>Quieting Medicine</hi>
alwayes at hand, to check any Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that way.</p>
            <p>But by the by, it may be observed how
pretty Divertising it is, notwithstanding
the great Opposition made to this way of
curing <hi>Fevers,</hi> to behold the Reception it
now has, and to see persons at such Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
yet substantially agree in this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which is indeed no small Argument
for it, like the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> who
both agree to the Authority of the Old
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97772:8"/>
Testament: And if we narrowly observe
several <hi>Physicians</hi> Practice, we will see some
may be catched stealing into this Practise,
and some too Cavalierly marching into it,
some like <hi>Firrets</hi> and <hi>Moles</hi> working under
Ground, and some frolicking and vapour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
            <p>As it has been the Fate of all new disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
and Discoverers, to meet with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and Contradiction, witness the
opposition made to the Circulation of the
Blood, and the Cure of <hi>Agues</hi> by the <hi>Iesuits</hi>
Bark, no wonder this improvement of thus
treating <hi>Fevers,</hi> should meet with the same
Lot, especially when it Receded so much
from the common Road, which treated them
only with <hi>Cooling Ptisans, Emulsions, Clys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Cordial Iuleps, &amp;c.</hi> But when ever
such improvments come to take place, <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi>
either Jugle or Labour to Disguise
them, or with more Resolution than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
strives who shall be fore-most therein,
and extend them farthest, as was done with
the <hi>Iesuits Bark,</hi> which was not only rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used in all continual <hi>Fevers,</hi> but by
some most Proposterously, to the Cure of
most Diseases.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97772:8"/>
I hope then it will not be unpleasing,
that I offer my humble Sentiments, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Solution of this <hi>Moral Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi>
these strange appearances of the
Actions of Men, in their <hi>Opposing, Shifting,</hi>
or <hi>Streaching</hi> things at this Rate, to the
great Detriment of <hi>Medicine</hi> in particular,
and of Mankind in general.</p>
            <p>In regard new <hi>Discoveries</hi> in <hi>Medicine</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not at first to every one so plain and
clear, as to silence <hi>Contradiction,</hi> they are
sure to meet with opposition from the weak
and less <hi>Perspicacious,</hi> and with <hi>Quible</hi> and
<hi>Cavil</hi> from a Spirit of Detraction in Elder
<hi>Physicians,</hi> who are Jealous that new improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Derogate</hi> from them, or their <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
or that they are in hazard thereby
to be reduced to the same level with young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Physicians,</hi> and be put to go to School a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to learn a new, and with all they <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate</hi>
any thing that may be in hazard
to convict their former practise of Error or
mistake; Tho such an error seems Venial
untill the occasion of delivery from it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
but the Mischief is, that the pride of
Self-seeking Men is such, that before they
will Acknowledge the least Bleemish or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97772:9"/>
they will run the hazard of being
the greatest <hi>Criminals</hi> Under Covert, not only
by the Mischief they do by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of such <hi>Practical Improvments</hi> but by
their Example and Authority, drawing
many younger <hi>Physicians</hi> after them, some
following them out of <hi>Reverence,</hi> and others
out of <hi>Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the more full clearing this
Matter, it would be considered, That as
all Men may be divided into these four
sorts, so <hi>Physicians</hi> are likewise divisible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as many kinds—The first sort are
of these who have a great Stock of <hi>Sense</hi>
and <hi>Learning;</hi> And withal, no less <hi>Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Candor.</hi> The second sort are these
who have much <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Honesty,</hi> but
little <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi> The third sort
are these who have much <hi>Sense,</hi> &amp;c. but
little <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity.</hi> The fourth
are these who have little <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi>
and as little <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Candor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first sort, as they will quickly
discern, take up, and follow new Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they will as readily own, maintain,
and endeavour to propagate them.</p>
            <p>For the second sort, tho they be long in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97772:9"/>
discovering such <hi>Improvements,</hi> yet their
<hi>Honesty</hi> makes them <hi>Modest</hi> and <hi>Doubtful,</hi>
&amp; keeps them from opposing them, waiting
until their weakness comprehend them.</p>
            <p>For the third sort, tho they quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
such <hi>Improvements,</hi> yet for <hi>By respects,</hi>
and <hi>Sinister Ends,</hi> they are shy in falling
in with them, or if they do it, they <hi>Iugle</hi>
and <hi>Dissemble</hi> the Use of them, and labour
to <hi>disguise</hi> them, in so much, that by their
hidden and reserved following them,
they are so straitned, that they never come
to any Perfection in them.</p>
            <p>For the fourth sort, as they are slow in
taking them up, so they are long in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, after they take them up, and as
they are the most constant, so they are the
most violent Opposers of them, and always
until it be a Scandal so to do, their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taking as much time to be Convinced,
as their Honesty to be engaged to own or
Defend them.</p>
            <p>And I may say of these two last Sorts, if
they shall also be Cursed with any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Degree of Credit or Reputation, to
plague the World, and to hinder the Good
of Mankind, by the propagation of such an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97772:10"/>
Improvement as this. (<hi>for Fortune never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
her Gifts so blindly as upon Physicians</hi>)
When ever such come to discern and follow
it, unless they be past feeling, and have
their Consciences wholly Seered, they will
be affected with a Torture and Remorse,
proportionable to their guilt, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to so many Deaths, as has been
caused thorow their contempt of this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
and that not only within the Verge
of their own practice, but also within the
Sphere of Activity of their Credit and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
which may perhaps be no small
precinct to some, it being very plain that
he that neglects the right way to cure his
Patient, while it is in the power of Art
to help him, is as guilty as he that direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maletreats him unto death.</p>
            <p>And there is no <hi>Physician</hi> who rightly
understands the import, weight, and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of his Employment, and the great
Charge lying on him to be accomplisht
therein, so far as is possible for Study, Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Search to go, who will leave any
stone unturned, to find out a more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
cure of <hi>Fevers,</hi> than that which has
been commonly used, by <hi>Bleeding, Cooling
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97772:10"/>
Ptisans, Emulsions, Clysters, Cordial Iuleps,
&amp;c.</hi> which every <hi>Apothecarys</hi> Boy can by
Rote tell, as perfectly as the Physician
himself; And which can be made evident
to do more hurt than good, beside the loss
of time spent upon such triffling.</p>
            <p>Now if every <hi>Physician</hi> would be pleased
to Examine himself, and consider what his
behaviour has been, in Relation to this
<hi>Improvement,</hi> he may thereby know what
place he may take in the foresaid <hi>Scale,</hi> for
according to his <hi>Approbation</hi> or <hi>Opposition</hi> of
this <hi>Improvement,</hi> his <hi>Iugling, Shuffling</hi> or
<hi>Plain dealing</hi> therein, he must necessarly
be ranked; But all Men may see, what
place our two Disputants have, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of their Animosity and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
do both in their practice and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
own and maintain Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> and
his <hi>Writings,</hi> wherein he delivers this way
of <hi>Treating Fevers,</hi> and they being of two
different parties, <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins,</hi> we
may also guess at the Sentiments of their
Respective Associats.</p>
            <p>So it is hoped now, no Physician in
this place will any longer <hi>Bogle</hi> or <hi>Scar</hi> at
this way of Treating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Fevers</hi> or <hi>Shuffle
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97772:11"/>
Iugle,</hi> or <hi>Dissemble</hi> it, to the scandal of
their Profession, the straitning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and the marring of their own and
others accomplishment in this practice,
For I am certainly informed, that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries</hi>
begin to practise it, with the
greatest <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Success;</hi> And One
of them told me, that he has not only seen
many others cured that way, but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he himself was Cured of a most des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<hi>Fever,</hi> by <hi>Purging:</hi> And that he
was happily treated that way, by the Joint
Advice of the <hi>Physicians</hi> who waited on
him, and that at that time few <hi>Physicians</hi>
approved of, or publickly owned that way.</p>
            <p>And tho as both our <hi>Disputants</hi> remark,
Dr <hi>Sydenham</hi> in his last work, the <hi>Monitory
Schedule,</hi> only says, This Method is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to all others in very many kinds of
<hi>Fevers,</hi> yet thereafter he told to my self,
and to several others, that he doubted not,
but it would agree with all <hi>continual Fevers,</hi>
tho he did not think fit, to publish all that
he thought of it, because it might dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
from some of his former Writings, and
he judged it would never be left off, when
once it came in use, because he doubted
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97772:11"/>
not but it would be alwayes more succesful
than any other way, and thorow all <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi>
of years, and as he had practised it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years before the last Edition of the
<hi>Schedula</hi> 1687; so I have practised
it with the greatest success ever since, being
12 years: and a Cure that has holden so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years, it is not to be doubted but it will
hold good alwayes, tho in difficult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Cases, it requires great <hi>Care, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
and <hi>Caution,</hi> and <hi>Dexterity</hi> therein,
can only be acquired by <hi>exact Attention</hi> and
<hi>Consideration,</hi> and due <hi>Experience;</hi> and this
may be a Reason why some Physicians
are unwilling to take up with it, as being
averse to give the Attendance sometimes
requisite in this <hi>Cure,</hi> and these who want
Experience therein, can only bungle at it,
and know not how to go thorow with it;
For in difficult and dangerous Cases, like
the Management of a Ship in a Storm,
where the Master must not only always be
at the <hi>Helm,</hi> but also be well acquainted
with the way he ought to take; So it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
not only the <hi>Physician</hi> to be close at
his <hi>Post,</hi> but likewise to be no Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the Way he ought to take. And
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97772:12"/>
especially in the Fevers that reign at
this time, which are most part <hi>Quick</hi> and
<hi>peracute,</hi> and cut off in a few dayes persons
of impure Bodies: And as I have used this
Method by <hi>Vomiting</hi> and <hi>Purging</hi> in many,
and most successfully, at this time, so I have
had lately considerable Experience thereof
in my own Family, <hi>Wherein Four of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Ten Servants had the Fever, and
blessed be GOD, all are Recovered;</hi> By repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Vomiting,</hi> with <hi>Antimonial Vomits,</hi> and
frequent <hi>Purgings;</hi> Except two Servants,
the one having gotten a great Stress at
work, who bragging of his strength, did
contend with his Neighbour at the <hi>Mowing</hi>
of Hay, and presently sickned, and died
the <hi>sixth</hi> day, and whom I saw not till
the day before he dyed, and found him in
such a condition, that I could not give
him either <hi>Vomite</hi> or <hi>Purge;</hi> and the other
was his Neighbour who strove with him,
being a Man of a most <hi>Impure</hi> and <hi>Emaciate</hi>
Body, who had endured want and Stress
before he came to my Service, and who
got not all was necessary, because he had
not the occasion of due Attendance, all
my Servants being sick at the time, And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97772:12"/>
as both my <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
were <hi>Vomited</hi> several times with
<hi>Antimonial Vomits,</hi> besides frequent <hi>Purg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
so it was astonishing to consider the
quantity &amp; Corruption &amp; Virulency of the
Matter <hi>Vomited</hi> up by them, and as I have
in this matter sincerely told the Truth,
which is also for the most part nottour in
the place: So every one may judge how
Malitious the Reports industriously spread
abroad of me, Are, <hi>Viz.</hi> That seven of
my Servants are lately Dead in <hi>Fevers,</hi>
under this Cure, Whereas tho I have kept
Servants near these Thirty years, Except
these two, I had never any before that
Dyed in my Service, tho the <hi>Fever</hi> has
several times before been in my Family,
and among my Servants and Children, I
hope the Reader will not think this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
altogether impertinent, or out of
Vanity, since it is both for my own Just
and Necessary Vindication, and the defence
of this profitable <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea I hope I might be also allowed to say
something now also by the by, about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Calumnies and Slanders raised, and
Propogate against me about the cure of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97772:13"/>
the <hi>Gout,</hi> Especially by a certain <hi>Person</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erved most diligently, without any other
Grarification, but Slander &amp; Back-biting, for
the Errors committed most unreasonably
by the Patient, and which slanders some
<hi>Physicians</hi> also take pleasure to Trumpet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
tho many other <hi>Gentlemen</hi> may
from their Experience testify the help I
have given them in that Disease, if they
please; And the <hi>Balsome</hi> I use, therein is the
same with that used at <hi>London,</hi> &amp; aproven by

time: Another time if there be any more
Reason for it, may do as well, and <hi>verbum
Sapienti sat est,</hi> a word is enough to a wise
Man.</p>
            <p>But to return to the purpose, it is further
to be remarked that as Persons of <hi>impure</hi>
Bodys and abounding with <hi>vitious humours</hi>
are most subject to these <hi>Epidemical Fevers,</hi>
so they are in most peril thereby, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all such Persons would be admonished,
that by the Advice an able <hi>Physician,</hi> in
such an Epidemical time, they would make
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97772:13"/>
use of fit means for <hi>Prevention,</hi> whereby th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
may either escape the <hi>Fever,</hi> or if they be
seised, it may thereby prove more <hi>Benigne</hi>
and easily <hi>curable,</hi> and among all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medys
for Prevention, as well as for cure,
I know none more effectual as is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Letter insert in Dr. Os. last peice
than <hi>Antimonial Vomits,</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the fear some People have of them,
may be so ordered, that they will work
with as much security and ease, as a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Medicine,</hi> and such Vomits not only
prepare, and open the way, for the more
effectual operation of <hi>Purges,</hi> But also one
<hi>Vomit</hi> has more effect, than two <hi>Purges;</hi>
which is of considerable advantage in <hi>Pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>
and <hi>quick Fevers,</hi> which still require a
speedy remedy by <hi>Evacuation,</hi> and no <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives</hi>
or <hi>Correctors</hi> of <hi>vitious Humors,</hi> can
so suddenly <hi>restore,</hi> and <hi>alter</hi> such a corrupt
<hi>mass</hi> of <hi>Humors,</hi> as are usually evacuat in
<hi>Fevers</hi> by such <hi>Vomits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now considering this whole matter, the
Opposition this practise has met with, and
progress it has made, (the full and clear
History whereof, may perhaps hereafter be
published for satisfaction of the curious,) it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97772:14"/>
is humbly proposed and referred to the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
consideration, of all Physicians, whether
or not they ought to be very wary and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in their behaviour, about the <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
Inventions</hi> and <hi>Experiences</hi> of others,
and whether or not they rather ought, to
inquire, ponder, and Modestly be informed
about them, than be rashly driven by a
spirit of <hi>Pride, Humour</hi> and <hi>Caprice,</hi> to run
them down by all their power, and all
Younger Physicians especially, would be
exhorted to beware whom they take for
<hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> for <hi>ex quovis ligno
non fit Mercurius,</hi> the best Stock of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sense and Learning being little enough
for a Foundation to make a competent
<hi>Physician;</hi> and without it, tho they grow
old in <hi>practise,</hi> they will never acquire true
Skil and Real Experience in this difficult,
intricate, and important <hi>Art,</hi> and Fame, and
Reputation more rarely accompanyes real
Merit in this Faculty and Function, than in
any other whatsoever. The Vulgar upon
whose noise <hi>Fame</hi> depends, being more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<hi>Iudges</hi> in any thing, than in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues</hi>
of this hidden <hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If some younger Physicians shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97772:14"/>
here to enquire, since they have not
<hi>Experience</hi> themselves, and that they must
lean to the <hi>Experience</hi> of Others, how shall
they discern the Men of Real <hi>Experience,</hi>
true Skil and <hi>Merit;</hi> and distinguish them
from Men of meer <hi>Vogue</hi> and <hi>Fame:</hi> For the
Satisfaction of such, and as a mean to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their being initiated in the Errors and
<hi>Mistakes</hi> of Others, which being once taken

be allowed to make a little Digression to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
them, that they ought to be very
cautious how they are led by the <hi>Dictates</hi>
and <hi>Sentiments</hi> of these three or four sorts,
whatever <hi>Vogue</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> they have.
The first are these, who by driwing the
<hi>Trade of Commeradship, Good Fellowship,</hi> and
<hi>Bon-Companionrie</hi> have gotten many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars
and Acquaintance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who will cry them
up for great Physicians, for all know how
generally acceptable such Conversation is,
and what a <hi>Noise</hi> so many Mouths well
tun'd up this way make.</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Sort</hi> are, These who are
<hi>High flowne</hi> or <hi>bigotted</hi> to a <hi>Party,</hi> either
in <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> and these who make
more than an Ordinary <hi>Semblance</hi> and <hi>shew</hi>

of <hi>Probity,</hi> whether <hi>Real,</hi> or <hi>Affected</hi> only
I will not determine, but the Opinion of a
<hi>Goodman,</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Probity</hi> or <hi>Integrity,</hi> tho
they also know him to be a very <hi>weak man,</hi>
goes a <hi>great way</hi> with the <hi>Vulgar</hi> to make a
<hi>good Physician;</hi> especially the <hi>Vulgar</hi> of the
<hi>Respective Parties</hi> they are of.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Sort</hi> are, These interested in
some great <hi>Families,</hi> as having been <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks,
&amp;c.</hi> Or otherwise concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and who thereby come to <hi>Reputation,</hi>
Great Persons being called <hi>Gods,</hi> no wonder
they aim at <hi>Creation,</hi> and the making <hi>Men</hi>
out of <hi>Nothing,</hi> and in no <hi>Faculty</hi> such an
<hi>Exploit</hi> as this seems so easie, as in <hi>Physick.</hi>
There is also a fourth <hi>sort,</hi> that by a <hi>Gentile
meen</hi> screw themselves into Peoples <hi>Liking</hi>
and <hi>Familiarity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or by a <hi>Facetious Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
by making Sports, and by telling little
<hi>quirck knacks</hi> and <hi>Mimical-Stories,</hi> to divert
whereby they gain the Opinion of being
thought Witty and fine Men, while there is
nothing <hi>solid</hi> or <hi>profitable</hi> to be found in their
<hi>Conversation;</hi> but since the most part are
more delighted with shows or with <hi>vain and
froathy Discourse,</hi> than with what is <hi>serious, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,</hi>
and <hi>useful,</hi> and that <hi>Fame</hi> Buoyes up

            </p>
            <p>The Physician not only being a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
of the secret works, and of the hid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
