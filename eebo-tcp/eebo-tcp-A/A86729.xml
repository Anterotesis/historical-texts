         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur eminency for the Profeſſion of Religion, and the
lawfulneſs of your Office, only invites us to dedicate
theſe our papers to you, not that they ſo much expect
your protection, as intend your inſtruction, they only
beg your ſerious peruſal, which may prove a happy coraſive, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
leave you excuſeleſs: your Lordſhip certainly knowes,
that this day <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the Devil and his
Angels are in fight, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſeemes to have got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now at ſuch a time as it is a ſin accurſed with a bitter
curſe, to ſtand a newter; for 'tis a ſeavenfold more accurſed ſin
to fall from <hi>Michael,</hi> and fight on the <hi>Dragons</hi> ſide: if he that loves
not the Lord Jeſus ſhall be curſed with a bitter curſe; what ſhall
befall that Profeſſer who hateth the Lord Jeſus, and perſecutes
him in his Members? Certainly, that mans ſin comes near to the
unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: The World may read his
name written in Hell in great Characters, the ſin againſt the
Holy Ghoſt may be committed in one Act; it is a ſin frequently
committed in this age in <hi>England,</hi> by Profeſſors, as there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſtraits in the narrow way to Heaven, (as repentance and ſelf
denial) the which if a man paſſe, he ſhall never fall away; ſo there
are certain precipices in the broad way to Hell, the which if a
man paſſe, he ſhall never be able to return again, though he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
deſire it. <hi>Cain</hi> paſſed this precipice, and <hi>Judas</hi> in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Maſter, and <hi>Eſau</hi> in ſelling his Birth-right for pottage;
we are far from charging your Lordſhip (as we are free from
<pb facs="tcp:117826:3"/>
acquitting the men of theſe times) of theſe damnable ſins, let
God and your Conſcience condemn or acquit you, before whom ere
long you muſt appear; our deſign is only to unbowel that little
bigbellied Viper (of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Conclaves hatching) the Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which like the Trojan Horſe hath concealed in the belly of
it, the ruine of lawful Magiſtracy, lawful Miniſtery, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
reformed Religion; your Lordſhip knowes full well, that
theſe are three precious Jewels, and your Lordſhip cannot but
know as well, if you pleaſe, that this Ingagement is the deſigned
ruine of them all.</p>
            <p>How ſad a progreſs it hath made already the ſincere Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
of the three Kingdoms to their ſorrow know: long ſince it
hath been the deſign and endeavour of our inveterate enemy the
<hi>Pope,</hi> to extirpate Proteſtant Magiſtracy and Miniſtery; but
they never could effect it until this day, and that principally by
this Ingagement: is not the Proteſtant race of <hi>Kings</hi> utterly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
this Kingdom by this Ingagement? and are not all the
Protestant Miniſters, now about to be turned with their Wives
and Children out of their Eſtates and dwelling-Houſes, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at the pleaſure of their tormenters, and all by this Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> We beſeech you to conſider what <hi>Miniſters</hi> they
are that are perſecuted; for what, and by whom they are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?
your Conſcience tells you my <hi>Lord,</hi> that they are the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
grave, learned, ſincere, zealous Miniſtery of <hi>England,</hi>
that by this Ingagement are perſecuted, and for what? but only
becauſe they will not forſake a good Conſcience, and a juſt cauſe,
that Covenant Cauſe which they ingaged in, which they muſt do
in taking the Ingagement, and that the contrivers of the Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
knew full well, and for that end contrived it. And who are
they that put this in execution, but they that entred into the ſame
Covenant with us? that pretended the ſame cauſe, thoſe whom
we have with the hazard of our lives, Eſtates, and all we have,
preſerved from ruine, and been the cauſe of their promotion; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thoſe who make Lawes for our ruine: theſe men out-law us,
theſe men ſequeſtrate and impriſon us, theſe take away our Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights
from us, and which is worſt of all, theſe are now about to
<pb facs="tcp:117826:3"/>
baniſh our Miniſtery, who have alwayes been our comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
in times of affliction. Woe unto us, were ever poor
Proteſtants ſo miſerably deluded? or were there ever ſuch notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
groſſe Hypocrites, Apoſtate Paſters in the world? are
theſe the Saints that cryed out againſt perſecution of tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences?
is this the year of our liberty ſo much boaſted of by
many? is this the removing of the yoak of oppreſſion and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?
is this the year of throwing down <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> when our chief Proteſtants,
both of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> are inforced to look through
priſon Gates, and the archeſt incendiaries of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party
are imbraced and conſulted with; and when our conſtant, real,
zealous Covenant-keeping <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> are they that muſt be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
with their Wives and Children (as in the <hi>Iriſh Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>)
and <hi>Malignants</hi> and <hi>Sectarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and prophane Fellows ſuffered to enjoy their liberties,
we appeal to your Conſcience (<hi>my Lord</hi>) whether this year
be the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> with the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Papiſts:</hi> are not
all Oaths, penalties, Lawes and Statutes, taken clearly off from
the Papiſts? and is not the Ingagement only deſigned as a ſnare
to catch the ſincere <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and to bring him under ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
baniſhment, out-lawry, and what not?</p>
            <p>The righteous Lord look upon our afflictions, our unheard of
afflictions; that our Brethren are riſen up againſt us, and hate
us, and perſecute us with a far more hatred then our open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and that without a cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Lord judge betwixt us and our enemies this day; if we
have dealt deceitfully in the Covenant of our God, then let God
ſearch it out, and bring us to ruine; but if we are perſecuted
for holding faſt to our Covenant, the Lord plead our cauſe: we
can with comfort and boldneſs ſay this in the midſt of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<hi>Lord thou knoweſt our integrity,</hi> this appeal our
enemies cannot make.</p>
            <p>Come forth (my Lord) from amongſt the tents of theſe ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, leſt you periſh with them, for their folly is made known to
<pb facs="tcp:117826:4"/>

            <head>A ſhort Diſcourſe of the excellency of
Englands Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is not unknown to us the Free-born Proteſtants of
<hi>England,</hi> that our Nation claimeth the priority of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations in the World for ancient and famous Laws,
and Peace and Religion.</p>
            <p>The Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Forteſ.</note> (ſaith Learned <hi>Forteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>)
are ancienter then the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Com.</note> yea of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leg.</note> which are eſteemed the ancienteſt in the World;
they are more famous then others,<note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note> becauſe better then the
Laws of other Nations, and that in a threefold reſpect, in the
ſubject matter, in the form, and 3. in the diſpoſing of
them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ras ſubſtrata</hi> of the ſtatute Laws of <hi>England,</hi> is reaſon,
which indeed is the <hi>totum compoſitum</hi> of the common Law.
Common Law, is a vaſt mine of right reaſon, out of which all
other Laws are digged, and fitly ſquared to the good of the
Kingdom: he therefore is eſteemed the beſt Lawyer that
ſpoke the beſt reaſon, and herein the People of <hi>England</hi> excel
all other Nations, in that they are only ſubjected (by the
Law,) to reaſon, and the pureſt reaſon, which to be, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
perfect freedom; yea it may truly be affirmed, that by
the Law they are ſubjects only to divine reaſon; for we have
ſuch a ſtanding Law upon record, that whatſoever Cuſtom,
maxim, or Statute, ſhall be faind directly contrary to the Law
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117826:5"/>
of God; that Cuſtom, Maxim, Statute, or Caſe, ſhall be <hi>ipſo
facto</hi> void, and ſo adjudged.</p>
            <p>And as for the matter for the form, the Laws of <hi>England</hi>
are the abſolute, and undoubted beſt in the World; for as
there is univerſal obedience required and injoyned to every
Law inacted, for there is a general aſſent in the acting and
conſtitution of that Law.</p>
            <p>There are 3. eſtates which concur, (as joynt cauſes of the
ſame effect) in making of a Law. Theſe 3. Conjunctions do
make the ſupreme Authority of the Nation, the <hi>Apax,</hi> or <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
poteſtatis,</hi> being ſet upon the <hi>Kings</hi> head, all Writs and
proceſſion iſſuing out in his name; with him are joyned the
Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Commons:</hi> theſe 3. diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are limitted by Law; but compunction they have power
to repeal, or make a Law; and none can ſay unto them, why

            <p>Limitations of royal power have been made and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and ſeveral other acts, and no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

and King <hi>Charles</hi> acknowledged, that the meaſure of his
power was the Law, and he deſired no more then what he
was inveſted with by Law.</p>
            <p>And ſo of the other two eſtates of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi>
theſe three have negative voices alike, have freedom (in their
ſeveral places,) a like freedom to make motions, and freedom
to reject what they diſlike.</p>
            <p>This is the abſoluteſt beſt Government in the World, as is
clear from God and Nature. God himſelf who is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Monark of all Spirits, hath pleaſed to reveal himſelf to
Man in a Trinity of perſons, and governs the univerſe by
himſelf, Angels and Men Celeſtical Bodies, by Sun, Moon,

affections; and the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and
<hi>Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of himſelf cannot make a Law of himſelf, if he
do, tis tyranny, nor the Lords in a part by themſelves, nor
the Commons by themſelves againſt the other two, if they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117826:5"/>
do, it is uſurpation, exceeding preſumption, perjury and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for they are ſworn to the contrary by their Oaths of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and ſupremacy, to act nothing againſt the Crown
and Dignity of their Soveraign Lord the King; beſides, they
are ſworn to maintain the Priviledges of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The King makes the firſt of theſe three Eſtates, by a right,

their ancient Cuſtoms and Laws again, and continued them,
<hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, who was of the <hi>Saxon</hi> line, having no
Heir, deſcending of his body, intended to make <hi>Edgar Ethling,</hi>

made to him by <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi>
who forſwore himſelf, and uſurped the Crown: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Duke <hi>William</hi> was received and acknowledged King by
the Nobles and City of <hi>London,</hi> after this <hi>Edgar Ethling,</hi> who
indeed was the right Heyr, compounded with Duke <hi>William,</hi>
and for a royal allowance, which Duke <hi>William</hi> granted him,
he reconciled himſelf to him, and thus <hi>William</hi> came in as
Succeſſour to <hi>Edward</hi> the Saxon King; and ſo it ſucceeded

<hi>Edward</hi> the 4. of the houſe of <hi>York,</hi> coming in upon a better
Title then thoſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> overthrew thoſe that oppoſed
his Title: this Diviſion continued and lived until <hi>Richard</hi>

back into the Current of the old brittiſh blood: together
with the <hi>German, Norman, Burgandian, Caſtalian,</hi> and <hi>French</hi>
atchievements, with the intermarriages, which 800 years had
acquired, incorporated, and brought back into the old royal
time. <hi>Nauntons, fegmenta Regalia, p. 2. Sec.</hi> 1. So that the
Stuarts, have an unqueſtionable Title to the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> from the old Chriſtian brittiſh Kings, whoſe antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is beyond all the Kings in the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tudors</hi> expiring in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the mighty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> ſucceeded by an unqueſtionable Title, as

death, <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. 1648. at his own door.</p>
            <p>So that by this it may appear, by what right the Kings of

            <p>The Houſe of Commons have power to impeach any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

each other: therefore the Lords and Commons be they never

becauſe he makes the firſt eſtate in Parl: indeed they have
power to curb the exorbitances of each other; and for this
end, their two Eſtates of Lords and Commons, were deviſed,
to curb the exceſs of Monarchs; but in no wiſe to dethrone
them.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons never was a Court of Judicature,

or publick capacity, he is no Subject of the Law: indeed,
he is ſworn to maintain and defend the Law. The <hi>King</hi> is
bound to maintain the Law by his Oath, the form of which
Oath runs thus. <hi>You ſhall keep the Church of God, the Clergy
and People intirely in peace and concord in God, according to your
power.</hi> The King anſwers, <hi>I will keep them: you ſhall cauſe equal
and right juſtice in all your judgements, and diſcretion in mercy
and truth, according to your power.</hi> The King anſwers, <hi>I will do
it, you ſhall grant juſt Laws and Cuſtoms to be kept, and you ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117826:7"/>
promiſe that thoſe ſhall be protected by you, and to the
lover of God to be ſtrengthened, which the common People ſhall
chooſe according to their power.</hi> To which the King anſwers, <hi>I give
and promiſe it.</hi> This Oath the King takes at his Coronation, <hi>viz.
Parl. Rol. 1. Hen.</hi> 4. but in caſe he doth not ſo fully execute the
Laws as is meete, there can be no Judge legal of the <hi>King,</hi> becauſe
he is a Monark, and there cannot be Judges of the acceſſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;
for none can be found his equals, and to judge him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
were to deny the Monarch: what is granted to the
meaner Subject, which is to be judged by his equalls.</p>
            <p>But though the Monark cannot be judged, yet the inſtruments
of that Monark may; for a Commiſſion from the <hi>King</hi> cannot
bear out a Subject beyond Law, the exorbitant Commands of ſuch
a Monak, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monark being politically powerleſs; and
if Authority fail in the ſupreme Power, the inſtrument can have
none from thence derived to him, but muſt neceſſarily fall under
the cenſure of the Law; ſo that though the King is head of the
three Eſtates, cannot be moleſted; yet the inſtruments that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
againſt Law may be tryed. This Law is moſt agreeable to the
Law of God, and the Law of nature; to the Law of God, for <hi>Kings</hi>
are the Repreſentatives of God on earth, and none can touch
them, we ſee this clear in two famous inſtances, in <hi>Saul,</hi> who
(could crimes have brought him under the cenſure of men) had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to dethrone him; for he was a Tyrant, a murtherer, and
a publick enemy to the Church and State, yet <hi>David</hi> when he
could have done juſtice upon him, ſaid, <hi>God forbid, for he is the Lords
anointed, the declared King of Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> that was guilty
of murther and adultery, both of them deſerving death by the
Law, yet was not queſtioned by his Subjects, becauſe God only
hath the power of puniſhing <hi>Kings,</hi> and not man.</p>
            <p>This is moſt agreeable to the Law of nature; for if <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould
be ſubject to their Subjects, then the order muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and the Law of nature utterly rooted up, which orders
approves no further then the ſupreme Authority, which if judged
by any, is not the ſupreme, and ſo produceth confuſion and infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Therefore we conclude, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are the
beſt Laws in the World in every reſpect, both for matter, form, and
diſtribution. And as for Laws, ſo for pure Religion, it is beyond
all other Nations, it received the Apoſtolick faith almoſt, if not all

never was obliterate nor extinct in the Kingdom. And as this

the Government of the Kingdom by a Parl: and ſo to pull down the

Ceremonies, and impoſing them on the Miniſtery of <hi>England,</hi> thereby they
intended at once to root out the Proteſtant Miniſtery, and Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
This took effect according to the <hi>Popes</hi> deſires ſo fully, and raiſed the
hopes of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party ſo high, that they reſolved (like <hi>Haman</hi>) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

as it was great joy to the Proteſtants: ſo it was exceeding terror to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and Popiſh faction, many of which fled beyond the Seas to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
other places. Several others like ſubtil <hi>Foxes</hi> got on Sheeps-Cloathing, and
walked amongſt the Separatiſts, who during the <hi>Prelates</hi> tyranny, were
counted the moſt religious and zealous Proteſtants, with theſe did they joyn

diſpleaſed the moſt of Proteſtants, who too far loſt their diſcretion through
the violence of their blind paſſions, who thought to much could not be ſaid
againſt Epiſcopal Government, it had been ſo exceeding tyrannical: hereby
the ſubtil <hi>Jeſuites</hi> under the name of zealous Proteſtants, pluckt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Miniſtery, and the Proteſtant Religion, and the Proteſtant Magiſtracy,
as much into danger on the other hand, as it had been before by the Popiſh
Prelatick party; for upon a true bottom did the <hi>Romiſh Sophiſts</hi> build a falſe
Argument thus. The <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (thats true) the <hi>Pope</hi> made Biſhops
(ſay they) and the Biſhops made Miniſters: therefore the Miniſters now
were ſet down for <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Miniſters: here the Devils Cloven foot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and mark what progreſs and advantage they made of this: The next
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117826:10"/>
conſequence was: If Miniſters be Antichriſtian, then the Ordinances they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
are Antich. Baptiſme is Antich. ſinging Pſalms, obſerving the Lords
day, meeting in Churches, all this was Antichriſtian: ſo that the Pope ſet up
two deſignes for the miſcarriage of that of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for what with the
Parl: juſt and ſtrict proceedings againſt the Popiſh party about the Court,
and what with their prevalency at Court with the Queen and the King;
deſignes by the Court factions were on foot, to bring the Northern Army
againſt the Parl: to over-awe them; as appears in the preamble of their
Proteſtation, made <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641. Thus, whereas the deſignes of Prieſts, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,
and other adherents to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> have of late been more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and boldly put in practice then formerly, to the undermining and
danger of the ruine of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the fundamental Laws of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by wicked plots
and conſpiracies, and breach of Parliaments; whereby the Kings Maj. perſon
is indangered, and an Army intended to be brought up againſt the Parl: to
force them to condeſcend to the luſts of a Popiſh party: Hereupon the firſt
Proteſtation was framed, and ſent throughout the Kingdom, no body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to ſubſcribe it except Jeſuitiſh Separatiſts. J. A. B. <hi>do in the preſence
of Almighty God, promiſe, vow and proteſt, to maintain and defend as far as
lawfully I may,</hi> &amp;c. Soon after this, the breach between the King and the
Parl. fell out, the King giving too much ear to evil Councel, and that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
faction which was the ground of all the former perſecution and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War: the King raiſed an Army to defend himſelf and the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Parl: did the like upon the ſame grounds, which at that time
was doubtleſs real; their end propounded was to defend Religion, Law, the
Kings Maj. Perſon, the Parl. priviledges, and the Peoples Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Parl: cauſe ſeemed the beſt in moſt Proteſtants eyes at that time, in
regard the Courts deſigns were long before diſcovered to the Parl: The
Queens departure with the Crown-Jewels into <hi>Holland,</hi> and the numerous
flocks of Papiſts going to the King, with all the corrupt part and guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Kingdom, which made haſte to the King after his departure, made
the Proteſtants afraid what would become of Religion, Parliament, and the
Kings perſon, ſhould that party about him have prevailed: however they
profeſſed the Proteſtant Religion, though many of them convicted Papiſts.
Hereupon the Lords and Commons made a ſecond Vow and Covenant with
this preamble, <hi>Whereas the Lords and Commons now aſſembled in Parl: have
declared that there hath been and now is a Popiſh and Traiterus plot, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the true Proteſtant Reformed Religion, and the liberty of the ſubject</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And after all this ſtill perceiving the Popiſh party to increaſe, grow great,
victorious, bloudy and blaſphemous; the Lords and Commons profeſſing
to the World, that they had nothing before their eyes but the glory of
God, the advancement of Chriſts Kingdom, and the happineſs of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117826:10"/>
King and his Poſterity, with the true publique liberty, ſafety, and peace of
the Kingdom againſt the plots of the enemies, they entred into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant, containing 6. Articles, which every Parl. man
publickly and ſolemnly at the Chappel of St, <hi>Margaret Weſtminſter,</hi> (with
his hand lifted up to Heaven, in the ſight of the <hi>Scots Commiſſioners,</hi> and the
whole Congregation) did ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>1. That we will ſincerely, really, and conſtantly through the grace of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

Perſon and Authority, in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion and
Liberties of the Kingdom; that the World may bear witneſs with our Conſciences
of our loyalty, and that we have no thoughts or intentions, to diminiſh his Majeſties

            <p>This ſolemn League and Covenant being entred into by both Nations of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> made the deepeſt and ſtrongeſt Politicians of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
faction to tremble, yea (as Mr. <hi>Hinderſon,</hi> the Reverend and Learned
Miniſter of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then Commiſſioner, well foretold) the news of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
(which was ſoon carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> with the names of all the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers)
made the Pope and his Conclave of <hi>Cardinals</hi> amazed and tremble;
inſomuch, that they doubled their diligence to work the deſtruction of the
Covenanteers at this time. The Duke of <hi>Lorane</hi> was ſolicited by Sir <hi>Kelem
Digbies</hi> meanes, who was then the Queens Agent for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs
at <hi>Rome,</hi> to help the King of <hi>England</hi> with an Army againſt the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>England.</hi> Sir <hi>Kelenem Digby</hi> was the Popes right hand to promote
and further all deſigns againſt the Covenanters party in <hi>England.</hi> At the ſame
time a Nuncio was forthwith ſent from the Popes Court into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
there to make a Ceſſation with the Proteſtants, and to further by all means
poſſible the King of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Covenanters, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with the Popes good liking, as hath been confeſſed.</p>
            <p>The old and ſage Stateſmen in Parl: perceiving the deſignes of the <hi>Pope</hi>
to drive furiouſly on towards the deſtruction of the Parl: and Covenanters,
called in the <hi>Scots</hi> to their aid againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> deſignes. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> A<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Scots</hi> Army admitting no Officers or Souldiers in their Armies, but
ſuch as took the Covenant: the Covenanters (through Gods providence)
beyond all expectation proſpered in the field againſt their enemies; and the
Parl: and Aſſembly of Divines proſpered at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and went on ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively,
both of them being unanimous in the pulling down of Popery and
Tyranny, and eſtabliſhing and maintaining the liberties of the Kingdom,
and Laws of the Realm, and true Religion in Doctrine, Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
for this purpoſe the Aſſembly of Divines firſt went over the
Articles of faith, drew them up after moſt deliberate, ſerious, and learned

            <p>Then they regularly proceeded to ſettle Church-Government, firſt prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Presbytery to be the Government which is moſt like to the primitive
Government, and coming neareſt of all other Governments to Gods word;
next they drew up a Directory for Church-Government, with an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
learned, and pious Catechiſme; and thus the Covenanters Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Miniſtry went on and proſpered until they threw down their open
enemies in the field, and were in great hopes of ſetling the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in purity, and extirpating Popery out of the 3. Kingdoms: at this
time the Popes Politicians were got into the Parl: Army, under the name
of Independents, from which the King fled to the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being fallen into the Covenanters hands, viz. the Scottiſh Army, the Parl:
made ſpeedy and ſeaſonable applications to him at Newcaſtle, offering to him Articles
of agreement, which news was forthwith carried to Rome; whereupon the Pope and
the Conclave of Rome were inforced to look about, and change their deſignes, project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new wayes by contrary proceedings to effect one and the ſame end; for
whereas they had given order to the Catholiques in Ireland before to yield all aſſiſtance
to the King againſt the Parl Seeing now the King was under the Parl: power, leaſt he and
his Parl: ſhould agree, and ſo England and Ireland be loſt, the Pope played aforehand
game, ſending his Army into Ireland, commanding at this time all the Cathol quests
renounce their allegiance to the King of England, and from that day forward the Pope,
and all the Romiſh Politicians projected how to deſtroy both King and Parl: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Reformation by the Covenanters, ſo far carried on both in England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:117826:11"/>
The taſk was hard at firſt view; to deſtroy a Religious Parliament, a victorious Army,
and an able, pious, and zealous Clergy, was no ſmall piece of work. The Romiſh poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticions
therefore were inforced to fly to their laſt refuge of Hypocriſie and lies, and like
<hi>Euphrates</hi> Frog, to change both ſhape and colour, uſing the violent motion of Frogs
from one extream to another, from the extream of Tyranny, to the extream of <hi>Anarchy;</hi>
from the extream of holy Orders to the extream of no ordination. In plain tearms the
Pope and his Counſel perceiving there was no probable way to get a Toleration for
Catholicks in the Kingdom of England, if the King, Lords and Commons agreed; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
how to throw down King, Lord and Commons, and Aſſembly of Divines, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Proteſtant Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>That the chief Engines to effect this might be placed here in England, and have ſure
footing free from the power of the Magiſtrates corrective and coercive power; Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
was ſet up which five valiant Champions of the Popes had defended in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as long as they could; and being there able to ſtand againſt truth no longer, like
Serpents hiſſed for all the viperous brood of Sectarious blaſphemers, or any Sect to creep
into their bellies. Hereby Independencie that bottomleſſe pit, and Independent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
(the very plot deſigned to deſtroy Religion in the Nethetlands by the Pope,
firſt enacted there by <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> the Popes hyerling) became as ſo many nurceries of
Jeſuite: and Popiſh Prieſts, and ſo many dens of Theeves; where they framed all their
picklocks opinions and deviliſh deſtructive inſtruments to ruin the Magiſtracy and the
Miniſtery. For the propagating and facilitating of this deſign, the chief of the Romiſh
Politicians in Europe were ſent to England, where they all went under the name of
diſſenting brethren, Independents, tender conſcienſ-men, and great Enemies to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
crying, down with Antichriſt, calling the Pope Anti-Chriſt; not that they thought
ſo but that they might hereby carry an their deſign of throwing down the proteſtant
Miniſtery undiſcovered for this to this day is their great and chief argument The Pope
is Anti-chriſt (thats true Antichriſt making Biſhops, Biſhops are Antichriſtian, (that in
ſome ſortis true alſo)</p>
            <p>Antichriſtian Biſhops making and ordaining Miniſters, Miniſters of England, are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians.
Ergo down with the Miniſtery of England, down with theſe black-coats,
down with Baals Prieſts, down with them, there is the deſign, and there is the end of all.
They onely uſe the Argument to put in practice the concluſion; they that preſſe the
Argument, and firſt framed it, were far from thinking the Pope to be Antichriſt,
or Prelatical Biſhop, eithe; onely it was framed to deſtroy the Covenanteeres Miniſtery,
who abhor the Pope, and long ſince renounced him and his adherents.</p>
            <p>If it be well obſerved, Indepency was but the wooden horſe with a thouſand Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
in his belly, brought into the Kingdom of England by the Romiſh Politicians, and
let forth as ſo many furies to ſly in the face of the reformed Religion. For he that views
the Hereſies of late ſprung up amongſt us, cannot but ſee that againſt every one of the
Aſſemblies, 33. Articles they raiſed contrary Hereſies; and could the ſilly Engliſh Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
of their own heads without the help of Jeſuits and Romiſh Caſuiſts do all this?
'tis ſolly to think it. The late Heretical Arguments are taken out of Caſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

did they deviſe liberty of conſcience meerly to get free from the Magiſtrate, and

how vehemently did they preach peace, for love, and meekneſſe, and admoniſhing on,e
another in love, and being tender of giving offence to tender couſciences; whereas we

and ſome ('tis to be feared) poiſoned.</p>
            <p>This party laid hold of the King, impriſoned him, and when the two Houſes of Lords
and Commons ſate freely, and voted a Treaty with the King, and when the King had
agreed to extirpate Popery, and eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Religion in his three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and to fettle Church-Government according to the primitive conſtitution; and
when upon a free and ſerious debate the Lords and Commons voted the conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the King to be a ground for them to proceed upon to ſettle the peace of the
Kingdom, then, even then, this party againſt the Votes of the Supream Authority of
this Nation, and againſt their allegiance violently ruſhed in upon the houſes pulled out
and reſtrained one hundred and fifty, impriſoned the chief Proteſtants, and ableſt
Stateſ-men who were moſt violent againſt the Papiſts.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117826:12"/>
and left only a party remaining in the lower Houſe, ſuch as themſelves
beſt liked of; this party ſeized on the King, cauſed him to be publiquely
arraigned, and at his own door at Noon in the view of all the people cut
off his Head, who was then the only Proteſtant King in the world, and
only becauſe he reſolved to root out Popery, and eſtabliſh true Religion
according to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Since which time the ſame party having rid their hands of the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Magiſtracy, have oft printed Books againſt the Calling of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Miniſtry, which Books have been printed by Authority, licenſed, and
frequently taught and ſcattered amongſt the people.</p>
            <p>And they have again and again petitioned that Power which they ſet
up, if not to pull down Miniſtry, States Preachers (as they call them) to
take away their Eſtates, their Tythes and Livings, by which they and their
families ſubſiſt; and how far they have proceeded in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi>
to ruine the Covenanters Miniſtry, all the world may ſee. But the chief
Politicians amongſt them conceiving that Deſign to be too ſhort to reach
all the Proteſtant Miniſtry, as the Heads of Colledges, and ſuch men, and
being well aſſured by taking away Tythes they ſhall prejudice their own
party equal with othets, have pitched upon a more Politick Deſign for the
extirpation of the Covenanters, which is by framing a contrary Oath to
the Covenant, and impoſing it upon the Miniſtry; hereby their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eſcape the ſnare, and only the Godly, Faithful, Loyal and Orthodox
Miniſters are taken; they have taken their Tythes from them, ſilenced

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers,
outlawed all the Covenanters; and laſtly, have reſolved to turn them
this Winter out of all Cities, Towns and Corporations. Thus far have
they proceeded by this Popiſh Engine to deſtroy the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>This New Oath (ſo far as we can perceive) is a meer Deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Parliament, to deſtroy the Army, to deſtroy the Miniſtery and
the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>1. Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> ſeemeth rationally to prove that this new oath or ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be intended to uphold the preſent power that inforceth the
taking of it, but to maintain the Liberties of the Common-wealth, whoſe
juſt Liberties and Ancient cuſtomes they confound, and therefore by that
ingagement men (ſay that party juſtly) are bound not to eſtabliſh but to
pull down any uſurped power over the people.</p>
            <p>2, If Mr <hi>Lilburn</hi> who is a man very popular in the Kingdome, having
alwayes been a publick ſufferer, ſhould (as he conceives himſelf bound
by that Engagement) gather of Gentlemen Souldiers and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
and free-born People of <hi>England,</hi> a conſiderable Party to remove
thoſe out of the way, whom he and his party conceive are Tyrannical, and
Oppoſers of the People, and in their ſtead erect another Party, who are
the true choſen Repreſentatives of the People; whether he may not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tax all the Engagers that reſiſt him, as Covenant-breakers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt them accordingly; and ſo conſequently whether this doth
not open a gap, and a wide one, to ſet up whom the People ſhall chooſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117826:13"/>
above the preſent Houſe ſitting and Engagement; to be Aſſiſtants in ſuch
Parliament confounding Acts, as 'tis declared:</p>
            <p>2. <hi>As it is deſtructive to the Parliament, ſo likewiſe to the Army; For
ſaith one part of the Army,</hi> The preſent Government is by Repreſentatives of
the peoples chooſing. <hi>Saith another part,</hi> The preſent Government is by that
Party in the Houſe of Commons, who invited us to the City to pull down the
King, Lords, and the greateſt part of the Commons, and by our Power enabled to
make Acts, and enforce the Kingdom to obey them. <hi>Saith another part of the
Army,</hi> The preſent Government is the Councel of State, and the Councel of War,
for that party in the Houſe were not of our ſetting up, only we ſuffured them to
ſit there, and the Councel of war commanded them to act what they did; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councel of War, with the Councel of State, erected by us; are the preſent
Government. Whether all theſe ſeveral Parties (eſpecially if there ſhould
be claſhing betwixt them) may not by this Engagement conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Conſcience bound to maintain their ſeveral Parties as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government without King or Lords? And thus 'tis likely to prove
deſtructive to the Army.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis abſolutely deſtructive to the Proteſtant Miniſtry, and the ſound
Proteſtants of the Kingdom; For it makes them in the ſight of all the
people in the world guilty of the horrible and Jeſuitical Deſigns and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
of the cutting off of the King, the throwing down of the Houſe of
Lords, and excluding of the Covenant keeping Proteſtants; for by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
that Engagement, they teſtifie to God and the world, that they
approve of all that they have done, (as they ſay.)</p>
            <p>2. They make themſelves guilty of horrible Perjury; for they did
ſwear Allegiance to the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors, to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Attemps and Conſpiracies whatſoever; Now this is directly
to conſpire the extirpation of the Kings Poſterity. 2. The Proteſtation
is againſt it. 3. Their Covenant directly oppoſeth the Engagement;
For therein they engaged to maintain the King, Lords and Commons;
and in this Engagement they engage to they know not what, without
King and Lords: So that if they engage, they in their Conſciences pull
the guilt of Murther, Treaſon, and other foul Facts upon their head<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and
forſwear themſelves; Or if they do not engage, they are it ſeems to be
ſtripe of their Eſtates, protection of the Law, and lies at the mercy of every
Villain. So that 'tis abſolutely deſtructive to the Miniſtry, and the like
may be ſaid of the Proteſtants of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Oaths (ſay the Caſeiſts, and all other Divines) ought to be plain and
clear, without equivocal terms or doubtful expreſſion; For every Oath
or Engagement is given and taken, to oblige the party that takes it to
the performance of what he ſwore unto. Now every wiſe man in taking
an Oath propoſeth firſt theſe two things. 1. Who impoſeth it. 2. What
it is that is impoſed.</p>
            <p>For that's certain, an unlawful or uſurped Power cannot impoſe an
Oath; it is lawful Authority muſt impoſe it, otherwiſe the Oath (though
good) may juſtly be refuſed, As the Gun-powder Traytors, had their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117826:13"/>
Deſign taken effect, they had got into the Throne, and impoſed an Oath
(though lawful in it ſelf) upon the Barons, Knights, Citizens, Gentry,
and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> yet it would doubtleſs and ought to be rejected
by them, becauſe the Authority was impoſed which uſurped it. This muſt
needs be ſo, for otherwiſe a Maſter, if over-powered by his ſervants, is
bound to take and ſubmit to ſuch an Oath as his ſervant ſhall impoſe,
which would ſoon ſet Beggers on horſe-back, and make all men of Honor
and Wealth perpetual ſlaves; but greater confuſion then this there can
not be in Hell, for 'tis Confuſion bottomleſs and unfadomable.</p>
            <p>2. What it is that is impoſed? that muſt be inquired into, for no man
of conſcience or honour, or the leaſt degree of wit, but will inquire what
it is that he takes before he take it, he will not take it firſt and enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
what it means, that's forbidden by <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that men may underſtand what they ingage or ſwear unto, the
words ought to be ſimple, cleer, and plain, that men may underſtand
them; For <hi>juramentum obligat lecundum intentionem jurantis ſine d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> alias
ſecundum ſecundarium intellectum ejus cui juratur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas.</hi> Now if
there be <hi>Amphibolas,</hi> equivocal terms and obſcurities in an Oath, how
can it poſſibly be but there muſt be errors either in him that gives it, or he
that takes it, or both.</p>
            <p>As for this Engagement indeed it is politiquely gilded like a poyſoned
Pill, with as much ſubtilty and craft to induce people to take it as may be,
for they call it <hi>An Engagement,</hi> not an Oath, for then they ſuppoſed people
would ſcruple it, but it is only ſubſcribing to two or three words, and
there's an end; this is no great matter with Atheiſts, Apoſtates, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
Lovers of the World, and Haters of God and Goodneſs; but
they that are wiſe, ſober-minded, and conſcientious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As they two well
know what Authority impoſeth it, ſo they cannot poſſibly ſee what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended
in it, nor what to make of it. He that ſeriouſly views it, will
poſitively conclude, there was never ſuch a little big-belly'd viporous
Monſter ſeen in the world before, to have ſo many Engines within ſo ſmall
a compaſs, to teer in pieces all parties that engage in it.</p>
            <p>We'l ſpread it to the eye of the world.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>A. B.</hi> do promiſe and declare that I will be true and faithful to the
Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> as it is now eſtabliſhed, without a King and Houſe
of Lords.</p>
            <p>Within this little Circumference of words there are no leſs then two
and twenty Doubts to be reſolved, and neceſſary Queries to be anſwered,
before this. Engagement can be taken by any man of Honour or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Quere.</hi> What is the meaning of the word <hi>[Common-wealth?]</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it meant in the primary proper ſence, for the Body of the Nation,
or for the common good of that Body? Or whether in the ſecundary
borrowed ſence, for the Body of the Repreſentative?</p>
            <p>2. Whether (if it be meant in the latter ſence) by <hi>Common-wealth</hi> be
meant a Parliament, or a Houſe of Commons, choſen as formerly? or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117826:14"/>
by any other way, and how? Or whether the thing be changed with the
name?</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be only an excluſive Engagement, as being againſt King
and Lords, without including any Government in their ſtead to which we
engage?</p>
            <p>4. Is the meaning, that we ſhall be true and faithful to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
whiles King and Lords are excluded? Or that we ſhall endeavor
alſo to continue their excluſion? And ſo whether he that endeavoreth
their reſtoring, or he that hinders it not, do break the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though he be faithful to the Commonwealth while they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent?</p>
            <p>5. If the preſent Government ſhould be overthrown, and King and
Lords ſet vp, whether doth he break this Engagement who ſhall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to them, or that ſhall ſwear or engage for them againſt the preſent
Government?</p>
            <p>6. If by <hi>Commonwealth</hi> be meant the preſent Government (as the words
<hi>[Now Eſtabliſhed]</hi> would make us think it is) then what is it that is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed?
whether an intire Houſe of Commons, or not intire? whether
only the preſent Houſe, or all future, or any future? Whether this Houſe
to be perpetuated? or if not, whether to continue till they voluntarily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,
which we know not whether it will be perpetuated or not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
whether we engage to any ſucceeding Parliament or not? Or
if they diſſolve, whether the next muſt be annual or triennial, or of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their own pleaſure as this? or whether choſen as formerly? or how?</p>
            <p>7. Whether the meaning of the word (<hi>As</hi>) be to engage us to endeavor
that all future Parliaments ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the ſame courſe, and
by the ſame means as this hath been?</p>
            <p>8. Whether the word (<hi>Now</hi>) have reference to the firſt Calling of this
Houſe of Commons, or to any alteration ſince made? And if ſo, by whom?
and when? and by what Authority was that change made?</p>
            <p>9. What's meant by (<hi>true and faithful,</hi>) whether only to do them no
wrong, or not to be perfidious? or elſe to obey them? or further to engage
and hazard our eſtates and lives on their behalf, or how far?</p>
            <p>10. And ſo if King and Lords ſhould raiſe an Army to recover their
Authority, whether he that refuſeth to fight againſt them do break his
Engagement?</p>
            <p>11. Seeing the people are judged the Supream Power (as it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the preſent Houſe) do they hereby engage to their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or to the preſent Authority, as their Supreriors or Rulers? and ſo give
away their Supremacy? or is it ſo natural to them, that they cannot give
it away? (which elſe would have been done heretofore;) Or do they
engage to them only as their Truſtees or Servants? <hi>viz.</hi> That they will
defend them in the work that they ſet them about?</p>
            <p>12. Whether if an Army, or any powerful Company, ſhould ſeize on the
preſent Houſe of Comons, or the greater part, &amp; ſhould impriſon, exclude,
or hang them up at Tybarn, are the people bound by this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117826:14"/>
to riſe for their Defence, and make War againſt theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders?</p>
            <p>13. If this Parliament or any hereafter ſhould endeavor to perpetuate
themſelves, and ſo prevent our having any more free Elections, whether
do we hereby engage to be true to them; or if we endeavor to diſſolve
them, do we break this Engagement?</p>
            <p>14. Doth this Engagement take away the Power of the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And if they when they meet and ſit reſtore King and Lords, which
now are thrown down, do they break this Engagement?</p>
            <p>15. If this next Parliament ſhall ſo re-eſtabliſh King and Lords, and
will not rule without them, muſt we reſiſt all, and be without any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?
or muſt we endeavor to chooſe a new <hi>Parliament?</hi> and if they
do the like, what muſt we do?</p>
            <p>16. If the preſent Houſe ſhall again change their Judgments, and ſet
up King and Lords, or require us to ſwear to them, muſt we obey or reſiſt
them?</p>
            <p>17. If this Army by obſerving that there is no Government but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
or one Inſupremacy in all the Bible mentioned, or by reading
that (<hi>For the ſins of people many are thy Rulers,</hi>) or by the experience of
new diviſions and parties in <hi>Parliament,</hi> breeding diſtempers in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or by being won over by the prevalency or flattery of ſome one
ſingle perſon, whoſe deſerts and worth they conceive is ſuch, as they
reſolve to make him ſole Governor, and ſo ſet up Monarchy again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are bound by this Engagement to reſiſt them?</p>
            <p>18. Do we engage to the preſent Power abſolutely or conditionally?
If this or any other <hi>Repreſentative</hi> ſhall Tyrannize and invade the peoples
Eſtates, or take away propriety (which are things that cannot be <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
acts,</hi> becauſe the people having no ſuch power themſelves, cannot
give it to others, ſeeing there is no power but what's derived from Gods,
who hath given none to do evil,) are we in this caſe bound to continue
our faithfulneſs?</p>
            <p>19. If the people ſhall find that this preſent Houſe, or any other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
hath forfeited their Truſt, or been guilty of the fore mentioned
Crimes, may they not recall that their Truſt, and exclude them from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</p>
            <p>20. Or if any of us be members of the Army, and the ſaid Army ſhall
hereafter judg that this Houſe hath been ſo guilty, and ſhall exclude ſome,
and baniſh others, and behead others (for ſo the Powers as now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtand) and ſo we underſtand <hi>[as now eſtabliſhed,]</hi> do we break the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
if we joyn with the Army in ſo doing, or ſhould we reſiſt
them?</p>
            <p>21. If this minor part of this preſent Houſe, or any ſucceeding, ſhall
judg that the whole is in danger by a corrupt majority, and (having
ſtrength thereunto) ſhall exclude them, do they break the Engagement
or we, if we further them in it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:117826:15"/>
22. If one part of the People or Army ſhall judg that this or any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Repreſentative hath been this Truſt, and the other part judg other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
which muſt we adhere to according to this Engagement?</p>
            <p>When the Authors of this Engagement ſhall clearly and fully reſolve
theſe Doubts, and give national and ſatisfactory Anſwer to theſe Queries,
they will in great meaſure ſatisfie the Kingdom, at leaſtwiſe the more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
part of them, and much more diſpoſe them to engage for the good
of the Kingdom; until then, we could heartily wiſh that Mr <hi>Dury,</hi> and
ſuch vain Bablers (who moſt groſly abuſe and miſapply Scripture, and
other Moral Rules) might be refrained from vometing up in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
view ſuch indigeſted Crudities, to the ſcandal of the Engliſh Nation,
and reproach of the Proteſtants throughout the world.</p>
            <p>We do profeſs, when the lawfulneſs of the Authority that impoſeth it
ſhall be made out clear to us, and our Doubts fully reſolved, with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting
of the Iuſtice, Goodneſs and Neceſſity of this Engagement, we
ſpeak it ſeriouſly and unfeignedly, there ſhall none more willingly nor
readily then our ſelves ſubſcribe it, until then, we cannot but think the
preſſing of the Engagement, and the puniſhing the Non-Subſcribers with
with ſuch intollerable puniſhments, as the expoſing their Eſtates and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to open violence, ſuch on enſlaving, irrational and deſtructive
Act againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> as ſince the planting of the Goſpel
in this Kingdom until this day, the like deſtructive Act can ſcarce be
found, It enſlaves the Souls as well as the bodies of men; for what
greater ſnare can there be to the Conſcience, then to be inforced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to they know not whom? 2. To they know not what? All the light
that is in it is, that it plainly tells a man that ſubſcribes it, that he ſwears
point blank againſt his Oath of Allegiance, his Proteſtation and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
all which engage him to maintain King and Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this engageth
him againſt King and Lords in the bare words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is ſaid by the moſt learned of the Engagers, That the taking
of this Engagement is no breach of the Covenant, becauſe the Covenant
obligeth no longer then there is a poſſibility of keeping it; but King and
Lords being taken away, there is no poſſibility of maintaining that that
is not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> But we humbly conceive (under favor) that this Argument is no
way ſatisfactory; For though it be granted, that 'tis impoſſible for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter
to maintain King and Lords when they are thrown down, yet
'tis not impoſſible for him in his calling and place to maintain Kingly
Government; As it is impoſſible for the ſon to yield actual obedience to
the father whom Theeves and Robbers have murthered, yet 'tis poſſible
for that ſon to expreſs his fillial affection that he bore to his father, and
his real intentions of preſerving his father, by exclaiming againſt the
Malefactors, and uſing all lawful means to bring ſuch men to condign
puniſhment, and utterly ſhunning all compliance with them.</p>
            <p>Put the caſe a company of hired ſervants in a family ſhould conſpire
to kill the Maſter of the family, or impriſon him, and ſeize on the wealth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117826:15"/>
and eſtate of their Maſter, divide it amongſt them, proclaim themſelves
Lords and Maſters of the family, command the children to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to them; though the children are not able to reſiſt them, nor yield
that obedidence for the preſent which is due to their father, nor the wife
expreſs that conjugal love, by reaſon of the violent reſtrant and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet it is poſſible for the wife to abhor the company, and diſclaim the
authority of thoſe ſervants, not to own them for her lord, nor ſubmit unto
them, nor be confederate with them, though ſhe cannot for the preſent
enjoy her husband; and ſo for the children, though they cannot poſſibly
love as their father, yet they may diſclaim the power that abuſed their
father, pray for his reſtoring, and abhor compliance with that party, that
ſo preſumptuouſly and wickedly threw down their father; This they may
do, and are bound to do by the Law of Nature, as children to a father;
and to do the contrary, as to be confederate with thoſe that deſtroyed their
father, were unnatural wickedneſs, and a meer Conſpiracy, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            </p>
            <p>2 We affirm, That the Kings Title is now on foot, and the Lords in

            <p>Can any created (much leſs uſurped) Power free us from our Oath,
which we made to maintain King, Lords and Commons, Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and the Peace and Union of the Kingdom? and never to be drawn
directly or indirectly by any Combination, Perſwaſion or Terror to be
divided from this bleſſed Union and Conjunction, whether to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the conteary part, or give our ſelves to a deteſtable nutrarity
or indiffterency, but all the days of our lives zealouſly and conſtantly
continue therein againſt all oppoſition. This clauſe of the Covenant
ſeems to be made purpoſely againſt the Powers now in Command; And
do they imagine that men of Conſcience or Honour will ſo foully blur
their Profeſſion and Reputation, and endanger their Souls, by a contrary
Subſcription? <hi>Aſhcam</hi> tells us, That uſurped Powers are ſo, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theyout and ſucceed another generation.</p>
            <p>We would fain know, whether ſubſcribing this Engagement be not an
acknowledging of the preſent Power ſitting to be the Supream Authority
of the Nation? and conſequently in ſo doing whether we do not approve
of their cutting off the King, throwing down the Houſe of Lords, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out all the Covenant-keeping Commons, with the reſt of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
keeping Officers in the Kingdom, hereby contracting the guilt of
Blood, Treaſon, and other foul Enormities to our ſelves, by being partaker
in other mens ſins, which <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 1. bids us neither to <hi>ſit</hi> with, nor
<hi>ſtand</hi> with, nor <hi>walk</hi> with, not to have the leaſt communion with?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But is objected by the ableſt of them from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2. That
that the Powers that be are to be obeyed, let them be what they will be,
if they are in being they are to be obeyed, becauſe they are the Ordinance
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle layeth this Command upon Subjects, not to rebel
againſt the viſible Supream Authority, this the Engagers hold to be the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117826:16"/>
ſence of the Apoſtle if ſo, then hence we draw this Argument, <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſubiects ſhal Rebel againſt a viſible ſupream Authority, they reſiſt the
Ordinance of God. But an Army and other ſubiects in contradicting the Votes
of the two Houſes, cutting off the King and pulling down the houſe of Lords
Rebel againſt the Supream Authoritie, Ergo.</hi> Here is an Argument <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
ſo that the Apoſtle ſeems to tell us that uſurping powers are not the
Ordinance of God, but the reſiſters of the Ordinance of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by their own Arguments the preſent power is rather to be dealt with
as reſiſters of the viſible Supream Authority then obeyed or acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Supream.</p>
            <p>As for that of Chriſts acknowledging <hi>Caeſar,</hi> 'tis well known the Caſe
is far different from ours, for the Roman Emperors had conquered Iudea
many years before, and the whole Nation became Tributary to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
the Supream Authority of the Iews acknowledged <hi>Caeſar</hi> to be their
King, We have no King but <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and they had for a certain Tribute
compounded with Caeſar, which Tribute money Chriſt forbids them not,
but commands them to pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Iews will Covenant with Caeſar
Chriſt bids them not break Covenant with Caeſar, and this is all, and
how far is this from our Caſe? Ieſus Chriſt is a great enemy to
uſurpation and ſo much abhors that Chriſtians ſhould ſubject unto it, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
under the Goſpel, that he cals it Devil worſhip, Revel, 13. 4.
Subjecting to a Tyrannicall Government is called the worſhiping of the
Devil; Verſe 1, 2. the beaſt ariſing out of the Sea, (i. e.) the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
State; meaning the Pope, the great Independant or the world;
(verſe 2.) to whom the Devil, the Dragon, gave his ſeat and power, and
great authority, The Dragons ſeat (before Conſtantine) was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Throne ſeated at Rome, this the Devil gave the Pope; and why is
it ſaid the Devil gave him his power and ſeat, but becauſe he got it in the
Devils way? by lying, Covenant-breaking, Rebellion againſt their
Leige Maſters the Emperors, and his murthering and dethroning of
them, and uſurping their authority. This uſurped power of the Pope,
verſe 3, the world wondered after, that is, yeelded ſubjection unto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
his ſoveraignty; and Verſe 4. and they worſhiped the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon;
how ſo? the next words tell you, he gave power to the Beaſt;
The Romans did not, and the Roman Catholiques did never abſolutely
profeſſe themſelves worſhipers of the Devil, but in as much as they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped
an uſurped Power, a Power gotten by Treachery, Rebellion, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and deceit, they worſhiped the Devil. This Text holds out two
clear Truths. 1. That there are Powers which are not of Gods ſetting
up, out of the Devils ſetting up. 2. To ſubject to ſuch uſurped power,
is ſubjection to the Devil, and as odious in the ſight of Chriſt as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping
of the Devil.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> Kings were ordained in wrath, and God was angry with Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
for deſiring a King; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Kings are not the government approved
by God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To this we anſwer in a word to the Engagers, who upon this ground
reject the government of Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:117826:16"/>
1. God did not give the office of a King, but the perſon of a King in wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for when God took away the perſon, he continued the office. 2. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to <hi>Abraham</hi> that Kings ſhould come of him. 3. He that denyes the office
of a king, denyes Chriſt who is a King, and denyes the eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(in the form of it) by God in the Church ſince <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. God was not angry with them ſimply for ſeeking a king, but, 1. for their
manner of ſeeking a king; they would ſeek one in the pride of their heart,
onely to be like other Nations: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 5. their hearts were hankering after
not only to be like other Nations government, but their Religion. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. For
that they ſought a king inordinately, they could not be content with a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that was over them, but had an itching diſcontented humor againſt
the preſent viſible government. They made a remonſtrance that their Judges
were unjuſt, therfore they would be no longer ſubject to them: <hi>v.</hi> 5. this
God is angry at. For Subjects to reject, or indeavour to change the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a kingdom, or to overthrow the viſible lawfull Authority upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the Government, is a God-provoking ſin, let the Ingagers look to it.
The ſupreme Powers are onely diſpoſed of by God. Doubtleſſe they might
have prayed to God in his due time to fulfill his promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. of giving
them a king, for Iſrael never came to the high noon of Reformation and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
till kings were ſet over, and that was in <hi>Solomon,</hi> at which time the Church
and State of the Jews flouriſhed beyond all things before or ſince: ſo that in
praying for a king in order to the glory of God, the accompliſhment of his
promiſes, and the good of his Church, it had been no ſin: but for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their own heads mutinouſly, and in oppoſition to a viſible Authority,
to deſire a king, this was a great ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> If Gods providence order ſuch things, we muſt ſubmit to providence,
and revealed decrees of God, leſt we be found fighters againſt God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To this we anſwer: there are the decrees of God, and the commands
of God, we ſpeak of them now as contra-diſtinct things <hi>quo ad nos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The precepts or revealed commands of God in his word, are the unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
rules of Chriſtians at all times, whereby to regulate all their actions,
againſt which no providence nor neceſſity can prevail: ſo as to diſpenſe with
thoſe Laws or precepts, we mean morall precepts, ſuch as are naturally moral,
not morall barely by inſtitution, for ſuch a morall differs nothing from cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,
except in duration; ſuch morall precepts, <hi>in extremâ neceſſitate,</hi> may
be diſpenſed withall, as to help an ox out of a pit on the Sabbath day, which
is a labour, and toil, and ſimply a breach of the Sabbath, yet in regard of the
neceſſity it gives a diſpenſation, or rather the Law diſpenſeth with it. But as
for morall commands which are ſuch by nature, they are indiſpenſible rules,
except in the caſe of an immediate call to the contrary by revelation from
God. As <hi>Abraham</hi> was call'd to kill his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which was againſt a naturall
precept, yet having an immediate call from God, had not God ſtayed his
hand, he might have lawfully done it: becauſe he that commanded <hi>Abraham</hi>
ſo to do was the Lord, and maker of the Law, which he can diſpenſe with.
But this caſe cannot be ours under the Goſpel, becauſe God hath given us his
revealed will in writing, ſince which immediate revelations have ceaſed in the
Goſpel Churches, there being no need of them at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:117826:17"/>
Now as for the Providentiall acts of God, or his revealed decrees, theſe are
no rules for us to walk by, nor follow any otherwiſe then they concur with
the revealed will of God in his precepts. We bring a caſe ſhall make good
this aſſertion, and ſtop the mouthes of all rationall antagoniſts.</p>
            <p>In the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 29. to <hi>v.</hi> 39. there was that decree revealed to <hi>Jeroboam</hi>
by the prophet <hi>Ahijah,</hi> who exactly revealed Gods intentions to give to him
ten of the twelve Tribes, and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> but two, <hi>Judah</hi> and ſickly
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſcarce worth the mentioning as a Tribe it was ſo ſmall. God reveals
the reaſon to him why he did it, <hi>viz:</hi> for idolatry, and forſaking the true
God. This, <hi>v.</hi> 37. donation of Gods to <hi>Jereboam</hi> is repeated again to him, that
God would chooſe him, and give him a vaſt power over the people, to do, and
reign as his heart could deſire. Here if ever a man might have pleaded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and have urged the revealed decree of God for attempting treaſon
againſt <hi>Solomon,</hi> certainly (if in any caſe or perſon) it had not been rebellion
in him to attempt that which Providence had decreed him. Nor rebellion in
Iſrael to have ſubjected to him whom God had declared to be their king.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jereboam</hi> in following the revealed decree of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrary to a moral
precept of God, <hi>viz:</hi> the fifth Commandment, which injoyneth Subjects and
inferiors to ſubmit to their lawfull ſuperiors, for this very cauſe he is ſet down
in the word of God as a Rebell againſt <hi>Solomon: 1 King.</hi> 11. 26. there he is put
in the rear of the worſt of the enemies of the Crown, and royall family of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and ſtigmatized with this infamous mark of a Rebell: for, <hi>v: 26. Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
the ſon of <hi>Nebat</hi> an Ephrathite of <hi>Zereda, Sauls</hi> ſervant—even he lift
up his hand againſt the King: and the cauſe of this his rebellion is ſet forth in
the reſt of the following Chapter, becauſe God had revealed his decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the puniſhing of the Royall Family for their ſin in giving him ten of
the Tribes.</p>
            <p>This revealed will of God was ſo far from juſtifying his acting againſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
precept, that his actions are ſet forth hanging as it were on <hi>Hamans</hi> gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
expreſſed in the terms of the higheſt treaſon, twice together, <hi>He lift up
his hand againſt the King, he lift up his hand againſt the king.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are the ten Tribes leſſe excuſable who ſubjected to <hi>Jereboam:</hi> for
though they might have pleaded ſelf preſervation, and if they had not revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they had all been undone, and the providence of God who would have it
ſo, who had decreed it ſo, and revealed thoſe decrees to them by a Prophet,
theſe might not be reſiſted, yet theſe ten Tribes notwithſtanding for their
rejecting of the viſible and lawfull Authority, and ſupremacie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
are twice branded in holy Chronicles for Rebels. 1 <hi>King. 12. 19. Iſrael
rebelled againſt the houſe of David.</hi> And 2 <hi>Chron. 10. 19. Iſrael rebelled againſt the
houſe of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is manifeſt, that following of Providence is ſo far from being a
Chriſtians duty, that many times it is a deſperate ſin: and therefore it was
that holy <hi>David</hi> when he might have cut off <hi>Sauls</hi> head, and when Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
had caſt him into his hands, he durſt not walk by acts of Providence,
but by divine precepts, which commanded him to do no murther. He might
have pleaded ſelf-preſervation, and in killing him he had killed a publick
Enemie, and a murtherer. But <hi>David</hi> had a better guide then Providence to
direct him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:117826:17"/>
Witty and true was that expreſſion of a pious and learned Divine: If <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
in Aegypt had followed Providence, he had without doubt committed
folly with his Miſtris, and have ſaid Providence put him upon it. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude, that acts of Providence are no rules for Chriſtians to follow,
and it is ſo far from reſiſting of God, the not being governed by them, that
many times it becomes a great ſin, as is evident by what hath been declared:
and the ten Tribes have this ſin written in bloody characters upon their back
untill this day: for from Rebellion they turned to Idolatry; and from that
day forward they ſank deeper and deeper into miſery, untill they loſt their
Religion, Laws, liberties, and Nation: which judgement remains upon them
untill this day; God having hanged them in Gibbets to teach Poſterities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them to take heed of their ſins, <hi>viz:</hi> of following Providence againſt a
Precept:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But how comes it to paſſe, that they that make a ſcruple of ſubſcribing
this Ingagement, yet make no ſcruple of paying taxes: Is not ſuch a ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an acknowledgement of their Authority? and do they not condemne
themſelves in doing one, and not the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We will not undertake to give the fulleſt Anſwer hereunto, yet we
hope a ſatisfactory Anſwer we ſhall be able to give.</p>
            <p>1. We therfore ſay, that we that do pay taxes do make ſcruples of paying
them, and were we not inſlaved ſhould much more expreſſe our ſelves.</p>
            <p>2. Paying of taxes doth not imply a not ſcrupling of the authority that
demands and exacts them: A man may pay his money to a thief, yet not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that authority to be juſt.</p>
            <p>3. Taxes that are now impoſed are extorted, and not voluntarily payed:
and (as to that) a power is uſurped over mens eſtates, as if the Nation were
compleatly conquered Now in ſuch a caſe we conceive our ſelves meerly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and no way active, at leaſt free from any ſpontaneous act. Now this is
far from acknowledging the iuſtneſs and lawfulneſs of the ſupremacie of ſuch
a Power; tis one thing to be inforced to a ſubjection in perſon and eſtate; and
quite another thing to acknowledge that power which uſurps this authority
to be ſupreme and legall, which the Ingagement abſolutely inforceth upon
the Subſcribers.</p>
            <p>But let the world judge from this Objection, how cruel and tyrannical
that Government is, that when the poore Proteſtants ſhall be content to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to moſt grievous taxes for quietneſſe ſake; yet this is not ſufficient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they will ſubject their ſouls, and inſnare them alſo in unreaſonable and
cruell bondage. Is it not ſufficient for the paying of taxes, bearing of Free-quarter,
and ſuffering many afflictions to purchaſe (that which in no age was
ever denyed) our freedom, but we muſt be cut-lawed, accounted the off-ſcouring
of the world, and expoſed to the cruelty of merciles men without
remedie; muſt our eſtates, our livelihoods be taken away, our wives raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
our children diſ-inherited, our goods rifled and muſt we have no remedy,
and all becauſe we will not <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ump with men in their opinion? Let all Europe
judge between our enemies and us this day, what have we done againſt them
thus to provoke them, who of us have lifted up our hands againſt them
where are theſe of us that in any taxes are behind? but we have payed it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117826:18"/>
double, and yet a thouſand of our families are ruined by them; they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away our offices, and livelihoods, they have ſuſpended and impriſoned
ſundry of our Orthodox and Presbyterian Miniſters, and now have layed a
ſnare to pluck them out of their Benefices, and at laſt to drive them the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as men unworthy to be protected. Where is that liberty of conſcience
they ſo much pleaded for before they got to be ſupreme, is not that forgot
now? Are not Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his words fulfilled, who fore-warned the kingdom
of that party which pleaded for Liberty of Conſcience, ſaying, If ever they
got power they would not grant liberty of conſcience to others, who now
ſo much plead for it for themſelves.</p>
            <p>This is our comfort in our diſtreſſe, that though on all hands we are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and perſecuted, and repreached by our enemies, yet for all this we have
not dealt falſly in our Covenant: and we can ſay more in our diſtreſſe to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
our hearts then all our enemies, Lord thov knoweſt our integrity.</p>
            <p>We will onely adde one thing (which indeed is no addition, but a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reiteration, that this new Ingagement may be explained according to
our Queries, or any other way to ſatisfie the rationall and ſober minded part
of the Kingdom, and if poſſible the drawer of it up, and firſt framer of it may

the firſt place, hath ſhaken and caſt out the Heads of Houſes in both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
and daily creepeth more and more upon the Proteſtant Miniſters
both in the City and Countrey, clipping their eſtates, and keeping them out
of Livings, and Benefices, whereby very many of the godly Miniſters with
their Families are like to ſtarve already, theſe things make many Proteſtants
imagine, that the deſign is to pluck up all the ſound Proteſtants in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
both of Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and ſo by degrees to eradicate the
Proteſtant Religion, and all to make way for Popery, which hath already got
ſtronger footing in the Kingdome then the Proteſtant Religion: for all the
oaths that were againſt their conſciences are taken away, and a new one ſet
up well pleaſing to the Papiſts, onely offenſive to the Proteſtants: nay all
Laws againſt the Papiſts are repealed, and they reſtored to their ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> daies, and worſe Laws againſt the Proteſtants, then in
her daies. Nor is this inconſiſtent with State policy, for if it be true as it is
beleeved, and reported to be true, that the deſigne is to ſet up Monarchy in
another family, they cannot do it without the alteration of Religion, for the
Proteſtants they are reſolved to keep their Covenant, and the Sectarians
they are in no wiſe to be leaned upon, by reaſon of their inſtability, they are
like Jackdaws that flye from Church to Church, ſometimes here, ſometimes
there, Heterogenious parts in an intire body, are fit to throw down a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
But unfit to erect another. But the Jeſuite he is both a Stateſman,
and a ſtaid man upon the Romiſh bottome, and that party, <hi>viz:</hi> the Romiſh
party, are all allies in the Catholick cauſe; ſo that he that will uſurp a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
his onely pollitique way is to joyn with that party who can befriend
him in every Countrey. For all Catholick Princes are bound by an Oath, as
much as in them lies, to promote the Catholique cauſe, and what Prince that
is a Papiſt dares be aſſiſtant to a Proteſtant Prince againſt an uſurper, that
hath promiſed the Pope to ſet up the Catholique cauſe, and root out Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
that Prince that ſhould do ſo, ſhould be ſure to be curſed whith bell,

            <p>But we will deſire the Author who ever he be, or the power that put it
forth, that they will tell us, what is the meaning of his new Ingagement, and
make it cleer to us that they can lawfully impoſe it: and when the juſtneſſe
thereof in each particular ſhall be made out, that it is for the glory of God,
the advancement of Religion, the eſtabliſhment of lawfull Magiſtracy, and
the eſtabliſhing and reforming of the State, as the tenour of the Covenant
runs, we do again profeſſe that we will with all joyfulneſſe ſubmit, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

            <p>But if upon cleer and manifeſt grounds it appear to be deſtrctive to
the Parliament, Religion, Laws, Liberty, Kingdom, and Army, and a meer
deſign to introduce Popery, they will be ſo far from promoting it (we hope)
that they will ſpeedily remove it out of the way, as a burdenſome ſtone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Chriſtians conſciences, and the Kingdoms Gangreen. We could wiſh
them to take notice of the hand of God againſt it ſince is came forth, the
ſame night that the Act for the taking the Ingagement was printed, the ſame
night a dreadfull blow by powder, which blew up 70. and odde perſons, and
ſlew them all in the twinkle of an eye: Lieut: Coll: <hi>Smith,</hi> who was Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
Wallers</hi> L: Coll: he that was the buſie man in pulling the Members of
the Commons Houſe out of the Houſe, and impriſoning the Members, he was
blowed up in the midſt of his cups, and ſlain: and ſince that one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
of the Ingagement (we tremble to mention it) on Jan: 30. through
the terror of conſcience, and temptation of the devil, hanged himſelf. We
cannot but take notice of Gods diſpleaſure and wrath which breaks out dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amongſt us, in fires and murthers ſince this Ingagement came forth.</p>
            <p>We therefore reſolve (as we hate perjury, rebellion and treaſon) not to
touch with this Ingagement, until upon evident grounds of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or Divinity, it be made clear, that it is for the good of Religion, Laws,
Magiſtracy, and Miniſtery: and this our reſolution is ſo reaſonable, and
juſt, that we conceive none but unreaſonable men, and the enemies of
Church and State, Parliament, Army and people will ſpeak againſt it, or
oppoſe this our reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> There is one objection or falſe gloſſe which the Ingagers make, and
that is in the clauſe of the 3d. Article of the Covenant concerning the King,
that we covenanted with the Parliament to defend the King ſo far as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the Proteſtant Religion: but if he act contrary, then to bring him to
Juſtice according to the Covenant, that injoyns us to bring Delinquents to
condigne puniſhment. But, ſay they, the King was a great Delinquent, and
an enemy to the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To this we anſwer briefly: 1. The two former Articles of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ſpeak wholly of the preſervation of the reformed Religion, the 3d. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
ſpeaks wholly of the preſervation of the King, and Parliament, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which together with the preſervation of Religion we covenanted to
defend. To defend his Majeſties perſon [in the preſervation and defence of
the true Religion, and Liberties of the kingdom] is not inſerted conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as I will defend his perſon no longer then he ſhall defend Religion, and
the Laws. If ſo, then twas taken with the like condition to be ſubject to the
Parliament: and then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that we the Subjects make
our ſelves the Kings Judges and that man or party may revolt from the King,
and indevour to pull him down, becauſe he maintains not his Religion; and
therfore we renounce that Interpretation of that Clauſe as Jeſuiticall. We
Proteſtants took it in this ſence, that we would, together with our Religion,
preſerve our King and Parliament abſolutely: And if they did act any thing
con<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rary to Religion, or Law, we were reſolved to yeeld paſſive obedience,
and in no wiſe to reſiſt the higher Powers But grant it (which we will not)
that it had been meant conditionally, ſo long as he preſerves Religion: how
comes it, that when the King had fully determined, and yeelded to root out
Popery, and to eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Religion in the three Kingdoms, and
to eſtabliſh Church government, and put the Militia in the Parliaments
hands; and when the Parliament voted his conceſſions a ground to proceed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117826:19"/>
on to ſettle the Kingdom, then he was ſnatched away, and both King and
Parliament thrown down. This plea of theirs joyned with their practice,
would make any man beleeve the Ingagers flat Papiſts. How can they ſay
they ſincerely maintain the rights and privileges of Parliament, when they
contradict their Votes, and take the boldneſſe to tell them they are all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
and lay violent hands on them, and exclude them from ſitting in the
Houſe, and impriſon them? And how can they ſay they defended his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
perſon in the maintaining of true Religion, when they cut him off, even
then, when both the Houſes of Parliament and He had even concluded the
Treaty, to root out Popery, and eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Religion? What
Subject, eſpecially hired ſervants, dare preſume to contradict the Parliaments
Votes upon ſerious debate, ſhall any one party of Subjects ſurmiſes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
the grave and ſerious debates of a Parliament? Tis true ſubjects du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſubmit to higher Powers, not reſiſt them. But this was a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at that very time when all things were concluded in a manner, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the kingdome in peace, and true Religion. So that they that upon this
ground plead for the neceſſity of cutting off the King, muſt plead it, becauſe
he would no longer defend the Popiſh Religion. And therfore from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagers
own Argument of cutting off the King, we cannot ſubſcribe to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement;
leſt the world take us for moſt rank hypocrites, vile Apoſtates,
and abſolute Papiſts.</p>
