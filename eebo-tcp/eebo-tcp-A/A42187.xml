            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>and the Affection of the Inhabitants, in ſuch a manner that I ſhould have needed no other Aid, Aſſiſtance and Security, for my Safety. But I have, God help and forgive thoſe that are the occaſion thereof, found more cruelty and rage in the midſt of my Native Countrey, and in the City wherein I was born, (where to my Knowledge I never gave any man the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſcontent) than ever was uſed amongſt People of one and the ſame Nation: My Houſe hath been ſet upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, as well by night as by day, my Meſſengers dragg'd along the Streets, my Children threatned, my Self and my Followers on a Sunday coming from the Stadt Houſe in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon time aſſaſſinated with drawn Knives, inſomuch that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the miraculous hand of God could have delivered me from apparent death. And yet, my Noble, Great and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lords, all theſe dangers have never moved me to prefer my Safety before the Welfare of my Country, or to ſpare my Perſon or Eſtate, ſo long as I believed that my poor Service might be advantagious to it, or that there might be more mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than deſign mixt with this boyſterous Work: always judging that the duty of a faithful Governour is to oppoſe the Common Inſurrections in a State by private Conſultations and Debates But after that I evidently perceived out of the Reports and Propoſitions which were made in your Noble, Great and Mighty Lordſhips Aſſembly, that the general Danger would be changed to a particular one, and by the expoſing of my Perſon make a Sacrifice to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty: I believed that that which hitherto might in me have paſſed for a ſincere and faithful Intention, would henceforward be accounted Careleſsneſs and Imprudence; and therefore judged that I was bound as well in reſpect of my Family, as for the defence of my Honour, to ſecure my ſelf from the violent hands of my Enemies, and to retire ſo long till I might return into my native Country without Danger, and according to my Duty perform the Services of your Great and Mighty Lordſhips.
