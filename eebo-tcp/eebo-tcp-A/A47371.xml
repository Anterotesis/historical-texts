         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Infant-Baptiſm, containing divers Syllogiſtical Arguments to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Pedo-Baptiſm, and to prove the Baptiſm of Believers.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce you deſire Syllogiſms, I have grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
you therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If none are to be baptized by the
Authority of the great Commiſſion of our
Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. but ſuch who
are firſt made Diſciples by being taught; than
Inſants, who are not capable to be taught,
ought not to be baptized. But none are to
be baptized by the Authority of the great
Commiſſion of our Bleſſed Saviour, but ſuch
who are firſt made Diſciples by Teaching. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
Little Babes ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Infant-Baptiſm was never inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
commanded, or appointed of God,
Infants ought not to be baptized. But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm
was never inſtituted, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or appointed of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ought
not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Major;</hi> If one thing may be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
as an Ordinance without an Inſtitution
or Command of God, another thing may
alſo; ſo any Innovation may be let into the
Church.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Minor;</hi> If there is an Inſtitution
for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis either contained in the great
Commiſſion, <hi>Matth. 28. Mark</hi> 16. or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
elſe. But 'tis not to be found in the
Commiſſion, nor any where elſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> none will deny.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. None are to be
baptized by virtue of the Commiſſion, but
ſuch who are diſcipled by the Word, as I
ſaid before, and ſo the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſignifies.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, Chriſt commanded his
Diſciples to baptize all Nations, and Infants
are part of Nations, therefore are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.
I anſwer;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If all Nations, or any in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ought to be baptized before diſcipled;
then Turks, Pagans, Unbelievers and their
Children may be baptized, becauſe they are
a great part of the Nations. But Turks, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and Unbelievers, and their Children,
ought not to be baptized. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides that, Teaching (by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Commiſſion) muſt go before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,
we have proved; which generally all
Learned Men do aſſert: if the Inſtitution is to
be found any where elſe, they muſt ſhew the
Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Faith and Repentance are required
of all that ought to be baptized. Infants
are not required to believe and repent, nor
are they capable ſo to do. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants
ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 8, 10, 16 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and 'tis alſo aſſerted by the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> What is required of Perſons to be
baptized? that's the Queſtion. The Anſwer
is, Repentance, whereby they forſake Sin;
and Faith, whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe
the Promiſe of God made to them in that
Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. That Practice that tends not to the
Glory of God, nor to the Profit of the Child,
when done, nor in after-times when grown
up, but may prove hurtful and of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nature to him, cannot be a Truth of
God. But the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm
tends not to the Glory of God, nor to the
Profit of the Child when baptized, nor in
after-times when grown up, but may prove
hurtful and of a dangerous Nature to him.
<hi>Ergo.</hi> See <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2. where <hi>Moſes</hi>
told <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe his Sons had done
that which God commanded them not, that
<hi>God would be ſanctified by all that drew near
unto him;</hi> intimating, that ſuch who did that
which God commanded not, did not ſanctify
or glorify God therein. Can God be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Man's Diſobedience, or by adding to
his Word; by doing that which God hath
not required? <hi>Matth. 16. 9. In vain do you
worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of Men:</hi> and that that Practice
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101137:3"/>
doth profit the Child, none can prove
from God's Word: And in after-times
when grown up, it may cauſe the Perſon to
think he was thereby made a Chriſtian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and brought into the Covenant of Grace,
and had it ſealed to him, nay, thereby
regenerated, for ſo theſe Gentlemen in their
Mercury, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. plainly intimate, and that
Infants are thereby ingrafted alſo into Chriſt's
Church. Sure all underſtanding Men know
Baptiſm of Believers is not called Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but only metonymically, it being a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Regeneration. But they ignorantly
affirm alſo, that Infants <hi>then</hi> have a federal
Holineſs; as if this imagined Holineſs comes
in by the Child's Covenant in Baptiſm, which
may prove hurtful and dangerous to them, and
cauſe them to think Baptiſm confers Grace,
which is a great Error. <q>How can Water,
ſaith Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> an external thing, work
upon the Soul phyſically? Nor can it, ſaith
he, be proved, that ever the Spirit of God
is tied by any Promiſe, to apply himſelf to
the Soul in a gracious Operation, when Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is applied to the Body: If it were ſo,
then all that were baptized were regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
then all that were baptized ſhould be
ſaved, or elſe the Doctrine of Perſeverance
falls to the Ground. Some indeed, ſays he,
ſay, that Regeration is conferred in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
upon the Elect, and exerts it ſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in Converſion. But how ſo active a
Principle as a ſpiritual Life ſhould lie dead
and aſleep ſo many Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceived. <bibl>On <hi>Regen.</hi> p. 75.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays, that
Faith and Repentance are required of all that
ought to be baptized, and in ſo ſaying, ſpeak
truly, and yet Infants can't perform thoſe
things; then Infants ought not to be baptized.
But the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays, that Faith
and Repentance are required of all ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and ſpeak truly, and yet Infants cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
theſe things. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not
to be baptized.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If it be objected,</hi> That they affirm
they do perform it by their Sureties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If Suretiſhip for Children in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is not required of God, and the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
do not, cannot perform thoſe things for
the Child: then Suretiſhip is not of God, and
ſo ſignifies nothing, but is an unlawful and
ſinful Undertaking. But Suretiſhip in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Baptiſm is not required of God, and
they do not, cannot perform what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do they, or can they cauſe the Child <hi>to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and
Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful
Luſts of the Fleſh?</hi> In a Word; Can they
make the Child or Children to repent and
truly believe in Jeſus Chriſt? for theſe are
the things they promiſe for them, and in their
Name. Alas, they want Power to do it for
themſelves, and how then ſhould they do it
for others? Beſides, we ſee they never mind
nor regard their Covenant in the Caſe: and
will not God one Day ſay, Who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
theſe things at your Hands?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If there be no Precedent in the
Scripture, (as there is no Precept) that any
Infant was baptized, then Infants ought not
to be baptized. But there is no Precedent
that any Infant was baptized in the Scripture.
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there is any Precedent or Example in
Scripture that any Infant was baptized, let
them ſhew us where we may find it.</p>

            <p>And as to the <hi>Minor,</hi> 'tis acknowledged
by our Adverſaries, it is not to be found in
the Letter of the Scripture. And as to the
Conſequences drawn therefrom, we have
proved, they are not natural from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;
and though we admit of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
and Inferences if genuine, yet not
in the caſe of an Inſtitution reſpecting a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Ordinance that is of meer poſitive
Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. If Infant-Baptiſm was an Inſtitution
of Chriſt, the Pedo-Baptiſts could not be at a
loſs about the Grounds of the Right Infants
have to Baptiſm: But the Pedo-Baptiſts are at
a great Loſs, and differ exceedingly about the
Grounds of the Right Infants have to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis no Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As touching the <hi>Major,</hi> I argue thus;
That which is an Inſtitution of Chriſt,
the Holy Scripture doth ſhew, as well the
End and Ground of the Ordinance, as the
Subject and Manner of it. But the Scripture
ſpeaks nothing of the End or Ground of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Baptiſm,
or for what reaſon they ought
to be baptized. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis no Inſtitution of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is undeniable; Some affirm,
as we have ſhewed, <hi>p.</hi> 15. it was to take away
Original Sin. Some ſay it is their Right by
the Covenant, they being the Seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
Others ſay, Infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have Faith, and
therefore have a Right. Others ſay, They
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101137:4"/>
have a Right by the Faith of their Sureties.
Some ground their Right from an Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Tradition; others upon the Authority of
Scripture. Some ſay, All Children of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Chriſtians ought to be baptized; others
ſay, None but the Children of true Believers
have a Right to it. Sure, if it was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Chriſt, his Word would ſoon end
this Controverſy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. If the Children of believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
as ſuch, are not the natural nor ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they can have no Right
to Baptiſm, or Church-Memberſhip, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of any Covenant-tranſaction God made
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> But the Children of believing
Gentiles, as ſuch, are not the natural nor
ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. If no Man can prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that any ſpiritual Benefit redounds to
Infants in their Baptiſm, 'tis no Ordinance of
Chriſt. But no Man can prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that any ſpiritual Benefit redounds to
Infants in their Baptiſm. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 12. That cannot be an Ordinance of
Chriſt, for which there is neither Command
nor Example in all God's Word, nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to ſuch who do it, nor Threatnings to
ſuch who neglect it. But there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or Example in all the Word of God
for the baptizing of little Babes, nor Promiſe
made to ſuch who are baptized, nor Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to ſuch who are not. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Child lies under a Promiſe who
is baptized, or the Child under any Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or Danger that is not baptized, let them
prove it, ſince it is denied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 13. If no Parents, at any time or
times, have been by God the Father, Jeſus
Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, either commended
for baptizing of their Children, or reproved
for neglecting to baptize them; then Infant-Baptiſm
is no Ordinance of God. But no
Parents at any time or times have been by
God commended for baptizing of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> Infant-Baptiſm is no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God.</p>
            <p>This Argument will ſtand unanſwerable,
unleſs any can ſhew who they were that were
ever commended for baptizing their Children,
or reproved for neglecting it, or unleſs they
can ſhew a parallel caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 14. If Men were not to preſume to
alter any thing in the Worſhip of God under
the Law, neither to add thereto, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
therefrom, and God is as ſtrict and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of his Worſhip under the Goſpel; then
nothing ought to be altered in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
under the Goſpel. But under the Law
Men were not to preſume ſo to do, and God
is as ſtrict and jealous under the Goſpel. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear; <hi>See thou make all things
according to the Pattern ſhewed thee in the Mount,
Exod.</hi> 25. 40. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2. See how
<hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> ſped, for preſuming to vary
from the Command of God, and <hi>Vzzah,</hi> tho
but in ſmall Circumſtances as they may ſeem
to us. How dare Men adventure, this being
ſo, to change Baptiſm from Dipping into
Sprinkling, and the Subject, from an Adult
Believer, to an ignorant Babe? <hi>Add thou not
unto his Word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 15. Whatever Practice opens a Door
to any humane Traditions and Innovations in
God's Worſhip, is a great Evil, and to be
avoided: But the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm
opens a Door to any humane Traditions and
Innovations in God's Worſhip. <hi>Ergo,</hi> to
ſprinkle or baptize Infants is a great Evil,
and to be avoided.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear, becauſe there is no
Scripture-ground for it, no Command nor
Example for ſuch a Practice in God's Word.
And if without Scripture-Authority the
Church hath Power to do one thing, ſhe may
do another, and ſo <hi>ad inſinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 16. Whatſoever Practice reflects upon
the Honour, Wiſdom and Care of Jeſus
Chriſt, or renders him leſs faithful than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and the New Teſtament in one of its
great Ordinances, (nay, Sacraments) to lie
more obſcure in God's Word, than any Law
or Precept under the Old Teſtament, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of God. But the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm
reflects on the Honour, Care and
Faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and renders him
leſs faithful than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and a great Ordinance,
(nay, Sacrament) of the New Teſtament, to
lie more dark and obſcure than any Precept
under the Old Teſtament. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
cannot be of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101137:4"/>
The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is eaſily proved: For he is bold
indeed who ſhall affirm Infant-Baptiſm doth
not lie obſcure in God's Word. One great
Party who aſſert it, ſay, 'tis not to be found
in the Scripture at all, but 'tis an unwritten
Apoſtolical Tradition: others ſay, it lies not
in the Letter of the Scripture, but may be
proved by Conſequences; and yet ſome great
Aſſerters of it, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others, ſay,
Thoſe Conſequences commonly drawn from
divers Texts for it, are without Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo prove nothing. I am ſure a Man
may read the Scripture a hundred times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and never be thereby convinced; he
ought to baptize his Children, tho it is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
to convince Men of all other Duties.</p>
            <p>Now can this be a Truth, ſince Chriſt who
was more faithful than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and delivered
every thing plainly from the Father? <hi>Moſes</hi>
left nothing dark as to matter of Duty, tho
the Precepts and external Rites of his Law
were numerous, two or three hundred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
yet none were at a loſs, or had need to
ſay, Is this a Truth or an Ordinance, or not?
for he that runs may read it.</p>
            <p>And ſhall one poſitive Precept given forth
by Chriſt, who appointed ſo few in the New
Teſtament, be ſo obſcure, as alſo the ground
and end of it, that Men ſhould be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about the Proofs of it, together with the
end and ground thereof? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 17. That Cuſtom or Law which <hi>Moſes</hi>
never delivered to the Jews, nor is any where
written in the Old Teſtament, was no Truth
of God, nor of Divine Authority. But
that Cuſtom or Law to baptize Proſelytes
either Men, Women or Children, was never
given to the Jews by <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor is it any
where written in the Old Teſtament. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
It was no Truth of God, nor of Divine
Authority: And evident it is, as Sir <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Knatchbul</hi> ſhews, <q>That the <hi>Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>
differed among themſelves alſo about
it: for, ſaith he, <hi>Rabbi Elizer</hi> expreſly
contradicts <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> who was the firſt
I know of who aſſerted this ſort of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
among the Jews: For <hi>Eliezer,</hi> who
was contemporary with <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> if he
did not live before him, aſſerts, that a
Proſelyte circumciſed and not baptized,
was a true Proſelyte.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 18. If Baptiſm is of mere poſitive
Right, wholly depending on the Will and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Pleaſure of Jeſus Chriſt, the great
Legiſlator: And he hath not required or
commanded Infants to be baptized: then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
ought not to be baptized: But Baptiſm
is of mere poſitive Right, wholly depending
on the Will and ſovereign Pleaſure of Jeſus
Chriſt, the great Legiſlator, and he hath not
required or commanded Infants to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>This Argument tends to cut off all the
pretended Proofs of Pedo-Baptiſm, taken
from the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and
becauſe Children are ſaid to belong to the
Kingdom of Heaven, it was not the Right of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Male Children to be circumciſed,
becauſe they were begotten, and born of the
Fruit of his Loins, till he received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
from God to circumciſe them.
Had he done it before, or without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from God, it would have been Will-Worſhip
in him ſo to have done. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
this further appears to be ſo, Becauſe
no godly Man's Children, nor others in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Days, nor ſince, had any Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but only his Children, (or ſuch who were
bought with his Money, or were proſelyted
to the Jewiſh Religion) becauſe they had no
Command from God ſo to do, as <hi>Abraham</hi>
had. This being true, it follows, that if we
ſhould grant Infants of believing Gentiles, as
ſuch, were the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (which we
deny) yet unleſs God had commanded them
to baptize their Children, they ought not to
do it; and if they do it without a Command
or Authority from Chriſt, it will be found an
Act of Will-Worſhip in them.</p>

Primitive Times, were baptized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Profeſſion of Faith, were baptized into
Chriſt, and thereby put on Chriſt, and were
all one in Chriſt Jeſus, and were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s

But Infants, as ſuch, who are baptized, were

Souls Marriage-Union with Chriſt, which
Marriage-Contract abſolutely requires an

Chriſt. If any ſhould object, he ſpeaks of
the Baptiſm of the Adult. I anſwer, his
Words are theſe, <q>Our Baptiſm is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
will any Pedo-Baptiſt ſay, that the
Baptiſm of the Adult is the ſolemnizing of
the Souls Marriage with Chriſt, and not the
Baptiſm of Infants. Reader, obſerve how
our Oppoſits are forced ſometimes to ſpeak
the Truth, though it overthrows their own
Practice of Pedo-Baptiſm.</p>

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 21. If the Sins of no Perſons are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
them till they are converted, then they
muſt not be baptized for the Forgiveneſs of
them, till they proſeſs themſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
but the Sins of no Perſons are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
them till they are converted. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
No Perſon ought to be baptized for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of them, till they profeſs they are
converted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the ſaid Treatiſe lays down
the Subſtance of this Argument alſo, take
his own Words, <hi>i. e.</hi> 
               <q>As their Sins are not
forgiven them till they are converted, <hi>Mark</hi>
4. 12. ſo they muſt not be baptized for the
Forgiveneſs of them, till they profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
converted, ſeeing to the Church, <hi>in
eſſe,</hi> and <hi>non apparere</hi> is all one. Repentance
towards God, and Faith towards our Lord
Jeſus is the Sum of that Preaching that
makes Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. Therefore,
ſaith he, both theſe muſt by a Profeſſion
ſeem to be received, before any at Age are
baptized; <bibl>p. 30. 31.</bibl>
               </q> And evident it is,
ſay I, from hence none but ſuch at Age ought
to be baptized. <q>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> cauſed the Eunuch to
profeſs before he would baptize him, that
<hi>be believed that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.
Saul</hi> had alſo, ſaith he, more than a bare
Profeſſion before Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 5, 15,
17. p. 28. The Promiſe it ſelf, ſaith he
doth expreſly require a Faith of our own, of
all the Adult that will have part in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges:
therefore there is a Faith of our
own, that is the Condition of our Title;
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. p. 16.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He might have added by the Force of his
Argument; therefore Infants ſhould not have
the Priviledges: for I argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 22. If there is but one Baptiſm of
Water left by Jeſus Chriſt in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101137:5"/>
and but one Condition or Manner of
Right thereto: and that one Baptiſm is that
of the Adult; then Infant-Baptiſm is no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of Chriſt. But there is but one Baptiſm
in Water leſt by Chriſt in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and but one Condition and Manner of
Right thereto, and that one Baptiſm is that
of the Adult. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infant-Baptiſm is no
Baptiſm of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, Faith and Repentance is
the Condition of the Adult, and as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Condition, I am ſure the Scripture is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
the Way of the Lord is one, <hi>one Lord,
one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If Profeſſion of Faith were not neceſſary,
ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, coram Eccleſiâ,</hi> to Church-Memberſhip
and Priviledges, then Infidels
and Heathens would have Right; alſo, ſaith
he, the Church and the World would be
confounded.</q> He might have added, but
Infidels and Heathens have no Right to
Church-Memberſhip, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> 
               <q>'Tis a grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Caſe among all Chriſtians, ſaith he, that
Profeſſion is thus neceſſary, the Apoſtles
and Ancient Church admitted none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; pag. 21.</q> And if ſo, why dare any
now adays admit of Infants, who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make no Profeſſion. He adds, <q>Yea
Chriſt in his Commiſſion directeth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to make Diſciples, and then baptize
them, promiſing, <hi>He that believeth, and is
baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16. 16. <bibl>
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 27.</bibl>
               </q>
Furthermore he ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>If as many as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into Chriſt, are baptized into his Death,
and are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death,
that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead, ſo
we alſo ſhould-walk in Newneſs of Life,</hi> &amp;c.
Then no doubt, ſaith he, but ſuch as were
to be baptized, did firſt profeſs this Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and a Conſent to be buried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
In our Baptiſm we put off the Body of the
the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion
of Chriſt, <hi>being buried with him, and raiſed
with him through Faith, quickned with him, and
having all our Treſpaſſes forgiven,</hi> Col. 2. 11,
12, 13. And will any Mau (ſays he) yea,
will <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribe all this to thoſe that did not
ſo much as profeſs the things ſignified? Will
Baptiſm, in the Judgment of a wiſe Man, do
all this for an Infidel, (or, ſay I, for an Infant)
that cannot make a Profeſſion that he is a
Chriſtian? <bibl>
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 31, 32.</bibl>
               </q> He proceeds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 23. the Baptized are in Scripture
called Men waſhed, ſanctified, juſtified; they
are called Saints, and Churches of Saints,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. all Chriſtians are ſanctified ones:
<hi>pag.</hi> 33. Now let me add the <hi>Minor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Infants baptized are not in Scripture call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men waſhed, ſanctified, juſtified, they are
not called Saints, Churches of Saints, Chriſtians,
nor ſanctified ones. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not
to be baptized. If any ſhould ſay, Why
did you not cite theſe Aſſertions of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
whilſt he was living? I anſwer, More
then twelve Years ago I did recite and print
theſe Aſſertions, and many other Arguments
of his to the ſame Purpoſe, to which he gave
no Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 24. If there is but one way for all,
both Parents and Children to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Goſpel-Church to the End of the
World, and that it is upon the Profeſſion of
Faith to be baptized; then both Parents and
Children muſt upon the Profeſſion of their
Faith be baptized, and ſo admitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
there is but one way for all, both Parents and
Children, to be admitted into the Goſpel-Church
to the End of the World, and that
is upon the Profeſſion their Faith to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 25. That cannot be Chriſt's true
Baptiſm wherein there is not, cannot be a
lively Repreſentation of the Death, Burial
and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, together
with our Death unto Sin, and Vivification
to a new Life. But in the Rantizing or
Sprinkling of an Infant, there is not, cannot
be a lively Repreſentation of Chriſt's Death,
Burial and Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 26. That pretended Baptiſm that
tends to fruſtrate the glorious End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Chriſt in his inſtituting of Goſpe-Baptiſm,
or cannot anſwer it, is none of
Chriſt's Baptiſm. But the pretended Baptiſm
of Infants tends to fruſtrate the glorious end
and deſign of Chriſt in inſtituting of Goſpel-Baptiſm,
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Major</hi> will not he denied.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Minor,</hi> all generally confeſ the
End or Deſign of Chriſt in inſtituting the
Ordinance of Baptiſm, was in a lively Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
to repreſent his Death, Burial, and
Reſurrection, with the Perſon's Death unto
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101137:6"/>
Sin, and his riſing again to walk in newneſs
of Life, that is baptized, as the Sacrament
of the Supper was ordained to repreſent his
Body was broke, and his Blood was ſhed.
But that a lively Figure of Chriſt's Death,
Burial, and Reſurrection, appears in ſprinkling
a little Water on the Face, I ſee not; and
as done to an Infant, there can no Death to
Sin, and riſing again to walk in newneſs of
Life, be ſignified; And therefore Chriſt's
Deſign and End therein is fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 27. If Baptiſm be Immerſion, as
to the proper and genuine ſignification of the
word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> as alſo of thoſe Typical and
Metaphorical Baptiſms and the ſpiritual Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
thereof; then Sprinkling cannot be
Chriſt's true Baptiſm. But Immerſion is
the proper and genuine ſignification of the
word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and alſo of thoſe Typical
and Metaphorical Baptiſms ſpoken of, and
the ſpiritual Signification thereof. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
Sprinkling is not Chriſt's true Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>1. That the proper and genuine Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> is Immerſion, or to
dip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have proved, which is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by the Learned in the Language.</p>
            <p>2. The Figurative Baptiſm was, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That of
the Red Sea, wherein the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

10. 2. <q>Others, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> more probably
think that the Apoſtle uſeth this term, in
regard of the great Analogy betwixt <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
(as it was then uſed) the Perſons going
down into the Waters, and being dipped in
them; and the Iſraelites going down into
the Sea, the great Receptacle of Water,
though the Water at that time was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Heaps on either ſide of them; yet
they ſeemed-buried in the Water, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in that Age were when they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,

               </q> The <hi>2d.</hi> was that of <hi>Noah</hi>'s

               <q>The Ark
of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm, ſaith he,</hi> were both a
Type and Figure of the Reſurrection, not the
Sign of the waſhing away of Sin, though ſo
taken metonymically, but a particular Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the Reſurrection of Chriſt: of this
Baptiſm is a lively and emphatical Figure, as
Alſo was the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of which he
returned as from a Sepulchre, to a new Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. Metaphorical Baptiſm is that of the
Spirit and of Affliction: the firſt ſignifies
not a ſprinkling of the Spirit, but the
