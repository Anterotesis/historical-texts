         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen it befalleth me to differ from men more judicious, it
is not becauſe I have a greater eſteem of my Intellect
than of theirs, but becauſe that which to me ſeemeth
Evidence conſtraineth me. And when I publiſh that
ſeeming Evidence, it is not in expectation that any receive it, ſave
thoſe that by impartial deliberate thoughts, diſcerning it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by it. I therefore craved your cenſure of theſe Papers, becauſe
I found that you had long and laboriouſly ſtudied the Controverſie,
and were confident of much of that which I write againſt: I have
read no man that hath handled it with ſo much Learning and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
as you have done: And therefore I knew no man fitter, if
I err, to detect my Errours. And as your Candour is rather for my
publiſhing, than ſuppreſſing theſe Papers; ſo truly I am ſo far from
diſliking a true Confutation of this (or any Errour that I ſhall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh)
that I therefore direct theſe lines to you, to intreat you, to
write (whether I be alive or dead) your Reaſons againſt any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
or dangerous Errour which you ſhall here find: That as we
thus friendly conſent to ſuch a Colliſion, or rather Communication,
as may kindle ſome further ſparks of light, the Readers may be helpt
by comparing all, the better to find out the truth.</p>
            <p>Seeing the chief Writers for the <hi>Millennium</hi> are Conformiſts,
(and men of greateſt Learning and Piety among them) as <hi>Joſ.
Mede,</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> (then conformable) Dr. <hi>Creſſoner,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Beverley,</hi> Mr. <hi>J. M.</hi> &amp;c. I hope they will not take it for ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
in you and me herein to differ.</p>
            <p>You have partly relieved me againſt ſome Accuſations of Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
when you tell your Readers (in the Preface to your Engliſh
<hi>Myſtery)</hi> that ſo many think the Thouſand years paſt already, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That <hi>Aretius, Bilney, Wickleffe, Walter Brute, Benno
Cardin,</hi> &amp;c. thought that the time began at the Birth of Chriſt.</q>
            </p>

            <p>
               <q>And page 20. you believe that the 1290 years in <hi>Dan.</hi> are paſt

            <p>
               <q>Though you are plain, that the Thouſand years are not before
the Conflagration, and that Antichriſt ſhall not be finally deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till then (though <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall) and that a Thouſand years will
be but a part, a morning of the laſt great day, in which the Juſt
only ſhall riſe, and that the evening will be the time of the riſing of
the unjuſt to deſtruction, and the ſpace that is till Chriſt give up the
Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
               </q> Yet becauſe oft-times you joyn the Jews earthly
Monarchy ſo obſcurely with the Reſurrection, without mentioning
the intervening Conflagration, I intreat you in your next to make
your ſelf therein more intelligible: And give ſome proof that the
wicked ſhall not be raiſed nor judged till after the Thouſand years,
(neither thoſe dead before, nor thoſe found alive at the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
ſeeing many words of Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi> ſeem plainly to aſſert a
common Judgment, of Sheep and Goats, juſt and unjuſt, at the ſame
time of Chriſts coming.</p>
            <p>As to my Opinion, that Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Babylon,</hi> I have ſo
much to ſay for it, as muſt not here be repeated: If that caſt away
my reputation with any or many, let it go: He is unworthy of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that cannot give it up for Truth. The Revelation hath much
plain and eaſie to them that read it without prejudice (who I doubt
are few.) I only fix on ſo much, and leave the reſt to wiſer men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſhonouring of their Judgments, ſo be it they give not up our
Cauſe to the Papiſts, by laying it upon things doubtful or untrue,
while we have ſure and plain proof enough againſt them.</p>

            <head>Chap. I. The Kingdom of Chriſt, as deſcribed by the
S. Scriptures.</head>
            <p>BEing by Mr. <hi>T. Beverleys</hi> importunate requeſts and
challenges, and his heavy Accuſation of Diſſenters
from him as <hi>Semi-Sadduces of the Apoſtaſie,</hi> urged to
give an account of the Reaſons of my diſſent from Him
and others of the Millenary Judgment, it is meet that I firſt
tell him what I take for the true Scripture Doctrine of the
Kingdom of Chriſt, which I am to defend. Premiſing my
deſire to the Reader, that he will firſt read as preſuppoſed
Truth, the Judicious Treatiſe of my dear Brother Mr. <hi>John
Corbet,</hi> of <hi>The Kingdom of God with Men:</hi> And <hi>Cluverus</hi> his
Arguments againſt the <hi>Millennium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. GOD made Man in his own Image (Natural,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26, 27. &amp; 9. 6.</note> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 7.</note>
and of Supereminence) in Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and
true Holineſs;<note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> to know, love, and obey his Creator: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they err that ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> had no Spiritual Holineſs,
and did no Act of Holineſs and Obedience before his Fall:
For elſe he had lived in great and conſtant ſin: For it could
be no better for him, not to eſteem God to be the chief
Good, and amiable Object; or not to Love him whom he
knew to be the beſt; or not to ſerve and obey him whom
he knew to be his Creator.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate God was to Govern him as a <hi>righteous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
by the Law which obliged him to <hi>Perſonal, Perfect, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Obedience;</hi> revealed partly by the Creation, and partly
by expreſs prohibitions and commands.</p>
            <p>II. Upon Mans Fall and Forfeiture,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> GOD firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
part of the penalty which he would inflict,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 29.</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Decree ſo far to forgive the reſt of the penalty,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 9.</note> as
to reprieve and yet continue his faln Creature;<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 7.</note> and to give
them a Redeemer that ſhould overcome the Serpent that
had overcome Man,<note place="margin">Pſal. 86. 5.</note> and to make him the Captain of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note>
and to put faln Man, and all things, and power into
his hand, for the accompliſhing of this Recovering work,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59413:5"/>
for the glorifying of his Love and Mercy thereby. The

creation or production of the reſt of the
World? and whether it (and the World, as
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought) was (except revolutions and
alterations) an eternal Effect of an eternal
firſt Cauſe, and many ſuch caſes about the Original of Souls,
are queſtions that God having not clearly decided by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or Scripture Light, I cannot peremptorily decide, but am
loſt in difficulties when I attempt it.</p>
            <p>IV. Till the Incarnation of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6, 7, 8.</note> the World was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by God, as the God of Mercy and Redemption; by
a Regiment of Grace;<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> which may be called the Kingdom
of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. &amp; 3. &amp; 8.</note> as Chriſt was the undertaker of future Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4, 7.</note>
And the World being all under a pardoning Law of
Grace,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note> that alloweth Repentance on hope of Mercy; God
dealt with none upon the meer terms of the Law of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or Innocence; which ceaſed <hi>ceſſante capacitate ſubdito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:
Be innocent and live, or ſin and die,</hi> is not the Law that
any are judged by.</p>
            <p>V. God that firſt made this Law of Grace to Faln Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> renewed it to all in <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Abraham</hi> pleaſing God above others by Faith and full
Obedience,<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 15. &amp; 26. 5, 24.</note> God choſe him to be the Father of a Peculiar
People,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3, 9.</note> promiſing him that his Seed ſhould be multiplied
into an eminent Policy,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 8, 24.</note> and that the Saviour Incarnate ſhould
be of his Seed,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 8, 17.</note> in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould
be bleſſed:<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 23.</note> Not ending the Law of Grace to the reſt of
the World, but priviledging <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed with the ſtate of
peculiarity.</p>
            <p>VI. By <hi>Moſes</hi> God brought <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Political State, and gave them a Law to be a Rule to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59413:5"/>
their Political Governours,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets and Chriſt <hi>Mat. 5.</hi> atteſt all this.</note> when to puniſh, and in what
ſort and degree: And God being their Abſolute Soveraign,
and their Government a Theocracy, he reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Power of Legiſlation in all the neceſſary parts, and
the choice of their Chief Rulers under him. And what the
Magiſtrate failed to puniſh according to his Law, he would
puniſh himſelf. This Law was but the Rule of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
ſuppoſing them Believers of the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
juſtified by Faith: But the carnal Jews were ſo taken up
with the outward Ceremonies and Works, that they loſt the
underſtanding of that Juſtifying Promiſe, and the very uſe of
all the Types and Ceremonies, and thought to be Juſtified
by the bare Works or doing of what the Law required of
them as their duty. And becauſe God had not done ſo by
any other Nation, they were proud of their Law, and yet
only outwardly obeyed it.</p>
            <p>VIII. In the fulneſs of Time the Meſſiah came Incarnate
(after 4000 years) And then that which before was only
in Decree,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 15. &amp; 5. 17.</note> became a Law of Mediation or Redemption,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> or
a Covenant between the Father and the Son in Fleſh;<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15. &amp; 9. 14.</note> Chriſt
being obliged in Habit,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> Act and Suffering, to do all impoſed
for the Recovery of Man,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> and for this was to be King and
Lord of all, and having finiſhed his undertaken work, to
reign for ever as God-Man with the Glorified recovered So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
as his reward in Heaven for ever.<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> And all power to
this End was given to him,<note place="margin">John 17. 3, 4.</note> and all Judgment or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
committed to him,<note place="margin">John 5. 22, 23, 26, 27.</note> to be exerciſed on lapſed Man for
Recovery, the Father judging no man, as meer Creator of
Innocent Man, till this work is done.</p>
            <p>IX. When Chriſt Incarnate came the King came from
Heaven,<note place="margin">Luke 19. 34.</note> and therefore <hi>John</hi> Preached that the Kingdom of
Heaven was at hand,<note place="margin">Jo. 18. 37.</note> and Chriſt firſt preached that it was
come and was among them;<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 14.</note> that is,<note place="margin">Jo. 1. 49.</note> The King promiſed
from Heaven to Rule the World for their Salvation.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> And
when he had firſt wrought Miracles enough to prove it,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 28. &amp; 21. 43.</note> that
Faith might not be precarious,<note place="margin">Mar. 1. 15.</note> and built upon his bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,<note place="margin">Luke 7. 28. &amp; 9. 27. &amp; 10. 9. &amp; 11. 20. &amp; 13. 18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; 17. 20, 21. &amp; 21. 31. 22. 16, 18.</note>
he openly claimed firſt the Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> as
of the Line of <hi>David,</hi> and cauſed the people to applaud him
with <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59413:6"/>
But being to Redeem us as a Sacrifice by his Blood, and
to Conquer Death, and confirm his Goſpel, by Dying and
Riſing again, he oft foretold all this to his Diſciples, and
the rejecting of him by the Jews,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17, 18.</note> and their Nations, Cities
and Temples ruin for it, and his purpoſe to ceaſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
Politie,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 10.</note> and to make his Church more Great and
Catholick by the Calling of the Gentiles;<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 7.</note> eſpecially the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>X. At his Reſurrection he took more ſolemn poſſeſſion
of his Kingly Government.<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> And firſt Commiſſioned the
Twelve Apoſtles whom he had before made Preachers to
the Jews,<note place="margin">Mark 16. 16, 17.</note> to continue their Miniſtry to them (in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
related to the Twelve Tribes) till Perſecution ſhould
expel them,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 37.</note> and then to do their beſt to make all Nations
(as ſuch) his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 20, 23, 24, 25, 26.</note> Baptizing them (as the Entrance
into his Kingdom) into the Name of the Father,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> the Son,
and the Holy Ghoſt, and there teaching them to obſerve all
his Commands delivered to thoſe Apoſtles, and promiſing
to be with them to the End of the World.</p>
            <p>XI. By this and more it appeareth that a great triumphant
Kingdom on Earth,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 17. &amp; 19. 6.</note> and National Churches, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Chriſtian Kingdoms, was at firſt in Chriſts Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though the Embrio and Infancy anteceding, it was
to be firſt in Execution: For he commanded the Diſcipling
of Nations, and would have gathered <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not
cut them off, nor taken the Kingdom of God from them,
but for their unbelief.<note place="margin">Acts 1. 25.</note> And the number of Twelve was by
<hi>Matthias</hi> to be made up,<note place="margin">Mar. 28. 20.</note> to ſhew their relation to the Jews
National Church State, till Perſecution drove them to the
Gentiles, and then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were added.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles have Succeſſors in all the parts of their
Office, which is to be continued to the End, but not in the
parts that were extraordinary, peculiar and temporary.</p>
            <p>XII. Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt (which he promiſed to
ſend to be his powerful Agent) propagated a holy Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">John 14. 16, 26. &amp; 15. 26. &amp; 16. 17.</note>
and by his Meſſengers Preaching (his Reſurrection
and Kingdom eſpecially) and the Miracles which they
wrought,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37, 38. &amp; 21. 20.</note> he confirmed his Goſpel;<note place="margin">Rev. 7.</note> And Converted quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
many Myriads of the Jews, and after far greater numbers
of the Gentiles: Thus preparing materials or ſubjects for his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59413:6"/>
more viſible Kingdom of Power on Earth; Himſelf reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over all in Heaven.</p>
            <p>XIII. That his Subjects might know the Nature and
Terms of his Covenant and Government (which was to
bring them to a Heavenly Kingdom) he not only requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Covenant-Conſent to forſake the Fleſh and this
World,<note place="margin">Luke 14.</note> and the Devil,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> for that Eternal Life which he had
promiſed them,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> but he was pleaſed to put them on the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
exerciſe of this agreement,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 5. &amp; 2 Theſ. 1. 6. 11.</note> and to try their ſincerity,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 12. &amp; 3. 12.</note> by
putting them often upon Sufferings and Martyrdom:<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note> And
therein he exerciſed his Heavenly Power, in ſtrengthening
them, and making them more than Conquerors, while they
went as Sheep to the ſlaughter; to the honour of their Lord
and Faith, and the confuſion of their Perſecutors.</p>
            <p>XIV. Yet did he ſo over-power the Spirits of the Pagan
Perſecutors, that of Forty Emperors, there were at moſt but
ten that perſecuted them; ſo that in this Captivity and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
ſtate by their liberty their numbers ſo increaſed
that they became a conſiderable party in their Dominions
and Armies.</p>
            <p>XV. Of all theſe Perſecutors,<note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory is the full proof of this.</note> the Cruelleſt were <hi>Nero,
Domitian, Maximinus</hi> and <hi>Decius,</hi> but far above all, the laſt,
who were ſeven together <hi>(Diocleſian, Max. Herculius, Max.
Galerius, Max. Daya, Severus, Licinius, Maxentius,</hi> (and
<hi>Conſtantius</hi> not wholly innocent) The cruelty of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors,
and the great numbers Tormented and Martyred,
is frightful even to read: By all which Chriſt ſhewed his
Heavenly Power, in the terrible puniſhment of all their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors:
Firſt in the dreadful deſtruction of the curſed part
of the Jews; who were by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> ſo deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that 110000 of them were killed, and about 700000 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated:
And their State, City and Temple overthrown,
and ſaith <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> it is certain that they ſhall
never (that is, the Infidels) return to that Land.</p>
            <p>And afterwards by <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> in revenge of the
Murders of <hi>Barcocheba</hi> an Antichriſt, near as many more
were killed; which muſt needs leave the Infidels few in ſo
ſmall a Land, when <hi>London</hi> is ſuppoſed not to have near one
Million of Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59413:7"/>
And as to the great Pagan Empire,<note place="margin">The <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry compared, prove this, and expound each other.</note> (the greateſt that
ever the World had) Chriſt rode on the White Horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them Conquering, and executed on them all the
Plagues gradually numbered in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> the Seals, the
Trumpets, the Vials, till he had utterly overcome them
and all their Confederates: He dealt ſo ſeverely with them,
that of Forty Emperors there were ſcarce ten or ſeven that
died without Murder a natural death: But they were ſtill
in Bloody Wars with other Nations, and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo that <hi>[The Beaſt that was, and Is not, and yet Is,]</hi>
became a fit deſcription of their State: As notably ſuited
to <hi>Domitian</hi> at firſt, and to <hi>Diocleſian, Herculius,</hi> and their
Fellows at laſt, ſo all along to the ordinary Succeſſion:
<hi>To day</hi> there was an Emperor; the next day he was kill'd,
and there was <hi>None;</hi> And yet another preſently ſucceeded
him, and ſo there is one again; The Soldiers ſelling the
Empire to him that would give moſt for it, or was likeſt
to advance them. How dreadful a deſtruction did Chriſt
by one <hi>Conſtantine</hi> bring on the ſeven Heads and ten Horns
at laſt, in a very little time. So that Heaven and Earth
triumphed with Joyful Praiſe that <hi>Babylon</hi> was fallen, and
the Kingdoms of the World were become the Kingdoms
of the Lord and of his Chriſt, and he had taken to himſelf
his great Power and had reigned, and was ſetting up the
New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as a Fifth Monarchy) the Embrio of the
Coeleſtial <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in its viſible Reigning Power. I am
none of thoſe that will ſecure Papal <hi>Rome</hi> from an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Name, and Guilt, and Fate: But he that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me that Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> was not the <hi>Babylon</hi> there meant,
or that it is not fallen, muſt firſt convince me that he is of
more credible Authority than the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XVI. O how great a change was it for poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
throughout all the Empire,<note place="margin">Read <hi>Euſibius Eccl. Hiſt. L.</hi> 8. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, &amp; 19. And the Prophets that proclaim it a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to have their Mountains again Inhabited, and their Cities Built.</note> to be brought from Scorn
and Torments, and the Martyrdom of many Thouſands,
after 294 years Captivity, to be ſuddenly made Freemen,
to celebrate Chriſts Worſhip in the moſt Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
and to be made Lords of their <hi>Perſecuting, Captivating,</hi>
Idolatrous Enemies, lately ſo great that no Nations could
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59413:7"/>
ſtand before them. Who did the Godly deſire ſhould be in
Power, rather their Biſhops that came newly out of the
Furnace of Tryal? O what a change! O what a joyful
day! And ſhall the ſucceſs of the Devil, that quickly ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Tares of Covetouſneſs, Pride and Contention among
the Clergy and Laity, tempt us to undervalue Gods great
mercy to his Church which Angels and Saints gave him ſo
much praiſe for. Emperours alſo had their odious Crimes;
even <hi>Conſtantine</hi> killed his Eldeſt Son <hi>Criſpus,</hi> and after his
Step-mother for accuſing him, and baniſhed <hi>Athanaſius:</hi>
Shall we therefore be unthankful for a Chriſtian Empire,
which was Chriſts own Viſible Kingdom?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> killed the <hi>Theſſalonians: Arcadius</hi> baniſhed holy
<hi>Chryſoſtom-Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond, a Saint, was called an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychian,
and ſo of others. <hi>David</hi> committed Murder and
Adultery: <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Monſter of Luſt and Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and at laſt of Revolt to favour Idols; yet were they the
peculiar Kings of Gods peculiar People; and few better
followed them.</p>
            <p>All this ſheweth that Chriſt all this while Reigned, and
left it not wholly to the Reſurrection, to make his Enemies
his footſtool.</p>
            <p>XVII. It is not unlikely that this delivered,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Potter,</hi> and many Proteſtant expoſitors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 21. 22. But of this more fully elſewhere.</p>
            <p>XVIII. The Dragon being bound up a Thouſand years
from the Churches deliverance (from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Edict to

of Glory: In which, as his Reward, he will for ever
in Humane Nature be glorified, as the Mediator of <hi>Fruition,</hi>
as he was of Acquiſition; and that in the Heavens. His
coming in the Air is not there to Reign a Thouſand years,
but preſently to Judge the World, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
it: And to confine his Kingdom in Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ours with him to a Thouſand years, and confine it
to the Air, and the ſurvivers on Earth, is a fiction full of
contradictions, diſhonourable to Chriſt and his Kingdom,
uncomfortable to his Church.</p>
            <p>XXI. There is but one Thouſand years mentioned in
Scripture, from whence they can fetch the leaſt ſhew for
their limitation; and that is only in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. But it is moſt
evident that the Thouſand years there mentioned was to
be before the Conflagration, and New Earth, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:
For it was to be before Satan was looſed,
and before <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and their numberleſs Armies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
the Holy City; and before the fire from God came
on them. And the Paradiſe reſtored State of the New Earth,
in which dwelleth Righteouſneſs, is not conſiſtent with ſo
much wickedneſs of the Inhabitants, and Satans Power over
the Nations: Nor with a <hi>Laodicean</hi> Lukewarmneſs, and
danger of being ſpued out. They therefore that well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Thouſand years Reign before the Reſurrection, have
no pretence to expect another <hi>Millennium</hi> after.</p>
            <p>XXII. To expect a Thouſand years, and that after the Fall
of Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> before the Reſurrection, is a ſuppoſition
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59413:8"/>
that this World will endure a far longer time than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
have hitherto believed: And that the great Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is to be before the New Earth: And what a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm
that will be, the deſcription of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and
of their <hi>Laodicea,</hi> may tell you: Far unlike a Paradiſe
ſtate, when all things ſhall be reſtored, and the groaning
Creation be delivered from the bondage of Corruption,
into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>XXIII. They that aſſign this Thouſand years on this
ſide the Conflagration and Reſurrection, for the ſetting up
a Fifth Monarchy of the Converted Jews at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are
the groſſeſt feigners of all the reſt. Well did <hi>Jerom</hi> ſay,
That the Millenaries fetch their Errour from the Jews, and
would ſet up Judaiſm by it. (He that dwelt ſo long at
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> knew the Jews Opinions.) For (to paſs by what
elſe is after to be ſaid) Their very Fiction is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Were our Jews converted, they would in leſs
than a Hundred years be no longer a Jewiſh Nation: For
their ſtate of peculiarity with the Moſaical Policy is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by Chriſt, and muſt never be reſtored: And they
muſt and would marry with Gentile Chriſtians, and fall
into the Catholick Church as Rivers into the Sea, and
loſe the name of Jews: So did their converted Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
            <p>XXIV. And ſeeing it is not like that our now Infidel
Jews are one to a hundred of the Poſterity of the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jews that have been propagated theſe ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, why ſhould a glorious Monarchy be ſet up of
this ſelf-curſed Remnant, excluding all the firſt-fruits, both
the ſealed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. and all ſince? But if the Poſterity of
all thoſe old holy Jews were now ſought for, to be ſent to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not one man of them would be found and
known; (of which more after.)</p>
            <p>XXV. It is a marvel that the great diſagreement of the
Millenaries among themſelves, yet hindereth not their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Concord, while they can but cry up the Thouſand years
Reign, though moſt of them know not what the words
mean. Some of them ſay, The Thouſand years are on
Earth; and ſome ſay, They are only of the Souls of the
Martyrs and Confeſſors in Heaven: Some ſay, They are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59413:9"/>
both in Heaven, or in the Air, and on Earth at once.
Some ſay, That they ſhall be a Jewiſh Monarchy at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi>
and ſome, That it ſhall be of the Godly all over
the World. Some ſay, Chriſt will Reign there viſibly in
his Humane Nature: Others, That he will only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
appear, as he did after his Reſurrection: And ſome,
That he will Rule there only by Reforming Chriſtian
Princes. Some hold but one Thouſand years, and ſome
two, (one being after the other.) Some hold two New
<hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> and ſome but one. Some ſay, That the Day
of Judgment is the Thouſand years (and yet that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath not told us how long Chriſt will be Judging
us.) And ſome, That it is only the Beginning and the End
of the Thouſand years, that the Judgment will take up,
and the reſt will be in other Government. Some think
that Execution on Men and Devils will be but that Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years; which ſome decry. Some think that the firſt
Reſurrection, is from an Aereal Vehicle or Body into an
Ethereal; and others that it is from earthly duſt to a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
body by tranſmutation of Elements: And others that
it is to be a Paradiſe body, like <hi>Adams</hi> before he ſinned.
Other differences ſeem almoſt reconciled to ſome, by the
bare name of a Thouſand years Reign.</p>
            <p>XXVI. It is a far more glorious Chriſtian Monarchy
which Chriſt by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſet up, than moſt of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenaries
give any probability of. 1. It was a Deliverance
from the cruelleſt Perſecution. 2. And from the Dragons
moſt potent Empire. 3. A Deliverance of all Chriſtians as
well as of Jews. 4. Without confinement to the narrow
Land of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 5. A ſetting up of a National-Provincial
Church in <hi>Judea.</hi> 6. With the great Charges of promoting
it, by New Churches, Monaſteries, Bibles, Biſhops! What
could he do more? The knowledge of what hath been done
long ago, would have prevented many mens expectation of
the ſame.</p>
            <p>XXVII. If it prove that their Millennial Doctrine, and
the Calling of the Jews, prove a meer miſtake, it will not
be ſo ſmall as ſhould ſuſpend our detection of it. Becauſe
it is an adding to Gods Word, and fathering on him many
untruths, and ſo a taking of his name in vain; and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59413:9"/>
of his Worſhip while we preach, write and pray for
that which we ought not (further than we muſt pray for
the Converſion of all ſorts of men) and a turning of mens
Zeal to promote untruths, and corrupt mens minds.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. We find it ſo eaſie to poſſeſs men with a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Zeal for the Millenary Opinion, and ſo hard to make
them zealous in holy Love to God and Man, and in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
converſation, as may make us ſuſpicious that both ſorts
of Zeal have not the ſame original: I am not willing to
name ſome tremendous Inſtances of men nearly known to me,
hereabout.</p>
            <p>XXIX. Our worthy Brother that hath more Learnedly
opened that Cauſe than any elſe that ever I read, by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
hath brought the difference into ſo narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
(in his <hi>Diatriba de ſigno filii hominis)</hi> that except, 1. The
Calling of the Jews, 2. And the Extending of the Day of
Judgment to a Thouſand years, and that the general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Judgment of the wicked, ſhall begin after the
Thouſand years are expired, there remaineth to great and
weighty diſagreement of ſuch with the Judgment of the
Churches.</p>
            <p>XXX. Seeing we aſcribe to Chriſts Kingdom ſo much
more than they that we oppoſe, why ſhould they be thought
to extol his Kingdom more than we? 1. Is not Eternity
longer than a Thouſand years? 2. And Heaven a more
glorious ſtate than the Air? 3. And a New Earth inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only by the righteous, better than one that is Laodicean,
or that hath ſuch Enemies of Saints as <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog?</hi>
4. And this New Earth either everlaſting, or of undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
time, better than one but of a Thouſand years du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is but with the Lord as One day, and about
a ſixth part as durable as this corrupted World, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſin and curſe? Is this Doctrine, or the other, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to Chriſt, and more comfortable to Believers, and
more evident in the Word of God?</p>

OF THE APOSTASIE.</head>
            <p>§ 1. Reverend and truly beloved Brother,</p>
            <p>I Take it for no wonder that great and many diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in matters of Religion are among us, while in
Profeſſions of leſs Myſtery (Law, Policy, Phyſicks, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> there are ſo many; that [ſo many men, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
minds] hath ſo long been a Proverb: And in ſuch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
caſes as much endanger not <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> few
men are more for mutual forbearance and charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
than I am: Therefore the Millennial Opinion I
have never been a cenſorious oppoſer of, while men kept
up Peace and Charity with it.</p>
            <p>But the caſe lately is altered, and is made a matter of
neceſſary Zeal, as part of the Creed and the Lords Prayer,
if not eſſential to the Goſpel and Chriſtianity: And very
many of the Antinomian, and Separating Opinion, that leaſt
underſtand it, lay much of their Religion on it: And the
juſt honour of many Conformiſts, of the moſt peaceable
Principles otherwiſe promoteth it; ſuch as Mr. <hi>Joſ. Mede.</hi>
Dr. <hi>H. More,</hi> Dr. <hi>Creſſoner,</hi> your ſelf, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Author of the
<hi>Midnight Cry,</hi> Mr.<hi>R. M.</hi> the Publiſher (moſt pious men
both) and many others. And we muſt not now be ſuffered
to be ſilent, but muſt anſwer your provocations, or be groſly
guilty of the evil that will follow your ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>§ 2. The Millenary Opinion was indeed early received
by ſome followers of <hi>Papias:</hi> But the univerſal oppoſition
of the Chriſtian Church that hath exploded it ever ſince,
tells us that it was a ſingular Opinion: And is he a humble
man that now calleth the Chriſtian Church for ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, and all thoſe Learned and Holy Divines of
<hi>England,</hi> and other Reformed Churches, that differ from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59413:10"/>
your conceit, by the name of <hi>[SEMI-SADDVCES OF THE
APOSTASIE.]</hi> Bear with my freedom. Is it humility
that ſo loudly challengeth all the Paſtors and Doctors of the
Churches to anſwer you? Have you anſwered all them?
or ſo much as one <hi>Cluverus</hi> alone, or <hi>James Calvert</hi> whom
you promiſed me to anſwer? Was it humility that <hi>caſt</hi> a
<hi>Glove</hi> for an Anſwer to two or three trifling Fallacies about
the Pagan <hi>Babylon,</hi> when I had given you an Anſwer to them
long before, and you modeſtly ſent it back without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation?</p>
            <p>I have had long by me, as a Learner, ſome humble Queries
to you, and no Bookſeller will Print them, becauſe they ſay
men look on you as diſeaſed with propheſying Self conceit,
and will not read a Confutation.</p>
            <p>Your Leader Dr. <hi>More</hi> ſaith, That the Papiſts not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
my Books againſt them, is, becauſe they deſpiſe
them, as unworthy of an anſwer. May not your caſe be
much the ſame? Men have greater matters to mind, than
to trouble themſelves with you and me, or anſwering our
Challenges.</p>
            <p>§ 3. But I come to your <hi>Chain of Principles:</hi> And 1. It's
a half and fallacious deſcription of Chriſts Kingdom, to ſay
it is his <hi>As the Son of Man.</hi> There be millions of <hi>Sons of
Men</hi> that have no ſuch Kingdom. It is his Kingdom as
God-man, the Redeemer and Recovering Mediator.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom is to him as the Eternal Word, and the
Son of Man in one perſon of a Redeemer.</p>
            <p>And becauſe you confeſſed to me, that if you err, the

            <p>§ 4. 2. You ſay oft, that Chriſts Kingdom begins at
the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as if he had none before: And you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
not the ſeveral Gradations of his Kingdom, as
from the Conception and <hi>Embryo</hi> to its maturity: As it
began in the Promiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> and renewed to <hi>Noah,</hi>
and proceeded to the Covenant of Peculiarity, made to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, ſettled in a Common-wealth by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> renewed to <hi>David:</hi> And as it came from Heaven

in the Perſon of the Incarnate <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſhewing his Kingly
Power by his Miracles and Doctrines, and in his Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration,
and acknowledged by <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s, and owned to
the death before the <hi>Roman</hi> Judge. Nor his entrance on
the more open exerciſe of it, by his Reſurrection, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ſending down his Paraclete the Holy Spirit, and
by it in his commiſſioned Apoſtles and Witneſſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
and converting the World. You take little notice
of his going forth conquering on the White Horſe, as
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and calling all the Fowls
of the Air to eat the fleſh of Kings and Captains, and his
utter ſubverſion of Pagan <hi>Babylon,</hi> taking to himſelf his
great Power and Reigning, when Heaven and Earth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed,
with joy, that the Kingdoms of the World were
made the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, and
Chriſt ſet up Chriſtian Princes as his Officers repreſenting
him to Rule as in his name (as his Miniſters do in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his name.)</p>
            <p>If you ſay that theſe things were not done, your unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſlander of Providence and the Revelation, is confuted
by the whole ſtream of the Roman and Church Hiſtory:
What more will be done hereafter is a further queſtion.
The fulneſs of the Gentiles then came in. And is all this
no Kingdom and Reign of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 5. Compare Chriſts words of his Kingdom and yours,</hi>
Matth. 12. 28. The Kingdom of God is come unto you. <hi>Matth.
21.</hi> 43. The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given
to a Nation that will bring forth the fruit thereof. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 20.
No doubt the Kingdom of God is come upon you. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 27.
There are ſome here that ſhall not taſte of death, till they ſee the
Kingdom of God come in power. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 21. The Kingdom of
God is among you <hi>(or within you.)</hi> Matth. 13. <hi>Likeneth the
Kingdom of Heaven to a Sower, to a grain of Muſtard-ſeed,
to a Treaſure hid, to rich Pearls ſought, to a little Leaven,
to a Fiſhers Net, to a field of Corn and Tares,</hi> Luk. 19. 12, 15.
<hi>When Chriſt aſcended, he then received for himſelf a
Kingdom, before he came to Judgment,</hi> Joh. 5. 22. The
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment to the
Son. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. All power in Heaven and Earth is given
me. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2, 3. All things are delivered to him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 42.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59413:12"/>
               <hi>He that prayed Chriſt to remember him when he came in
his Kingdom, was told that he ſhould be in Paradiſe with
him that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> are now in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and others ſhall ſit down there with them.
God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared
with Chriſt on the Mount of Glory: And <hi>Enoch</hi> was
tranſlated. Chriſt is not in Heaven alone without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but Angels: And if <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> be there, more
are there, to make the ſuperiour part of his Kingdom. He
hath there a nobler Reign now, than is exerciſed in this
dark, diſtracted World, that is drowned in wickedneſs, and
torn by mutual Enmity and Malice. It would not elſe have
been better for <hi>Paul</hi> to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.
Thoſe that follow him, ſhall be where he is, <hi>Joh. 12. 26.
We live, becauſe he liveth,</hi> as branches in him the Vine.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Either this World is Governed now by God, or
not: If not, he is not a God to it; or Kings are more
to it than God: If yea, it is by Chriſt that he governeth
it. Are there any Divine Laws, or not? If there be, they
are Chriſts Laws, and the Execution is Chriſts Execution of
them. And ſure the exerciſe of Legiſlation, Judgment,
Protection, Rewards and Puniſhments, are the exerciſe of
Kingly Government.</p>
            <p>You deny Chriſt, if you deny him to be King: Will you
not obey him as King, till the Trumpet ſound, and he come
to the final Judgment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 8. But where is the preſent Kingdom of Chriſt, more
gloriouſly deſcribed than in the Prophecies which you call
your ſelf the</hi> Humble Reader of? <hi>and eſpecially in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe
(if it be not you only that underſtand it?) It would
ſwell this writing to name all the Texts that expreſly aſſert
it.</hi> Iſa. 9. 6, 7. To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, and
the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulder, and his Name ſhall be
called Wonderful, Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting
Father, the Prince of Peace; of the increaſe of his Government
and Peace there ſhall be no End; upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and
upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to ſtabliſh it with Judgment
and with Juſtice, from henceforth even for ever. <hi>Is this only at
the Millennium.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59413:13"/>
               <hi>He is a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and remiſſion
of ſin.</hi> God hath made him Lord and Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 16.
To be Lord is to be King: To deny this is to ſay that we
owe him no obedience, and is Apoſtacy indeed.</p>
            <p>How could he make us Kings and Prieſts to God, if he
were not King himſelf? even a Prieſt after the order of
<hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> and a Prophet raiſed up like <hi>Moſes</hi> that was
King in <hi>Jeſhurun.</hi> But enough of this to real Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 9. But what is all this to you? Do you deny it? 1. If
you do not, it is not</hi> Chriſts Kingdom, <hi>but the</hi> Conſummation
of his Kingdom, <hi>and his Glorious appearing in it that is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at Judgment after the Conflagration. 2. But it is your
words and not your thoughts that are publiſhed in Print, and
if you have written contrary to your Heart, recant it, and
pity them that you deceived. In your Catechiſm of the
Millennium you ſay, pag</hi> 5. <q>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When doth Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
begin? <hi>Anſ.</hi> It begins at the Coming and Appearance of
Chriſt, and at the Reſurrection of his Saints at his Coming and
Appearance.] <hi>And page</hi> 6. The Apoſtle without any other
mention of his Kingdom ſaith, He muſt reign till he hath put
all his Enemies under his feet. Now when did this reign begin
but at his Coming? Or where did the Apoſtle give any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his reigning but at his Coming? And when he comes and
deſcends, and no longer ſits at the Right Hand of God, then
God firſt maketh his Enemies his Footſtool: Not when he ſits,
but when he comes: And then he begins to reign.—His
Kingdom and the Reſurrection of his Saints begin together.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>§ 10. I confeſs this Doctrine well agreeth with Doctor
<hi>More</hi>'s Life of Tryal in the Air, and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Concluſion
that our Salvation is not aſcertained to us till the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
Indeed it maketh all our Preaching, and Religion
in this life of little moment, in compariſon of that which is
after both Death and Reſurrection: For if Chriſt Reign
not till then, he maketh no Laws till then; He bindeth us
to no obedience to him till then; He puniſheth no ſin till
then; He ſetteth up no Magiſtrates till then, to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Officers in his Kingdom: He executeth no Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in the Churches as King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O how have Independents
and Presbyterians been deceived then, who have lamented
the neglect or ſuppreſſion of Chriſts Kingly Government in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59413:13"/>
the Church! It is then under his Thouſand years Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that men muſt obey to ſecure their Salvation.</p>
            <p>§ 11. But the contrary is fully evident by the Effects.
1. What new Laws he will make in the Air, you muſt
prove: But we can prove that he made Laws for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on Earth: 2. Elſe the World hath had no King or
Government of God: 3. Nor no authorized Prince or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.
4. All Saints can ſay that he giveth Rewards on Earth
to Believers. 5. And he is the Protector of his Church.
6. He here is known by the Judgments which he executeth,
and maketh his Enemies his footſtool, though their final
Fall be at the laſt. Did he not in that Kingly glory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by <hi>John,</hi> execute all thoſe Plagues on Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi>
and its Beaſt, which are gradually deſcribed in the Seals,
the Trumpets and the Vials till it fell? If you ſay that all
this is meant of Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> ſure I am, it was done firſt on
Pagan <hi>Rome:</hi> And you that tell us how ſhortly Turk and
Pope ſhall fall, ſure take it to be before the Reſurrection!
And doth not Chriſt then make his Enemies his footſtool by
his Kingly Power?</p>
            <p>12. What it is for Chriſt to ſubdue his Enemies, muſt be
known by his Office and Undertaking, which is to overcome
Satan, and to ſave his People from their ſins. And did he
not conquer Satan as a Tempter, and triumph even on the

Hath he trod down in you, no Pride, no Luſt, no Errour,
no Injuſtice? Doth he not tread down greater Enemies
than Turkiſh Swords, or Papal Inquiſitions in every Soul
that he converteth? When we fight not againſt fleſh and
blood, but againſt Principalities and Powers, and ſpiritual
wickedneſs in high places? And when we are but killed,
and counted as Sheep to the ſlaughter, in all this we are more
than Conquerours, and need not fear them that kill the body.</p>

is to Recover ſinful man to God, and reſtore him
to purity, from ſin, and all the curſe or puniſhment for ſin;
yea and to advance him to a more perfect and confirmed ſtate.
And Chriſts Reward for this, is the everlaſting Joy that was
ſet before him, in the fruition of the Divine Complacency,
and in the perfect and glorious Headſhip to his perfected glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Church for ever. Let us conſider, 1. Which of theſe
is Given up to the Father; And 2. What Giving up to the
Father is; And 3. When it is done.</p>

As a Prince commiſſioned to be General for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Revolted Rebels, brings them down by degrees,
and having ſlain ſome, and reduced the reſt, he giveth up
his Commiſſion, and is General no more; for his work is
done. But he hath after the promiſed Reward and Honour,
and may under the King, rule them as recovered.</p>
            <p>Or as a Phyſician that hath an Hoſpital or infected City
to cure, giveth up that work when it is perfectly finiſhed:
So Chriſt giveth up the Kingdom of Redemption when he
hath done that work. 2. But this <hi>Giving</hi> up is no depoſing
of Chriſt, nor is he leſs, but more gloriouſly King than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Nor is God the Father any more King than before.
It's no diminution to Chriſts Royalty, nor any addition to
the Fathers. I ſhall prove this before I go further.</p>
            <p>§ 20. 1. By comparing this Text with <hi>Joh. 5. 22. The
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment to the
Son:]</hi> And yet the Father Governeth no leſs than he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and is not depoſed by giving up all Government to the
Son: Only the quality of the Subject, and the terms of his
Government are altered. Creation is in Scripture eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſcribed to the Father, and Redemption to the Son. The
Father as Creator Governed Man in his Integrity, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and perfect him: Man being faln into ſin and miſery,
the Son as Redeemer Governeth Man as a Phyſician his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
in order to his cure. The Father now judgeth no
Man as ſinleſs according to the Law of Innocency, but hath
committed the Government of all to the Son as his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator
and Phyſician, in order to their cure. This is but
altering the way of Government. And it is the Subjects
of the Kingdom that are called <hi>The Kingdom,</hi> who are now
reſtored, and delivered up to the Father, without blemiſh,
ſpot or wrinkle, that he may henceforth Govern them as a
perfectly healed People, according to the Law of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>The Father now judgeth no leſs by the Son, than before
in another way.</p>
            <p>§ 21. 2. I prove the continuance of the Kingdom of the
Son, in the way of Fruition and Glory, by the Promiſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
made to him by the Father. The Covenant of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hath Obligations laid on the Son, and Promiſes of a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59413:15"/>
glorious Kingdom, as merited by his performance of his
part. And doth his performance diſpoſſeſs him of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Reward, when it was the condition of his Title to it?
It's tedious to cite all Texts that prove it.</p>
            <p>§ 22. 3. The Promiſes are made to Chriſt, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſhall be an everlaſting Kingdom, and have no end:
And therefore ceaſeth not by the delivery mentioned. And
though the Hebrew word commonly tranſlated <hi>[for ever]</hi>
oft ſignifie but a long time, or many Generations; yet in
the Texts intimated, there is no reaſon for ſuch a limitation.
If God ſay, that of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end, let
the deniers prove their denial.</p>
            <p>§ 23. 4. Chriſt hath promiſed to make them that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
Pillars in his Temple, and they ſhall go out no more;
which he could not perform if he go out himſelf, or loſe his
Kingly Power.</p>
            <p>And he ſaith, That the Children of God and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

ſure he can make their ſtate no more durable than his own.
And it is called <hi>Life Eternal</hi> which we ſhall poſſeſs: And

            <p>§ 24. 5. Chriſts Humane Nature will be perpetuated,
and therefore ſo will his glorious Kingdom. No Text ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of his ceaſing to be Man; but many contrary. And
who ſhould then preſume to aſſert it? I know <hi>Smeckfeldius</hi>
held, that Chriſt ceaſed to be Man as ſoon as he entred
Heaven: But the Church called it a Hereſie. As on Earth
he was to be Man like us in fleſh, ſo in Heaven where fleſh
and blood cannot enter; yet he will make our vile bodies
like to his glorious body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 25. 6. The ſtate of Reward is an Advancement, and

above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow,
of things in Heaven, and things on Earth, and things under the
Earth, and that every Tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.</p>
            <p>§ 26. 7. Chriſt hath promiſed us that we ſhall be with
him where he is, and prayed that we may there behold his
glory; which is plainly to ſay, that when he hath been the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59413:16"/>
Mediator of Redemption, he will be the Mediator of <hi>Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
that is, that we ſhall ſee Gods Glory as ſhining to us
in the glorified Humanity of Chriſt: For as we ſhall have
Bodies in Heaven as well as Souls; ſo our Bodies will have
a ſuitable Medium of Communion with God.</p>
            <p>§ 27. 8. If Chriſts Humane Nature ſhould ceaſe its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>ours</hi> by the ſame reaſon would do ſo too. But that is
contrary to the hopes of Faith.</p>
            <p>§ 28. 9. Angels Glory and Being is perpetuated: And
therefore Chriſts Humane Kingdom and Glory, who is above
them, will not ceaſe.</p>
            <p>§ 29. 10. There is Executive Government by Chriſt to
be exerciſed after the ſuppoſed Thouſand years: Therefore
he ſhall Reign after to perform it.</p>
            <p>The Redeemed Believers muſt be Rewarded to Eternity,
and he muſt ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by
him: He muſt continue and perpetuate their Reward and
Happineſs: For they muſt live as his Members, becauſe he
liveth: And I doubt not but if you are for ending Chriſts
Kingdom after a Thouſand years, you will be for the ending
of ours.</p>
            <p>And he hath his Enemies to puniſh longer than a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

their puniſhment then, if you would end Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
then, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16. It is the Wrath of the Lamb that is
to be executed on the Enemies of the Lamb: It was againſt
him and his Grace that they ſinned; and it is he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in flaming fire to execute Judgment on all that know
not God, and obey not the Goſpel. And doth puniſhment
end with your Thouſand years? The very nature of the
glory of the Glorified Body of Chriſt, is to live as Branches
in him the Vine: Our Life is hid with Chriſt in God:
And if his Kingdom be given up, all our life and ſecurity is
alſo given up. The ſame cauſe muſt continue that began,
the Reward of Believers (in whom Chriſt will be admired
more than a Thouſand years) and the puniſhment of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
The Kingdom of Glory therefore continueth when
the Reſtoring Kingdom hath done its work.</p>
            <p>§ 30. 11. The Devil hath reigned by Gods penal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,

about 6000 years within 314, And ſhall Chriſt reign but one
thouſand? Prove it before you affirm it.</p>
            <p>§ 31. 12. How frivolous is your reaſon from <hi>Gods being
All in All?</hi> What do you think thoſe words do mean? It's
neither any Addition to God, nor any Excluſion of Chriſt:
But Gods Governing Mankind as fully recovered according
to the Law of his perfect Nature, and without any more
Medicinal recovering Grace; and his filling them with the
Grace and Joy of his inhabiting Complacence.</p>
            <p>1. It cannot mean that God in Eſſence is nearer the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than before. For in him we Live and Move, and Be.
He is <hi>All in All</hi> now as the God of Nature.</p>
            <p>2. It cannot mean that God will be more the Cauſe of
Grace or Glory, for Chriſts ceaſing to be a Cauſe. For
God is no leſs a Cauſe when he uſeth ſecond Cauſes, than if
he uſed none.</p>
            <p>3. It can no more be an Excluſion of Chriſt from being
a Cauſe of our heavenly Communion with God, than an
Excluſion of all ſecond Cauſes from their Office: And if all
ſecond Cauſes be excluded, and there be no Cauſe but God,
there will be no Being but God, and this is but to reduce
the World into God or Nothing; which you muſt not
feign unproved.</p>

Even Chriſt is ſaid to Be <hi>All in All, Col.</hi> 3. 11. And ſhall

upholdeth All things by the Word of his Power. For whom
are All things, and by whom are All things? <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 3.

the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. We are growing toward this
before the Reſurrection. And if then we attain it, muſt it
endure but a Thouſand years? The perfection of the Church
of Chriſt, is not like that of Fleſhly Bodies, that when they
are at the top of Age, go downwards again; Nor Apples
and Pears, that when they are mellow ſoon rot.</p>

Anſ.</hi> And was he not always ſubject to him (in his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?)
He tells us oft that he doth not his own will, but the
will of him that ſent him. The <hi>Father worketh,</hi> and he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
He were not the true Chriſt if, as Man, he were not
ſubject to God: But <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not that <hi>Then he begins to be

War is over, and he hath done his work as General, or
Conquering Redeemer, he ſhall be ſtill as Man, a Subject to
God, and Glorified as the Reward of his Redemption, and
be the Glorified Head and King of his Glorified redeemed
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>

that Chriſt ſhall be Man <hi>for ever,</hi> but not as the <hi>Son</hi> of
Man: That is, as Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and you, and <hi>John Turner</hi> ſay,
<hi>He is an Eternal Man, or Life, and hath</hi> ſay you, and Dr. <hi>M.
an Eternal Body, Fleſh and Blood, from whence you plead for

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59413:17"/>
it but for a Temptation, while Scripture is againſt it, as well
as the judgment of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that Fleſh and Blood <hi>cannot inherit</hi> the
Kingdom of God, I muſt in Charity ſuppoſe that by <hi>Fleſh and
Blood Eternal,</hi> Dr. <hi>More</hi> and others, mean (not properly
but Catachriſtically) the <hi>Natura Mentalis,</hi> or the Intellectual
Nature, which they ſuppoſe to be the ſame in Chriſt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men.</p>
            <p>It is not improbable that the higheſt of Creatures, is in
order of Nature, a prior effect of the Divine production be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the lower.</p>
            <p>Whether this ſhall be called an Emanation or a Creation
you are not agreed. Nor whether this prime Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
be <hi>Vniverſal Life,</hi> and <hi>Vniverſal Matter,</hi> and ſo be the
<hi>Soul and Body</hi> of the World, conſidered as before modal
Mutations; or whether it be only ſome nobler ſort of <hi>Spirit</hi>
and <hi>Matter</hi> that is made before the more ignoble, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
maketh the reſt.</p>
            <p>But it is concluded that Chriſt is the <hi>Life or Spirit</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Perſon in the</hi> Trinity, and the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghoſt the Matter,
and ſo the <hi>third Perſon:</hi> And that Chriſt, the Soul, and the
Holy Ghoſt the Matter, are one; which ſome call A <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and ſome call God, and ſome both. <hi>Peter Sterry</hi>'s is
the plaineſt way, that the Divine Nature firſt produceth and
uniteth it ſelf to the Univerſal Intellectual Nature, which is
Chriſt the firſt Creature, including the Holy Ghoſt: And
that this firſt Intellectual Nature, uniteth it ſelf at the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Humane Nature: And ſo that Chriſt hath three
Natures. 1. Divine. 2. Superangelical Created. 3. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
            <p>But ſtill it is unreſolved whether the prime Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
be a Soul to the Incarnate Body, or Chriſt took both
<hi>Soul</hi> and Body of Man, beſides the firſt Mental Nature.
<hi>Apollinarius</hi> was for the Godhead being inſtead of a Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now you come and tell us that</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>[The Eternal Word in
Humane Nature hath a Kingdom throughout Eternity, but not
as the Son of Man, but as the Eternal Word: The Glory in
which Chriſt is ſeen with his Saints, being the Glory which he
had with the Father before the World began: Of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wherein he is now at the right Hand of God till he appears:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59413:18"/>
And the Union in that Eternal State is by God to God, by the
Word to the Father; ſo the Son as Man is ſubject, and God All
in All. <hi>Catech. p.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>It ſeems by the high expreſſions of God, who is pureſt Spirit,
being All in All, and by the Lake of the Second Death, and
even the New Heaven and New Earth after the Thouſand
years flying away, there is no bodily or material nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
no not of the Sons glorious body, who is then ſubject,
nor of the Saints. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Scripture having declared no ſuch thing,
no ſuch thing can be ſuppoſed, but that Chriſt and his Saints ſhall
be in bodies.</p>
               <p>So high expreſſions can fit no ſtate but of God All in All;
even as he was before the foundation of the World All in All,
and to which ſtate our Lords words ſo much refer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.
When all the Saints are thus One with God in Chriſt, then he
is thus All in All, as before the World began.</p>
               <p>Though this Kingdom of Chriſt be ſo holy, ſo heavenly, ſo
pure, ſo much of God in it—yet becauſe it is the Kingdom
of the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and of his Saints in a Viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Glory, and not the higheſt Union to God All in All, Chriſt
gives this laſt declaration of the Name, that is, of the Nature
and Glory of God; He freely delivereth up this his Kingdom,
and the Son as in Humane Nature ſuffers moſt willingly that
Glory of himſelf, and of his Saints, to be ſwallowed up by God
All in All, and unites them with himſelf to the Father, as he
is the Eternal Word, and ſo they are with him for ever, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Glory which he had with the Father before the World
was, which is the higheſt inſtance of Self-denial of all Created
Glory, and giving up all to God All in All that could be given,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§ 36. Here you do but confound mens minds with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things at the beſt unproved. 1. That Chriſt was an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Man; (of which your Tranſubſtantiation-Book hath
more.) 2. That his Eternal Manhood is ſo diſtinct from his
being the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> that he hath a twofold Manhood;
one from Eternity, and one at his Incarnation. 3. That
Chriſts Kingdom as the Son of Man, that is, in his Manhood
which he had by Incarnation, endureth but a Thouſand years.</p>
            <p>4. That the Manhood of his Saints which they had by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
alſo ceaſeth after the Thouſand years. 5. Yet Chriſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59413:18"/>
and they ſhall have material <hi>Bodies</hi> after, even in Chriſts
eternal Body. 6. That this giving up of the Kingdom after
a Thouſand years, is the greateſt Self-denial in the World,
as if it were a loſs or diminution of the Glory of Chriſt and
Saints. 7. That when all the Saints are thus One in Chriſt
with God, then God is All in All, as before the <hi>foundation of
the World.</hi> 8. That this is the Unity meant in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24.
9. That this is glorifying Chriſt with the Glory he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World began, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. And not that God would
glorifie him as the Son of Man, by advancing his Humane
Nature, to its participation in the Glory which the Divine
Nature had from Eternity. 10. Yet you tell me by word
of mouth, that you believe the Individuation of the Saints in
this united ſtate. The Metaphor of <hi>[ſwallowing up in God]</hi>
you may make true or falſe as you ſhall expound it, which
till then ſignifieth nothing.</p>
            <p>§ 37. Short-ſighted men may reverence this the more,
by how much the leſs they underſtand it: But they that
will make ſenſe of it muſt ſee, that it is to lead us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philoſophy as a higher Light than Chriſt and Scripture,
and to introduce the Pythagorean Opinion of the Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
of Souls, and the Platoniſts and Stoicks Revolution,
and <hi>Averrhois</hi> his Univerſal Soul, and to make God or Chriſt
Diviſible, and with <hi>Origen,</hi> to make the future Rewards
and Puniſhments temporary.</p>
            <p>§ 38. 1. If Chriſt as a <hi>Man, or Life, or Spirit,</hi> was <hi>Eternal,</hi>
it was as <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>as</hi> a <hi>Creature.</hi> As God he was not Man,
nor Body. If you ſay that he was the ſecond <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> as
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the Holy Ghoſt the third as <hi>Matter,</hi> (as Dr. <hi>More</hi>
and <hi>J. Turner)</hi> then either you mean <hi>Vniverſal,</hi> or <hi>Particular
Life</hi> and <hi>Matter:</hi> If Univerſal, you make the World to be
God, and make him Diviſible: If Particular, you make God
a part of the World: And ſo you do if you make him but
the <hi>Soul</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>§ 39. 2. If the Saints were in God before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
accordingly all things were eternally in God; and that
will bring in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Eternity of the World, which indeed
meer Reaſon might take for probable.</p>
            <p>§ 40. Either you mean that we were in God only as in
<hi>Potentia Creatoris,</hi> and that is <hi>not to be in him,</hi> but only to ſay
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59413:19"/>
that he was <hi>able</hi> to make us: For <hi>exiſtere est eſſe extra Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas
Efficientes.</hi> Or elſe that we did actually <hi>exist:</hi> (which
thoſe hold that are for Souls <hi>Prae existence,</hi> or worſe.) And
we did exiſt in God, either as being <hi>God himſelf,</hi> or <hi>Creatures,</hi>
or <hi>Effects</hi> of God. If we were God from Eternity, we are
God ſtill: If as <hi>Effects</hi> or <hi>Creatures,</hi> then either as <hi>Parts of
one common Soul</hi> and body of the World (or of the Humane
Species,) or as ſo many Individuals. If it be ſaid that we were
but <hi>Parts</hi> of one <hi>Soul</hi> or Body, it will infer that we are ſo
ſtill, and that theſe parts are as the Rivers and Springs from
the Sea in continual Revolution: Or if we are fixed Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,
God kept us not <hi>idle</hi> from Eternity (or prae-exiſtent.)
None can think that God from all Eternity (or ſince) kept
all the Souls that are to be embodied to the end of the
World, in a ſleepy ſtate till Bodies were generated for them.</p>
            <p>If you ſay that they lived in God as pure Spirits without
Bodies, what then did the Prime Matter, which ſome of you
call the third Hypoſtaſis in the Trinity? We ſee that God
put Souls into Bodies in this World: And can you prove
that he never did ſo before from all Eternity?</p>
            <p>And when you have ſaid, that Chriſt and Saints ſhall be
ſwallowed up in God, and have no more Kingdom as Sons
of men, but be in God as before the World began, do you
mean that they ſhall continue ſo to all Eternity, and never
revolve into Bodies more? When God hath ſhewed us that
he hath delighted in embodied Souls theſe five thouſand ſix
hundred ninety years, will you feign that he never did ſo
before, nor ever will do ſo again?</p>
            <p>§ 41. I conclude, 1. That there is no rational iſſue of
your Doctrine to be expected, but a Pythagorean, or Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Revolution or Tranſmigration of Souls, from one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Soul into many particulars, as the Sea floweth into
Springs, and they into Rivers, and they into the Sea again,
and ſo round: Or as one Sun illuminating the Air, lighteth
many Candles, (by a burning-glaſs or by flames,) being indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduated
only by the oily matter, but not divided from the
common Element of Fire.</p>
            <p>2. And that all this is but to confound men partly with
falſhoods, and partly with uncertainties; when the plain
Doctrine of Chriſt is a more quieting way. God hath kept
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59413:19"/>
us ſo dark about the <hi>Beginning</hi> or <hi>Prae-exiſtence,</hi> and the
<hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>producing Souls,</hi> yea and of the manner of their
operation in their ſeparated ſtate, that to be confident beyond
his Scripture-Revelation, is but to be ignorant of our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and to venture to take Gods name in vain.</p>
            <p>But we know that God breathed into Man that breath of
Life, and ſo made him a Living Soul, and ſaid, <hi>Increaſe and
multiply;</hi> and that the Spirit goeth to God that gave it, and
we ſhall be with Chriſt in Paradiſe, and that he will receive
our departing Spirits, and that it's beſt to be with him.</p>
            <p>§ 42. And now I ſee not what you can make of Gods
being <hi>All-in-All,</hi> more that at this day he is, and more than
that he ſhall Govern Man again as ſinleſs and fully reſtored,
without any further Redemption or Recovering Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but that you pervert the Text to countenance your
pretended abbreviation of Chriſts Reign to a Thouſand
years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things are now in him, and of him, and to him.</hi> Nothing
can be added to All. But I am not able to diſcern why you
ſpeak ſo much in Equivocals and Generals, that cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
afford the Reader a determined ſenſe. If you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be understood, your Opinions are not of the Light.
If you underſtand not your own words, how ſhould others
underſtand them?</p>
            <p>No man can tell whether you infer from Gods being <hi>All
in All,</hi> the <hi>Deification</hi> of <hi>All things,</hi> or their <hi>Annihilation,</hi> or
the diſſolving of all Bodies compound, and the Deifying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the ſpiritual part.</p>

            <p>Here we have <hi>Anihilation</hi> and <hi>Nothingneſs in themſelves,</hi>
and yet <hi>[indeed are returned into the Divine Immenſity.</hi> And ſo
that which is <hi>Nothing in it ſelf</hi> hath a <hi>Being</hi> in God! What
can this mean but that the Creatures were once <hi>all God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
till he gave them a Self-being, which he taketh away,
and then they are God again, not only their Individuation,

where God as All in All ſhall be Glorified in the perfection
of Chriſt <hi>God-Man</hi> and his Glorified Saints. This is agreed

               <p>§ 1. What could you have ſaid more ſtrongly againſt your

the Redeemed die no more. None of them die after Chriſts

Trumpet ſoundeth, and the dead are raiſed.</p>
               <p>§ 10. IX. <hi>Matth</hi> 24. Chriſt tells us that <hi>He will gather
his Elect from the four Winds,</hi> when he cometh with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,

Coming, and the Reſurrection: For after that there
will be no more death as an <hi>Enemy.</hi> If you would deny this
(as aforeſaid) becauſe in the New Earth the Bleſſed are
Mortal in poſſibility of Nature, I anſwer, that Paradiſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
(were it true) is none of the Curſe for Sin, and
therefore not the Enemy to be ſubdued.</p>
               <p>§ 12. XI. The Saints ſhall be caught up when the day
and work of Judgment Cometh: But that will be at Chriſts
Coming, and the Reſurrection: As he himſelf and many a
plain Text of Scripture tell us, (too much to cite.) And
whereas you feign a Judgment day of a Thouſand years,
taking <hi>Judgment</hi> for <hi>Government,</hi> Chriſt otherwiſe expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelf, and tells how the Judgment will proceed by
Exploration and Sentence, <hi>Mat. 25. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Government in general containeth Legiſlation, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Execution: You tell us not a word what Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be in the Air the Thouſand years. And for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in ſpecial, will Chriſt be a Thouſand years in <hi>Explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Sentence?</hi> Will the wicked ſo long be untryed and
uncondemned, or the Faithful ſo long unjuſtified, or by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59413:23"/>
judged to Salvation? Doth not Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
this? VViil their caſe be ſo long undecided?</p>
               <p>If you mean that <hi>Execution</hi> will be that Thouſand years,
can you prove that the Damned ſhall ſuffer no longer? Nor
the Bleſſed any longer reign with Chriſt? O make not a New
Goſpel, Heaven and Hell!</p>
               <p>§ 13. XII. The Saints will be taken up when the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is delivered up to the Father, and God is All In All:</hi> But
that will be at Chriſt Triumphant Coming and Judgment at
the Reſurrection. For it ſignifieth no more but that Sin
and Curſe ſhall all be caſt out, and all that rebelled againſt
God be Conquered, and all Chriſts Recovering work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and God again Rule Man as Innocent according to
the Law of his perfect Nature: This will be then fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>You ſay that thoſe on Earth ſhall be in a Paradiſe State,
and thoſe in the Air will not be worſe: And then Chriſts
Coming in Triumph delivereth up the Kingdom to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that his and Chriſts Kingdom of Glory and Fruition
may ſucceed.</p>
               <p>§ 14. XIII. When <hi>Paul</hi> was opening to them the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Chriſts Kingdom, if he had talkt thus of being caught
up in a moment of time, at the laſt Trump to meet the Lord,
and never told them a word of a Thouſand years between
the Trumpet and being caught up, it muſt be becauſe he
<hi>knew it not,</hi> or was not <hi>willing that we ſhould know it:</hi> But <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of theſe could be true in a matter of ſo great moment,
when it was that Coming of Chriſt that he was ſatisfying
them about. And I will learn from you, nothing that <hi>Paul</hi>
knew not.</p>
               <p>§ 15. XIV. I have proved before how copiouſly Chriſt
openeth the nature of his own Kingdom in many Parables;
and how he maketh his Enemies his Footſtool, Conquering
Satan, Sin and Enemies, and how the Revelation openeth
his Conqueſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: And he ſhall deſtroy the
Man of Sin with the Breath of his Mouth, and the Brightneſs
of his Coming. Therefore he hath not left this to be done
the Thouſand years after his Coming.</p>
               <p>§ 16. <hi>XV.</hi> Peter <hi>tells us that</hi> [the day of the Lord will
come as a Thief in the night: in which the Heavens ſhall paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59413:23"/>
with a great noiſe, and the Elements melt with fervent heat.]
<hi>But a Thouſand years is not ſuch a ſudden ſurprize: Nor
will Heaven and Earth be a Thouſand years burning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 17. XVI. <hi>The Earth and the Works therein ſhall be burnt
up;</hi> and all theſe <hi>things be diſſolved. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12.
Therefore the Bodies of thoſe then alive would be <hi>burnt
and diſſolved</hi> were they not firſt taken up. To ſay as you do,
that God would keep them in the Fire unburnt as he did the
three, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. is to make and obtrude on us a Goſpel of
your own.</p>
               <p>§ 18. XVII. You think <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall live after
the Conflagration, who ſhall cover the Earth: And ſhall all
their Bodies too be unburnt in the Fire, that diſſolveth all
theſe things on Earth? Is this any Word of God?</p>
               <p>§ 19. XVIII. You that think Men live each one the
whole Thouſand years, and <hi>generate ſo abundantly as to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with a much more for the few that were ſaved under the
firſt</hi> Adam, can by no reaſonable imagination find room on
Earth, for the numberleſs Off-ſpring of a Thouſand years,
to dwell all at once here: And the numberleſs followers of
<hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> alſo to dwell with them. They muſt not be
ſo unrighteous as to diſpoſſeſs the wicked of their dwellings;
And for one year after all is burnt up, they may be in
want.</p>
               <p>§ 20. XIX. It is incredible that your deſcription of
Earth for the Thouſand years can leave <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in their
Hoſtility unconvinced: For to ſee Men live a Thouſand
years in the ſight of Chriſt and all the Saints in the Air,
one would think ſhould convince them: Or if Men are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before at the common Age of Men, to ſee ſo many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
caught up to Heaven without Death or Burial, ſure
would make them afraid of fighting againſt ſuch.</p>
               <p>§ 21. XX. There is not one word of God that confineth
Chriſts Kingdom to a Thouſand years; and what are you
that you ſhould preſume to do it?</p>
               <p>It hath continued much above a Thouſand years already.
If you alledge 2 <hi>Pet. 3. One day with the Lord is as a Thouſand
years, and a Thouſand as one day,</hi> which ſpeaketh only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
doubting, becauſe of the delay of Chriſts Coming, as
if this told us how <hi>long</hi> he ſhould <hi>reign</hi> when he is Come,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59413:24"/>
this would but confirm us that your Doctrine is meerly of
your ſelf. The Thouſand years in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. is the ſame with
that of the Womans being in the Wilderneſs, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
being bound, which is plainly on this ſide the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration.
And indeed is preſently after the fall of Pagan
<hi>Rome.</hi> For that Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> was not <hi>Babylon,</hi> or that it is
not faln, I will not believe though you ſhould ſwear it, or
caſt the Glove in Challenge to diſpute it.</p>
               <p>§ 22. XXI. <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and all their Hoſts are to
be in the end of the Thouſand years: But they are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conflagration and Coming of Chriſt: Therefore the
Conflagration and Coming of Chriſt is to be after the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years. In the New Earth will dwell Righteouſneſs,
that is, only Righteouſneſs, and in a Paradiſe ſtate: But
that is inconſiſtent with a numberleſs power of malignant E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
that ſhall compaſs the Holy City.</p>
               <p>§ 23. XXII. You make a ſtrange Expoſition of <hi>John,</hi>
as if he wrote to five of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches as in one World,
and to <hi>Laodicea</hi> the ſeventh in another when this is burnt up
and Chriſt come.</p>
               <p>§ 24. XXIII. When you have almoſt equalled the New
Earth with Heaven, you debaſe it by making it a <hi>Laodicean</hi>
Church, which for Lukewarmneſs God threatneth to ſpew
out, and to take away their Candleſtick? Is this the Paradiſe
World of Righteouſneſs?</p>
               <p>§ 25. XXIV. You make two New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s when
Scripture ſpeaketh but of one after Chriſts Coming: One
you take to be in the Air, and the other on Earth: Though
one Society may be in both, one <hi>Vrbs</hi> or material City can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
ſuch as is deſcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. and 22.</p>
               <p>§ 26. XXV. You feign two Conflagrations: One to
Burn the World, and another after to Burn <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>
and their Followers over the Earth.</p>
               <p>§ 27. XXVI. You groundleſly diſhonour the Kingdom
of Chriſt by confining it to a Thouſand years, which God
hath promiſed ſhall have no End.</p>
               <p>§ 28. XXVII. You diſhonour Chriſt and his Kingdom
by bringing him from his Fathers Right Hand in Heaven, and
placing him and his Saints a Thouſand years in the Air,
where you ſay <hi>wicked Spirits now dwell,</hi> and where Dr. <hi>H.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59413:24"/>
More</hi> ſaith, Good and Bad dwell in an Aerial Vehicle till
they are advanced to an Etherial: Yea where you ſay De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
and Damned Men now dwell with Chriſt; And where
Chriſt muſt exerciſe the greateſt ſelf-denial in leaving that
lower Station.</p>
               <p>§ 29. XXVIII. You make Chriſts Kingdom to be a
humbling loſs to the Saints above, while you take them down
into the Air for a Thousand years, from the Heavenly ſtate
where you ſay they were in God, where Chriſt is at his
Right Hand, as they ſhall be at laſt; or elſe you will make
that Everlaſting Union their loſs.</p>
               <p>§ 30. XXIX. Either you alſo bring down the Angels
from their Glory to dwell in the Air, or elſe you ſeparate them
from Chriſt and the Saints in the Air with him.</p>
               <p>§ 31. XXX. When God hath already continued the old
ſinful World under the Curſe almoſt ſix Thouſand years, you
by Fiction confine the New purified World wherein dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Righteouſneſs to a Thouſand years, and call this the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm.
As if our Reſt muſt be ſo much ſhorter than Sin

And it was Chriſts Viſible Monarchy Reigning by his Vice-Roys,

§ 2. But your fiction that the Scripture aſſigns a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years to Chriſts Reign after the Reſurrection is worſe
than frivolous; a meer forgery; I anſwered it before. If
<hi>Peter</hi> quiet mens over-haſty expectation of Chriſts coming,
by telling them that a Thouſand years time is as nothing to
the Eternal Infinite God; ſhall a man pretend skill in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
and tell us, that he meaneth that Chriſts Reign after
the Reſurrection is meaſured and meant by this Thouſand
years, and is as nothing to the Eternal God.</p>
               <p>And I have proved to you that the Thouſand years in the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> ſpeaketh of no ſuch thing, but of what is done
before the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>For 1. Thoſe Thouſand years are moſt likely to ſignifie
an undetermined time, and mean no more than a Long time;
as Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Cluverus</hi> moſt incline to think (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others.)</p>
               <p>But 2. Granting the contrary, it plainly ſpeaketh of a time
preſently following the feaſting of the Fowls of Heaven with
the fleſh of Kings and Captains, and the Fall of the Pagan
<hi>Babylon.</hi> And not only <hi>Grotius,</hi> but <hi>John Fox</hi> and many others
tell us, that it is the juſt time between the Fall of Pagan
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the beginning of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; which was
about 1300 years.</p>
               <p>3. And this Thouſand years is before the ſuppreſſion of
wickedneſs in the World, while <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are in the
four quarters of the Earth, in number as the Sand of the
Sea; that ſhall go upon the breadth of the Earth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
the Camp of the Saints, the beloved City: And before
the fire that cometh down to devour them. And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
all this is not in the New Earth, wherein dwelleth
Righteouſneſs: So that this Thouſand years ſeemeth to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
but 1. That Apoſtles and Martyrs go to Heaven, 2. And
leave their Names and Doctrine honourable on Earth; 3. And
that the ſurviving Confeſſors ſhall riſe from their perſecuted
ſtate, to triumph with Chriſt in their deliverance and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
on Earth; 4. And that this ſudden Exaltation is a fit
repreſentation of the Glory that they ſhall have perpetually
in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Let any ſober man judge whether this one only mention
of a Thouſand years in a hard Prophecy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. under the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59413:25"/>
expoſitory circumſtances now named, will warrant a man
to Preach a new Goſpel and Kingdom of Chriſt to the
World, without any proof from all the plain words of
Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles, and directly againſt them.</p>
               <p>He that well conſidereth Prophetical Language, will think
that Articles of Faith ſhould be founded on plainer words.
When we read in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall have no Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
for forty years, that <hi>Tyrus</hi> ſhall be no more inhabited,
that <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be no more inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
and abundance the like, we ſhall the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> whoſe very words are much taken out
of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>5. The Devil and the falſe Prophet are caſt into the Lake
of fire after the deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and after the
Thouſand years: But ſure they are caſt into the Lake at the
Reſurrection: For if they ſtay uncondemned a Thouſand
years after that, I know not what Chriſts coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſignifieth: Sure it is not the date of their Execution;
for they are to be tormented for ever and ever: And muſt
they be unſentenced a Thouſand years?</p>
               <p>6. And the Reſurrection is deſcribed as coming after all
this: The Earth and Sea giving up their dead, and the dead
judged out of the Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. And <hi>Ch.</hi> 21. The New Heaven and New Earth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after this Thouſand years, and the deſtruction of the
Enemies; and the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> coming down from God:
And there are yet Kings of the Earth that are to bring their
Glory into it: And there are Nations to be healed with
the Leaves of the Tree of Life; which made Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> and
many others conclude, that it is the glory of the Church on
Earth, that the 21, and 22 Chapters deſcribe: Though it is
moſt probable that it is but as a repreſentation of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Glory: But the Thouſand years is plainly ended before
the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>8. The plain meaning that (Though the Old Serpent will
ſtill be a Tempting Deceiver, both without the Church and
within, yet) as a Dragon or Babyloniſh Conqueror and
Captivater, he ſhall be bound up for a Thouſand years after
the Churches delivery from the Pagan Captivity: And ſo
he was. And yet the Text tells us, that all that while the

                  <hi>Earth</hi> had Nations of Enemies that at laſt were by that Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
drawn to aſſault the Church again. Here is not a word
of a Thouſand years New Earth in which dwelleth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,

The New Earth is mentioned with no ſuch limitation: That's

That all his Kingdom then beginneth, is a falſhood largely
confuted by Chriſts own mouth. And as falſe is it that
the Kingdom of Recovery or Grace, is not given up till a
Thouſand years after the Reſurrection. That this is before
the Kingdom of Eternity, is falſe in any proper ſenſe. If
you mean a Kingdom from Eternity without beginning, you
ſhould prove that ever there was ſuch: Your bare naming it
ſo is no proof. If there were no men from Eternity, then
there was no Kingdom of men. If you mean that which ſhall
endure to Eternity, ſo will Chriſts glorious Kingdom as
Man over Men. For many and many Scriptures tell us, it

<hi>Appearance,</hi> as no Reader can diſcern, but you mean ſuch <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
to Mans <hi>viſive Faculty</hi> in theſe Fleſhly Bodies, as if
now in Heaven Chriſt and Angels, and the Spirits of the Juſt
did not Appear to one another, becauſe they <hi>appear</hi> not to us:
As if the Intuition of Spirits and Spiritual Bodies, were not
a more eminent diſcerning than our Eye-ſight: Sure there is
a more noble ſight, than that of Mortals.</p>
               <p>So no Man can tell by your phraſe of <hi>[ſwallowing up in God]</hi>
and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was from Eternity, and ſhall be to Eternity,
the <hi>Word and Man imbodied,</hi> whether you mean that he was
an Individual Man diſtinct from any others, or the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Soul of the World imbodied in Matter: And by your
talk of our being One in God, as we were before the World
began, none can tell whether you mean that we were Exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or only <hi>in Potentia Creatoris?</hi> And if Exiſtent whether
we were God or parts of God, or individual Souls made from
Eternity for future Bodies, and kept till thoſe Bodies were
made: And whether kept in Revolution from Body to Body?
Or how? And whether we ſhall have a future Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>So your Doctrine of the Hell of the Devils and the Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
can tell no Man whether you think that after the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years they ſhall not be as dead, under meer privation,
ſince you ſay, Catech. p. 5. and 22. <hi>It is a ſtate of deprivation of
Glory, and caſting into the Lake of Fire, ſignifieth, final and utter
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59413:27"/>
ceſſation of all action;</hi> And <hi>that they ſhall not appear</hi> but be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if they have no Action, they have no ſinful
Action, no Self-accuſation, no Intellection, no Malice nor
Revenge, nor Hatred of God and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>So your Doctrine of the Kingdom of Chriſt; I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you ſo notorious an Infidel, as to deny Chriſts Kingdom
in Heaven and Earth, till the Reſurrection: And yet your
words expreſly ſay, that his Kingdom then beginneth: and
that this Apoſtle mentioneth none till then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in your</hi> Late Great Revolution, <hi>Epiſt. in the end, you
ſay,</hi> [His Monarchy ſhall then (1697) begin its Succeſſion,
though the Glorious Inveſtiture ſhall not be till Seventy five years
after.]</p>
               <p>Can any but a Prophet that is inſpired to Expound you, tell
what you mean by abundance ſuch paſſages? What is the
difference between the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Inveſtiture?</hi> What is the <hi>Succeſſion?</hi> Doth it begin the
Thouſand years or not? Doth the Succeſſion begin Seventy
five years before the Inveſtiture? Is not the <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> Chriſts
Glorious Appearance?</p>
               <p>Your Writings make it plain, that you are a good Man of
deep thoughts, faln into a fond eſteem of your new unripe
Conceptions, and rapt up thereby into a diſeaſed Conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and how you will be able to bear it when providence
and experience have confuted you in 1697 I know not: But I
am the more bold to foretel your failing, by my perſwaſion
that your Expoſition of the Revelation which you take for
granted, is a meer miſtake from the Beginning almoſt to
the End.</p>
               <p>And wonder not that no body writeth to confute you
For Men love not to trouble themſelves with Convincing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſingle Man of his Errours. And the Reaſons why I do
attempt it is becauſe by the Seduction of ſome of my Friends,
and the general Inclination of the Antinomian, Anabaptiſt
and Separating Party, to this conceit of the Thouſand years
Kingdom, and by the <hi>Midnight Cry</hi> publiſhed by Mr. <hi>R. M.</hi>
and preached by Mr. <hi>J. M.</hi> Men of very great Piety, whom
I highly value as any Conformiſts I know, I underſtand that
your Opinion that formerly was tolerable as confined to a few
conceited good Men, is now becoming a great Article of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59413:28"/>
their Faith and Religion: Eſpecially ſince I ſee that in all your
profeſſed extraordinary Humility, you brand all that diſſent
from you as Semi-Sadducees of the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and earneſtly
Challenge and provoke all Paſtors and Doctors to anſwer you;
and maintain (though you Conform) that Gods Word

            <head>Chap. III. Of the other Sect of the Millenaries that place
the Thouſand years Reign before the Conflagration.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THis was the Elder Sect: But Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verley,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Creſſoner,</hi> and other late Writers,
being more ſearching, did perceive that this way would not
hold, nor by it could they countenance their Doctrine from
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. the only Text that mentioneth a Thouſand years
Reign (miſunderſtood.)</p>
            <p>§ 2. They agree that, 1. There will be a Thouſand years
Reign on Earth: 2. That the Jews ſhall be called, and make
a glorious part of this Kingdom: 3. That the Ten Tribes
now loſt, ſhall be found, and be part of the Kingdom: 4. That
Turk and Pope ſhall fall before this: 5. That at laſt <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog</hi> ſhall gather in War againſt this New <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> 6. That
fire from Heaven ſhall conſume theſe Enemies.</p>
            <p>§ 3. But they agree not, 1. Of the ſtate of the Church
with Chriſt above all this time. 2. Nor whether there be one
or two New <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> (one above, and one below.) 3. Nor
whether Chriſt ſhall Reign on Earth viſibly in his Humane
Nature, or only by a holy Magiſtracy and Miniſtry? 4. Nor
whether all or moſt of the Jews ſhall go dwell at the Old
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Judea,</hi> or ſtay in the ſeveral Countries where
they live? 5. Nor how far the Princes and Nations among
whom they live ſhall be converted with them? 6. Nor by

and that which burneth <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> make one or two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59413:28"/>
Conflagrations? 11. Nor how far Chriſts Kingdom ceaſeth
at the end of the Thouſand years?</p>
            <p>§ 4. As to both Sects, I know no more that I have further
to do for their full confutation, but I. To give a better Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe
of the Revelation than their feigned ſuppoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
And that I have done in a Book not yet Printed.</p>
            <p>II. To prove that the Ten Tribes were but part of them
carried away by <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> and that they were in <hi>Cyrus</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and had leave as well as the Two Tribes to return
if they were willing: And that <hi>Galilee</hi> and other parts of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> as much owned Chriſt as the Two Tribes, at leaſt: And
the Twelve Tribes made up the Converts that were the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of the Chriſtian Churches: And that it was to the
Twelve that <hi>James, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> wrote:
And it was the Twelve that the 144000 <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. were ſealed
out of, ſo expreſly diſtinguiſhed from the innumerable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Chriſtians, as may confute the Expoſitors, that make them
to ſignifie the Gentile Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>III. To prove that at the Fall of the Pagan Empire, the
Fulneſs of the Gentiles came in, as meant <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and all
<hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaved: That near three Millions of the Jews that were
curſed Infidels, being killed and ruined by <hi>Titus, Trajan</hi> and
<hi>Adrian</hi> (out of a Countrey not ſo big as half <hi>England)</hi> and
the Chriſtians eſcaping, the Chriſtian part remained the main
Body of the Nation: And marrying with Gentile Chriſtians,
and forſaking <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, loſt the name of Jews, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
only with the Off-ſpring of the ſcattered Infidels.
That <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made <hi>Judea</hi> one of the moſt famous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional-Provincial
Churches in the World, for Honours,
Temples, Monaſteries and Biſhops, no Jews being forbidden
there to dwell. And that God hath promiſed no further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the curſed remnant of the Infidel Jews, than of
any other Infidel Nations: And therefore all Chriſtians
ſhould not in ignorance of all this, corrupt their Prayers, and
Sermons, and Religion, with fathering on God ſuch Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Jews Converſion as he never made, leſt they be
found guilty of adding to his Word, and taking his Name in
vain, and ſcandalous depraving the Chriſtian Faith. Nor
ſhould they by ignorance unthankfully deny the performance
of Gods Promiſes, of the Fall of the Pagan Empire and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59413:29"/>
and ſo much of the Fifth Monarchy, and New <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and Converſion of the Jews, as certain Hiſtory puts us
paſt doubt is already paſt.</p>
            <p>The performance of this, to avoid prolixity, I ſhall but
briefly give you as followeth.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>Chap. IV. That the Ten Tribes of Iſrael, will never be
found and called, if they never were ſo heretofore.</head>
            <p>§ 1. THoſe that are for a Jewiſh Monarchy, or their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Converſion, commonly hold that the Ten
Tribes carried away by <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> are loſt, and never yet
reſtored. Whether this be true, we ſhall ſee anon. But if
it were true, it would follow, that they never will be found
and called, and conſequently that they will be no part of the
Converted Jews.</p>
            <p>§ 2. The proof is evident: Becauſe the Accident ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a Subject: That which <hi>is not,</hi> hath no Accident. There
<hi>are</hi> no ſuch Ten Tribes unknown and uncalled exiſtent in
the World. None will ſay that any ſuch are known: And
that's enough to prove them unknown, and if unknown, not
in being.</p>
            <p>For 1. If the Infidel part of the Two Tribes be as many
as ſuch think, how much more numerous muſt all the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Ten Tribes be?</p>
            <p>2. And Navigations, Travelling, and Merchandize, and
Embaſſies, have acquainted Men with ſo much of the Earth,
as tells us that they are not known in any known part of the
World: And were they Exiſtent they could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s Itinerary that feigneth a diſcovery of them,
proveth it ſelf fabulous, and is ſo accounted commonly by
ſober learned Men. And dreaming that they are in <hi>America</hi>
is no proof.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Learned Mr. <hi>Sam. Lee,</hi> well deſcribeth many of the
places to which they were tranſplanted, and very learnedly
ſtretcheth his Wit to conjecture that they are in <hi>Tartary:</hi>
But 1. There is not any probability given us by him that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59413:29"/>
ever they were thither removed, [at leaſt any notable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.]
2. And though <hi>Tartary</hi> be large, and not all fully
known to us, yet ſo much is diſcovered by Hiſtorians and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
as may acquaint us that there is extant no Society of
known and profeſſed Jews; they being all Heathens and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,
ſave an inconſiderable ſprinkling of Chriſtians:
And <hi>Scythia</hi> hath been ſo anciently peopled, that even to the
Potent <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they were the moſt Invincible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
And the Wars of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> made them known to
much of the World. And if they were there, and Marrying
with <hi>Scythians</hi> have loſt the Name of Jews, they are unreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably
Extinct. And ſo cannot be called as Jews, being
now no Jews. It is become a Natural Impoſſiblity.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="chapter">
            <head>Chap. V. That the Ten Tribes were not loſt, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.</head>
            <p>§ 1. 1. THis is ſo clear by abundance of Propheſies in
<hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel, Hoſea,</hi> that it
would be tedious to recite them; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>
were to be again made one Kingdom, as two Sticks made
one Stick, and <hi>David</hi> their King to reign over them: If this
was not fulfilled, the Propheſie would fail, which muſt not
be imagined: For (as is aforeſaid) if it be not fulfilled, they
being now extinct, and not exiſtent, it never can be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
            <p>§ 2. 2. There is no probability (as Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> hath well
noted in his <hi>Diatriba)</hi> that all or moſt of the common people
were tranſplanted; but only the Rulers, and Rich, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and Leading Men. For 1. Conſidering how many
Millions that ſmall Land maintained, it is improbable that
ſo great a multitude could be ſo far Ruled by an Army, or
that they ſhould ſoon find vacant Habitations, and Victuals
for them. 2. And it is more unlikely that <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> ſhould
find ſo many of his Subjects to ſend into their places, and that
all thoſe ſhould be willing of a removal into ſo ſmall a Land.
3. And it is known that no ſuch thing hath been done by
Conquerours in any other Land. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> took from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59413:30"/>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> none but the Princes, Nobles, Prieſts, Rich Men,
Souldiers, and Men fit for his Militia, and Smiths, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he left the common people to Manure the
Land: Otherwiſe they would loſe all their Tribute, and the
Fruit of the Ground.</p>
            <p>In all the Conqueſts made by the Perſians, the Greeks, the
Romans, the Egyptians, the Saracens, the Turks, the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians
by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> there hath no ſuch thing been done, as
the tranſplanting of the moſt of the common Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Indeed the beggarly Goths, and Vandals, Oſtrogaths and
<hi>Hemli, &amp;c.</hi> came with their Wives and Children ſometimes,
reſolving to poſſeſs or die: But what was a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of ſuch to all <hi>Italy</hi> when they poſſeſt it; or to all <hi>Spain,</hi>
or all <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Africk,</hi> in compariſon of the Inhabitants
whom they ſubdued and maſtered?</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> how few were the Romans, yea or the Saxons,
or the Danes, or the Normans, in compariſon of the <hi>Britains</hi>
that were brought in ſubjection unto them? It was but the
Great men, and Rich, and Military, and ſome fearful people
that fled from their Armies, that fled into <hi>Wales.</hi> As Mr. <hi>Tho.
Jones</hi> in his <hi>Hearts Soveraignty</hi> hath truly proved, the main
Body of this Nation called Engliſh, is of the Brittiſh Bllod
(it's like many hundred to one) though the Language fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the ruling part.</p>
            <p>§ 3. 3. It is evident that All the Twelve Tribes were
in the Dominion of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when he ſent the Jews to repair
the Temple and City: The Two Tribes at <hi>Babylon</hi> where he
made <hi>Darius</hi> King, and the Ten in his Hereditary Dominions
and his Conqueſts, as Mr. <hi>Calvet</hi> in his <hi>Naphthali</hi> hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and as will appear by the Topography of the places
named in Scripture, to which they were carried, Learnedly
opened by Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> abating his conceit of <hi>Tartary.</hi> And it is
evident that <hi>Cyrus</hi> meant not to confine the grant of his free
return to the Two Tribes: But thoſe that were not willing
to return he did not compel: And moſt had poſſeſſion by
that time of wider and fatter Habitations. <hi>Ezra 1. Cyrus</hi>
made no queſtion of their liberty to dwell in <hi>Judea:</hi> But it
was Gods Houſe at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that God charged him to Build,
for which end he ſaith, <hi>ver. 3. [Who is among you of all his
people, his God be with him, and let him go up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59413:30"/>
is in</hi> Judah, <hi>and Build the Houſe of the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>(he
is the God) which is at</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>And whoſoever remaineth in
any place where he Sojourneth, let the Men of his place lift him up
with Silver, and with Gold, and with Goods, and with Beaſts,</hi> &amp;c.
Were the Ten Tribes none of <hi>the people of the God of</hi> Iſrael?
I muſt not ſwell this Book too big: Let the Reader that is
willing to underſtand, peruſe <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah, Eſther,</hi> and
<hi>Daniel,</hi> with <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and conſider the Grants
of <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and the vaſt number of Jews ſtill
remaining abroad in the perſecution of <hi>Haman,</hi> and he will
find that it was not for want of Liberty to return that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtayed behind, but becauſe the avoided returning as a
Suffering: And multitudes that had a Zeal for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
ſettled in <hi>Egypt</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that thence they might three
times a year come to the Temple, without too much loſs and
coſt.</p>
            <p>§ 4. 4. In Chriſts time the Habitations of the Ten Tribes
was of the ſame Religion with thoſe at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And went
thither to the Feaſts; and ſubmitted to their Prieſts and
Ceremonies; Chriſt lived from his Childhood ſtill in <hi>Galilee:</hi>
At <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where <hi>Peter, Andrew, James</hi> and
<hi>John</hi> lived: That is, cloſe by the Ford of <hi>Jordan,</hi> by which
is the paſſage to <hi>Egypt:</hi> There he had far more Followers
than about <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Thence went his ſuppoſed Father, and
Brethren ordinarily to the Feaſts at <hi>Jeruſalem: Zechary</hi> and
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> many Levites, Scribes and Phariſees dwell in the
Countrey of the Ten Tribes: Though <hi>Samaria</hi> about the
place of Worſhip, by Cuſtoms kept up ſome Animoſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet the Woman, <hi>John</hi> 4. could ſay, <hi>When
the Meſſiah cometh he will tell us all things: And is not this the
Chriſt:</hi> And what place ſo generally received the Goſpel
when <hi>Philip</hi> preached to them? It was not for nothing that
the Chriſtians were ſo long called Galileans. But this and
more ſhall next be proved.</p>

            <head>Chap. VI. What Converſion the Twelve Tribes have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
had?</head>
            <p>§ 2. 1. AS is aforeſaid, The Saviour himſelf (and his
Apoſtles) choſe his abode on Earth among
them; and calleth them the loſt Sheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
and the Children whoſe Bread muſt not be given to Dogs:
They were the Circumciſion to whom he was a Miniſter:
He ordinarily Preached in their Synagogues, and there
wrought moſt of his Miracles: It was they that cryed him
as King with <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s: It was they that followed him to
the Croſs; and it was in <hi>Galilee</hi> where on a Mountain he
appointed them to meet him after his Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>§ 2. 2. He appointed (not two, but) Twelve Apoſtles,
and 70 Diſciples, as ſuited to the Twelve Tribes and their
Sanedrim, to ſhew what Form of Government he aſſigned
them, and for whom, and he ſent his Apoſtles to the
Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. 3. The chief ſucceſs of their Preaching was on the
Samaritans and others of the Ten Tribes; and ſuch of them
as came up to the Feaſts.</p>
            <p>§ 4. 4. There were three thouſand at once converted of
the Jews; after made five thouſand; and ſoon after many
Myriads of Jews believed (at leaſt many thouſands.)</p>
            <p>§ 5. 5. Theſe became the Mother-Church, and the Law
went out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and ſo all Nations were bleſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
Seed, and Chriſt became a Light to the Gentiles, and the
Glory of his People <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The ſcattered Jews of the
Twelve Tribes through much of the Empire, were the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi>
or Rudiments of the Gentile Churches: The Apoſtles
firſt Preached in their Synagogues, and the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
were added to their Converts.</p>
            <p>§ 6. 6. The Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </hi> was written to all
the Hebrew Chriſtians, and not to Two Tribes only; and
implieth the great ſucceſs of the Goſpel on them.</p>
            <p>§ 7. 7. <hi>Peter</hi> directeth his Epiſtle to all the Strangers
ſcattered through <hi>Pontus, Aſia, Galatia, Phrygia,</hi> &amp;c. and
magnifieth their Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59413:31"/>
§ 8. 8. <hi>James</hi> directeth his Epiſtle to <hi>the Twelve Tribes,
that are ſcatter'd abroad:</hi> And it is evident that he writeth to
them as Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>§ 9. 9. The ſeventh Chapter of the <hi>Revelations</hi> expreſly
nameth the Twelve Tribes, of which One Hundred and
Forty four Thouſand were Sealed, Twelve Thouſand of
each Tribe (meaning a great number) that were to be
preſerved from the Deſtruction that was to be executed
on their Enemies. The boldneſs of thoſe Expoſitors
who give us their own Revelation inſtead of Chriſts, is
palpable: who tell us that by theſe One Hundred and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four Thouſand is meant all the Reformed that are ſaved
from the deſtruction to be executed on the Papiſts? What
words can we deſire God to uſe more plain, that Men may
not pervert? 1. God ſpeaketh of Jews, and they ſay he
meaneth Gentiles. 2. God nameth the Tribes, and they
exclude them. 3. They are called <hi>[The Firſt Fruits]</hi> of the
Church:<note place="margin">Rev. 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Gentile Chriſtians that with them partaked of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
are by way of diſtinction mentioned in the next
words: Yet theſe Commentators ſay, That the Gentiles are
meant by the Twelve Tribes. 5. The Propheſie is put in
the beginning before the Trumpets or Vials, even before all

Chriſtians could be ſatisfied to let go their Priviledge of
Peculiarity and Moſaick Policy, and to Embody on equal
Terms with the Gentiles in the Catholick Church, and to
Marry with Gentile Chriſtians: And all that time Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>

Cities one Church of Jews and one of Gentiles; which alſo
difference of Language would require; and ſo had two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

            <p>§ 11. 11. At the Wars of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> againſt the
Jews, One Million and One Hundred Thouſand were kill'd,
and Seven Hundred Thouſand carried into Captivity; and
the Chriſtians fore-warned by Chriſt, got out of the City
and eſcaped. And in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s days a Madneſs ſeized on the
Infidel Jews, and they roſe up and Murdered many ſcore
Thouſands of the <hi>Roman</hi> Subjects: And after <hi>Barchocheba</hi>
proclaimed himſelf the Meſſiah, Murdered ſo many more as
amounted to an Hundred Thouſands: VVhereupon <hi>Trajan</hi>
and <hi>Adrian</hi> in Revenge kill'd between One and Two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theſe Rebel Jews, ſtill ſparing the Chriſtians. After
all this, the Infidel Jews could have but a ſmall number left:
All <hi>London</hi> hath not near a Million. By which it appeareth
that the main Body of the Jews preſerved, were the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to whom the Curſed part were few.</p>
            <p>§ 12. 12. The Converted Jews fell into the Catholick
Church, and Married with Gentile Chriſtians, and ſo ere
long loſt the name of Jews, and became unknown.</p>
            <p>So that the ſcattered Relicks now called Jews are but the
Off-ſpring of the Self-curſed Rabble that were ſcattered after
the aforeſaid ſlaughter of them.</p>
            <p>§ 13. 13. In <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Reign the Jews had as much
Liberty and Invitation to be Chriſtians as any others: And
<hi>Judea</hi> was not only made a National-Provincial Church, but
was more honoured for Chriſts ſake than any Nation no
greater, ſave the Imperial Seat. There were more Churches
Built, and more Monaſteries, and more Biſhops, than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
in ſo ſmall a compaſs: No Jew was forbidden there
to live. No Countrey ſo honoured: The Devout People
from <hi>Rome</hi> and many Countreys went thither, ſome on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
and ſome to dwell: Thence they fetcht what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
they could get in remembrance of Chriſt. There at
<hi>Bethlehem Jerom</hi> lived while he wrote and ſtudied much of his
Works.</p>
            <p>§ 14. 14. Since then in all Ages ſome of the Infidel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks

(which few judicious Men believe) in all Ages many Jews
have been Baptized, and ſome proved excellent Divines.</p>
            <p>§ 15. 15. When all the Ten Kingdoms that had been
Tributary or Subject to the Pagan Empire, ſo quickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the ſucceſs of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the Chriſtian Arms, and
turned againſt the Pagan Idolatry, it is utterly incredible that
multitudes of the Infidel Jews did not the ſame. No one
Nation turned all at once: And no one National Church
under Heaven were all (that I ſay not the moſt) ſincerely
holy Chriſtians: The viſible Church ſtill conſiſted moſtly of
temporizing Men, that came in to Chriſtianity for worldly
Intereſt, over-awed by Chriſtian Power: Till it came to
this, the Chriſtians were a perſecuted party, and no National
Church. And the unbelieving Jews were not like to be ſo
free from the Love of the Fleſh and VVorld, as not to do
as others did. Chriſt Riding victoriouſly on the VVhite
Horſe, and Conquering his Enemies, brought the Nations
to Submiſſion, after he had by the Word and Martyrdom
purified to himſelf a holy Generation. As all the <hi>Revelation</hi>
fully telleth us. Therefore if <hi>Judea</hi> was not made a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church, no other Nation was made ſuch.</p>

good repute, that divers of my Friends diſſwade me from

Reaſons of my diſſent to the tryal of wiſer Men.</p>
            <p>§ 2. 1. It belongeth to the Affirmers to produce their
proofs: But I can find no Text cited by them, that to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

<hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>David</hi> their King, and the Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing
their own Land, and the Subjection of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

paſſages, that cannot be applyed to any ſuch time and uſe as
this in queſtion, but plainly ſpeak of their return from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and their following ſtate. It would too much ſwell
my Book to try and vindicate all the particular Texts
Mr. <hi>James Calvert,</hi> having already done it in his <hi>Naphthali,</hi>

with the remote, and ſet not one againſt the other, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59413:36"/>
parts and degrees that make up the whole. Many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
in the Pſalms are ſpoken immediately of <hi>David,</hi> but
as he was a Type of Chriſt, in whom they were though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely
yet chiefly fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The Propheſies of the honour of the Jews, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration,
had divers degrees of fulfilling. 1. They were
primarily fulfilled in the return from Captivity, and the
Power that followed under <hi>Zorubbabel</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
2. They were further fulfilled by the Coming of the Meſſiah,
of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> in whom all the Nations
of the Earth are bleſſed. 3. They were further fulfilled at
Chriſts Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Effuſion of the Holy
Ghoſt, and the many Thouſands of them Converted; And
their ſpreading the Goſpel over the Gentile World. 4. It
was yet more fulfilled when Dominion was given to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the fulneſs of the Gentiles brought in all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
ſettled a National Church in <hi>Judea,</hi> and put all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in ſubjection to the Catholick Church of Jewiſh and
Gentile Chriſtians, reconciled in one Body, the partition
Wall being broken down 5. It will be yet more fulfilled
in the New Heaven and Earth; under the Goſpel there is
neither Circumciſion not Uncircumciſion, but Chriſt is All
and in All: How much more in the New World?</p>
            <p>He that would promiſe to redeem Chriſtians from Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Captivity, and reſtore them to their own Land, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and honour them there if they will obey him, muſt not
be thought to confound the ſeveral benefits and degrees of
this Promiſe: He that will lead you into an upper Chamber,
includeth every ſtep of the Stairs that you aſcend; and the
promiſe of helping you up the firſt ſtep, includeth not the
laſt, but tendeth to it, and if you obey will lead you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>4. Read the Book of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and other Hiſtory,
that you may not be ignorant of what is already done: For

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59413:35"/>

            <p>1. God caſt not away the <hi>fore-known Elect, v.</hi> 1, 2, to 11.</p>
            <p>2. Through their Fall and Infidelity, perſecuting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
from among them, the Goſpel came to the Gentiles,
<hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>3. It was but <hi>ſome</hi> of the Branches that were broken off,
<hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>4. As the caſting away of them was the converting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
of the Pagan World; ſo their receiving was as a
Reſurrection of life from the dead, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>5. The Converted Gentiles were but grafted in among
them, and partakers with them, (and not without them) of
the fatneſs of the Olive, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>6. Not the Root, but the ſome Branches that were broken
off, was that we might be grafted in, <hi>v.</hi> 19. It was chiefly
the Prieſts, and Rulers, and the ſelf-curſed Rabble that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, and yet ſome Prieſts and Phariſees were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>7. If they continue not in Gods Goodneſs, the Gentiles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſhall be broken off, <hi>v.</hi> 22. So much of conditionality is in
the Promiſe: And yet there is more Scripture to expect that
the Gentiles ſhall not be broken off, than that there ſhall be
any more National Converſion of the Jews.</p>
            <p>8. The promiſe of reſtoring the broken Branches is, If
they continue not in unbelief, <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>9. Yet here is a Prophecy that the Jews ſhall be eminently
replanted, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and not for ever left in general unbelief.</p>
            <p>10. It was but blindneſs in part that happened to thoſe
ſome, till the fulneſs of the Gentiles came in: Which muſt
either mean, till the Empire of the Roman World fell into
the Chriſtians hands: Or elſe till all the Gentiles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
that ever ſhall be: This laſt cannot be the meaning,
for then it would not be till the end of the World; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt be the former, which is long fulfilled, <hi>v.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>11. So all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſaved, that is, 1. All the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of
God, the believing Children of <hi>Abraham (for all are not</hi> Iſrael
<hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael,) gathered into one Catholick Body. 2. And
ſo many of Natural <hi>Iſrael</hi> as to make not only one of the two
Witneſſes and Olive Trees, but alſo a formed National ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
Church-Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59413:35"/>
12. When to drive away the Goſpel to the Gentiles ſome
were left in unbelief: The Elect part were they that were
beloved for their Father <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake, (much more for
Chriſts ſake,) <hi>v.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>13. As it was from them that the Gentiles had the Goſpel;
ſo it was from the Gentiles mercy that the reſtored Body of
the Jews obtained mercy, being by the Chriſtian Emperors
and Princes reſtored and honoured, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30.</p>
            <p>14. God left the Rulers and many others in unbelief, that
he might recover (not each ſingle perſon, but) a Political
Body and Power to the Nation as he did, <hi>v.</hi> 32. As <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Severus</hi> gave the Infidel Jews power to chuſe them a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of their own (under him) the Chriſtian Emperors
did for the Chriſtian Jews much more.</p>
            <p>15. Thus is Gods Goodneſs and Severity glorified: And
what word in that Chapter proper to the Jews is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled?</p>
            <p>§ 4. As to the Texts that mention the <hi>Reſtitution of all
things,</hi> the Creatures groaning to be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of corruption, drinking the fruit of the Vine new, and
ſuch like; what word is in all this that reſpecteth the Jews
more than the Gentiles, or that may not be performed in
the New World, unlimited to Jews, or to a Thouſand
years?</p>
            <p>§ 5. The ſame I ſay of the Lords Prayer, <hi>Let thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
come, &amp;c.</hi> which long made me hope for better days
on this ſame Earth: But this ſaith nothing more of the
Jews than of the Heathens. And who can here find any
limitation of this Kingdom to a Thouſand years? All the
Word that tells us what to pray for, doth not tell us what
in this World we ſhall obtain. I doubt not but we may pray
for Jews and all men, but that proveth not all ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and ſaved: We may have hope of many Individual
Jews, when we have no promiſe of a National further Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the many more than of any others.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I hinted this oft before; I will not ſhun repetition where
the cauſe requireth it.</p>
            <p>1. It is granted that the Catholick Church is called <hi>The
New Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo far as it is ſhort of the other World: But
the Catholick Church, and therein the Jewiſh Nation, was
more gloriouſly ſet up by the Chriſtian Empire, than the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenaries,
can reaſonably expect or plead for: 1. What are
a few Rabble Jews, ſuch as are among us, to the great, rich,
victorious Roman Empire, the greateſt that ever was on
Earth, which turned Chriſtian in the Regent part, and ſhortly
in the commoneſt Profeſſion? What an Empire would the
Jews of <hi>England, Spain, Portugal, Turky, &amp;c.</hi> make?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was then called not only <hi>New-Rome,</hi> but
<hi>New-Sion:</hi> And how greatly did it excel <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs,
riches, power and glory?</p>
            <p>3. How ſmall and barren a ſpot was <hi>Judea,</hi> (like our
<hi>Wales)</hi> in compariſon of the Roman Chriſtian Empire, in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa?</hi> Like the <hi>Iſle of Man</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. How great a Protection had the Jews under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
and following Emperours, above what they had even after
their Reſtoration from Captivity, from <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and the
<hi>Maccabees</hi> to the end of their Policy.</p>
            <p>5. What could they now deſire for their return more than
they then had? What greater liberty, or encouragement, or
help? An exceſs of Honour was put on their Countrey, and
on all that would come into the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>6. What better Plantation of Religion can be expected in
<hi>Judea,</hi> than was when the Emperours built them Temples,
and devout people travelled thither, and dwelt there, and
bought them Bibles, and built them Religious Houſes, and
ſet over them Paſtors, and Biſhops, and A. Biſhops, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59413:38"/>
one of the five in the Empire? And their National
Church honourably united to the Catholick? What outward
honour can they expect more? All Proteſtants note it as the
wicked Superſtition of the Popes, that they were ſo ſet on the
honouring of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> called <hi>The Holy Land,</hi> that
they forced Emperours, and Kings (of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England, &amp;c.)</hi>
at vaſt charges to go fight for it, to the loſs of 100000 men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 2. Obj.</hi> But <hi>Judea</hi> was not all planted with Jews, but with
a mixt people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. And muſt all that now poſſeſs it be robbed of their
Habitations and Eſtates, to make room for our Jews? 2. There
were no Jews reſtrained from going thither that deſired it:
And would you have them forced, or ſent thither with a
Paſs? 3. Thoſe that would not go thither had better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
where they dwelt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 3. Obj.</hi> But it was not the main Body of the Nation
that was converted and reſtored.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I have given great probability that it was the far
greateſt part, ſo many of the Rebels had been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
2. There was no Heathen Nation where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
number preſently turned Chriſtians, till Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
prevailed with them: Even till the days of <hi>Alari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>

And holy <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his days in the glory of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
reckoned but of a hundred thouſand Chriſtians, beſides
Separatiſts and Hereticks, the reſt being Heathens and Jews;
ſhall we therefore ſay that ſuch were no National Churches,
that is, Chriſtian Kingdoms?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 4. Obj.</hi> But while their Governours were ſet over them
by others, and not choſen by themſelves, they could not be called

the Souldiers and Magiſtrates were. The Inhabitant
Chriſtians Jews and Gentiles choſe them. 2. Their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and conſent might make them Churches of Jews. 3. But
I confeſs they were not, nor ever muſt be, Churches of Jews
ſeparate from the Gentiles, or otherwiſe than as parts of the
Catholick United Church. It ſeems you take not the Jews

§ 5. II. The Doctrine of the Jews Converſion as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
a Policy or Monarchy of Jews as ſuch, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
and therefore impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Is there any room then for any further diſpute of it?</p>
            <p>When there are no Jews, there cannot poſſibly be any
Kingdom or Common-wealth of Jews: But were the ſelf-curſed
Progeny converted, they would be no Jews imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
in a Religious ſenſe, nor within ſixty or eighty years
in a natural ſenſe.</p>
            <p>1. A Converted Jew joyneth himſelf to the Catholick
Church, and knoweth that this is his advancement,
above the old ſeparate ſtate of Peculiarity, and knoweth
that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law and Policy is ended; and that if he turn
to that Law, he falls from Grace, and if he be (Jewiſhly)
Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit him nothing: Therefore he
is no more a Jew in Religion.</p>
            <p>2. And being a Catholick Chriſtian, he will marry with
Gentile Catholicks, and not confine Marriage to thoſe of
his own Nation, to keep up the ſeparation. And ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a ſhort time there would be no Natural Jews. For inſtance;
If <hi>A</hi> marry <hi>B,</hi> a Gentile Chriſtian, their Children will be
but half Jews: If their Children marry Gentile Chriſtians,
their Children will be but a quarter Jews: And if thoſe
marry Gentile Chriſtians, their Children will be but an
eighth part of Jewiſh Race; that is, no Jews at all: Thus it
is faln out with the Progeny of all their converted Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.
I have ſince I was twenty four years Old, lived in the
houſe with the Mother of the Grandmother of the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
of ſome now living. And if I have ſeen between
24 and 76 ſo many Generations, in how ſhort a time would
Converted Jews be no Jews?</p>
            <p>§ 6. III. And the deſire of ſuch a Jewiſh Converſion,
State and Kingdom, or Church, as ſhould continue them in
a Jewiſh Line and Peculiarity, diſtinct from the Catholick
mixed Church, is a <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and contrary to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Chriſtianity, and the Kingdom and Deſign of Chriſt:
For Chriſt came to take down the Partition Wall, Middle
Wall, and make of two one new man, even both one, (no
longer two:) Here is neither Greek nor Jew, Circumciſion
nor Uncircumciſion, Barbarian, Scythian, Bond or Free, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59413:39"/>
Chriſt is All, and in All, of whom the whole Family in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth is named, and will have all to grow up to one
perfect man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. &amp; 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. Will Chriſt now turn
againſt his own uniting Deſign and Kingdom, and ſet up
<hi>Moſes</hi> again and his Policy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 7. Obj.</hi> But we do not hold that he ſhall ſet up <hi>Moſes</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Law, or Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor if you are Chriſtians, ſhould you ſay, that
he will turn again the one United Body into two, and by
reſtoring the carnal Peculiarity, to ſet up again the Wall
of Separation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 8. Obj.</hi> But if Engliſh, French, Spaniards, &amp;c. may be ſtill
diſtinct, why may not Jews and Gentiles?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe <hi>One</hi> is but accidentally and mutably, from
the difference of Countreys and Habitation, and of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and Trading, and Government, which Chriſt came
not to unite: But the other is on pretence of a Religious
Truſt on a Divine Gift of Peculiarity, ſetting them up above
the reſt of the Church, which Chriſt came to take down,
and tendeth to Church Diviſions.</p>
            <p>§ 9. IV. So hardly were the firſt Converted Jews taken
off their conceit of Peculiarity, and acknowledging Catholick
Equality of the Gentiles, and ſuch doleful Hereſies and
Breaches were made by this Pride, that it is not ſafe tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to it again.</p>
            <p>§ 10. V. It ſeemeth a Carnal Imputation of the moſt
Holy God; as if he made under the Goſpel ſo great an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of one ſort of People by their peculiar Birth-priviledge,
above all the reſt of the World. When <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that
All Believers are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, and that he is not a
Jew that is one outwardly, nor that Circumciſion which is
of the fleſh. And the Jews are ſo far from being of any
better nature or deſert than other men, that the Infidel part
have ever ſince their ſelf-curſing and obdurateneſs in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
been found in all Nations to be the moſt covetous,
treacherous, and ſottiſh ſort of People: Much unprepared
for ſo great a change.</p>
            <p>§ 11. VI. Either All the Off-ſpring of the Jews ſhall be
partakers of this pretended Priviledge and Monarchy, or only
the Off-ſpring of thoſe that continued Infidels till the change.

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59413:41"/>
But neither of theſe can be true. 1. The Off-ſpring of all
that have been converted for fourteen hundred years after
Chriſt, cannot poſſibly now be made any parts of a Jewiſh
Monarchy or State: Becauſe they are all unknown, and are
now no Jews: And ſo that it is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>2. And to advance only the preſent profligate Generation,
to a ſeparate Monarchy, excluding all the Off-ſpring of the
Converts of all former Ages, looks ſo ſtrangely, that the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
had need to bring good proof of it, conſidering the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of quality and number, that the leaſt and worſt part
ſhall be chiefly advanced.</p>
            <p>§ 12. VII. Either in this Jewiſh advancement, all the
reſt of the Godly through the World ſhall be as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
or the Jews alone. If all the Godly, they being I
hope a Thouſand to one Jew, why ſhould it be called a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or Monarchy? Then ſure, this New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
muſt be ſetled in all Kingdoms, where the Godly dwell:
And ſhall they every where be Lords? If it be only for the
Jews, can any but a Jew believe it? That the Off-ſpring of
the ſcattered, curſed, ſottiſh Enemies of Chriſt, ſhall be ſo
much preferred before all the Godly through the World?</p>
            <p>§ 13. VIII. Either all the Nations of Heathens, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
Papiſts, and Ungodly-Ones, ſhall be Converted,
with the Jews, or not: If yea, it will be a New and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
World indeed: A Bleſſed Change will be made on Kings,
and Parliaments, and Lords, and Rich Men, and Poor:
And there will be as many Miracles as Men, when all thoſe
ſhall be made wiſe and holy, that we cannot now with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years preaching prevail with to be Men, and to ceaſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,
and beſtial Luſts: Sure God will not Burn ſuch a
Bleſſed World, and bury ſo many Millions of Miracles in
the Flames.</p>
            <p>But if it be only the Jews, that are miraculouſly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it muſt be a Miracle that muſt cauſe the malignant
Princes and People, Heathens, Mahometans, Greeks, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and Carnal Proteſtants, either to become Subjects to
theſe poor Jews where they dwell, or to help or permit
their Tranſportation to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then to be ſubject to
them there: If this muſt be their Fate, why do we not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
our ſelves with thoſe few curſed Enemies of Chriſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59413:41"/>
that live in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>Wapping,</hi> or elſewhere near us, and
honour them, and beg their favour againſt the time of their
Reign. <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> appointed a Solemn diſpute before
him, whether the Jews (for Money) ſhould have a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and when that good Man Dr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin,</hi> and ſome
other godly Independents had ſpoken much for it, <hi>Matthew
Newcomen</hi> (that holy Man) ſo opened the wickedneſs of
turning looſe a Curſed Generation to tempt a Nation to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
that is already too much inclined thereto, as turned
the Scales, and put an end to that deliberation.</p>
            <p>§14. IX. Either the feigned Converſion of theſe Jews
will be before the burning of the World, or after: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before nor after: Therefore not at all.</p>
            <p>1. If it be Before, either it will be the Thouſand years
Reign, or ſome part of the Thouſand years Reign, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffore
it all.</p>
            <p>If it be the Thouſand years Reign, then 1. The World
muſt laſt yet a Thouſand year after the Jews Converſion:
Which few believe. 2. And then there will be no Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years Reign after the Conflagration, which our chief
Millenaries will not endure: For there is but One Thouſand
years Reign looked for by them. 3. And then the New <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
ſtate ſhall have the numberleſs Enemies of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> And ſhall fall to a Laodicean Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs: What! After ſo many Millions of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?</p>
            <p>2. But if they ſay it will be After the burning of the
World, that is before diſproved: For the Thouſand years are
paſt before that Conflagration. <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and the
numberleſs Enemies will not ſurvive the Burning, nor live
in the New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>3. And if they ſay that it will be but ſome part of the
Thouſand years, or a ſhort time before the Conflagration.
1. The Thouſand years will not be divided, part before the
Burning, and part in the next World. 2. And ſo ſhort a
Reign of the Jews, as ſhall end before the Thouſand years,
and Burning, will not anſwer the glorious preparation of ſo
many Millions of Miracles, nor the Doctrine of their ſo
ſpeedy Apoſtaſie after, as to prepare for the <hi>Incendium.</hi>

§15. X. The Miracles muſt be ſo many and great, that
muſt go to the feigned Converſion and Exaltation of theſe
Jews, that it will be a great and heinous crime to impoſe
them on God by preſumptuous Fiction, if the Truth of
them be not proved; 1. As to the number of Converts.
2. Their preſent unfitneſs. 3. Their ſcattered diſtance.
4. Their Servitude in all Nations. 5. The feigned way of
their Converſion. 6. The ſtate of their feigned Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
All theſe muſt be ſo full of Miracles, that will a
thouſand-fold exceed all the Miracles that ever Chriſt did on
Earth, or his Apoſtles after him. And God keepeth ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
a tenor in his Eſtabliſhed Order of working by means
and ſubordinate Cauſes, as that we muſt have good proof
before we ſay that he will do all this. Tell us not <hi>what God
can do,</hi> when our Queſtion is, <hi>what he will do.</hi> God can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the World without the Sun, or make all the frame
of Heaven and Earth to change their courſe: God can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Turk and Pope, and all the Heathens in the World,
and all the bloody Princes and Souldiers, to morrow. But do
not therefore ſay that He will do it. When the Devil
tempted Chriſt to ſhew his power by a Miracle, he ſaith,
<hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath appointed a quite contrary way for mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
<hi>Rom. 10. How ſhall they believe on him of whom they
have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? and
how ſhall they Preach unleſs they be ſent? Chriſt aſcended on
high to give gifts and offices to men, for this end,</hi> Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Teachers, <hi>to gather and edifie his Church.</hi> Chriſt tells
us of no way but the Lord of the Harveſt to ſend forth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
and the Meſſengers to go into the high-ways and
hedges, and compel them to come in: And the Sowers to
go forth to ſow that Word, which is the regenerating
Seed.</p>
            <p>Though Chriſt would ſpeak to <hi>Paul</hi> from Heaven, it was
to ſend him to <hi>Ananias.</hi> And though an Angel appear to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>
it is to ſend him to <hi>Peter</hi> to be taught. Though Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
affright the Jailor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. it is to ask <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,
what he muſt do to be ſaved.</hi> And by what warrant ſhall we
ſay that Chriſt will for millions quite change this his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
way?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59413:42"/>
§ 16. 1. As to the number, it muſt be ten thouſands of
Miracles that a number ſo great ſhould be thus changed all
at once, or near it, throughout the World: And yet that
a number ſo ſmall in compariſon of all others, ſhould become
a Monarchy, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> be ſo friendly to them, as
to permit and help them, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> did the Jews, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval,
and afterward be ſubject to them.</p>
            <p>§ 17. 2. They are now a more ſottiſh Generation, full
of Malice againſt Chriſt, and Cruelty to Chriſtians where
they dare ſhew it; ſordidly worldly and covetous: They
live among Chriſtians, and all our endeavours, converſe and
examples ſcarce converteth in this Kingdom, three in an
Age. Bear with me you that talk ſo zealouſly for the
Jews Converſion and Kingdom, while I ask you, How
many in <hi>London</hi> have you converted in your lives? Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
How many have you laboured with by Inſtruction and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to convert them, while you have prayed for their
Converſion, and cenſoriouſly diſputed againſt us that doubted
of your Opinion?</p>
            <p>§ 18. 3. They are ſcattered over the moſt of the Earth,
being every where a hated and deſpiſed people. And
ſhall Preachers be ſent to them in all Lands at once?
Shall Preachers ſo quickly be made, when no Countrey
have enough for their needful work at home? And ſhall
they quickly learn and ſpeak all the Languages of the
Countreys where the Jews are? (For Hebrew alone will
not do the work.) And ſhall all Jews on Earth, get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Will they be Rich enough to bear the
charge of their Tranſplantation? Or enough cured of the
love of Riches, to leave their Trades and Wealth behind
them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§ 19. Obj.</hi> We hold not that they ſhall all be converted
or dignified, but enough to poſſeſs <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and Reign there:
<hi>Say ſome,</hi> The Tartarians may do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſeems then it is but the Popes old Zeal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> But what's this to the Converſion of
the Jews? Were they converted when <hi>Godfrey</hi> and others
recovered it? The Tartarians taking <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> will not
prove the Converſion of one Jew, that now is taken for a
Tartarian.</p>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59413:43"/>
§ 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. They are in ſuch ſervitude in all Nations, and
ſo contemned a People among them, as muſt prove it a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
for them to remove ſo far, to power.</p>
            <p>§ 21. 5. The feigned means of their Converſion is mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Miracles.</p>
            <p>1. The New Opinion is, that Chriſt ſhall do it by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the Air as he did to <hi>Saul.</hi> O take heed what
you impoſe on Chriſt! That appearance of Chriſt was ſeen
but by a very few in one place: And the words heard by
none but <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf. Shall Chriſt in the Air be ſeen at
once in <hi>Perſia, Greece, Rome, Portugal,</hi> and all Nations
where there be Jews? (And yet theſe good men are againſt
the <hi>Lutheran Vbiquitarians!)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall Chriſt Preach to them in the Air, and his voice
be heard throughout the World, a thouſand times further
than the Thunder?</p>
            <p>And how will they know that it is Chriſt? when on
Earth they would not know him; but imputed his Miracles
to <hi>Beelzebub?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And will the bare ſight of Chriſt, make millions of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
ſots preſently underſtand all the Eſſentials of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
yea and become eminently wiſe and holy, when we
can ſcarce teach an ignorant one now to underſtand the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm
or Creed in many years? I doubt many Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
have ſome ſuch Servants and Children in their own
houſes.</p>
            <p>2. Some ſay that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come and Convert them? A
Jewiſh Dream: And how will they know that he is <hi>Elias?</hi>
As they knew <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to be <hi>Elias!</hi> If you ſay, as <hi>Peter</hi>
did on the Mount, I ſay, that was by Inſpiration, or by
Chriſts telling him that it was <hi>Elias.</hi> Shall they have either
of theſe?</p>
            <p>And where ſhall <hi>Elias</hi> preach to them? Is he alſo ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary?
If he preach in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhall they hear him in <hi>Portugal?</hi>
Or if in <hi>Holland,</hi> or Rome, ſhall they hear him in <hi>England?</hi>
If he preach at <hi>Stepney,</hi> ſhall they bear him at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
at <hi>Tarmouth,</hi> at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and all over the Land, and over all
the World at once? Or muſt he ſtay long enough to go over
all the Earth? If one Man can do ſo much why have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands done ſo little on the Jews to this day?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59413:43"/>
3. If you ſay, God will raiſe up and ſend forth Miniſters
enough, that will be yet a greater Miracle: To give ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Skill, VVill and Zeal? To cauſe them to ſpeak with all
the Languages of the Nations? When the Jeſuits at <hi>Japan,
Congo,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> after many years Learning their Tongues,
do but ſet the Nations in a Laughter, to hear their miſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
as <hi>Maffeius, Varenlus,</hi> and others tell us.</p>
            <p>And who will furniſh ſo many Thouſand new inſpired
Preachers, with Money to carry them through all the
VVorld? And procure them free paſſage through Enemies
Lands?</p>
            <p>4. But the laſt anſwer I expect is, that nothing is difficult
where God will work, and Grace ſhall make one ſight of
Chriſt, to Convert them all. I anſwer, If you lay all on
the Miraculous Inſpirations of God, that can do it without
ſeeing Chriſt, and without preaching; As God made the
World with a Word: He can ſo make every Infant a
Doctor, that they not ſtay as Chriſt, to encreaſe in Stature
and Wiſdom. But if you feign him to purpoſe or promiſe
this, take heed leſt he will not hold you guiltleſs for taking
his Name in vain. This Creating Inſpiration of ſudden Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Faith and Holineſs, into ſo many Thouſands over
the World at once, will be a greater Miracle, yea Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Miracles, than ever Chriſt did: And is quite contrary
to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>§ 22. 6. The feigned Exaltation of them by a <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
Monarchy is alſo a deviſed Miracle: That theſe ſcattered
people by ſuch means, ſhould get to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and become
a Grand Monarchy, and that in a place ſo uncapable, and that
never was ſuch, no not in <hi>David</hi>'s days.</p>
            <p>§ 23. XI. Another reaſon againſt this Jewiſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is, that inſtead of an Exaltation, it would
be a Baniſhment to the Jews. <hi>Judea</hi> being like our <hi>Wales,</hi>
or not ſo big as half <hi>England,</hi> and a Countrey (though
flowing with Milk and Honey in compariſon of the <hi>Arabian</hi>
Wilderneſs, yet) very full of Mountains, Rocks, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
and oft infeſted with Famines. So that could they
bear their charges thither, I believe that the Jews in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
Conſtantinople, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> alone, would take
it for as ſad a Baniſhment to be ſent to <hi>Judea,</hi> as all <hi>England</hi>

            <p>§ 24. XII. God in Scripture hath given us another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Two New <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> the Infantile and the
Perfect, that on Earth, and that on Heaven, more Glorious
and Deſireable than the Jewiſh feigned one: Therefore we
ſhould not obſcure the Glory of them by ſuch a Fiction. As
Satan fighteth againſt the Spirit by a falſe Spirit, and againſt
the Church by a falſe Church, and againſt the Miniſtry
by a falſe Miniſtry, and againſt Unity by falſe Unity, ſo
doth he againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
by a Counterfeit.</p>
            <p>1. As the <hi>Aſſyrian, Perſian, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
were the four mentioned in <hi>Daniel;</hi> ſo there have
been ſince a fifth and a ſixth. By a Monarchy now is
meant only the Greateſt on Earth known to the Church.
The fifth was the Chriſtian Empire, whoſe Chief Seat was
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> called <hi>New Rome,</hi> and <hi>New Sion.</hi> I am not
ignorant what is ſaid againſt this by <hi>Heddeggerus</hi> and many
others: That is not to be diſputed in this narrow Room.
The ſixth Monarchy viſibly is the Turks, with the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian
Unity, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> The ſeventh, the Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and Perfect Monarchy is that of Chriſt in the New
Heaven, and New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,
after the Burning of this World: By debaſing Fiction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to a Thouſand years, and Chriſts own Kingdom alſo
ſo confined, whereas this wicked World hath already laſted
Six Thouſand years within Three Hundred and Ten. This
vilifying of Chriſts Glorious Kingdom is by blind Zeal
now made the exalting of it, by many deceived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Men.</p>

            <head>Chap. IX. Of the New Earth.</head>
            <p>§ 25. COncerning the New Earth we muſt content our
ſelves with what God hath revealed, and not
ſearch into the unrevealed things.</p>
            <p>1. It is revealed that it will be the Reſtitution of all
things; that in it ſhall dwell Righteouſneſs; that the whole
Creation groaneth to be delivered from the Bondage of
Corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the Sons of God;
that it will be a Paradiſe State; that Chriſt ſhall Reign
over it; that no Glorified Saints ſhall loſe any of their
part in Heaven by it; that there will be no death, nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery:
Therefore there will be no <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
Armies of the wicked: For there entereth nothing
that is defiled: It will be a State of Communion with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Angels and Men will have familiar Converſe: Chriſt
ſhall be joyfully known among them as their Saviour and
King: Neither Chriſt nor the Saints will lay by the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature or Body, but their Bodies will be ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
as ſhall be ſuitable to the condition of the New refined
World: This much is certain.</p>
            <p>But theſe things following are uncertain. 1. How much
of the Old Earth God will uſe in the conſtitution of the
New. Whether only the Surface of the Earth ſhall be
Burnt, and the Things and Works thereon, or alſo the
Interiour parts diſſolved into a Chaos: As it is uncertain
to us whether the Chaos at the preſent Earths Creation,
was the Relicks of a former World: We are not certain
whether there was any former World; Though to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing
Reaſon it ſeems improbable that God who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in his Works, and will continue a VVorld to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
ſhould from all Eternity have nothing but Himſelf,
till Six days ago (Six Thouſand years.) But this will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Eternity of the Univerſe (except mutations
of alterable compoſitions) that the VVorld is an Eternal
Effect of an Eternal Cauſe; and <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his Indefiniteneſs
(he meaneth Infiniteneſs) of the VVorld, and the old
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59413:47"/>
Opinion that God and the VVorld are but One, as Soul
and Body: By which they reſolve the Grand difficulties
that God is not <hi>Pars Entitatis,</hi> which were to be Imperfect
and ſo no God, the Entity of the <hi>World and God</hi> being more
than of either alone, if the VVorld have any real En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
            <p>2. It is uncertain how God will people this New Earth:
Some think as he did this Earth by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Some
think, by a Creation of many at once. Some think by a
Tranſplantation from ſome other Orb: Some think as Dr. <hi>H.
More,</hi> that except a few rare Saints or Martyrs, all go hence
but into an Aerial Vehicle, and may thence without loſs
be made Inhabitants of the New Earth. And ſome think
that thoſe that are found alive, ſhall live in the Fire and
after, and ſome that they ſhall be caught up from the Fire,
and Judg'd, and ſent hither again.</p>
            <p>3. It is uncertain whether there ſhall be any Generation
on the New Earth: Mr. <hi>Beverley</hi> ſaith, They ſhall multiply
ſo as to compenſate with a <hi>[much more]</hi> for the <hi>Jewneſs
of the ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the firſt</hi> Adam] and each ſhall live the
Thouſand years: But Chriſt ſaith that the Children of the
Reſurrection neither Marry nor are given in Marriage, but
are like the Angels, and die no more. The doubt is then,
whether he call only thoſe in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and not thoſe on the
New Earth, <hi>the Children of the Reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is uncertain whether there ſhall be any ſtated viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
preſence of Chriſt here, or that only he ſhall appear as
in Heaven, as the Sun doth by its Light; or only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be ſeen as he was after his Reſurrection. And ſo of
the Angels.</p>
            <p>5. It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s uncertain whether the New Earth ſhall have any
End or Change, or ſhall be Everlaſting. It's certain that
the Thouſand years <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. are before it in this Life, but
of its Duration God hath ſaid nothing to us.</p>
            <p>6. It's uncertain how much of the Old Heaven ſhall be
Burnt: Though it's likely it will be only ſo much as was
Curſed for Sin.</p>
            <p>7. It's uncertain whether there will be any removal to
a higher VVorld, and each Perſon live his Thouſand years,
and then as <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> be tranſlated, and ſo on to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59413:47"/>
following Generations; or each Perſon continue here for
ever.</p>
            <p>8. It's uncertain whether Devils ſhall be permitted here
to be Tempters, or all Temptations be caſt out.</p>
            <p>§ 26. It will be no diſparagement to Chriſt to Rule the
Reſtored Earth as well as Heaven. Nor to Saints or Angels
to be Governours under him. VVere the Sun Intellectual it
would be no grief to it to be a Benefactor by its Influence
to Earth: For it is no diſhonour to God Himſelf, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all to the Creature that it hath. There may be
here ſuch Subjects as God promiſed Apoſtles and Saints that
they ſhall Judge.</p>
            <p>If by Faith in Chriſt God dwell in us by Love, and we in
Him, and we have in us that Kingdom of Grace, we ſhall
have our Part in the future Kingdom, though we underſtand
not many difficulties about it. For Chriſt is the Author of
Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</p>
