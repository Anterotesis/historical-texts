            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe I have found your imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited and ſuperabounding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for theſe ſundry years paſt: therefore it is that I have now preſumed (in dedicating this Book to your name) to the intent that I might ingenuouſly make ſome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of my humble thankfulneſs before the world. It is known to ſome, and hoped by all, that you love the Truth. The truth not only of divine myſteries; but even of humane Sciences. And withall hate falſhood. The falſhood not in Religion only, but of Arts alſo. Eſpecially of all ſuch arts, as are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent with the very fundamental truths of Religion. Of which ſort (I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aver) is this fictitious art of Magicall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. And whether I have (by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
<pb facs="tcp:58142:3"/>
enablement) here ſo proved it: that I humbly refer to be judged of by your own prudence; and the moſt truly diſcerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtian profeſſours. Firſt it began as a Religion, amongſt the vileſt of Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Idolatours. Then the Jewiſh Apoſtates Idolized with it, and by it, to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable prejudice of their own Religion. But after the Chriſtian Religion came to be graciouſly promulged, this Darkneſs durſt not now ſet up it ſelf for a Religion before that Light: only then it pretended to an art; and under that masked notion (through ſome kind of Chriſtianizers) ſought craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to inſinuate into the Church, as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; Till Chriſtian Conventions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Synods, Senates, and Parliaments tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined it, and ſo juſtly condemned it for unlawfull. Since that, this Black Aart lurkt only in obſcure corners; and durſt never appear in publick: Save only in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled times, to their further diſtraction. Becauſe it then preſumed Religion, and Laws to be at a loſs; or (at leaſt) not at leaſure to examine and ſuppreſs it. And ſo it took
<pb facs="tcp:58142:3"/>
confidence to ominate alwaies moſt envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt the Church. For, that being clouded, it then preſumed, that Planetarian Edicts might the more eaſily be impoſed upon a people: yea and Starry, Laws and Ordinances, ſoon after that, given, even to a State it ſelf. And in truth Sir! it was the impoſing upon the peoples faiths by them of this way (late ſtart up amongſt us, with unſufferable peremptorineſs and impudence) that urged me not a little to employ ſome ſpare time from my other ſtudies, upon this enterprize. For it was notorious both in City, and Country, (and not only ſo, but greatly ſcandalous) how that they began to look into, and commune of their Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks, before the Bible: and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more infallibly aſſured of a Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication (as touching the government of the world, and of the Church alſo) than either of a prophecy, or a promiſe. Only their groſs hallucinating in their prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous portending upon the laſt Eclipſe; hath proved not a little to Eclipſe their credit with them. And I hope all true meaſuring and
<pb facs="tcp:58142:4"/>
ſober Aſtronomers, will deteſt, Diſtinguiſh, and detect theſe mad ominating Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: which none indeed can doe ſo exactly (as concerning their pedanticall cantings, and myſterious juglings) as can they. For my part, I know, I muſt expect the utmoſt of their malice, and malignity: elſe it would fare better with me than with others that have oppoſed them in all ages. But I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily believe, that God will bleſs me from their imprecating malefice, And I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to bleſs me from their conſpiring violence, And the Church (I truſt) will bleſs me againſt their curſed calumny, And then let me alone to bleſs my ſelf againſt the fallacie of their art, or artifice. So (maugre all their malice) I ſhall live by Gods grace and bleſſing) a Miniſter of Chriſt, a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the word, a teacher of truth, a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer of peace, a refeller of falſhood; minding herein the glory of my God; and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of my Brethren.

In regard hereof, I could neither plenarily confute them from themſelves (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have been done with no great difficulty) nor yet ſufficiently argue againſt them from others; a thing of much facility. Now ſeeing their Sun hath been ſhrouded from me, or but appeared to me only in ſome kind of twilight; I have ventured to light my leſſer candle; by which I have waded through much of their black darkneſs: and not only ſo, but have been bold to ſet it up in a candleſtick; that others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may thereby take a view either of my progreſs, or my ſlips and faylings therein. In which, as I refer my ſelf to their judgment, ſo I implore their charity. Firſt, neither theſe kind of men, nor any elſe, ought to ſtumble at the new coynd name I have here prefixt; ſince the thing it ſelf is ſo old; For who hath read the Fathers, the Philoſophers, the Hiſtorians, the Poets, or but ſome of the Magicians, and Aſtrologers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

The moſt antient; becauſe uſed ſo frequently by the primitive Fathers, and old Philoſophers. The moſt juſt; becauſe all arts and ſciences being founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſon, and ſubject to it, are obliged to render a reaſon a proper and ſufficient reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all that is delivered in them. The moſt ſound; becauſe a queſtion (a direct and pertinent queſtion) implys a forcible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and is a ſtrong argument againſt a thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be clearly and fully anſwered and reſolved. The moſt direct; becauſe it flouriſhes not about in a wild circuit of words, but comes cloſe home to the matter in hand. The moſt earneſt; becauſe an interrogation (in matters neceſſary, or contingent) either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

The moſt innocent; becauſe ſo a man may ſearch even into the worſt arts, and inventions, for an information of the underſtanding; without any contamination of the affections. The moſt conſcientious; becauſe the ſcruple is not at every fond error and opinion; but ſuch only as tend mainly to oppugn ſound doctrine, and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

It were eaſy to note more than a tack of Magick, in all I have named: but my peculiar task is againſt arrant Magick it ſelf. And therefore let me ſay unto you, whats there to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and feared: yea although you look no further into them, than I have done. That is to ſay, what elſe? but exotick terms, barbarous words, rude characters, monſtrous figures, chymericall figments, Platonicall Ideaes, Cabbaliſticall fancies, Rabbinicall traditions, Philoſophicall dreams, paganiſh ſuperſtitions, phre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall enthuſiaſms, empty ſpeculations, curious inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, obſcure nugacities, difficult follys, poor ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, fantaſtick imaginations, no demonſtration, weak proofs, frivolous evaſions, ridiculous fallacies, various opinions, mutuall oppoſitions, ſellf-contradictions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed confeſſions, depraved adulterations, ſacrilegious detorſions, hyperbolicall ratiocinations, ambiguous equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, affected decurtations, ſophiſticated expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, paradoxall aſſertions, profane aſſeverations, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory pronunciations, execrable blaſphemies, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable impieties, deteſtable hereſies, vain obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuperſtitious ominations, conſcious cautions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure preparations, ſiniſter directions, idolatrous configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, diabolicall invocations, adjurations, imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, adorations, immolations, prodigious erections, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigious deluſions, ſorcerous incantations, and maleficall operations. And now mark what is hence to be feared, or ſuſpected: what? but as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> A turning
<pb facs="tcp:58142:6"/>
of eternall predeſtination into fatall deſtiny; and the election of grace into ſydereall elections; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine covenant into a diabolicall compact; and all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, into Divinations; and ſpirituall infuſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to celeſtiall influence; and promiſes, into promiſors; and prophecies, into prognoſtications; and divine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, into natures miracles; and the oracles of God, into <hi>Apollo's</hi> oracles; and Ghoſpell predication, into goeticall prediction; and devout contemplation, into profane ſpeculation; and true religion, into idolatrous ſuperſtition; and religious obſervance, into vain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and lively faith, into dull credulity; and liberty both of conſcience, and will, into ſlavery, both to the creature, and to the Devill; and prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, into preſaging conſultations; and warrantable enterprizes, into tempting attempts; and contentedneſs in every condition, to contention on all ſides; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hopes, into ſecure preſumptions; and awfull fears, into diſaſtrous diſpairs. All this (if we look well about us) we have good cauſe to fear: not only from their arts, or Almanacks; but eſpecially from their acts, and emiſsaries; ſpreading through City, and Country to prognoſticate of variety in religions, preſage change of States, tell private perſons their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, cure by words or charms, and deſcry things loſt or ſtoln. Thus I plainly and ſadly tell you, what you may fear. But now I tell them broadly and boldly, that I (having faith in a gracious covenant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon divine providence) fear them not at all. Not their genethliacall calculations, not their aſtrall prognoſtications, not their magicall operations; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not their imprecations, conjurations, incantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, venefices, malefices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their envy, and
<pb facs="tcp:58142:7"/>
calumny as little. And from both theſe, that old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten objection of theirs, repeated even unto nauſeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (of all others ignorance in their art, or artifice) whereby they uſe proudly and vainly to wave and ſlight all that can be ſaid either to examin, or oppoſe them. How eaſy is it to object ignorance in a thing, not only which themſelves know not: but they know is not; and is not to be known? Methinks, they ſhould be more modeſt in upbraiding others ignorance: unleſs they were more able to demonſtrate their own ſcience. For my part, I reckon it thus; To be unknowing in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive art, or preſtigious artifice, is not culpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but innocent ſimplicity. Becauſe neither God, nor nature bind to know: nay more, not ſo much as admit to know; and not only ſo, but forbid it. But (by their leaves) there may be a ſufficient knowledge of the truth, and integrity of an art, or a thing: although a man be not ſo preciſely and pedantically verſed in the obliquity, and vanity thereof. Learned and Godly men, though they be not altogether acquainted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficall formalities and ceremonies of witch-crafts: yet can they diſcern of ſuch, better than the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert can doe of themſelves. A prudent Magiſtrate knows well enough how to judge of a jugling gypſie, or preſtigious impoſtors: albeit he cannot tell how to cant with him exactly in his own foyſting gibboriſh. But I return to you, Judicious Readers; and what I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you, I ſubmit unto you: judge both of me, and of the Judiciary Aſtrologers. And fear not the ſigns of heaven, as heathens: but as Chriſtians, fear God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Son, and apply to his Spirit: and ſo, magre all their fatall, or fortuitous previſions, or predictions, Fare ye well.</p>

uſe. What Signes? Magiſteriall, fatall, neceſſitating Signes? Ah! then wete they not ſignes only, but Cauſes. And yet not ſole cauſes, becauſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſited to neceſſitate. Indeed we read of their <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>dominion,</hi> (verſ. 16. <hi>Pſal. 136. 8, 9. Jer.</hi> 31. 35.) if we may call it theirs, becauſe they were <hi>made</hi> for it, and it <hi>given</hi> to them, and that by a ſuperior <hi>Ordinance.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all their prefecture and power but derivative, ſubordinate, miniſteriall. And not only derived, but limited and determined expreſly to be <hi>of, by,</hi> and <hi>over</hi> Time, and the diſtinctions, and viciſſitude of time: but not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore over every thing, and act in time, with their diſtinctions and viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. What Signes? Indefinite, indeterminate ſignes? That is, becauſe ſignes of ſome things; therefore ſignes of every thing? Becauſe ſignes of ſome things naturall, as in Phyſick, Navigation, Husbandry: therefore ſignes of all things rationall, arbitrary, morall, politicall, and religious? Is it not ſufficiently here expreſſed to what ends and uſes they are ſaid to be Signes? <hi>To divide between the day, and between the night</hi> (That by ſuch a ſignall diſtinction men might diſcern what part or diviſion of time is fitteſt for labour, and what for reſt.) And to be <hi>for Seaſons</hi> (The ſignall opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is to actions Naturall, Morall, Politicall or Religious.) <hi>And for dayes and years</hi> (Times ſhorter or longer, as may be fitteſt for the account and order in the aforeſaid actions.) <hi>To rule the day, and the night</hi> (There's their proper uſe deſigned by, or over time, and the viciſſitudes thereof.) <hi>To be Lights ſet in the firmament of the heaven</hi> (There's their end, as reſpecting the perfection and beauty of the Univerſe.) <hi>And to give light upon the earth;</hi> (There's their main end and uſe in reſpect of all inferiours.)</p>
                     <p>But may we not couch and expound them thus? <hi>For ſignes, and for ſeaſons, and for dayes and years,</hi> that is, For ſignes of ſeaſons, of dayes, and of years. Is it not to be noted in the Text, that the commanding or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive word ſpeaks firſt of the Creation of the Starres of Planets; and after that of their operation, or uſe for which they were created? When it ſpeaks of their Creation, it ſpeaks <hi>ſingularly;</hi> to note, they were all of them (for nature and ſubſtance) out of one being. But when it ſpeaks of their Uſe, it ſpeaks <hi>plurally,</hi> to note their ſundry uſes: yet, as it ſpeaks <hi>plurally,</hi> it ſpeaks <hi>conjunctively;</hi> to note, that if <hi>Signes</hi> be abſtracted from <hi>Seaſons,</hi> and <hi>dayes,</hi> and <hi>years,</hi> then are they either no Signes at all, or elſe no ſuch ſignes as are here intended and defined. Again, the commanding, and inſtituting word, ſets forth their perpetuall Law of their miniſteriall ſervice to the whole Univerſe; and how can this agree with their particular and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary aſpects, together with their magiſteriall domineering?</p>
                     <p>May we not well underſtand <hi>Seaſons,</hi> not only for appointed and ſtated; but for ſolemn and ſacred times: as alſo <hi>dayes, and years,</hi> for ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon times more or leſſe? Certainly, God ordained them for dividing and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58142:10"/>
diſtinguiſhing ſignes even of his time as well as ours. So then, they ſerve to be ſignes for obſervation of ſacred and religious times; and likewiſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and civill times; but as touching the obſervation of ſuperſtitious and genethliacall times, where's the leaſt word for that in the Text? Why doth the Holy Ghoſt here omit to expreſs hours and moneths? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not give the leaſt occaſion to <hi>Planetary horoſcopiſts,</hi> and monethly Prognoſticators? Doubtleſs, though he implies them here within his own diſtinction, yet he would not have them involved in their calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>How are their imagined influences of the Stars, and their ſignall Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtications of them, grounded upon this place? When as themſelves ſay (from their <hi>Rabbines,</hi> in that profound cabaliſticall parable of <hi>Malcuth</hi> cut off from the <hi>Ilon, &amp;c.)</hi> that from the Sin and fall of <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentiall Channels were broken, and their water-courſe was no more; The divine Light retreated, and the deſcents were reſtrained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did God indeed curſe the heavens for mans ſake, as well as the earth? How were they created and inſtituted for ſignes and for ſeaſons, and for dayes, and years? Seeing they were but created on the <hi>fourth day;</hi> and all (by their account) was undone on the <hi>Sixt day.</hi> To whom were they for <hi>Signes</hi> for a day or two? To Man? He was not yet created. And ſo ſoon as he was created (ſay we) he fell; and ſo ſoon as he fell (ſay they) theſe Signes failed. What uſe then, or obſervation of them could there be to him? Well ſince they will have theſe to be the Signes before the curſe, we are ſure theirs are not only the ſigns after the curſe, but curſed ſigns; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (by their own argument) can have no placing here.</p>
                     <p>Nay, and moreover, what ſay the preſaging Aſtrologers to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Rabbines, who thus tranſlate the place? <hi>Let them be,</hi> not <hi>for Signes;</hi> but <hi>for Letters.</hi> Letters to be read, not Signs to be gheſſed at. If there may be ſuch a ſpelling of their letters, what need or uſe of their other ſpelling Signs?</p>
                     <p>But what ſhould hinder us (who are orthodox) not to reſt our ſelves ſatisfied with theſe moderate and ſafer explications? <hi>Signs</hi> of diviſion, of diſtinction; <hi>Signs</hi> of the ſeaſons of the year; <hi>Signs</hi> of the ſeaſons of the weather; Naturall <hi>Signs,</hi> although not artificiall; indefinite <hi>Signs,</hi> becauſe not preciſely of particulars; and yet not ſo indefinite, as if ſigns in generall of all things whatſoever. Signs of the alteration and alternation of times and weathers: but not of the mutation and termination of humane Societie and deſtiny. Signes of ſignification, and for direction in ſome ordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but not of Prognoſtication, for prediction of contingent events. In a word, ſuch Signes as God hath here eſtabliſhed, but not ſuch as he hath there fruſtrated. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 25.</p>

By their common po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and not indeed by their ſpeciall impoſition? Ordinarily? nay, but extraordinarily. Formally? nay but rather effectively. Even ſo far forth as it pleaſed <hi>the Lord of Hoſts</hi> to uſe them as his inſtruments, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious producing of thunder, lightning, wind, hayl, rain, ſtorm, or tempeſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then, the Stars fought externally, by their own proper weapons, in generating and producing of diſturbing and diſtracting <hi>meteors:</hi> not by their influences, working internally upon the minds, wils, conſciences, counſels, and courages of men. In this generall muſter, or great conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which of them was the leader in chief, or predominant Lord? All thoſe that periſhed in this ſlaughter, did the Stars agree to deſign that in their births; which they now executed at their deaths? This fighting of theirs (ſuch as it was) who foreſaw it? who foretold it? was not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs her ſelf ignorant of it, ſave only after the event? And when ſhe underſtood the manner of it, was ſhe inſtructed by an arted ſpeculation, or by a divine revelation only? <hi>Deborah</hi> is now aſcribing the victory to the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> (for his praiſe and worſhip) and not unto the Stars.

                     <p>What difference betwixt a divine contemplation, and a Diviners ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Heavens? Are not theſe the main differences, and moſt of them to be here obſerved? 1. One reads them with the pure glaſs of Gods word? the other by his own falſe and fallacious perſpicils. And muſt not he be blear eyed and weak ſighted that undertakes to read the Heavens, and Heavenly bodyes, not with the eyes of his ſoul, nor yet with his eyes in his head, but with his eyes in or through a caſe? 2. One beholds them as <hi>Gods</hi> Heavens: the other as dame Natures Heavens. 3. One ſees, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders:</hi> the other neither ſees, nor conſiders; but gazes only, and ſo conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. 4. One looks upon them as a <hi>work,</hi> an ordinary work: the other pores upon them as working, and extraordinarily working. 5. One con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates them devoutly, and conſtantly; at any time, or all times, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: the other ſpeculates them ſuperſtitiouſly, at ſtated planetary hours, and moments. 6. One conſiders them, as the work of Gods <hi>fingers:</hi> the other conceives them as working by his own figures. 7. One doth it, to meditate within himſelf: the other doth it to preſage and predict upon others. 8. One regards them, as Gods <hi>ordinance:</hi> the other reſpects them, as giving laws, and ordinances to men. 9. One takes occaſion hereby to meditate both of mans frailty and his dignity; as in ſome reſpects inferior; yet in ſome reſpect ſuperior to the heavenly bodyes: the other feigns, and muſes upon the Stars ſuperiority, and domination; and mans inferiority,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58142:13"/>
and ſubjection altogether. 10. One admires the mercy of God, in exalting man above the Stars: the other (at moſt) but vaunts of his judgements, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing him under them. 11. One hereupon argues mans ſtate to be <hi>little lower</hi> than that of <hi>Angels:</hi> the other hereupon would make mans condition to be far worſe than that of beaſts. 12. One ſo directs his meditation, as that it is not without an expreſſe invocation of the Lord: the other ſo directs his ſpeculation, as that (very often) it is not without ſome implicite invocation of the Devill. 13. One magnifies God for ſo <hi>viſiting</hi> man in mercy as to <hi>crown</hi> him with the <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> of a reaſonable, and a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul: the other diſhonours him even in the viſitations of his judgments; in that he would rob man of this his crown, and ſet it upon the Stars head: making them to be rationall creatures, nay and little leſs than God; and man to be awed wholly under their irrationall and fatall neceſſity. 14 One nevertheleſs concludes that God hath ſo made man, as <hi>to have the dominion over the works of his hands:</hi> the other concludes, that the work of his fingers have nevertheleſs the inevitable and ineluctable domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him.</p>
                     <p>But it would not be unmentioned, why no mention is here made of the <hi>Sun,</hi> as is of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and of the <hi>Stars?</hi> was it becauſe <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this <hi>Pſalme</hi> in the night time; and is he therefore ſilent of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was now ſet? Surely, ſpirituall meditations require not the preſence or appearance of ſenſible objects. If he did compoſe it in the night ſeaſon, yet undoubtedly it was done in his Chamber, and not on the top of a Tower. This nightly meditation was clean another thing to their nightly ſpeculation. He could, as they cannot, perfect his conſideration, without any relation of, or to the Sun. Or therefore ſpeaks he not of the Sun, but of the Moon, and the Stars only becauſe theſe ſhine together? Well then, it is evident that he lookt not at ſuch Aſpects and Conjunctions, as are fain to refer all chiefly to the Sun. Or calls he the Sun <hi>his Heavens</hi> incluſively? Why that (in a peculiar manner) is no more his creature, than are all the other obſcurer and inferior Stars; they are all but the ſame work of his fingers. But if he ſpeak of the Sun thus involvedly, it is not to countenance their involutions, but reprove their involved praedictions: who ſtudy to be ambiguons, becauſe they prognoſticate from ſuch things they plainly perceive not. Or ſpeaks he not of the Sun? Becauſe he ſpeaks of <hi>ſeeing;</hi> and thats a thing cannot ſuffer it ſelf to be over broadly gazed on. Goe to; if it doe indeed dazle the ſenſible eyes, for whoſe naturall uſe it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: how then will it dazle thoſe curious eyes, that are prying and ſearching into it, not only for the ſupernaturall, but preternaturall abuſe of it and of all under it? But (to let paſs theſe levities of conjecture, ſave only that they have their weight againſt their lighter conjectures) doth not the

Pſalmiſt in very deed therefore here paſſes over the Sun in ſilence? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not now prognoſticating, but propheſying of <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> to whoſe brightneſs and glory, the Sun in the firmament is but obſcure darkneſs; propheſying of his Birth, and Death, for which the Prince of the Planets hand no motion, and hath therefore here no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Becauſe in this place (and in this place alone) the name of a <hi>Magician,</hi> hath (with many) the favourable tranſlation, and interpretation, to be accepted as a middle word (and a middle word, not in relation to their common and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane art but in conſideration of their ſpeciall and extraordinary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and office) ſhall therefore the profeſſion and practice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, be held a thing indifferent? Yea, will they therefore boaſt it to be not <hi>ungratefull,</hi> or not <hi>diſtaſtfull</hi> to the <hi>Goſpell</hi> it ſelf? Is it not ſo to it, when it ſpeaks of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and of <hi>Elymas</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> or <hi>Magician?</hi> Doth not the holy Scripture often make mention of the <hi>Devill,</hi> and <hi>Sin?</hi> and are theſe therefore to be collected as not ungratefull to it? And what if a word be not ungratefull, or diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to it (becauſe therein is properly no turpitude; and becauſe it ſerves but to diſcern and diſcover the evill, and ſo is not evill) is the ſame therefore to be concluded as concerning the thing ſignified? ſhould it once be ſo much as imagined (by underſtanding and conſciencious men) that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (having ſo often reproved and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the thing) ſhould here approve of it; yea or of the name, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to it? Although (among profane Authors) the name of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician was taken ſometimes in the good part, and ſometimes in the bad; as the art, or practice was preſumed to be of things lawfull, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: yet why ſhould ſuch a thing be admitted in ſacred Scripture, where it is wholy condemned? If we look unto the origination of the word, (which is various, and in various languages) we find it commonly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an ill notation of the name. But leaving the originall and ſignification of the word for obſcure and uncertain (as the greateſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are fain to doe) let them (who have a mind to commend this word unto us) ſhew us what good they can obſerve in the uſe and practice of it, or of thoſe that have been named by it.

But (to look again upon the Text) grant they are here called not <hi>Magicians</hi> barely but <hi>Magicians of the Eaſt.</hi> (though the conſtruction will not well bear it for <hi>from the Eaſt,</hi> has reference to their profection, not their profeſſion) what of all that? were the <hi>Magi</hi> the honeſter for comming from that coaſt or place? And if they were ſo there, does not that caſt a brand upon Magicians in all others coaſts and places.? And what though they were ſtill cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Magi</hi> after their comming to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or converſion? was not <hi>Saul</hi> called <hi>Saul</hi> after his converſion? and <hi>Matthew</hi> called the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> called <hi>Zelotes,</hi> after their vocation? Is it neceſſary that all mens names ſhould be changed upon their converſion? or thoſe that were, were they changed becauſe they were of ill ſignification, or import? or was the name of <hi>Magi</hi> not ſo, becauſe not then changed? And what though <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Elymas</hi> have ſome Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes added to the name of <hi>Magician</hi> (as it is ſaid of the one, <hi>that he bewitched the people,</hi> Acts 8. 9, and of the other, that he was <hi>a falſe Prophet,</hi> Acts 13. 6.) Does that argue that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> approves of the name, without thoſe Paraphraſes? Nay, doe not thoſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes or Synonyma's further clear what the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> intended by that name? For how did <hi>Simon Magus bewitch</hi> the people, but by his <hi>Magick,</hi> or <hi>Sorceries?</hi> Acts 8. 11. Oh! but <hi>Magus</hi> is the interpretation of <hi>Elymas,</hi> Acts 13. 8. And <hi>Elymas</hi> ſounds well both according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> derivation. It may ſound and ſignifie well, or ill; as the <hi>derivator</hi> pleaſes to fancy, or labours to allude. But is the good or bad ſignification of a name, ſufficient to make the thing ſignified either good or bad? His name was <hi>Barjeu</hi> or <hi>Bar Jeſas;</hi> and did that approve him for the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</hi> Magicians were wont to arrogate and uſurp unto themſelves good names or titles, thereby to colour their wicked myſteries and practices. <hi>Simon Magus gave out that himſelf was ſome great one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> and thereupon came to be accounted <hi>the great power of God,</hi> Acts 8. 9. 10. Doe the Scriptures uſe to interpret an obſcure thing, by an obſcurer? And therefore why may we not interpret the <hi>interpreting,</hi> to be no other, but his own arrogating, or others accounting? But (to be brief) may we not reſt ſatisfied with theſe interpretations of

all his names at once? <hi>A falſe Propphet,</hi> ther's the name of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; a <hi>Jew,</hi> ther's the name of his nation; <hi>Barjeſus,</hi> ther's the name from his Parents; <hi>Elymas,</hi> ther's the name of his education (for might he not be brought up, and inſtructed in <hi>Elymais,</hi> a City in the Country of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where the Magicians were educated?) and <hi>Magus,</hi> ther's the name of his practice. And thus the knotty interpretation is eaſily diſolved, interpreting <hi>Elymas Magus,</hi> for an <hi>Elymaticall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</hi>

What ſay they (beſides the Angells) to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>the ſheapherds of the ſame Country?</hi> Certainly, if they came not (as ſome think) till about twelve dayes after the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; or (as others) not till about two years after (which they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from <hi>verſe</hi> 16.) then met <hi>Chriſt</hi> with many attendants, ere they came. But what if they had been the firſt attendants, was it their art Magicall that did diſpoſe, or invite them thereunto? Or did they (as they were <hi>Philoſophers)</hi> acknowledge him in the fleſh before that he himſelf diſcovered it? Without all doubt, had not he himſelf firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to them by his <hi>Spirit;</hi> not only all their art, but even <hi>the Star</hi> it ſelf had been inſignificant, and altogether inſufficient to ſuch a purpoſe.

Why may we not take <hi>Magi</hi> here, not for an artificiall, or a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionall; but for a nationall and a gentilitiall name, or appellation? There are expreſſe promiſes for the calling of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but not of the Magicians. There the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> propoſes it as a thing ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <hi>Behold, there came Wiſemen from the Eaſt to</hi> Jeruſalem? making as it were a wonder (conſidering their art) for to ſee Magicians to come unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore we conclude, that nothing (from their call, or converſion) was now praefigured in reſpect to their profeſſions, but to the Nations; They being thus the firſt fruits of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not of the <hi>Magicians.</hi> Having relation to the promiſed calling, not as <hi>Magi</hi> not as <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> Iſa. 33. 18. 1 Cor. 1. 20. 26. but as <hi>from the Eaſt,</hi> Iſa. 41. 2. and 43. 5.

                     <p n="3">3. Why God would call the <hi>Magi,</hi> or Magicians to Chriſt? Not becauſe they were Wiſemen, or men well morrallized; nor becauſe they were Prieſts, and Prophets, and Theologues and Divines, teaching and ſerving God aright in their way of Religion; nor becauſe they

                     <p n="4">4.

For it is ſpoken of one, as well as another, <hi>the inviſible things of him, from the creation of the world, are cleerly ſeen, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi> Rom. 1. 2. Not that the myſteries of Grace are more to be read in the book of the Heavens, (but a book of nature, as well as the earth) although (as it were) of a whiter paper, or a fairer character. Not that the heavenly bodies are <hi>Gods Image,</hi> as ſome of the earthly are: neither yet bear it before them, as they doe. Not becauſe the Stars have any peculiar attractive vertue in them, to draw men to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or Chriſtian profeſſion.

No; but to captivate them in their own wiſedome; and to condeſcend to their own capacities, and to inſtruct them (the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of them being laid aſide) from their own ſtudies, and exerciſes. Namely, that the creatures (celeſtiall, or terreſtriall) may become (in their kind) our tutors to God-ward; if they be rightly uſed, and not ſuperſtitiouſly or profanely abuſed. That the Stars are not the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the world: but only ſerving as a guide to him, that governs both them, and the world.

Item,</hi> about thirteen daies after the Nativity. <hi>Item,</hi> not till a year, or about two years after. <hi>Item,</hi> that they rode upon ſwift <hi>Dromedaries,</hi> and ſo come thither the ſooner. <hi>Item,</hi> that they were miraculouſly provected; and as it were carried along in the ayr. <hi>Item,</hi> that they ſuffered many adventitiall and ordinary delayes in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. So upon the ſecond, opinions are the like, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared long before the day of the Nativity. <hi>Item,</hi> that it appeared juſt upon the very day. <hi>Item,</hi> that it appeared not till after the day. All which opinions, as they are all of them impoſſible to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: ſo the moſt of them are eaſie to be refuted. But this is the thing to be obſerved; If they came ſo ſoon; how farre diſtant was the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> from whence they came? If they came ſo late; how were they the firſt attendants? If the <hi>Starre</hi> appeared ſo long before the day of his Nativity; how was it the ſigne of him already <hi>born?</hi> If juſt upon the day; how could they come thither on that day ſo farre as from the <hi>Eaſt?</hi> If it appeared after his Nativity (as indeed it did, being the ſigne of one <hi>born</hi> already) what influence could it have upon the inſtant of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity? and what could they (in all their art) collect to that purpoſe? and if they could not thus calculate, from <hi>His</hi> peculiar <hi>Star;</hi> what preſumption then is it in them, who have attempted, and pretended to doe it, from the common ſtarres, and their ordinary conſtellation at the inſtant of his Birth?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Whether this <hi>ſtarre</hi> was one or many? Moſt certain it is (from each particular in the text) that it was but one ſingle ſtarre. <hi>We have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58142:18"/>
ſeen</hi> (all of us as one, and at once; not one of us one ſtarre, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another) a <hi>ſtarre</hi> (ſingularly, not plurally ſtarres) <hi>His ſtarre</hi> (peculiarly, and none elſe but his) and <hi>the ſtarre,</hi> or <hi>that his ſtarre</hi> (and that alone, or none but that) <hi>in the Eaſt</hi> (in that coaſt only.) But who but <hi>Mathematicians</hi> gave occaſion to this queſtion? Did not <hi>Albumazar,</hi> in feigning <hi>Virgo</hi> the Sign in the Zodiack, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted of many ſtarres, reſembling a Virgin, carrying a Child in her arms, and it holding an eare of <hi>ſtarres</hi> in its hand? And did not other Mathematicians, and Magicians fancie, or feign the like concerning the apparition of this ſtarre in <hi>Bethlehem?</hi> And did not this give occaſion to ſome kind of Chriſtians, not onely to embrace this, but to deviſe other ſuperſtitious figments? of which I ſpare now to ſpeak. Onely I cannot but note thus much to the purpoſe; that this <hi>ſtarre</hi> being a ſtarre by it ſelf, did ſignifie by it ſelf, and not in conjunction with any other ſtarre whatſoever. What ground or colour then is here for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, and their kind of ſignifications?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Whether this was a new <hi>ſtarre,</hi> and extraordinary; or one of the old and ordinary ſtarres? Not an old ſtarre, or one of them created from the firſt Creation. Becauſe, it is called <hi>his ſtarre:</hi> Now how prove they, that any ſtarre (from the Creation) is affixed, or attributed to any individuall perſon or action? The <hi>Magi</hi> made it a marvell to have ſeen it, which they needed not to have done, had it been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtarre. It ſigned a thing paſt, not future; for it betokened one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready born, and withall invited to come and <hi>worſhip</hi> him. It ſhone as well by day, as by night. It appeared and diſappear'd anomalous to ordinary ſtarres. It moved not circularly, but directly. It moved not only from Eaſt to Weſt; but from North to South. Its motion was not perpetuall, but interrupted. It moved but ſlowly (according to the pace of the <hi>Magi)</hi> not in a rapide motion, as other ſtarres. It was in a lower or inferiour ſituation, as a guiding miniſter; which other ſtarres are unapt for, by reaſon of their elevation. It was as of a brighter qualitie: ſo of a leſſer quantitie, than other Starres. After the end of its office and miniſtry, it vaniſhed: whereas other have their conſtant office, and yet remain the ſame they were from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It had no naturall influence upon inferiour bodies. It appeared but to ſome certain perſons; not to all, nor yet to many, within the ſame <hi>Horizon,</hi> or <hi>Hemiſphere.</hi> It is thought to have been a ſtarre, not ſo much in ſubſtance, as in ſimilitude. Now being this was neither Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, fixed Star, nor Comet; but a new ſtarre, extraordinary, ſingular, and accounted different from all other ſtars in nature, ſubſtance, quantity, quality, ſite, motion, duration, ſignification, and effects; Wherefore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58142:18"/>
then ſhould ſuch a ſingular apparition be drawn to a generall obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? as if it did approve ſuch ſignifications in other ſtars, which it ſelf did not ſignifie? or countenance ſuch collections in others, and by others: which the <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> themſelves could in no wiſe collect from it? Nay, in as much as this Star which ſignified <hi>Chriſt</hi> new born, was new, ſingular, extraordinary, miraculous; is not this a ſtrong argument againſt ordinary portents or ſignifications, of ordinary ſtars, in ordinary births?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Whether the <hi>Magi</hi> were ſolely, and ſufficiently inſtructed by this <hi>ſtarre,</hi> concerning the birth of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Some have thought that they took notice of the Star for a long time before; and yet they undertook not their journey, till they were immediatly ſtirred up by the motion of Gods Spirit, and that all we Chriſtians doe eaſily believe. Were they brought then, or invited hereunto by their ſpeculation or by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? by their art, or by their faith? They confeſſe they had <hi>ſeen his Starre;</hi> and yet nevertheleſſe they are enquiring, <hi>VVhere is he that is born King of the Jewes?</hi> Why could they not collect from the Starre one circumſtance, as well as another? the place of his birth, as well as the time? eſpecially ſeeing the place was the chief circumſtance that the Starre was intended to portend, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. But does not this imply, that their art or ſpeculation was not ſufficient to inform them: and therefore they are referred to inquire of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> for their certain, and preciſe inſtruction? Doe the Stars uſe to tell what the ſtate, and conditions of the perſon newly born already is: and not rather (as they pretend) foretell what it ſhall be afterwards? yet here they ſpeak of one <hi>that is born King of the Jewes.</hi> And had they learnt this from the Star only, or their art; had that been a ſufficient warrant for them to <hi>come</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> him? It muſt needs be Idolatry, Superſtition, and not divine worſhip, that is taught, or induced to, by meer humane art or ſcience. If they apprehended him a temporall King (as ſome have ſuppoſed, from their inquiring after him in a temporall Court) this was a defect of revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, was it not an error of their ſpeculation? But whereas ſome ſpeak of a diabolicall ſuggeſtion, becauſe they were Magicians: howbeit it is not to be thought that the Devill can ſuggeſt any thing directly tending to Divine worſhip. For my part I charitably believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had revealed himſelf unto them, before they ever ſaw the Star; in as much as they were taught to call it <hi>his Star</hi> upon the firſt ſight thereof. Yet that they learnt this from the Starre; or either this, or the Starre, from <hi>Seths</hi> Pillars, or Books; or from <hi>Balaams</hi> prophecies: the faith of thoſe traditions I leave with the Authors. And proceed further to argue their inſufficiency notwithſtanding all theſe. If the <hi>Magi</hi> could certainly collect from this Star, the time of <hi>Chriſts</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58142:19"/>
Nativity; Why then did they reſolve <hi>Herod</hi> ſo uncertainly, both for time, place, and perſon? as appeareth <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and 16. For his ravening and raging ſo rudely, and wildly, was doubtleſs according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation upon his inquiry. If you ſay, they underſtood all preciſely; only (knowing <hi>Herods</hi> intent to fo barbarous cruelty) they therefore gave him an evaſive and deluſory anſwer. And were they indeed thus adviſed of ſuch his intent, whereof <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were yet ignorant. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Nay? 'tis evident, they were unadviſed, till they were warned of it in a <hi>Dream, verſ.</hi> 12. And therefore (no doubt) had an intent to have returned, and informed him according to his inquiry, had they not been otherwiſe inhibited, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. Indeed it is ſaid, <hi>Herod ſaw himſelf mocked of the VViſe men, verſ.</hi> 16. But that was not as touching their reſolution, but their return. However, touching their latter, not their former reſolution. But this is ſtrange! and yet not ſo ſtrange as true: Theres more certain prognoſtication from a <hi>Dream,</hi> than from a ſtarre. For the <hi>ſtarre</hi> informed them not ſo much as of the action: but a <hi>dream</hi> adviſes them of the very intention. It was <hi>his dream</hi> (divinely immitted) and not <hi>his Star</hi> (miraculouſly exhibited) which did inſtruct them concerning his ſo imminent, and extreme perill. What a dream then, and leſſe than a dream, is that of the ordinary ſtarres: to make them to preſage acts, intents, events, (both arbitrary and contingent) from the firſt moment of a mans Birth; even to the laſt of his Death?</p>

                     <p>Whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in theſe places) reproved all, or approved any kind of judiciall Aſtrologie? Undeniable it is, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> words are not only univerſally, but totally tending to reprove. As obſerve, I.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58142:19"/>
nature-tempters, and fortune ſpellers; if they pretend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Chriſtianity, together with Magick and Aſtrology, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly as arrant hypocrites in the one, as impoſtors in the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. As pretending a ſearch into natures ſecrets, ſo far forth as it may fet forth God, and lead unto him: yet ſo wandring in abſtruſe ſpeculations, and uſeleſs vanities, as doe indeed blind with ſuperſtition, and ſo ſeduce the farther from him. For the inviſible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made; even his eternall power and Godhead. <hi>By the things that are really made:</hi> not by the things that are fantaſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined. And therefore their fooliſh heart being thus darkned, as to become ſo vain in their imaginations; profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe (before the men of the world) they are indeed become <hi>Fooles,</hi> in the account of God, and all good men. Or, does he not therefore call them <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> becauſe profeſſing themſelves to be teachers of the <hi>Law,</hi> and expounders of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> they notwithſtanding rather addicted themſelves to vain obſervations, unneceſſary ſtudies, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Prognoſtications? Oh! how hard a thing is it, for a <hi>Divine,</hi> to turn a <hi>Diviner,</hi> and not to turn <hi>Hypocrite</hi> (if not Atheiſt) withall? 2. The occaſion reprooved; In that they came tempting him, and urging him to ſhew them a <hi>ſign</hi> from <hi>Heaven. Tempting</hi> him. Who are greater tempters of God, than Magicians and Aſtrologians; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all ſuch as ſeek unto them, to be reſolved by them? As either feigning the creatures, which are not: or applying the creatures that are, to thoſe ends and uſes, for which God never ordained them. A <hi>ſign</hi> it is they would have. This fault in them is plainly and ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooved, <hi>Mat. 12. 39. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 22. And is it not a fault reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Chriſtians, and profeſſors of Religion, who ought to be led (both in matters politick, and eccleſiaſticall) by ordinary rules, and certain promiſes: and not to look after extraordinary and uncertain ſigns and tokens. And it muſt be a ſign <hi>from heaven</hi> too. Why? were not all <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſigns upon earth (his feeding the hungry healing the diſeaſed rayſing the dead) ſufficient to convince them of his <hi>Meſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</hi> It is well worth the obſerving upon this occaſion; that of all the ſigns and wonders which <hi>our Saviour</hi> wrought in, and among the inferior creatures, he not once (in all his life, and acts) medled to make any kind of portent in or among the ſuperior creatures; the Stars, and Planets. And why ſo? but becauſe he would not have Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians and Aſtrologers to arrogate his Patronage, or obtrude his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, Becauſe providence is ſufficient to rule and govern the world,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58142:20"/>
without Prognoſtication. Becauſe the prophecies and promiſes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat for the ordering and ſtrengthning the Church without predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and preſages. Becauſe he would teach men to keep themſelves within the ſeveral ſpheres of their own ſerviceable activities: and not to be curious in inquiring, nor ſuperſtitious in depending upon ſuch things as properly concern them not. 3. Their Art, or skill (in the generall) reprooved. <hi>O ye Hypocrites! ye can diſcern the face of the skie, and of the earth.</hi> O ye Hypocrites! (that are buſily prying into the abſtruſe miracles of nature, and profanely neglect to take notice of the hidden and wonderfull things of God; That flatter and Sooth up others, to a doating preſumption of thoſe things, which yee your ſelves doubt of, and (among your ſelves) deride; That terrify others in a vain ſuperſtition of thoſe things, which you your ſelves are ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly ſecure of) <hi>ye can diſcern</hi> (that is, not ſo much by the judgement of a certain knowledge: as by the opinion of an uncertain conjecture) And what can ye diſcern? but the <hi>Face</hi> (the apparition, the ſhadow) but the heart and body thereof ye cannot; <hi>ſc.</hi> the ſubſtance, and truth. All is but <hi>the face of the skie;</hi> and theres all your Aſtrologicall: and <hi>the face of the earth;</hi> and ther's all your Magicall skill. 4.

For theſe things have their naturall and ordinary cauſes: and ſo may be moderatly obſerved <hi>to come to paſs;</hi> or to have their common effects. But in the aſſerting, or pronouncing upon theſe things, he reprooves (and that juſtly) their arrogation of authority to themſelves; <hi>ye ſay:</hi> their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate raſhneſs; <hi>ſtreightway ye ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and their peremptory determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; <hi>ye ſay, it will be to day.</hi> Now if he reproove this manner of Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticating in things that have their naturall cauſes: how much more doth he ſo in things that have not? And how then ſhall our Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticators goe unreprooved (by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and all good Chriſtians) who preſume to ſay (of themſelves, unadviſedly and peremptorily) not only, it will be fair weather; it will be foul weather: but it ſhall be a fair child, it ſhall be a foul child; and that not only for the face and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of it; but for the fortune and manners? 5. Their defect of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter skill (yea of the beſt ſcience) is here reprooved. <hi>Can ye not diſcern the Signs of the times? how is it that ye diſcern not this time,</hi> viz. Of the Meſſiah, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> of the Goſpell, of grace, of the

Church, of the Ordinances, and of the Chriſtian Common-wealth?

Their defect or neglect of conſcientious judgments reprooved: Why, <hi>even of your ſelves, judge ye not what is right?</hi> Can ye judge of an externall event, which may peradventure be? and will ye not judge out of an internall principle, what ye ought neceſſarily to doe? the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nature, the judgment of Art, they are often in the wrong; it is the judgment of conſcience only that is in the right; Why then ſhould we believe, or aſſent unto the curious; where we find not the conſcientious judgment? where is obliquity, but in the judicials of Aſtrologie? where is arctitude but in a conſcience informed by Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie? Nay, may there not be ſo much rectitude even in an Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers conſcience as to convince him (beſides his perſonall, and morall) even of his artificiall obliquity? Nay and beſides, may not a man judge of what is right, juſt, true, good, poſſible, probable, neceſſary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient (as touching nature, morality, pollicie, Religion) and that <hi>even of himſelf</hi> (by reaſon, prudence, conſcience) without the Art, or the Artiſts, of Magick, or Aſtrologie?</p>

And are not theſe the proper obſervations, and inſtructions both made, and taught by Aſtrologers? If (upon another ground) it be tranſlated, <hi>an obſerver of the clouds:</hi> does not that come nearer to them, as touching the matter of their art? And if it be tranſlated from that word, which fignifieth an <hi>eye:</hi> it yet again ſerves to note their ſuperſtitious ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and praeſtigious inſpection.

                     <p>Which is the right way preſently to reform Magick and Aſtrology? Is it not according to this example, firſt to reform the Artiſts, and then the Art? Muſt not they be well <hi>beaten,</hi> and <hi>wounded,</hi> by the <hi>evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> of their own guilty conſciences? Eſpecially, for <hi>taking upon them, to call over</hi> (by adjuring, imprecating, and deprecating) <hi>them that had evill ſpirits</hi> (whether of obſeſſion, temptation, ſuperſtition, curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity) adding thereunto (in a preſumption of more vertue and vigour to their charming, and inchanting) <hi>the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> As if they thus indeavoured to reconcile Aſtrologie, and Theologie, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, or Goetie and the Goſpell, Divination and Divinity. Again, muſt they not <hi>flee out of their houſes</hi> (their <hi>Zodiacall houſes)</hi> and that <hi>naked,</hi> or quite ſtript of all their ſuperſtitious phantaſies, and vain obſervations? And again, muſt they not <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>confeſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſhew their deeds,</hi> and <hi>magnifie the name of the Lord Jeſus? Fear,</hi> in a deep apprehenſion of Gods juſt diſpleaſure; <hi>believe,</hi> through a lively faith in his gracious promiſes; <hi>confeſſe</hi> their ſins in generall; <hi>ſhew their deeds,</hi> declare their magicall and ſorcerous practiſes in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and <hi>magnifie the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> admire and adore the wiſedome, power and goodneſs of God, in that excellent myſterie of mans redemption. Now the perſons thus converted; whats to be done for the reformation of the Art, but after their example? <hi>Many of them which uſed curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men. Many of them;</hi> for all the converts now, were not <hi>exorciſts,</hi> or Magicians. And therefore, what ſtarting hole is here to ſurmiſe that ſome of them did not ſo? <hi>They brought their books together,</hi> one as well as another, with a common conſent, that none of them might eſcape, of what kind authority, or edition ſoever. <hi>And burned them before all men;</hi> voluntarily, and not by compulſion of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58142:25"/>
Law; evidently, and not under a pretext; and that to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſatisfaction, as well of the world, as of the Church. And what books were they, that were thus ſerved? Books of <hi>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arts;</hi> Unheard-of curioſities, and well-worthy to be unſeen. But what? would the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> thus exrenuate the malefice and malignity of their contents? or would he thus, if not elevate, yet alieniate their fludies, or rather <hi>Practices?</hi> Oh no; but to inform us that the books were worthy to be burnt, not only for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe curioſity; but for the triviall impertinency that was in them. And ſo much the originall word imports properly; and ſo inſtructs further: that magicall aſtrologicall and chymicall books; and all ſuch works upon which a man beſtowes ſuperfluous pains (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unneceſſary, uſeleſs, unprofitable, impertinent, beſides a mans own calling, and to no edification of others) are good for nothing elſe, but to be burned.

Ah! who ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our Magicians, Aſtrologers, and Chymiſts to doe ſo? Prize they not their old miſty fragments, and freſh two penny Pamphlets more than ſo? Nay, will they not hazzard the burning of their ſouls, rather than the burning of their books? And if they will not beſtow the burning of them; who will ſave them the labour, and doe it for them? Ah ſhame, and woe of ſuperſtition and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! what books (now of late are grown into requeſt with many) more than theſe? Is not <hi>the Book,</hi> the book of books layd aſide; while theſe are taken up? Here is Divinity ſet after Divination, and Prophecies undervalued to preſages; and promiſes, to <hi>Promiſers,</hi> and the Goſpell to their <hi>Goetie.</hi> How are the <hi>Planetarian elections</hi> preferred to the election of grace? and men more inquiſitive now after their <hi>fatall deſtiny;</hi> than eternall predeſtination? If this be not a juſt complaining let the Time ſpeak; If this be not a right arguing let the Text ſpeak. They burnt their books, <hi>ſo mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed.</hi> The growth and prevalency of Gods word was the cauſe of burning their books: and ſo was this a ſigne of that. Now God grant that his word may <hi>grow</hi> in mens hearts and conſciences, and prevail againſt mens errours, and opinions: and then we may eaſily gheſſe what will ſoon become of all theſe gheſſing books; and the like.</p>

                  <p>There is nothing more effectuall to drive away evill Spirits, than muſicall harmony (for they being fallen from that coeleſtiall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, cannot indure any true conſort, as being an enemy to them, but fly from it.)

                  <p>Hence (for the naturall dignifying of a perſon fit to be a true perfect Magician) ſo great care is taken in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that he be not <hi>polluted</hi> by a <hi>dead carcaſſe,</hi> or by a <hi>woman, a widow,</hi> or menſtruous; that he be free from <hi>leproſie, flux of blood, burſtnes,</hi> and be <hi>perfect in all his members;</hi> not <hi>blind,</hi> not <hi>lame,</hi> not <hi>crook-backt,</hi> or with an <hi>ill-favoured noſe.</hi>

                  <p>Of this ſort were the Gods of the Nations, which did rule and govern them, which <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf in <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> calleth <hi>Gods of the earth.</hi> To the which all Nations were attributed, not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying others, than the heavenly ſtarrs, and their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>That the heavens, and the heavenly bodies are animated with certain divine ſouls, is not only the opinion of <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;</hi> but alſo the aſſertion of the Sacred Scriptures, and of the Catholicks For <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> alſo deſcribeth <hi>the ſoul of heaven.</hi> Coeleſtiall bodies are animated, becauſe they are ſaid to receive commands from God; which is only agreeable to a reaſonable nature; for it is written, <hi>I have injoyned a command on all the ſtars.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Job</hi> ſeemeth to have fully granted, that the ſtar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Maſters of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> think, that the names of <hi>Angells</hi> were impoſed on them by <hi>Adam;</hi> according to that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>he Lord brought all things which he had made unto</hi> Adam, <hi>that he ſhould name them: and as he called any thing, ſo the name

                  <p>Many prophecying Spirits were wont to ſhew themſelves, and be aſſociats with the ſouls of them that were purified; examples whereof there are many in ſacred writ.

                  </p>
                  <p>There is a kind of frenzy which proceeds from the mind of the world. This doth by certain ſacred myſteries, vows, ſacrifices, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorations, innovations, and certain ſacred arts, or certain ſecret confections, by which the Spirit of their God did infuſe vertue, make the ſoul riſe above the mind, by joyning it with deities and <hi>Daemons.</hi> So we read concerning the <hi>Ephod,</hi> which being applyed, they did preſently propheſy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rabbi Levi</hi> affirmeth that no propheticall dream can be kept back from his effect, longer than twenty two years. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> dreamed in the ſeventeenth year of his age, and it was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the 39. year of his age.</p>
                  <p>A humane ſoul when it ſhall be rightly purged, and expiated, doth then, being looſed from all impurity, break forth with a liberall motion, aſcends upwards, receives divine things, inſtructs it ſelf, when happily it ſeems to be inſtructed elſewhere; neither doth it then need any remembrance or demonſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of the induſtry of it ſelf: as by its mind (which is the head and Pilot of the Soul) it doth (imitating by its own nature the Angels) attain to what it deſires; not by ſucceſſion or time, but in a moment. For <hi>David,</hi> when he had not learning, was of a <hi>Sheepheard</hi> made a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and moſt expert of divine things. <hi>Salomon</hi> in the dream of one night, was filled with the knowledge of all things above and below. So <hi>Iſaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and the other <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were taught.</p>
                  <p>If there be a deprecation (a magicall deprecation) made for the deſtruction of enemies; let it be commemorated, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the <hi>Gyants</hi> in the <hi>Deluge</hi> of waters; and the builders of

                     <hi>Babel,</hi> in the confuſion of tongues: <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> in the rayning of fire; the hoſte of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Red Sea; and the like: adding to theſe, ſome maledictions out of the <hi>Pſalms;</hi> or ſuch as may be gathered out of other places of Scripture. In like manner, when we are to deprecate (ſtill magically deprecate) againſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of waters; let us commemorate the ſaving of <hi>Noah</hi> in the flood; the paſſing of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> thorough the Red Sea; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> walking dry ſhod upon the waters, and ſaving a Ship from ſhipwrack, commanding the winds, and waves, and lifting up <hi>Peter</hi> ſinking in the waters of the Sea, and ſuch like. But if a prayer be neceſſary for obtaining oracles, or dreams, whether it be to <hi>God, Angels,</hi> or <hi>Hero's;</hi> there are many places offer themſelves out of the old Teſtament, where God is ſaid to talk with men; promiſing (in very many places) preſages, and revelations; beſides the propheticall dreams of <hi>Jacob, Joſeph, Pharoah, Daniel, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> in the old Teſtament, and the Revelation of <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in the new.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, certain confections (magicall confections) are called holy, into which God hath put the ſpeciall beam of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: as we read in <hi>Exodus,</hi> of <hi>the ſweet perfume,</hi> and <hi>Oyl of annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>

Since therefore the Soul is not of ſuch infinite vertue; but that nature hath limited her to her own Law, of apprehending things, either by ſpeciall revelation, common illumination of reaſon, or ſenſible collection: how then hath the <hi>Ideaes, ſpecies,</hi> or <hi>Images,</hi> of all things (eſpecially things future) lodg'd in her? Thoſe imperfect <hi>Ideaes, ſpecies,</hi> or <hi>images</hi> that are in the mind; are they there properly? and not rather accidentally; <hi>ſc.</hi> from the apprehenſion either of ſome things preſent, or elſe paſt? we know there are in men ſenſes, to obſerve things preſent; and memory, to recollect many things paſt; and underſtanding, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive ſome things that may come of certain cauſes, or may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure fall out according to probable conjectures: yea and Faith likewiſe, to believe what ſhall be by divine revelation and promiſe. But what naturall abſtract faculty call they that, that can foreſee, and foretell things future, from impreſt <hi>Ideaes, ſpecies, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> &amp;c. What though there be in the Soul a naturall faculty (called memory) to record, or recall things paſt, is there therefore an oppoſite faculty (called who can tell what?) whereby to divine of things to come? If there were ſuch a faculty or power, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to memory; why ſhould it preſage or predict one future thing, and not another: ſince the memory is able to recollect one paſt thing, as well as another? What tell they us of the naturall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of Beaſts; and frequent predictions of Fools, mad men, Infants, of men ſleeping, dreaming, diſtracted, dying? will they make ordinaries, of extraordinaries; and univerſals, of ſingulars;

and common motions, of heroicall: or elſe, ſubtilties, of phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies; ſagacities, of imbecillities; and direct preſages, of occult and confuſed inſtincts? What if brutes have a naturall inſtinct, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of ſome future effects, whoſe cauſes notwithſtanding they underſtand not: muſt a reaſonable Soul therefore naturally divine of thoſe things, whoſe naturall cauſes it knows not? But admit there were ſuch a naturall impreſt faculty of the Soul or mind, as <hi>ſpecies</hi> abſtracted, or collected within it ſelf, to divine, predict, or prognoſticate by: we then urge their own argument againſt themſelves; what need it to look out to the Stars, or to any other creature (in heaven or earth) to that end and purpoſe? One thing indeed both we, and they are convinced of; that there is in all our Souls a naturall faculty <hi>(called Conſcience)</hi> greatly addicted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging: which (if it be juſtly judging, and not erroneouſly opining) will preſage more directly, and certainly of effects, and conſequents (temporall, ſpirituall, eternall, good, bad, happy, unhappy, of hopes, and fears) than can all the <hi>Planets,</hi> although they conſpired to prognoſticate in one conjunction.

Now though ſome ſuch things may be yeelded to ſimple <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomie:</hi> yet who can make any of all theſe plainly appear in ſophiſticated <hi>Aſtrologie?</hi> As nature in it ſelf intends the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every creature: ſo all that it can intend in any Art, is the uſefulneſs and benefit to humane Society.

Now if they had not been put to this plunge of natures irregularity; peradventure we had never heard of thoſe erronious, nay and hereticall devices, of the Stars being animate, rationall, divine. But if they think to elude us, with urging the naturall ſubjection or ſubordination of the <hi>Inferior</hi> creatures, to the <hi>Superior;</hi> we doe them to wit, that the ſuperiority and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of the creature (as pertaining to this point) is to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not from the externall place, or poſiture, but from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall gift or endowment.

Being (as is their own word) <hi>anaitiologicall;</hi> or not having any naturall cauſe at all.</p>

Of all the cauſes of humane actions, and accidents (God, Angells, Devills the will of mans mind, the temperature of his body, externall violences, accidentall occurrences, and the ſtarres influences) whether theſe laſt (of all the reſt) be not the moſt remote, and feeble in their operation?</p>

3. Whether the Artiſts, in their Predictions ought not to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves (if the Art may admit of moderation) according to this known order, and received diſtinction of cauſes? 1. Some Cauſes produce their effects neceſſarily, and alwayes: and thoſe Cauſes being underſtood and diſcerned, the effect may certainly be pronounced and prenuntiated; as in <hi>Eclipſes.</hi> 2. Some Cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain produce their effects, though not neceſſarily, and alwayes; yet for the moſt part, and ſeldome faill: and ſuch may be Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only conjecturally, but not peremptorily; as the changes, or alterations of <hi>Weather,</hi> 3. Some Cauſes are only generall remote, indefinite, indeterminate, partiall, accidentall; whoſe effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low neither neceſſarily, nor alwayes nor for the moſt part, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſcare at all (as in <hi>tempers</hi> and <hi>manners)</hi> and ſuch, as they cannot be foreknown; ſo they are not to be foretold. But as for more rationall, and arbitrary actions, and future contingents meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortuitous; theſe can have no Cauſes all, but in the ſecret and hidden will of God; or elſe in the indiſcernable will of man: and therefore are in Gods power alone; and not in mans art, either to forknow, or foreſee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the ſtarres be not only <hi>Signes,</hi> but <hi>Cauſes?</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Signes, where they are ordinarily no Cauſes? or Cauſes, where they are no Signes? or (as they ask of <hi>Comets)</hi> whether they be either cauſing or ſigning from their matter, or from their form? Eſpecially to our purpoſe; whethrr they be both Cauſes and Signes of things future and fortuitous? Cauſes they cannot be but of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things; and they generall only, and indefinite. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be Signes of determinate and particular effects. For if they ſigne not the cauſes in particular; how can they ſign the effects in particular? Again, Signes naturall they cannot be, but either as Cauſes, or effects, or elſe as proceeding from the ſame common cauſe and ſuperiour to both. And that common cauſe cannot bee corporeall: becauſe there is no bodily thing ſuperiour to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodyes. That ſuperiour Cauſe therefore (upon which they both depend) muſt needs be incorporeall; even <hi>God;</hi> not <hi>Angells,</hi> becauſe Angels have no ſuch <hi>tranſient</hi> action common to them both. If therefore they be ſo much as Signes, they are only ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divine ordinance and inſtitution; and not according to any humane art, or invention.</p>

at all? And for as much as ſuch <hi>aſtrall</hi> effects, as have their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes, can be forecold but conjecturally, and indefinitely; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what grounds then doe they particularly define and determine upon caſualties, and voluntaries, whoſe events are not ſo much as probable; as not having any ſuch cauſes as aforeſaid?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether the Cauſes (namely the ſecond and particular cauſes) of meer accidents and contingents, are to be foreſeen and foreknown by mortall men?

Not in themſelves, becauſe they yet are not. Nor in their cauſes, for they are either God, or the heavens, or mans free will. And firſt, how are they able to foreknow thoſe things that depend upon the prime cauſe Gods ſecret will, and abſolute pleaſure, without his ſpeciall revelation?

Yea are but mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cauſes at moſt, and therefore betoken, or effect nothing of the actions of the mind or Soul. Then, for the will of Man (which is the proximate cauſe in all arbitrary actions) how can they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge of that?

If in his will, how come the Stars to neceſſitate that free faculty? If in his temper, ſuch a diſpoſition is eaſie to be foreſeen, without a Planetary Prognoſtication. If ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, it is either God, or the Creature. If God he is free to work both without the ſtarres, and againſt them. If the creature, how

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. ALthough ſome certain demonſtrations, or demonſtrative reaſons (borrowed from <hi>Arithmetick, Geometry,</hi> and <hi>Opticks)</hi> may be conceded to <hi>Aſtronomie;</hi> becauſe it is a Science that keeps it ſelf to naturall motions, and meaſures, ends, and uſes: yet whether all they ought to be uſurped by, or allowed to <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> in as much as it tranſgreſſes all theſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether (beſides the exaction of a blind and implicite Faith) the rejection and deriſion of ſound and explicite reaſon and demonſtration (done by <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers)</hi> be not a neceſſary demonſtration of the vacuity or want of <hi>reaſon,</hi> to the Artiſts, or their Art?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether <hi>Reaſon</hi> be not ſuperiour and predominant to the power of the Starres? For ſay (after their own order) the ſtarres may have their influences upon tempers and humours; and ſo upon paſſions and affections; and ſo upon manners and actions; and ſo upon iſſues and events; yet <hi>Reaſon</hi> is not deſtitute of ſuch means and ſuccours, as may temper thoſe humours, moderate thoſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prevent thoſe actions; what then becomes of thoſe events? Whom then will they make their Aſtrologicall Prognoſtications to be powerfull over, but ſenſuall men or knaves; or perſwaſive to, but unreaſonable men or Fooles? For rationall men will ſtill be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeing the ſtarres are not powerfull upon-reaſon, nor above it: how can their power ſtand againſt it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If reaſon be predominant to Divination; nay, if it be made conducible to divining Predictions; why then have the moſt bruitiſh and barbarous people of all the world, been alwayes moſt addicted thereunto? Why durſt it never peep forth among knowing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; ſave only in times of greateſt ignorance and ſuperſtition; or elſe upon occaſion of the diſcontinuance, or diſcountenance of good learning? And further, why are they reputed, and recorded to be moſt apt, as well as moſt frequent in Divinings and Propheſyings;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58142:54"/>
when <hi>Reaſon</hi> is moſt ſuſpended, obſcured, and debarred (as in ſleeps, dreams, abalienations, diſtractions, phrenzies, furies.) Nay, why are they moſtly obſerved, when breaking forth from the mouths of children, fools, mad-men, melancholy, fanatick, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraught, dying, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether the <hi>New</hi> Aſtrologers are able to give better reaſons for their divining or predicting art or faculty; than the <hi>old ones</hi> did? All which are either ſo falſe, as that they make nothing for them: or elſe ſo contrary, as that they make altogether againſt them. As conſider them in thoſe their arguments; If there be no preſignification of things future, then there are no <hi>Gods.</hi> Were there <hi>many Gods</hi> indeed, they might be too many to keep counſell: but there is <hi>one God,</hi> who will admit no creature here to be his Counſellour. Again, then are they ignorant of future things. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure ſuch <hi>Gods</hi> may not know one anothers minds or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or yet actions: but <hi>a God</hi> knows all things paſt, preſent, future, and is only known to himſelf; and it is ſufficient for the being of any thing, that he himſelf alone knows it to be. Again, it is then becauſe they are not able to declare them. In <hi>one God,</hi> his pleaſure of revealing, is his power to reveal. Again, then they love not men. Gods love is to communicate himſelf to the creature accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will, and according to its kind. Again, elſe it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they envy us this knowledge. Envy is at anothers good; and therefore not in him, that can ſee no good which is not his own. Again, or elſe it is becauſe they think it pertains not to men to fore-know things to come: or that it befits not their divine Majeſty to preacquaint humane creatures with then. Theſe latter indeed are true aſſertions, of the true God; and irrefragable argumentations againſt any truth of a predicting or preſaging art.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How will they anſwer an <hi>Heathen Philoſopher</hi> thus queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, or reaſoning againſt them? ſhall we attend to the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fation of irrationals, and inanimate; and not reſt our ſelves ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the confariation of reaſonable men? what reaſon can more move to think all their divination to be nothing, than that they can give no reaſon for it? what reaſon can the <hi>Aruſpex</hi> give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why the inſpection of the <hi>liver</hi> or <hi>lights</hi> ſhould deſign times and actions for lucky, or unlucky? What can the <hi>Augur,</hi> why a bird flying on the righthand, or on the left, ſhould preſage this or that for fortunate, or unfortunate? What can the Aſtrologer? why the ſtarre of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> conjoyned with the <hi>Moon,</hi> ſhould be

ſo benign to the birth of a child: and (on the contrary) that of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> ſo malignant? Wherefore ſhould they make God to be ſo buſie, to inſtruct men ſleeping: and ſo careleſly (as it were) to neglect men waking? And what reaſon is there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>for this? that <hi>Caſſandra</hi> in a diſtracted fury, ſhould foreſee things future: which <hi>Priamus</hi> with all his collected prudence, and deliberate, cannot doe?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether this be a ſufficient reaſon (to bear ſway with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men,) That therefore ſo little reaſon is it to be rendred, for the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Magick and Aſtrologie (as they call them) leſt men might ſo ſlight them, as common things: and not value them as rarities, or <hi>unheard-of curioſities?</hi> Nay, becauſe they want <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is the main of every humane art; is it not therefore that they ſo univerſally and earneſtly exact <hi>Faith:</hi> and ſuch a faith as is proper only to a divine Faith?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whether an Aſtrologers formall affirmation, be as good as an infallible demonſtration? Elſe, why prove they it not by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> (divine, morall, naturall, yea, or artificiall) when they ſay, that ſuch, or ſuch a conjunction of the Planets, ſignifies innovation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, removall of Churches, mutation of States, tranſlation of Kingdomes, tranſmigration of Nations, depoſition of Princes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Magiſtrates, perſecution of Miniſters, ruine of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, diſſenſion of Lawyers, loſſe of Merchants, wrack of Mariners, breaking of Tradeſmen, undoing of Farmers, deſolation of Cities, depopulation of Countries, mortality of Men, murrain of Cattell, dearth of Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all theſe through hereſies, ſects, factions, blaſphemies, profanations, impieties, hypocriſies, pride, ambition, covetouſneſſe, luſts, treacheries, conſpiracies, ſeditions, tumults, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, warres, battells, murders, thefts, robberies, oppreſſion, fraud, diſſimulation, hatred, envy, hunger, diſeaſes, fires, waters, tempeſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all theſe by Superiours, Inferiours, Neighbours, Servants, Children, Wives, Husbands, Kindred, Friends, Enemies, Strangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We know there may be innumerable ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences or caſualties in the world, and that by ſuch means or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: but how prove they that the Starres are either the Signs or Cauſes of them? If they put us off with this only, That the Diſciples, and Auditors in Aſtrologie muſt be believers: Let them tell us from what neceſſity they impoſe this duty; otherwiſe they ſay nothing, or nothing but ſay, and ſo leave both our faith, reaſon, and ſenſes unſatisfied.</p>

9. Since (as they ſay themſelves) the Influences of the Starres are ineffectuall; as neither apt, nor convenient to produce agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects, in the matter of <hi>Sublunary</hi> things; unleſs there be a proportionable, equall, or juſt meaſure and mixture in their <hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations;</hi> and that without either exceſſe, or defect: How then ſhall we believe them in their prognoſticated effects; if ſuch a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as they ſpeak of) be not firſt demonſtrated unto us?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whether all ſuch Aſtronomicall demonſtrations, as are of pure Aſtronomicall effects from the ſtaries (as of hot, cold, dry, and moyſt) be any reall proofes (in Aſtrologie) of beneficall, and maleficall influences, of vertuous and vitious efficacies, of fortunate or unfortunate events? For as much as theſe differ, as naturall and preternaturall; as neceſſary and arbitrary, as conſequentiall and caſuall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Where are the influences of the ſtarres received? and how? How can they by fair experience prove they are preſent in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Muſt we truſt the <hi>four corners</hi> of a <hi>Figure?</hi> is this all their evidence? thus we are taught to examine them by one of their own neighbours. And therefore they ſhall give me leave to queſtion with them a little further. That Caeleſtiall vertue or efficacy, which either Cauſes or Signes ſuch terreſtriall effects as they pretend; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it created, or uncreated? If uncreated, how comes it in, or from the Stars? If created, where reſides, or remains it all the while, untill it take effect? In the Conjunction of the Planets? Why that is not, becauſe gone and paſt. In the party himſelf? Then hath every one the cauſe of his own fortune within himſelf; and ſo need thank no man (but himſelf) for his riches, peace, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, preferment: nor yet blame any other, for his impoveriſhing, diſgrace, wounds, and death.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Whether the influences of the Stars be a ſimple extract, or elſe a compoſirion; as it ſhould ſeem by their conjunctions? And then, for as much as they impend, and operate at once, how can they tell to which of them they ſhould particularly, and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly referre the effect?</p>
               <p n="13">13. If the influences of the Stars incline either to vertue or to vice; and their efficacies be propenſe either to recompenſe one, or other: why then are their conſtellations recorded to have been ſo malefick (for the moſt part) to the vertuous; and ſo benefick, to the vitious?</p>
               <p n="14">14. What power can the Stars have either in the determination,

If there be no Stars in the Heavens idle, or vacant; but that all of them have their influx, and operation upon theſe inferiors: and infinite of them (as Aſtronomers acknowledge) whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; nature; and power, are altogether unknown (and the unknown aſpects, poſitures, conjunctions, poſſibly thwarting, and impeding the known) And the known, not perfectly known; and if they were known never ſo exactly, yet not to be infallibly applyed to particulars; No nor yet with fair probability to be prenuntiated or pronounced upon: Can an effect be concluded for known, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, probable, particular; from an unknown, uncertain, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, generall cauſe, or means? Doe not they themſelves ſay that the Stars operate by an occult quality (like to that of the <hi>load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtane</hi> upon <hi>iron)</hi> by a ſecret ſympathie or antipathie; by an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible influx, by a vertuall contract, and after an inexplicable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Wherefore then are they ſo peremptory in pronouncing, or predicting: where they are ſo impotent and confuſed in apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; or expreſſing?</p>
               <p n="16">16. Either the Stars doe inflow, and impreſt, yea portend, and ſignify perpetually; or not. If ſo; how then is it, that they are no more univerſally obſerved (as concerning all, or any) nay, why work, and ſign they not at one time, as well as another; in one place, as well as another; to one perſon, as well as another; in one action, as well as another? If not; then how doe they it after natures or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and order; which is not only conſtant and continuall; but common, and generall?</p>
               <p n="17">17. If the Soul be not <hi>ex traduce,</hi> or drawn out of the matter (and conſequently corruptible, and mortall) what power then can thoſe materiall influences have over it; and over the powers of it?</p>

For how can it be properly called a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,</hi> if it once be plainly foreſeen, or certainly foretold? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nature and property of a meer contingent, is to be ſo, both in reſpect of the active, and of the paſſive power: <hi>viz.</hi> unknown, ſudden, indeterminate, incogitate, rare, ſeldome alike, potentiall, not actuall, not neceſſary, from no naturall, or neceſſary cauſe.

               <p n="28">28. How can a contingent be foreknown, or foreſeen? that is, ſeen, before it be ſeen? In as much as the knowledge of ſuch a thing is primarily, and directly to the ſenſes: and but ſecondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and accidentally to the underſtanding.</p>

How the poſitions, and motions of the ſtars can either cauſe, or ſign a future contingent? when as divine providence diſpoſes of both theſe, after a quite contrary manner. For the poſitions and motions of the ſtars are diſpoſed of according to a neceſſity; that they muſt needs ſo be; but future contingents are diſpoſed of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a contingency; that they may be otherwiſe; or may not be at all.

For as much as the ſame Starres or Planets, have not the ſame aſpects, or conjunctions, in all places; and ſome ſtarres are to be diſcerned in one place, and not in another: Now then, muſt not the judiciall Aſtrologer make his judgement either from one place, and not from another? or elſe, muſt he not be in many places at once, to make his obſervation compleat? Or elſe, what judgement can he make?</p>
               <p n="32">32. Seeing the heavens, and ſtarres are ſo diſtant; the eye-ſight ſo infirm, and the ſenſes ſo oft deceived in the proper object; and the Artiſts obſervation tyed up to one ſingle and weak ſenſe: Is it not now with ſtarre-gazers peeping at the Planets; as with Saylors, to whom the Earth, Caſtles, Woods and Mountains doe ſeem to move? and as things ſingle afarre off ſeem double; and black things white, or white things black; and as a ſtraight oar part in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and part out of it, appears crooked and broaken? what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain judgement then can here be to reaſon, from a ſolitary ſenſe, ſo eaſily, and oft deceived?</p>
               <p n="33">33. Since things inanimate, or liveleſſe, are naturally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, and ſubject to things of life; things lively, to things ſenſible; things ſenſible, to things reaſonable; and things reaſonable, to things ſpirituall: how comes it to paſſe, that men ſhould be bound, and conſtrained by the ſtarres; and <hi>Devills</hi> (through the ſtarres) bound and compelled by Men? What reaſon can the <hi>Magician</hi> give for this binding of devills and Spirits? and the Aſtrologer, for this binding of men, and wills? For to me it ſeems unreaſonable, rhat unreaſonable creatures (ſuch as the ſtarres are) ſhould have the Dominion, and power aſſigned over rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Souls.</p>

Whether both the ſwiftneſs, and the ſlowneſs of the ſtarres motions, hinder not their influences, and impreſſions upon inferior and ſublunary matters? at leaſtwiſe inhibit not the obſervation? above all, forbid not the prognoſtication thereupon? For if (as themſelves have ſayd) the heavenly bodyes move with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation and celerity, as to change their face <hi>ten thouſand times a day:</hi> how is it poſſible there ſhould either be any impreſſion on the ſtarres part, or obſervation on the Artiſts and art, in a tranſiency ſo imperceptible?</p>

35. In as much as the ſtarres move ſo rapidly, as in a poynt, or moment of time; and every point or moment of time makes an immenſe alteration in the heavens; and every point of alteration, is of moment to alter the Conſtellation; and the leaſt altering of the Conſtellation occaſions a vaſt aberration to the Calculator: Adde to all theſe how hard it is to obſerve, and compare the points and moments of the Childs birth: What point of diſcretion was it then, to make any matter of moment, of a Genethliacks calculation?</p>
               <p n="36">36. What naturall reaſon is to be rendred why the ſtarres ſhould be more notable for influentially operating, and efficaciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining at the point of the edition, parturition, or birth; and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the generation, conception, formation, delineation, animati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (beſides the whole courſe of life and conſervation) Since not in that, but in theſe is the great operation of the <hi>vitall ſpirits;</hi> the diſpoſition, mixture, and temper of the Elements; the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſtitution, union, and perfection of the whole?

               <p n="37">37. Whether doe thoſe ſtarres bear more ſway, that rule at the beginning, or thoſe that rule at the end of a buſineſs? would not one impute moſt to them, that are in force at the making up of the match? Wherefore then doe they teach men (not only ſo ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, but ſo prepoſterouſly) to look only to thoſe ſtarres that reign at the undertaking of an enterprize: and not to heed thoſe rather that have the dominion at the diſpatch?</p>
               <p n="38">38. Are the ſtarres only ſigning things future, and not deſigning things preſent? And doe the ruling Planets enact decrees, and make lawes (contrary to all other Rulers) only to be in force, or take effect, after their own depoſition, or deceaſe? Elſe, how is it, that the conjunction, or conſtellation at the Birth, ſhould be ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at the death; it ſelf being paſt, and as it were decreaſt long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

               <p n="1">1. VVHether it may not pleaſe <hi>Almighty God</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome experiments, or effects of Magick, and Aſtrologie; for the ſame intents, as he doth thoſe of <hi>malefice,</hi> and <hi>ſorcery?</hi> (Nay, and indeed, as in all other wicked wayes.) Namely, 1. For the magnifying of his own wiſedome, juſtice, and power. His power, in that though the fallen creature may will evill of it ſelf: yet is it not able to act all it wills, without his power or permiſſion. His juſtice, in deſerting the creature to its own pravity and malice; and ſo puniſhing ſinne with ſinne. His wiſedome, in ſo directing it, as to work good out of evill. 2. For the convincing of the Devill, of the malice of his own will, of the wretchedneſs of his own power; and of the fallacy of his own Art. In that he would doe more malefice if he might; can doe nothing but by permiſſion; promiſes nothing but ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guouſly, becauſe he is not certain himſelf, till he have tempted God. 3. For the dereliction of the Artiſts, or Actors, to the deluſion of a falſe Faith, a bold temptation, and proud curioſity. Becauſe they believe without a promiſe, and ſo believe the Devill, more than God. They tempt the Devill, as well as God; that is, tempt the Devill, to tempt God. They are inquiſitive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of thoſe things, which are neither for them nor Devills, but for God alone to know. 4. For the execution, obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deluſion of their credulous and ſuperſtitious <hi>Proſelytes</hi> and <hi>Clients,</hi> in the vanity of their carnall hopes and fears. Becauſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58142:59"/>
they will not receive the love of the truth, but will chooſe their own deluſions, and truſt to <hi>lying wonders,</hi> after <hi>Satans</hi> working (which are praeſtigious experiments) for this cauſe God alſo choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their deluſions, yea, ſends them <hi>ſtrong deluſions</hi> (confirmed not only by inward perſwaſions, but outward experiments) that they ſhould believe a lye: <hi>ſc.</hi> vain obſervations, prognoſtications, and predictions. 5. For the tryall of the Faith, Patience, and Prudence of the ſaints. That they may learn to believe, not becauſe of a ſenſible experiment, but becauſe of a ſpirituall promiſe; And may ſubmiſſively admire Gods permiſſion, not believing raſhly every preſaging ſpirit; but diſcreetly trying the ſpirits, whether they are of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How can that be a ſufficient proof of the verity of any Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or of the lawfulneſs of any Art; which the <hi>Devill</hi> makes to be the chiefeſt means of his own ſcience, and the only proof of his own art? For is not the Devills main knowledge <hi>experimentall;</hi> or gotten by long experience of times, and men, and things? And glories he not in this, that he may be permitted to ſet before mens eyes ſome externall experiment, that ſo he may win their hearts to give credit to his preſtigious deluſions? Yea, may not the Devill be permitted to give an experiment in ſome things; that ſo his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may become the more curious, tempting, credulous, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, even in thoſe things, where there can be no experiment at all?</p>

                     <hi>XII.</hi> From the Conſciouſneſs of Caveats.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHether ſuch an art muſt not needs be both unſound in the ſtudy, and ſearch of it; and unſafe in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and aſſent thereto; that conſiſts more in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and corrections; than in rules, and directions?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore doe the more wary <hi>I heoriſts</hi> in Aſtrologie, ſtill give ſo many cautions (ſo often repeated) to the raſh Artiſts, or practitioners; to take heed of Chaldaizing Judaizing, Paganizing; of Idolatry, Atheiſm, Superſtition; of Sorcery, inchantment, witchcraft; of curioſity, temerity, tempting of God; of impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adjuration, conjuration; of circulatory, joculatory, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigious deluſion; of pride, arrogance, impudence; of impiety, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, profaneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it not becauſe of the arts obnoxiouſneſs, and the Artiſts proneneſs to all theſe, and the like?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether their diſtinguiſhing betwixt Magick <hi>Theurgicall,</hi> and <hi>Goeticall;</hi> black, and white; naturall, diabolicall, and (as ſome adde) divine; of Aſtrologie naturall, ſupernaturall, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; of both theſe Jewiſh, Heatheniſh, Chriſtian; of the arts perfection, and imperfection; or rather of the arts integrity and the Artiſts imbecillity; of the practices lawfulneſs, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; of the uſe, and abuſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not indeed a conſciouſneſs and conviction of the worſe part; rather than any demonſtration or declaration of the better?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whats the reaſon they adviſe ſo often to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt neceſſary, and probable; betwixt infallible and conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall? but becauſe ther's no other diſcipline, that is, or can be invented, that hath ſo little infallibility, or certainty; and ſo much contingency, or uncertainty. What certain judgement then of future contingents can be by ſuch an art, or diſcipline; that is it ſelf but a kind for contingency?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether they themſelves that would ſeem very ſcrupulous and preciſe in diſtinguiſhing and diſcerning truth, and falſehood; good, and evill; lawfull, and unlawfull; in Magicall Aſtrologie: doe not in very deed commix and confound them, in one kind or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58142:64"/>
another? and ſo impinge upon the ſelf ſame rock they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to avoid. Is this caution; or colluſion? For doubtleſs, this is done not that they would be more wary and conſcientious them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of what they deliver: but to make others more unwary and ſecure in receiving and approving what is delivered.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether as (with the Patrons and Advocates of Aſtrologie) it ſeems to be a ſober caveat among themſelves, to diſcern betwixt the uſe, and the abuſe: it be alſo a ſound plea to others, that they ſhould likewiſe diſtinguiſh them? For is it not requiſite that they themſelves ſhould firſt really, ſincerely, and clearly diſcern; ere that they injoyn others to diſtinguiſh? Now (in birth-ſpelling, and fortune-telling Aſtrologie) where is the uſe? nay wherein is not an abuſe? Should not they firſt here undertake to ſatisfy us, ere they take upon them to adviſe us? How loath would they be, we ſhould be too ſevere in this impoſed task; which they truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not; but only (enough for conviction) would ſeem to ſlubber over?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether this cautelous concluſion and (as they think) ſober ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <hi>(The Stars incline onely, but neceſſitate not)</hi> be verily delivered by Aſtrologers; or craftily propoſed in excuſe? For if they believe this their own ſaying, how then dare they be ſo peremptory in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing upon Fate, and fatidicall deſtiny from the Stars? But would they not thus evade the fallacy of the prognoſticated event? For, others are eaſily Judges of the effect: but if the execution fail, they thus make themſelves the ſole Judges of the diſpoſition. And ſo, from the hidden inclination, think to ſave the credit of their Art, againſt the palpable fruſtration of the effect. As alſo by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (who knows what?) oppoſites, interventions, obſtructions, impediments. And if they know not how Stars are averſing: how come they to know how they are inclining?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Was there ever yet a judiciary Aſtrologer that duly obſerved that old caution, given him by the Prince of his Profeſſion? not to mingle, among his predictions, nor at all to meddle with the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prognoſtication of all ſuch things as can have no naturall cauſes?</p>
               <p n="9">9. As concerning this caution, or conviction (by no means to ſubjugate the rationall will, with its arbitrary acts to the power of the Stars) how chance this is propoſed by ſome of them, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many, and yet obſerved by none?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whether their more than abundant cautelouſneſs, for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58142:65"/>
ſalving of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> (their many-fac't miſtreſſe in all her dreſſes or apparitions) be ſufficient ſo to doe? And how many aſcenſions, and deſcenſions; riſings, and ſettings; times and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt here be divined, ere it can come to Divination?</p>
               <p n="11">11. As touching Planetary events (benevolous, malevolent) whether their uſuall reſervation (for the time of their taking ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, how far they ſhall extend, how long laſt, or for their utter impediting) to be in God, in nature, in the prime cauſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence: be not a conviction within themſelves of their uncertain and doubtfull predictions; if not rather uſed as a fallacy to ſave their skill in caſe of fruſtration?</p>
               <p n="12">12. Whats the cauſe, in their own aphoriſms, canons, rites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are fain to admoniſh one another to ſuch cautelouſneſs in the reading of them; much more in the apprehending of them; moſt of all in the practiſing according to them? Is not here a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, and confeſt incidence to error; not only in the Reader, his apprehenſion, and practice; but even in the very rule or art it ſelf?</p>
               <p n="13">13. Whether it be not ſtill the trick and guiſe of Magicall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers, to adjure, and conjure (after the old Heatheniſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) their Diſciples, and Clyents; to beware how they once ſo much as intimate their venerable myſteries, and admirable ſecrets, to unskilfull (as they call them) and profane ears? And what is their intent in ſo doing? Surely ſuch kind of cautionary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring ſecrecy, as not to reveale to any (ſave only among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) the art, rules, tearms, characters, phraſes, figures, fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, operations, intentions, profections, defects, time, place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, habit, inſtruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what can all this argue, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of ſuperſtition, ſorcery, envy, ignorance, ſophiſtry, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigious jugling, and plain knavery?</p>
               <p n="14">14. Wherefore adviſe they ſo earneſtly both Agent, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, to take heed however of all heſitation, or doubting; either in doing or receiving? Doe they indeed reduce all the efficacy of their art to a Faith, or ſtrong imagination? and to the ſaith of one, as well as another? Nay, does all the vertue of the art conſiſt more in the inferiors confidence; than the ſuperiors influence?</p>
               <p n="15">15. Why bid they beware what aſſociats they take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the art; eſpecially in the operation? Does the efficacy of the art depend upon the dignity, not only of the Excerciſer; but his Aſſiſtant alſo?</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:58142:65"/>
16. To what purpoſe doe the Arch-Magicians and Aſtrologers make caution, and admoniſh ſo ſtrictly (upon pain to forfeit all the fruit.) That the Pupill be naturally inclined to the art; or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſpoſible thereto, by a faith in his Tutors ſufficiency? That he con ſuch words, tearms, phraſes, characters, figures (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed inſignificant, or of no proper entent) whereby he may preſerve cloſe the ſublime Majeſty of the art; glory in his own profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of learning; and upbraid others, eſpecially his oppoſites, with ignorance and unskilfulneſs. That he ſtudy other learning by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but this by himſelf. That he glory in the multiplicity of his Authors, more than their emendation. That he boaſt of an extraordinary gift, yet not beyond his Teachers; till hee can correct them in the invention of a new and nearer way. That he leave the order of ſuperiors, and inferiors, of aſcents and deſcents, of ſimilitude and diſſimilitude, of ſimple, and compounds. That he obſerve diligently matter, form, number, degree, time, place, order of operation: and eſpecially the Planet, or Lord of the operation; under whoſe dominion the ſpirit of the day, and hour is, for the effectuall operating. And laſtly, that he operate with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome above all. Were it not for this laſt, to what purpoſe were all the reſt of the directions? which are not only inobſervable by the Attenders: but in explicable (and ſo confeſt by) the propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themſelves. But weel take them at their word; let wiſedome be purſued to ſome purpoſe: and then all their other cautions, or conditions, will prove to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Whether the confuſed cautions of dayes, hours, minutes, points, numbers, meaſures, degrees, orders, harmonies, ſimilitudes, congruities, diſpoſitions, compoſitions, elections, preparations, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, fabrications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> argue not their art or artifice, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult vanity, an unprobable fiction, an impoſible operation?</p>
               <p n="18">18. What fickle, tickle, fallible arts are Magick, Aſtrologie, Alchymie? to have ſo many cautious directions, ceremonies, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances (and they ſo difficult to be apprehended, more difficult to be obſerved) and yet the ignorance (as they ſay) neglect, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the leaſt circumſtance enough to fruſtrate the whole ſubſtance or effect?</p>
               <p n="19">19. Upon what pretexet is it that ther are ſuch caveats in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, Aſtrologie, Alchymie, yea and Sorcery it ſelf; for faſting, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, cleanneſs of affections, members, garments, habitation, inſtruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince the arts themſelves are unclean and the beſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58142:66"/>
of them (by their own confeſſion) not throughly purged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from?</p>
               <p n="20">20. Is it not well known, that the Devill (even in the moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable arts, and acts of conjuration, inchantment, ſorcery, witch-craft) hath cautioned, admoniſhed, and exhorted to faſting, prayer, chaſtity, charity, juſtice, forbearing of certain ſins, frequenting of divine ordinances? Now will any ſay, theſe arts, or acts, were any whit the better, or ſafer, for thoſe cautionings, and conditionatings ſo p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erequired?</p>
               <p n="21">21. What good end elſe can there be of their own counſelling and warning, that an Aſtrologer be a man both expertly <hi>Ethicall,</hi> and <hi>Phyſicall?</hi> Save that, as he ſhould not exerciſe his own: ſo he ſhould not Prognoſticate of others manners; beyond all grounds of morality. And that he ſhould correct, or rather prevent his Aſtrologicall Prognoſtications, by true phyſicall principles.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Whether this be not a proper caution for all Aſtrologers; to forewarn one another, of gazing ſo long upon the ſtars, till they fall (as one of them did) into the ditch?</p>
               <p n="23">23. Whether it be not the beſt caveat that can be given to an Aſtrologer, and ſo confeſt by ſome of them, to account it moſt ſafe and ſure (after all inſpection of the ſtars) to look to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, for the conſtitution; to the temper, for qualities; to the will, for actions; to induſtry, and externall means for acquiſitions; and to divine providence, for events?</p>
               <p n="24">24. VVhether any ſound Orthodox Chriſtian ever did write in the approof of judiciary and predicting Aſtrologie? And if any ſuch have treated of the ſpeculation (if their recantation followed not after it) then with what moderation, and reiterated caution? yea and that ſo ſevere, ſo ſincere; as that a Chriſtian Reader might eaſily perceive, it was the caution which he intended (through the main of the diſcourſe) and not the Inſtitution?</p>

And their Hereſies moſt Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, Idolatrous, Superſtitious, Atheiſticall, Impious, Profane: Perverſly and Obſtinately impugning the great truth of God, and main fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion? Witneſs theſe few that follow, in compariſon of the many that might be collected, eſpecially out of their Rabbins, and apoſtate Authors.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>God</hi> himſelf is the chief <hi>Mathematician,</hi> and teaches Mathematicall things to the ſouls of men, making them capable of the ſcience, before they flit into bodies: which otherwiſe could not be, unleſs they had ſeen God acting the Mathematician in Heaven. 2. That not only nature, but God himſelf is ſubject to Chaldaicall, or Aſtrologicall fate. 3. That Heaven is the body of God, and the Stars are his eyes. 4. That God is aſſiſted and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by the Stars, in the prediction of effects upon things ſublunary. 5. That it is not God that make men juſt, but <hi>Jupiter.</hi> 6. That the Stars (both fixt, and errant) are Gods.</p>
               <p>7. That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> expected by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould come in the year 1464. after <hi>Chriſts</hi> nativity. Becauſe then would be the ſame conſtellation of the Stars, as was when <hi>Moſes</hi> brought the <hi>Hebrews</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 8. That it is lawfull and neceſſary to calculate the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 9. That from ſome ſiniſter aſpects in <hi>Chriſts</hi> nativity, his fortune and fate might eaſily have been predicted. 10. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore was eminent in ſo many vertues, becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi> was in <hi>Gemini</hi> aſcendent: For <hi>Gemini</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58142:71"/>
together with <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſignifies the birth of ſome great Prophet. 11. That the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was from the configuration of <hi>Mars.</hi> 12. That as the nativity, or firſt comming of Chriſt, was prefigured by a great wonderfull Planetary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: ſo ſhall his ſecond comming, or the day of judgement likewiſe. 13. That <hi>Saturn</hi> having part in <hi>Chriſts</hi> geniture, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him ſo ſad, and penſive, as that he was often ſeen to weep, never to laugh. 13. And that alſo made him ſeem older than he was: ſo that they took him to be near <hi>fifty,</hi> when he was not but about thirty years of age. 14. That <hi>Saturn</hi> meeting with <hi>Venus,</hi> was the cauſe of his having certain <hi>red ſpecks</hi> in his face. 15. And that becauſe of thoſe <hi>ſpecks,</hi> all his parts were not from God. 16. That all the miracles of the prophets, and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were wrought by the vertue of the <hi>Hebrew Letters.</hi> 17. That <hi>Chriſts</hi> hanging upon the <hi>croſs</hi> might have been foreſeen and foretold from his natalitiall ſtars. 18 That the ſtar which happened at <hi>Chriſts</hi> nativity, had the dominion, and regulation of his life, manners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, miracles, wiſedom, doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 19. That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man perfectly <hi>ſolary,</hi> was therefore raiſed again, upon the day aſſigned to the Sun. 20. That the Sun is the <hi>true light,</hi> and the moſt exact image of God himſelf: whoſe eſſence reſembles the <hi>Father,</hi> light the <hi>Son,</hi> and heat the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> called the conſpicuous Son of God, the divine image of divine intelligences, the perſpicuous ſtatue of God. 21 That the vertue of reſemblance betwixt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and an image (a <hi>Taliſmanicall,</hi> or conſtellationall image) did not only invite him to his naturall, but now alſo doth to his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall preſence amongſt us.</p>
               <p>22. That Magick is Primitively in God, Derivatively in the Creature. 23.

That Magick is nothing elſe but the will of the Creator revealed to, and planted in the Creature. 25 That the ſpots in the Moon, and about the Sun, ſucceeded upon <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion and fall. 26. That the <hi>Deluge,</hi> or univerſall Flood, was from the conjunction of Planets in <hi>Aquarius.</hi> 27. That the patefaction, or giving of the <hi>Law</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> did depend upon certain configurations. 28. That the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> yea and the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> were nothing elſe but <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or figures made under certain conſtellations. 29.

becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi> (who governs that day) might make the work unproſperous. 30.

That the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> (whereby it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about the ſucceſs of difficult affairs) had to that end, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of an <hi>Aſtrolabe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. That the <hi>Jews</hi> (from the diſpoſition of the ſtars) were born to Religion. 33. That the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion was unproſperous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was founded upon a malevolent ſtar. 34. That the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion is governed by <hi>Saturn;</hi> the <hi>Turkes,</hi> by <hi>Venus;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by <hi>Sol:</hi> which is the reaſon of their ſeverall Sabbath dayes. 35.

That it may be judged by the ſtars of a mans conſcience, of the moſt ſecret ſcruples, and inward feelings of it. 42. That by the ſtars it may be judged of mans love towards God; and of Gods again towards him. 43. That Aſtrologicall predictions may be made infallibly as concerning life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>44. That every kind of Divination is to be received and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a token of Gods benign providence. 45.

That the <hi>Hebrew Letters</hi> are the moſt efficacious of all, to Magicall and Aſtrologicall operation: becauſe they have the greateſt ſimilitude with celeſtials; and the world; and becauſe of the vertues of their numbers, which he that ſhall know, ſhall be able in every language, to draw forth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miſterys by their Letters: as alſo to tell what things have been paſt, and foretell things to come. 49.

               <p>54. That mens ſins and iniquities doe proceed neceſſarily from the ſtars: for they not only ſignify, but cauſe the ſame. 55. That it is not mans will that commits adultery, but <hi>Venus;</hi> nor that commits murder, but <hi>Mars;</hi> nor that commits theft, but <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi> 56. That all mens actions (good or bad) and the events of either, doe (by an indiſſoluble bond) depend neceſſarily upon the motions of the ſtars as the Lords of fate; and are therefore to be worſhipped. 57. That there are <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> which have their reſidence in the ſtars: and may (not amiſs) be prayed unto. 58. That the ſtars being prayed unto, doe hear our prayers; and beſtow celeſtiall gifts: not ſo much by any naturall agreement, as of their own free will. 59. That he who ſhall make any prayer (the <hi>Moon</hi> conjoyned with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in <hi>Leo)</hi> ſhall be ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of God whatſoever he askes. 60.

               <p>65. That conjunctions and influxes of the ſtars are potent, not only to raiſe dead bodies; but to make their ſouls appear viſible. 66. That (by Magicall and Mathematicall vertue) the ſame body

and the ſame ſoul are united together again in 440. years. 67. That there be two Planets the authors of all humane felicity: <hi>Venus</hi> of this preſent life; and <hi>Jupiter</hi> of the life to come. 68.

And becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them can be of any edification to the Church of God: but the uſe of them is a prophanation both of his Word and Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether there be any ſuch thing as Fate in nature, or in the world? And whether they that determine for it, doe aptly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it: or in the determination abſtract and exempt it from the very hetheniſh originall and acceptation? And whether all their diſtinctions of Fate be able to diſcern it, for a ſolide and ſober truth, in any part or reſpect? The <hi>Theologicall</hi> fate is abuſive; for that's not paganiſh fate, but divine providence. The <hi>Naturall</hi> fate is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; for that need be called no more but natures common order.

fancy. But what kind of Fate call they that which they make to ſit in the middle, and as it were hover in the balance, betwixt the deſultory levity of an indifferent caſualty; and the preſultory temerity of an urging, and inevitable neceſſity?</p>

And why doe our <hi>Fataries,</hi> and Fortunaries ſo confound them: eſpecially in their prognoſtications, or predictions?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have been more ſerious than the <hi>Poets,</hi> about the <hi>ſeries</hi> of Fate? As for the <hi>Poets,</hi> what child ſmiles not to read the pretty fictious of the three <hi>Fates,</hi> or <hi>fatall Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; Clotho, Lacheſis,</hi> and <hi>Atropos;</hi> yea, or of <hi>Nova, Decima,</hi> and <hi>Morta;</hi> and of their names, derivations, progenie, order, and offices? As for the <hi>Philoſophers (Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicures,)</hi> It were long to tell, how featly they have toſt both Fate and Fortune, too and fro in their ſundry argumentations, aſſertions, definitions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But (better than all their earneſt) it is excellent ſport which they make (in their Mythologies, Apologies, Hieroglyphicks, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> with Fortunes <hi>wheel</hi> and <hi>horn</hi> on the one hand: and Fates <hi>Diſtaffe</hi> and <hi>Spindle</hi> on the other.</p>

Me thinks the <hi>Stoicks</hi> (for all their gravity) doe but rayle, when they call her the Goddeſs of fools, an empty name, a verſatile wind, a ſhort Sunſhine, a ſudden tempeſt, a muddy torrent, a fools paradiſe, a labyrinth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her for blind, deaf, mad, brutiſh, inſtable, treacherous, envious, cruell <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Querulouſly accuſing her for playing with her own gifts; and ſporting her ſelf with humane mortality and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; turning all things upſide down, corrupting her own nature, or ruſhing upon her very ſelf, repenting of her good, rejoycing at her evill, taking the ſtronger part; regarding not vertue, but power; anſwering thoſe more, that dare, than that implore her; carrying on things againſt reaſon, prudence, counſell, vertue; moſt deceiving, where ſhe is moſt truſted; fooling all ſhe foſters; ſmiling and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at once; tampering her hony with poyſon; immoderate both in good and evill; ſtrangling at laſt her own nurſelings; exalting

But (in my mind) the <hi>Epicures</hi> (for all their levity,) reaſon better. For though they might return the many invectives againſt <hi>Fortune</hi> upon <hi>Fate,</hi> yet they ſoberly argue thus; If there be neceſſitating and enforcing fatation upon things, muſt not ſuch a thing be done by a man, whether he be inſtructed or exhorted to it or no? nay, ſhall he not doe it whether he will himſelf or no? Is not the deſtinating decree enough to bring all things about, although there were neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor care to goe about it? Does it not robb all rationall creatures of mind, will, counſell, deliberation, to tye them up to inevitable neceſſitie? How then are their proper motions reſerved, not only to rationalls, but to every moving creature? What natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeries of cauſes can there be betwixt intellectualls, rationalls, ſpiritualls, animals, inanimates, and artificialls? Is it not ridiculous, to make an indiſſoluble ſeries, or conjunction of cauſes, where (beſides a deity) reaſon, and accident are ever and anon making an interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Who will ſay, that all things are concludedby, and included under Fate? Is there not much arbitrarineſs, whether one man will beget another, or no? and much more, whether one man will kill another, or no? How can there be ſo much as a naturall fate or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity over men, when we ſee they are not all carryed one way: as things of one nature or kind (beaſts, birds, fiſhes, flyes) are? but men (although of one nature) are carryed diverſly, as their wits and affections lead them. Were people have ſundry Lawes, and they duly executed; how are they led along by their conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent edicts, rather than by the fatall decree of the Starres? Are the lawes of men and fate repugnant? and are theſe more prevalent than they? If all things be neceſſarily bound under Fate; what can be ſubject to reaſon, will, nature, occaſion, time, manners, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, counſell, ſociety, contingency, caſualty? Muſt not mens ſins and vices be neceſſary alſo, and inforced? Why ſhould he be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for offending, that is not able to reſiſt an impelling force? Is he to be blamed, that is not of his own power? we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vertue, but what praiſe of the vertuous, not ſo by labour and induſtry, but by fate and neceſſity? Doe not the Authors of Fate
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58142:83"/>
goe, and come; ſpeak, and keep ſilence; offer, and forbear; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and deliberate; procure, and prevent; exhort, and dehort, praiſe, and diſpraiſe; reward, and puniſh? and why ſhould they doe all this, if they did believe their own doctrine of Deſtiny? Why ſhould men ſtudy or labour, if their fate be ſufficient to make them both wiſe and rich? How many things are not as the Fates will but as we will our ſelves? Have the Fates determined that a man ſhall have children, that will not marry, nor once touch a woman? that he ſhall be wiſe, that will not learn? that he ſhall be liberall, that will not give? that he ſhall be drowned, that will not come neer the warer? that he ſhall dye in a ſtrange Country that will not travell? If Fate have appointed a wound, or a diſeaſe to the body, is there not a medicine and meat to cure it? but if it could intend any evill upon the ſoul or mind, yet is there not education, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to prevent it? Many things may be effected beſides nature: may they not much more then beſides Fate? If every man may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate his own Fortune, why not alſo contrive his own Fate? If Fate had never had name, or nature, or power, would things have fallen out otherwiſe than they doe fall out? why then ſhould Fate be inculcated, ſince (without Fate) there is Nature and Fortune, to which all things (neceſſary or caſuall) may be aptly referred? In this old Philoſophicall diſpute, what eaſie Moderator would not give this cenſure? That either ſide hath ſaid ſufficient, to overthrow his Adverſaries opinion; but neither of them enough to eſtabliſh his own.</p>

That's only for the infinite power of God himſelf to doe, men (as to naturall, civill, and morall acts) are ſtill actors in their own liberty. As for bodyes (Coeleſtiall

Wherefore, ſeeing fatation is neither in the ſtarres, nor in fate it ſelf: whether can any thing be ſayd to be fatall with reſpect to the ſtarres? For the ſtarres are but ſecond cauſes.

               <p n="25">25. How doe the celeſtiall bodyes work ſo fatally upon theſe inferiours: when as they here operate not upon a neceſſity, as to the producing of the effect. For albeit their impreſſions be naturall; yet are they not received, but according to the manner of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which are fluxible, and not having themſelves ſtill after the ſame way.

And the ſtarres themſelves are but indefinite, and remote cauſes; to which the effect can never follow determinatly, and neceſſarily, unleſs the middle cauſes be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and then they follow them, and not the other. But in the foreſaid ſeries the middle cauſes are moſt of them contingent: and from many contingent cauſes can come no effect of neceſſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any one of them, and all of them together, may be defective, and not attain unto their end.</p>

Set aſide the firſt act, which is the eternall decree; and the laſt act, which is death: theſe indeed may be ſaid to be both abſolute, and conditionate; but Chriſtians are not taught to call theſe fate.

If the firſt, is not a mans will to be excuſed in evill? and if the laſt, is not every mans will the cauſe of his own fate? yea and of the hardeſt and heavieſt fates? For they are ſuch which follow ſin, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Wherefore ſhould man (or his actions) be made the ſubject, yea the ſlave of fate; when as indeed man, as man, is ſuperiour thereto? For fate being but a ſydereall ſervice of ſecond cauſes, muſt be reduced to the providence of the firſt cauſe: and in that reduction, man himſelf hath place, or preferment, before all the ſtars of heaven. Becauſe the divine providence receives to it ſelf, or extends it ſelf in a more ſpeciall way, to intellectuall, or rationall: than it doth to all other creatures elſe. In as much as they excell all others, both in the perfection of nature, and in the dignity of end. In the perfection of nature; Becauſe the rationall creature hath the dominion over his own actions, and operates voluntarily: whereas the other act not ſo much, as are acted. In the dignity of the end; becauſe the intellectuall creature only, by his operation, reaches to the ultimate end of the univerſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> to know, and love God. But the other creatures touch not that end, by an inſpired intention, but only according to ſome participated ſimilitude. Furthermore, God provides for the intellectuall nature principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it were for ſelfs ſake: and but for all other crtatures ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily and in order to it. The rationall creature is Gods agent: the other are but his inſtrumens. Now God cares more for his agents than he doth for his inſtruments. Yea they are the inſtruments of this very agent: and he makes uſe of them either in his practice, or contemplation. God hath more regard to the free, and liberall: than to the neceſſitated, and ſervile acts of his creatures. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures are the more noble in themſelves, and of more neer acceſſion to the divine ſimilitude; and therefore tendred by God before and above all others. They are the more principall parts of the whole univerſe: to which the leſs principall are but ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; as intended for their ſakes, and working for their ends. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall natures have more aſfinity with the whole; as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all things elſe beſides themſelves: whereas every other creature is but a part, and capable of no more but a bare partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58142:89"/>
of its own particular entity. Now it is not for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehending part, to have an ordaining power over the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive whole. By the courſe of nature the rationall creature uſes all other things for it ſelf, as either for the perfection of its intellect, the explication of its ſcience, the exerciſe of its vertue, or elſe the ſuſtentation of its body, to which the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all nature is united. And therefore it is not for them, to diſpoſe, rule, govern, impell neceſſitate him him: but for him to obſerve, rule, govern, diſpence moderate, and make uſe of them.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Whether any thing can be ſayd to be fatall (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us) till it have taken effect? For a fatality before it be, is but a contingency to us: and to us a concingency, after it is, is a fatality. Why then ſhould we be bound to believe the prognoſticated things of Fate or Fortune before hand? yea, though they may have ſome naturall cauſe, remotely neceſſary, or of ſome indefinite probability: yet is not all this ſufficient for our faith in particular; becauſe, as concerning many ſuch naturall cauſes, there is in us nevertheleſs (beſides the ſupreme) a liberty, and power to prevent.</p>

37. Whether that be true Fate, which they would mingle together with providence? and how can divine providence, and Pagan Fate agree? For Providence is the beginning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of all things: Fate is the end or utter confuſion of them. Providence is in the ordering of caſuals, as well as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: Fate is oppoſing all things fortuitous; and therefore not diſpoſing them. Providence is an act in God: their Fate is no more but an event upon the creature. Providence is a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impendent, or out of the thing: Fate is a diſpoſition inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or in the thing. Providence comprehends all things (paſt, preſent, and to come) ſo does not Fate in her connexion of Cauſes. Providence is in and over all things, from the greateſt to the leaſt (good, evill, celeſtialls, terreſtrialls, ſpiritualls, corporealls, univerſalls, ſingulars, naturalls, rationalls, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaries, neceſſaries, contingents) ſo is not Fate. Providence is more ſpeciall to one, than to another: but Fate is a neceſſity to all alike. Providence can work immediately, without, and againſt means: Fate can operate nothing but according to her ſeries, or connexion. Providence can act with every creature, reſerving to it its own motion (as with free agents freely; with contingents contingently, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> whereas Fate hath no way to work but fatally, that is neceſſarily, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, inexorably, immutably, inevitably. The rules, order, ſucceſſe of divine providence, are either written in his own book or in his own breaſt: and not in the Starres and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, as Fate is. The wiſedome, juſtice, power, goodneſſe of his providence; all this is written in his own book: the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſucceſſes, iſſues, events thereof all theſe are written in his own breaſt Even wiſe Providence it ſelf is not herein to be diſcerned or determined before-hand: what ſatuous thing is Fate then, that is ſo obvious and triviall, as for the <hi>Faticanes</hi> to foretell? Is not this difference enough between them, and never to be reconciled; Providence is a prudent counſellor, and will have the particular iſſues kept ſecret: Fate is a ſilly babbler, and will have them commonly foretold?</p>
               <p n="38">38. Whether (had it not been for the fictions of Fate and Fortune) there had ever been hatcht opinions and hereſies, ſo prejudiciall to divine providence? and that even amongſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans

themſelves, that had experience ſufficient to convince them of the <hi>truth,</hi> and power of it: and of the juſtice, yea and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it in great part. Had the divine providence ever been denyed: if Fate and fortune had not been held for Gods? Had God himſelf been implanted under Fate, or made ſubject to the decrees of it, or ſlandered for a ſloathfull &amp; careleſs ſpectator of humane things, and terrene: if they had not confined and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted God to content himſelf with the reiglement of the heavens; as if it had veen beneath his dignitie and majeſtie, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to look down to ſmall things, or once to take notice of of what was done here below: but to commit the care and rule of all ſublunary and inferiour things, to the ſtarres and celeſtiall bodyes; as his ſubſtitutes and their ſuperiours? Had prophane and wicked men ever accuſed providence, and excuſed their impieties: had they not heard of fatall ſtarres neceſſitating and inforcing both their wills and actions?</p>
               <p n="39">39. Was not the conſtitution of Fate and Fortune, firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in a derogation to God, and his divine providence: and that through a paganiſh and infidelious ſcandall at good things happening to bad men here; and evill things to good men, which had never been excogitated, or had ſoon vaniſhed had they been thus Chriſtianly inſtructed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Creator diſpenſes theſe middle things with an indifferent hand, as unto creatures.

That the wiſe Diſpoſer knows how to turn theſe outward good things to the evill, of evill men: and theſe outward evill things to the good of good men.

Admit that either Fate or fortune was ſo indeed as they preſage; or much more than they can imagine: yet how is the beſt of them both ſufficient to moderate all fond hopes and fears?

               <p n="3">3. Whether if be (in Magick, and Aſtrologie) that the art hath power over the heavenly bodies: or the heavenly bodies power over the art? not the firſt becauſe for the Art to have power over the heavenly bodies (ſo as to ſtop or turn the courſe of the ſtars; or by odes, and incantations to fetch down the moon from her orb, as the old Magicians have boaſted) this is beyond the power of a Devill, or an Angell: and were not only againſt the particular order of nature, but would utterly confound the whole courſe of it.

All power is from action; all action is from forms; all forms are either naturall, or artificiall: now by what third kind of form doe the ſtars, and the Art, worke one upon another? And how agree their proper forms to act upon a third ſubject? How can the ſtars, or the Art (in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing forms and producing effects) work either naturally, by art; or artificially, by nature? Can a naturall form give principles of life, and motion, to an artificiall matter: or an artificiall, to a naturall matter? which way then will they have theſe two to conſpire, or conſent, either for the operating between themſelves; or upon a third?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Whether that power which Magicians, Necromancers, conjurers inchanters inſultingly boaſt of, againſt Devils, and evill ſpirits, by way of coaction and compulſion: be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by way of invocation, and ſubjection? For though <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſubdued Devils, and ejected them by a divine and extraordinary power: but as for meer men, and the vileſt of men, ſince God hath denyed them the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gift; who hath taught them the triviall arr of acting over, or commanding evill ſpirits? Or have they taken it upon themſelves (as did the <hi>Jewiſh Exorciſts Acts</hi> 19. 3.) and is not indeed all their power and authority of the ſame force, as was theirs? But inſtead of preaching to ſuch let me firſt reaſon with them. Is it credible, that a mortall man ſhould be able to bind an immortall Spirit? and bind him by a word, a ſound a ſyllable, a character? and theſe inſignificant, and no vertue of Gods promiſe in them? Can theſe men doe that to the Devill, which he cannot doe to them: compell him to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58142:93"/>
doe good, or evill? If they can compell him to doe the thing that good is; then are they able to doe as much as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth: and to compell him to doe evill, that they need not, he is alwaies as ready to doe that, as they. Devils are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the order, and power of ſenſible things: how then ſhould they be ſufficient to move them, either by way of allurement, or conſtraint? If the Devill doe at any time work with man, he will not doe it <hi>gratis,</hi> or freely; unleſs it be upon his own errands, and to his own ends; for he hates mankind, and their indifferent commerce. And therefore ſince he will not doe it voluntarily, and cannot be compelled; if he acts at all, it muſt either be upon a temptation of his own, or elſe upon a confederation of theirs. And if he be enjoyned to obey by covenant or compact, then is not the malefice as much as confeſt? Reaſon and experience prove, that the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forced to ſtand to his own promiſes: how much leſs then to any mans precept, or command? And therefore if the Devill appear at the provocation, recede at the commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwer at the call and obey at the command of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer; what diſſimulation of obedience is there on both ſides? One ſecretly imploring, and outwardly injoyning: the other outwardly obſerving, but inwardly inſlaving. For it is not they that bind the Devill; but the Devill that binds them to obedience. Only he ſeems to be enforced to doe theirs; that ſo he may make them willing to do his will. Or that his ſeigned conſtraint might either the more excuſe him; or elſe ſet them the more without excuſe both before God, and men; what command or inforcement is that, which is done not only to others injury but oft-times to the actors own hurt? eſpecially if he be doubting, and have not a ſtrong faith, and obſerve not all the circumſtances of adjuring; which ſhews all the force (on one part, or other) to be only in a pactionall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The main thing that the Aſtrologicall Magicians, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancers, conjurers, and inchanters pretend, is, that they can ſtand without his chain, and yet bring him (will he, nill he) within their circle: and all by vertue of the celeſtiall orbes; only calling, and urging him under certain aſpects,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58142:94"/>
conjunctions, conſtellations. But alas! theſe cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or impoſe upon him (neither of themſelves, nor by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; neither directly, nor indirectly) he being a meer ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſubſtance, and formally united to no body. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be obſervant upon ſuch tearms, it is to indulge a ſuperſtitious faith, and perſwaſion of the vertue of ſuch things, and eſficacy of ſuch an art, beſides, above, againſt the word of God. And he obeys now, not as neceſſitated thereby, as by cauſes; but yeelding thereto, as unto Signs. Signs indeed of a compact, or confederation. And in that regard, ſeems very obſervantially to ſubmit, not only to ſtars, and Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſtellations: but to plants, herbs, ſtones, metals, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, odes, verſes, words, ſounds, characters, figures, fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confections; and indeed to any rites or ceremonies whatſoever, uſed as ſeals to ſuch an intent. Otherwiſe, was it not for the covenant on the one part, there would (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the art, and authority) be but little perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance on the tother.

while ſuch artifices and practiſes are tolerated, which teach to obſerve them from ſignal conſtellations, and Magical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the vain obſervation of vain dreams, proceed not from the vain dream, and phantaſtical of the coeleſtial influences upon the phantaſtick ſpirit? For do they not ſay, That as the coeleſtial influxes upon corporal matter produce diverſe forms: ſo from the ſame influxes upon the phantaſtical power, which is organical, phantaſms are impreſſed, by a coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial diſpoſition, conſentaneous to the producing of any effect, eſpecially in dreams; becauſe the minde is then more freed from corporeal, and external cares, or troubles; and ſo more freely receives thoſe divine influxes? Whence it comes to paſſe that many things are made known to ſleeping men, in dreams, which are hid to the waking. And if this be their chief reaſon, whereby they would reconcile an opinion of truth to Dreams, why are they not agreed (among themſelves) of the cauſes, yea of the ſydereal cauſes of them? One will have the <hi>Intelligence</hi> that moves the Moon to cauſe them, by the means of its light, whereby mens phantaſies are irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, while they ſleep. Others refer them to the influxes of the ſuperiors, yet by the means of certain ſpecies, whereby they continually flow from Heaven. Another will have them to depend upon the powers of the ſoule, the influxes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, together with certain images, or reſemblances, whether of fantaſie or configuration. Others will have them wholly cauſed by their conſtellations. And if they would bring in the Devil among the reſt (as ſome of them have confeſt he is not to be kept out) they ſhould finde him to be the greateſt cauſe of all: eſpecially of the vain obſervation of them, and ſuperſtitious omination upon them. Who will deny, that there may be ſome obſervation of ſome dreams, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation made upon them, as touching either the health, or ſickneſſe of the body, the vertuous or vitious inclinations and affections of the minde; yea, and (though rarely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily) for the caution, and encouragement, as touching ſome ſpecial actions and events? But I demand, of Magical and Aſtrological men: not ſo much whether there be one common rule to all, for the interpretation of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58142:100"/>
dreams, As whether this (taught by themſelves) be either a ſecond cauſe of dreams, or a ſafe rule to interpret them? <hi>viz. That dreams are more efficacious, when the Moon over-runs that ſigne, which was in the ninth number of the Nativity, or revolution of that yeer; or in the ninth ſigne, from the ſigne of perfection. For it is a moſt true and certain divination; neither doth it proceed from nature, or humane arts, but from purified minds, by divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> They ſhall do well, not onely (by true reaſon) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve us fully, of the truth they ſpeak: but alſo (in good ſenſe) of the terms, they ſpeak withal.</p>

The Phyſiognomie of Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes; ſtill from ſtarry ſignatures, and diſpoſitions?

Which way go the Phyſiognomiſts, Metopoſcopiſts, and Chiromantiſts to work (for all this obſervation, and omina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs) but either (as they pretend) from the cauſe, to the effect. And how is that? but firſt judging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the man, or the member, to be <hi>Saturnine, Jovial, Martial, Solar, Venereal, Mercurial, Lunar.</hi> Or elſe, from the effect, to the cauſe (as they ſay) by collecting their horoſcope from the habitude of the body? And thus what do they? but trifle, and delude which way they pleaſe, by inſpections, obſervations, ominations, predictions of manners, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to the great diſhonour of God, and reproach of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; were it not that their art is proved to be an abſurd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, both by reaſon, experience, vertue, and Grace. For what can they ſay? but that paſſions, and affections may break forth, and ſhew themſelves in the alterations of ſome outward parts. What then? Becauſe they may do ſo in ſome parts: will they therefore make all to be ſignifying, and ſigning? Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even in thoſe parts, where thoſe eruptions, or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are, it is but upon a preſent provocation: will they then make ſuch collections, and preſagitions by them, as if they were habitually ſeated there? But I am weary of theſe frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58142:103"/>
Artiſts, I will therefore only turn them over to their own fautors, who tell them plainly, that it is not neceſſary, nor of any rational conſecution, that the condition, manners, and ſtudies, and inſtitutes of mans nature (together with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions, and agitations of his minde) ſhould be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to external marks: neither yet to be meaſured by any ſignal lineaments of his body. Becauſe a man may conceive, and agitate many things inwardly in his minde: whereof there is not the leaſt ſhew or appearance outwardly in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And becauſe a man may be of an enormous body, and diſtorted members: and nevertheleſſe poſſeſſe a minde excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in all good culture: and on the contrary, be of a decent and compleat frame or ſhape, and yet of manners ugly and ill-favoured enough. And that there is not the leaſt reaſon, nor any rule of truth for theſe their conjectures, obſervations, and ominations: neither are they agreed among themſelves, about their own abſurd ſigments. And therefore it is to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that theſe nugacious kinds of men do onely dote through the inſtinct of the devil, drawing them from errour into ſu-perſtition, and from that into infidelity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether <hi>Augurizing, auſpicating,</hi> and <hi>aruſpicinating</hi> (and all ſuch heatheniſh obſervations, and ominations) were not founded upon Magick and Aſtrologie? For not onely theſe deſcended from the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and from them to the <hi>Hetrurians:</hi> and from them, to the <hi>Latines.</hi> But there had never been (very like) neither faith in, nor practiſe of any ſuch, had not the Artiſts taught, that there are certain lights of praeſagition, deſcending from the coeleſtial bodies, upon all inferiour creatures: as certain ſignes in their motion, ſite, geſture, flight, voice, colour, meat, &amp;c. So that omination, or divination may well be made from the ſimilitude, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience betwixt them, and the ſtars. For beaſt, and birds, their parts and entrails, their flyings, and cryings, &amp;c. How can theſe (conſidered onely in themſelves) be cauſes of future events? Yea, how can they be ſo much as ſignes? Unleſſe they be taken as effects of ſome other cauſes, that may cauſe, or ſigne future things. And what can they be, but the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial motions? And therefore they muſt prenuntiate future events, in their conformity to the coeleſtial bodies: and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58142:104"/>
to the diſpoſition of the ſtars. So that thus it is, that they are brought to preſage (beſides out of a natural inſtinct, ſuch things as may concern themſelves, as in ſtorms, and ſhowers) out of a preternatural and aſtral diſpoſition, ſuch ominousacci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as may befal others.

               <p n="2">2. Whether theſe ſundry differences have not been obſerved concluded, confeſſed, betwixt divine Prophecy and divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the names, and kinds. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Prophecy is from <hi>God,</hi> a gift inſpired by the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> Divination is from the Devil, a deluſion ſuggeſted by an evil ſpirit. 2: Prophecy was never but according to Gods Covenant; Divination is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domwithout a pact, or covenant with the Devil. 3. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is Gods conſulting with the creature: Divination is the creature conſulting with the creature. Or, one is a conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and not with the creature: the other is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the creature, and not with God. 4. Prophecy is firſt motioned, and freely offered by God: Divination is temptingly, and ſorcerouſly ſought for (as was <hi>Balaams</hi> own way) and not onely provoked, but preſumed alſo. 5. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy hath been concerning ſome ſpecial perſons, and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary actions: Divination (even the Magical, and Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical) is ordinary for all men, their manners, and fortunes. 6. Prophecy hath never been, but of matters weighty, and ſerious: Divination hath often been of things vain, and ludicrous. 7. Prophecy is of thoſe things that are neceſſary to be known: Divination (Magical and Aſtrological) is of thoſe things that are not neceſſary to be known. 8. Prophecy is of thoſe things, that are onely known to God; and cannot be known to others, without Prophecy, or Revelation: Divination is either of thoſe things, that cannot be known by divination; or elſe of thoſe, that may be known without it. 9. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is of things true, certain, infallible; becauſe immediately from God, the firſt cauſe: Dvination is of things falſe, and uncertain, and but probable at moſt; becauſe either from the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58142:106"/>
Devil, or but from the creatures, and ſecond cauſes. 10. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy conſiders things in God, and therefore is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable: Divination conſiders things in the creature, and therefore muſt be mutable. 11. No Prophet ever made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the author of his own Prophecy; but <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. But the Devil, and Diviners arrogate their predictions to themſelves, and to the abſoluteneſſe of their own Art. 12. The gift of Prophecy ceaſed in the act: But Divination they wil have to remain ſtill in the Art. 13. Prophecy is not a permanent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, but a tranſient act; that the prophets themſelvs might know and confeſſe, that they had it not but by gift, and occaſionally according to Gods good pleaſure <hi>(for the prophecy came not at any time by the will of man.</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 21.) but Divination, or Aſtrological prediction is a ſtated Art (as they ſay) and they may not onely ſtudy it, but practiſe it at their own wills and pleaſures. 14. It is not for every Prophet to know every thing that is prophecyable: But (for ſo they pretend) it is for any prognoſticator, to know any thing that is prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 15. Prophets, beſides the Spirit of Prophecy, may have the inſtincts of their own ſpirits, which might ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: But Diviners, and Prognoſticators, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of their own ſpirit, are obnoxious to Satanical deluſion; whereby they often both are deceived, and do deceive. 16. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is true in the ground, although it may fail in the effect; becauſe the principle thereof is the prime verity: Divination, though it take effect, yet is it falſe; both becauſe of falſity in the author, and ground, and means, and end. 17. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of things prophecyed, argues no falſhood, or defect in Prophecy; becauſe God may reveal ſome things to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as in their ſecond cauſes, which may be impedited; and ſome things might be propheſyed conditionally, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they might be prevented; however to be referred to Gods good and wiſe diſpenſation; yea and the Prophets themſelves were inſtructed, and enabled to propheſie as well of their prevention, as of their conſecution: But who can ſay ſo much of Divination? 18. God may (in mercy) ſuffer a true Propheſie to be fruſtrated: and (in judgement) may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a falſe divination to take effect. 19. The Prophets were ſometimes prevented, as touching their predictions of evils, and judgements: But the diviners and falſe prophets were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58142:106"/>
in their predictions of bleſſings, and good things. 20. The Prophets foretold Gods judgements with grief and condoling; wiſhing that they might rather be accounted for falſe Prophets then that ſuch heavy things ſhould be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That Prophecy hath been prevented, or failed in effect, was meerly becauſe of the liberty of Gods will: but Divination, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrological prediction, may be defeated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven by the liberty of mans will alone. 22. Prophecy, enlightens the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perfects it: ſo does not Divination; but onely (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a confuſed manner) alters the imagination. 23. In Prophecy, it is the intellect that moves the phantaſie: but in Divination, it is the phantaſie that moves the intellect. For Prophecy illuminates immediately, beginning at the mind and heart: which divination cannot do; becauſe it begins at the ſenſes, and ſo to the phantaſie, to the imagination. So that a Prophet underſtands his own Propheſie: ſo doth not a diviner his own divination. 24. Extaſies of Prophets did not ſo abalienate their mindes, as that they apprehended not what they did, or ſaid: as indeed it is in the dementating fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of divination. For theirs was onely but an abſtraction of the minde from outward, ſenſible, and terrene things: not a diſtraction of it within it ſelf; as in theſe. 25. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets mingled godly and wiſe inſtructions, together with their Predictions; that they might not ſeem to neglect the preſent, by prying into the future: both which, are both the ſloath, and buſineſſe of all prognoſticating predictors. 26. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſerve to inſtruct all ages: divinations, inſtead of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, have onely proved to diſtract preſent times, and that's all. 27. The gift or grace of Prophecy was given for the things of Faith, and true worſhip: Divination hath onely been uſed to ſeduce from both. 28. Prophecy was inſpired by God. for the prevention of Idolatry, ſuperſtition, ſorcery: Divination hath been ſuggeſted by the devil, as an occaſion, and promotion of them all. 29. All things are ſubject to prophetical illumination; as things paſt, preſent, and to come,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58142:107"/>
things neceſſary, contingent, caſual; things natural, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſpiritual; things intellectual, rational, arbitrary; things moral, religious, temporal, and eternal: ſo are they not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, or Aſtrological prediction. 30. Prophecy hath been of the very thoughts of the heart themſelves; becauſe immediately from God, who knoweth the heart: but Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can diſcern of no thoughts ſimply, as they are in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect; neither of affections, as they are meerly in the will: but onely gueſſes at them by certain external ſpecies, ſignes, or effects. Yea, though they be thoughts of the devils own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, yet he diſcerns not their affirmation, or negation <hi>(ſc.</hi> their complacency, or reluctancy) in the immanent act of the underſtanding, or the will: ſave onely as tranſeunt, or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth externally by certain ſignes and ſymptomes of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and affections. 31. Prophecy is then moſt high and admirable, when it exceeds all humane reaſon: Divination, or any ſuch kinde of prediction, is then moſt vile and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, when it is not ſubject to it. 32. The devil can neither propheſie, nor make prophets: but the devil can both predict and make predictors. 33. Prophecy, as it is not hereditary by nature: ſo neither is it propagatory by art: but Magical divination is the one; and Aſtrological is the other. 34. Prophecy, in obſcureſt things, is ſincere: Divination, in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things, is equivocal. 35. Prophecy is not venal, or to be bought, and hired with mony, and preferments: as Magical divinations, and Aſtrological predictions are. Neither were the true Prophets mercenary, covetous, ambitious; as the falſe Prophets and Diviners were. 36. Holy men were alwayes humble in the gift of Prophecy: prophane men have been proud of the Art of divination, or prediction. 37. True Prophets never propheſyed things formally falſe: much leſſe thoſe wittingly, and willingly; as falſe Prophets and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have done. 38. True Prophets never hunted the favors of men in place, and power; by flatring predictions even to evil men, and ſad preſages even againſt good men: as Magical and Aſtrological Diviners have alwayes uſed to do. 39. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies were then moſt rigorous, and the Prophets moſt zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; when they themſelves were moſt perſecuted, and deſpiſed: but let Magicians, Necromancers, Diviners, Soothſayers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunetellers,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58142:107"/>
Gipſies, Juglers, Prognoſticators, and Predictors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. be ſeverely examined according to Lawes; and then the ſortilegious ſpirit ſtraightway leavs them. And now, they are able to foreſpeak no mans fate, or deſtiny; they are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in ſuſpecting their own. Thus the Art periſhes, in the peril of the Artificer: as the malefice is prevented, or cured in the execution of the Witch. 40. It was a curſe, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned as a curſe; for the Church of the Old Teſtament to want her Prophets: but it was a bleſſing, and expreſſely promiſed as a bleſſing, that Diviners, Soothſayers, and all ſuch like, ſhould be expelled out of her. And what faithful man and wiſe, would not think it a like bleſſing to a Chriſtian Church, and Commonwealth? Now, if any man will take the pains to order this accumulation of differences; how eaſit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly might he obſerve (through various particulars) Prophecy, and Divination, to be two things utterly different in Author, means, matter, form, ſubject, object, end, and effect?</p>

If the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyer or predictor ſhall preſume himſelf for ſingularly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily choſen out, and ſtirred up, to reveale ſecrets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a hundred, both of more eminent places, and graces, then himſelf. 13. If he ſhall pride himſelf in a ſingular gift: or prefer it to the favour, and comfort of a ſaving grace. 14. If vain, or corrupt imaginations immediately forego, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the revelation. 15. If erroneous, inordinate, paſſionate, affected words, and phraſes accompany the delivery, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation thereof. 16. If the perſon of the prophecyer or predictor be noted for idolatry, infidelity, ſuperſtition, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſchiſm, athieſm, hypocriſie, prophaneneſs, carnality, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, covetouſneſs, ambition, ſedition, curioſity, vanity, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſorcery, envy, flattery, &amp;c. Oh that we did but obſerve theſe, and the like, to examine upon them! Doubtleſs, we might with ſounder judgements, and ſafer Conſciences, pronounce upon our predictors, and their predictions; then either of them could do upon us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the Devil can Prophecy, and Predict? Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie he cannot; for that's to ſpeak from the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> which the devil cannot, will not do. Yea it is to ſpeak ſo, <hi>as moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now though the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> may move, or command the devil to ſpeak whether he will or no: yet for him to do it <hi>as moved,</hi> that was not onely to be inſpired, but to receive the inſpiration with approbation; or ſome conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of affection, and intention; which to a devil is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Nevertheleſs, predict he may in ſome things, through the divine both permiſſion and injunction. And but in ſome things. For the devil cannot foreknow, or foretel ſuch things, as depends abſolutely upon Gods wil. Nor yet thoſethings, which depend arbitrarily upon mans own will. Nor the thoughts, and immaginations of mans heart. Nor what entertainments his own ſuggeſtions have there, at their firſt motion. Nor what the good Angels intend. Nor what they are ſent to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the world, or the Church. Nor can he foreſee any thing in it ſelf, nor any thing, that hath not a natural, and particular cauſe. Nor yet what particular impediment may hinder that natural cauſe from effecting. Now I would ask of Magicians, and Aſtrologers; whether they can foreſee, or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58142:108"/>
foretel more, then the devil himſelf can do? Yet I would ask again; whether the Magical and Aſtrological preſcience, and preſagition, be not much after the ſame manner, as the diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal is? For the devil acquires his, by long obſervation, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten experience of things. He knows well natural cauſes, and can ſee their following effects as preſent in them. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands mens bodily temperaments, and to what paſſions or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections they uſual diſpoſe: and which way mens ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites may ordinarily prevail to incline their wills. He can recollect the wickedneſs of Times, and Nations; and can gueſs by the multitude, lawleſneſs, and impunity of their iniquities among men; how ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r they are to the judgements of God; And accordingly can conjecture, and predict the puniſhment of a people; by war, famine, peſtilence, &amp;c. He can certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretel theſe things, that depend upon neceſſary cauſes; and have no other natural cauſe to hinder them: as the motions of the ſtars, Eclipſes, conjunctions, &amp;c. But if they be not neceſſary (although falling out for the moſt part) but may have ſome other natural cauſes hindring them: thoſe he can foretel but probably, and by conjecture; as ſhowers, ſtorms, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, &amp;c. He can certainly foretel thoſe malefices, which (by Gods permiſſion) he intends to act, either by himſelf, or by his ſworn inſtruments. He can diſcloſe ſuch corrupt cogitations as himſelf hath injected: eſpecially ſo far forth, as he obſerved them to take impreſſion with complacency. And for ſecret luſts, manners, and actions (ſuch as himſelf hath been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate witneſſe of) he can reveal them to his Magical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and make them (if God will permit) object them to mens faces, and bewray them to the world. He is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo going to and fro in the earth, that he can tel what is doing even in remoteſt places: and (ſuch is his agility) can ſuddenly convey it to his abſent inſtruments, or Artiſts; and make them relate itas if they were preſent. Hidden treaſures, loſt goods, thefts, murders ſecretly committed: theſe (becauſe done in his preſence, and kept in his remembrance) he can diſcloſe to, and by his Agents; if men will conſult, and God give leave. Yea, he can preſage many things from the prophecies of the Word; whoſe hiſtoricall part he underſtands better then men.</p>

5. Why God permits the devil and Diviners oft times to predict things future? Is it not to diſtinguiſh betwixt his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſpiritual, and ſaving graces: and his extraordinary, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and tranſient gifts? That none might preſume of an inlightened minde, or a conformed will: becauſe of ſuch acts as may be without the leaſt touch, either of the one or the other? Nor arrogate to themſelves a likeneſs to Angels, for ſuch preſagitions, as wherein the beaſts may ſurpaſs them? Is it not, that ungodly men and profane may thus ſo much the more be given over to their own ſuperſtitions, and diabolical deluſions? And to teach the faithful, and godly, not to covet, affect, admire, or undiſcreetly approve of thoſe gifts: which are no perpetual and infallible tokens of Gods grace, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Eſpecially, neither to be acting in, nor attending to, thoſe vain curioſities; which <hi>Satan</hi> may ſuggeſt, and wicked men and infidels may attain unto.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether the devil or divining predictors, ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſhould they foretel truth? <hi>The Devil abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lye, he ſpeaketh of his own: for he is a lyar, and the father of it.</hi> Joh. 8. 44. <hi>Eve</hi> ought not to have believed him, becauſe he ſpake of his own, <hi>Gen. 3. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ab</hi> was not bound to be <hi>perſwaded</hi> by him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20, 21, 22. Becauſe though he had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or permiſſion from God; yet he exceeded it, and ſpake of his own. But I make a queſtion whether <hi>Saul</hi> ought not to have believed him; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 19. Becauſe he now ſpake not of his own. God is to be believed even in the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But then, it might be evident, that he not onely ſpeaks the things of God, but from God: that is, both the truth, and by a ſpecial warrant. Otherwiſe, there's no accepting of his Teſtimony (be it never ſo true) if he take it up of his own Authority. And therefore our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> would neither aſſent to, nor approve of the Devils, although they ſpake the truth, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 24, 25. &amp; 3. 11, 12. No more did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the truth that was ſpoken by <hi>the Spirit of Divination, Act.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18. We are taught, that <hi>Satan</hi> may transform himſelf into an Angel of light, and ſo may his Miniſters like-wiſe. And therefore we held our ſelves not obliged ſimply to believe either the one, or the other; even in the beſt they can
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58142:109"/>
ſay. Becauſe they may lye, in telling truth; may tell truth, to deceive; may prejudice a greater, in uttering a leſſer truth; may uſurp it of themſelves; may arrogate it to themſelves. When did God ſend the devil on a meſſage, to inſtruct his Church in the truth; or to promiſe good unto his children? If he be ſent extraordinarily to pronuntiate to the wicked, and reprobates, their deſtinated judgements, and deſerts; they may be ſo conſcious within themſelves, as to have cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. But as for holy men, and elect, if they be not tyed to believe their truth, how much rather ought they to take heed of their ſtrong deluſions, as not to believe their lyes?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether a wicked man may propheſie: or a godly man divine? Although godly men are more ſubject to wicked mens ſins, then wicked men are capable of godly mens graces; Yet godly men (as godly men) cannot be infected with wicked mens divining: neither can wicked men (as wicked men) be endowed with godly mens prophecying. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is pretended to <hi>divine:</hi> yet is it but a pretence, of a pretence; if it be taken in the worſt ſenſe, as hath been ſaid before. <hi>Balaam took up his parable</hi> (a dark ſaying, which he himſelf underſtood not) and <hi>God put a word in his mouth</hi> (which never affected his heart) But <hi>Balaam</hi> had no more the gift, and ſpirit of propheſying, then his <hi>Aſſe</hi> had the gift, and ſpirit of ſpeaking. May we not then determine it thus? God may be pleaſed ſo to diſpenſe prophecying, as ſometimes to prompt a wicked man with the act, ſound, or prolation of it: but inſpires, or indues godly men alone with the gift, ſenſe, and ſpirit of prophecy. For the ſpirit of prophecy delights in ſanctity, and purity. And to perfect prophecy is required, not onely the illumination of the minde; but the aſſent alſo of the will (as to Gods revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, authority, pleaſure, meſſage, truth, glory) which indeed cannot be in an ungodly man. In Scripture a <hi>good man,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> are Synonyma's: and <hi>a man of God,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible terms. And a bad man is never ſo called, but with ſome epithete betokening the abuſive appellation. Goodneſs of manners, though it neceſſarily prepares not of it ſelf, to the acquiſition of prophecy (becauſe it is a free, ſudden, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſult, or illapſe) Yet badneſſe of manners is alwayes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58142:110"/>
of it ſelf, an utter impediment. Onely, God may be pleaſed (in ſuch ſingular acts) ſo to abalienate, or ſuſpend corruptions for the preſent, as ſometimes to make good uſe of ill inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for others ſakes: but not often, or for their own; as he hath been been pleaſed to act with thoſe, whoſe hearts he hath changed, and renewed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. How chance the Prophets that prophecyed not onely by words, but by Facts, and by Signes alſo (and by ſo many, and ordinary Signes) yet none of them, once prophecyed from the ſtars, or their conſtellations? Was not that vertue in them? Or was it not obſerved in them, in their time? Were they fain to make uſe of terreſtrial ſignes, becauſe the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtials were out of their reach? Nay, was it not to let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, That God, and his Prophets could make the meaneſt ſignes upon earth, to confirm their Prophecies: whereas the devil and diviners are not able to make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſignes in Heaven, to confirm their Prognoſtications? Why did <hi>Chriſt</hi> refuſe to ſhew <hi>a ſigne from Heaven,</hi> in proof of his <hi>Meſſiahſhip?</hi> Matt. 16. 1, 4. Becauſe they ſought it; and ſought it temptingly, and ſought it for themſelves. They would have ſignes among ſignes, and miracles among mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and ſuch ſignes and miracles as they themſelves fancyed; and ſuch as might aſſimilate their own prognoſticating ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and vain obſervation; and ſuch a ſigne, as was not prophecyed, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould do; and ſuch as had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſt cauſe, neceſſity, nor end, for which they ſhould deſire it. Beſides, that the Prophets revealed nothing from the ſtars; and <hi>Christ</hi> denyed to make any ſuch demonſtration of himſelf, his doctrine, and miracles; becauſe it was not prophecyed of him: and therefore he refers them onely to a prophecyed ſign, <hi>the ſigne of the prophet Jonas:</hi> enough to ſignifie, of how little neceſſity all ſydereal obſervation, or operation is to pure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But I demand further; if there were any congruity, or conſiſtency betwixt Prophecy, and mag-aſtro-mancy; why then was the one a ſingular, extraordinary, and temporary gift to Gods people, and the other made a common Art, or Trade, o Idolators, lnfidels, and men prophane?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whether Prophecy be natural? Or yet of any artificial preparation? The Occult Philoſophizers, Magical Mirabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58142:110"/>
and aſtral Fabricators, are for both (yea beſides the ſeed of the ſoul, and the humours of the body, they pretend the parts of beaſts, ſtones, herbs, and outward ceremonies, all to be effectually diſpoſing to Prophecie.) But the truth is for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For Prophecy indeed is not natural, but ſupernatural: not artificial, or acquiſite; but infuſed, or inſpired. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is immediate, ſudden, momentany; the diſpoſition (at one inſtant) infuſed together with the act: yea and the very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſpoſition ceaſing, when the particular act ceaſeth. It never finds it ſubject capable to receive it, but makes it ſo: neither leaves it in the leaſt capacity to acquire, or expect it preſently again. But if it pleaſe to return, it ſtill makes its own way (oft times another, a new way) for it ſelf. What inclination of nature, or preparation of Art doth it require; when it can take the ignorant, as well as the learned; the <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,</hi> as well as the <hi>Artiſt;</hi> yea a corrupt heart, and a falſe mouth and never theleſſe make it foreſpeak its own infallible truth? No nature or eſſence is prophetical of it ſelf, but that which is incomprehenſible, and comprehending all things. If our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had any ſuch inclination in it ſelf; why ſhould we not all propheſie? And alwayes propheſie? And propheſie when we pleaſe? And propheſie of one thing as well as another? And one propheſie, as well as another? To whom then ſhould we propheſie? And how ſhould our pronuntiating be of thoſe things, which are hidden to the common ſenſe, and ordinary apprehenſion of men, among whom we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant? How ſhould Prophecy be ſaid to exceed all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cognition; if it may proceed from any natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And how ſhall we diſtinguiſh betwixt Prophecie, which hath revealed, and reveals things, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and prognoſtication, which (at moſt) can but predict ſome things, as they are in their natural cauſes, and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? What praevious diſpoſition to propheſie (either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or artificially) was there in <hi>Amos,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I was no prophet, neither was I a prophets ſon; but I was an beardman, and a gatherer of ſycomore fruit. And the Lord took me, as I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the flock, and the Lord ſaid unto me, Go prophecy. Amos</hi> 7. 14, 15. As for <hi>Eliſha's</hi> calling for a <hi>Minſtrel: 2 King.</hi> 3. 15. This was not to procure, or excite propheſie: but to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58142:111"/>
ſedate paſſions and affections; and ſo make himſelf fitter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or contemplation and devotion. Not as if (according to the Rabbinical conceit) the ſpirit of Prophecie had now made its receſſe from him, becauſe of ſome perturbation of his, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo exaſperated againſt <hi>Jehoram;</hi> For that was a true zeal of God, and that is never inordinate: neither ſerves it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but promote Gods gifts. But ſay he had been ſomewhat diſquieted, and diſtracted from the ſpirit of Prophecie; how was it in the force and vertue of Muſick to reſtore it? Muſick could do that neither naturally, nor artificially: if it did it at all, it muſt do it miraculouſly. The prophets very calling for Muſick, was a propheſie; Signifying that the ſpirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie reſts not in turbulent, diſtracted, factious, ſeditious minds: but in harmonious, unanimous, appeaſed, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hearts. But let them contend Prophecie to be of natural diſpoſition, and artificial preparation; that would ſo take off theirs, from being though diabolical: what need we do ſo, that hold Prophecie to be wholly divine? Nature, and Art cannot ſo much credit the Aſtrological, as they prejudice the Theological propheſie.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whether Propheſie be not now ceaſt? It was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be perpetual. Even while it was, it was an act; not an habit: not permanent, but tranſient. The Spirit now in the illapſe, and again upon the receſſe. It was a gift or grace, not ſo much perſonal, as vocational: pertaining not to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary duty ſo much, as extraordinary occaſion. Nor was it ſo neceſſary, that men ſhould be taught to look after things future: as how to uſe the preſent time aright. The prophets were but types of that <hi>great Prophet:</hi> and all propheſie had its main end, and completion in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It was therefore meet that the ſhadow ſhould recede, now that the ſubſtance came in place; Prophecy was neceſſary for the Church of the Old-Teſtament, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not yet come: but not ſo in this of the New; becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come already. We have an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal propheſie, abundantly recompencing that lack of the legal: being a gift or grace not extraordinary, but ordinary; not temporary, but perpetual; not ſingular, but univerſal; not vocational onely, but perſonal; not an act common to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, but an habit peculiar to the Saints. Not of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58142:111"/>
things of future times: but of expounding the future things of eternity. Be it in heaven or earth; <hi>Prophecies ſhall fail, when that which is perfect is come,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 8. In heaven, they muſt needs fail; becauſe there's no future to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, or expected; all is an eternal preſent. And in the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they muſt needs fail; becauſe there is no future truth (not another Goſpel) to be expected; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent truth is eternal. Prophecie failed in the Church, as did the other extraordinary, and temporary gifts: <hi>viz.</hi> Working of miracles, and ſpeaking with Tongues. Nevertheleſſe I conceive, God hath abſolutely denyed his Church none of all theſe: but that the Spirit may be pleaſed to ſtir up ſome men, at ſome times, and to ſome particulars, to act in any of them; if juſt cauſe and neceſſity be. Yet, though a man ſhould be raiſed to propheſie now, and that by the ſame Spirit; I cannot think it to be by the ſame degree, or authority of the Spirit as the former Prophets were. Becauſe the authority of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them, was not onely prophetical, or hiſtorical: but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piential, and dogmatical. And ſo their propheſies were recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not onely for a particular and certain prediction of truth: but for an univerſal, and perpetual inſtruction of Faith. And therefore, either there muſt be no end of adding to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: or elſe none ſuch muſt now be raiſed. There may be ſome prudential predictings of good men; and ſuſpicious preſagings of evil men; and ſhrewd conjecturings of common men: but what are all theſe to the propheſyings of holy men of God in old time? Yet we ſay, Gods hand is not ſhortned, but that he can ſtill raiſe up ſuch: but who can ſay, that he will do it? Or that there is juſt cauſe why he ſhould ſo do? We conclude therefore, in the general, that Prophecy is ceaſt. And that of an extraordinary gift at firſt; it is become more extraordinary to after ages. What reaſon then have we to be ſo blind of Faith; as to admit of a ſtated art of divination in its ſtead?</p>

                  <p>From the rarity of Miracles.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 WHether every thing that is affected above, beſides, or againſt the courſe and order, faculty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hope and expectation of nature; may truly be ſaid to be miraculous? Not every thing. 1. Becauſe, it is not a thing effected againſt particular nature, but againſt whole nature, that makes a Miracle. 2. Becauſe in particular nature, there are antipolliges, or occult qualities of actives and paſſives; naturally acting, or diſpoſed to act one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. Becauſe it is neither nature acting contrary to ſome part of her ſelf; nor is it Art urging or tempting Nature: but it is God totally exceeding the law, vertue, and order of Nature; that makes it to be a Miracle. 4. Becauſe many things may be done againſt Nature, or natural propenſity; which notwithſtanding are but ordinary, and trivial; as the cauſing of heavy things to aſcend upwards, &amp;c. 5. Becauſe there are many ſins and vices, that are againſt Natures law and vertue, which who will ſay that they are miraculous? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude againſt Magical Mirabilaries? that although every Miracle be an act or effect above Nature: yet every act or effect beſides, or againſt Nature, is not a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether that may abſolutely be ſaid to be a Miracle, whoſe effect is manifeſt; and whoſe cauſe is occult or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us? No. Except it be acted ſimply by the firſt cauſe; and for cauſes onely known to him. 2. Except it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all mans exact knowledge indifferently; one as well as another. 3. Except the cauſe be altogether paſt ſuch finding out, even to ſober and prudential obſervation, art, induſtry. Otherwiſe, it ſhould not be a Miracle, ſo as it is in itſelf, but ſo as it appears to us. Our ignorance ſhould neceſſarily come
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58142:112"/>
into the cauſe of Miracles. That ſhould be miraculous to one man; which is not ſo to another. And a prophane curioſity of Art would boaſt of more light, and experiment in divine works: then indeed is vouchſafed to the perſwaſion of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether the power of working Miracles be not proper to God alone? This muſt be affirmed, and cannot be denyed. 1. Becauſe He onely can work a Miracle of himſelf, to whom nothing is a Miracle. 2. Becauſe He onely can work againſt the order of Nature, and ſecond cauſes, whoſe will is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to inſtitute, Order, alter all things. 3. Becauſe God is a tranſcendent, and is not under, nor yet within the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of any part of the whole order of Nature; as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is: and therefore he onely can act that againſt, and beſides above the order of Nature; which the creature cannot. 4. Becauſe a divine power requires not a ſubject to work upon (for it is able to create all things of nothing) neither looks it at the poſſibility, or propenſity of that ſubject, to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the effect, as every created power doth. 5. Becauſe the proper cauſe of a Miracle muſt not onely be uncreated, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, omnipotent, indeterminate, &amp;c. But it muſt alſo be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, unſearchable, incomprehenſible: now no cauſe is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo; but the hidden God himſelf. 6. Becauſe it cannot be a Miracle, unleſs it be abſolutely, and univerſally wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; or to be equally admired of all creatures of the ſame kinde. Now it is onely for God; and neither for Angels, or men, to do ſuch things, as ſhall be admirable to their fellows, and not ſo to themſelves. 7. Becauſe if any other could work Miracles but God, or but by God, then Miracles could not be the indubitable ſignes, and proofs of a God; nor of Gods Word, and Truth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the good Angels can do Miracles? Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and inſtrumentally they may: but not principally and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively. For Angels are finite both in their nature, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and power. And divine Miracles (abſolutely conſidered) are as ſtrange and wonderful to them: as they are to us men. Yet Angels (out of the vertue and perſpicuity of their own nature) may know how to do many things, that may ſeem miraculous, or be marveilous to us. Becauſe they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58142:113"/>
are a ſuperior power or vertue unknown to us; and may have a particular power (over inferiours) not known to us; and therefore may act above, beſides, againſt the particular order of Nature, that is known to us. But being part of whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated nature themſelves, they cannot act againſt it (the main reaſon of a Miracle) for ſo they ſhould act againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether Devils can do Miracles? If not Angels; much leſſe devils. Neither doth the Lord make uſe of the devils to be inſtruments of his mighty works; as he doth of the Angels. For Miracles were never intended or effected (immediately or mediately) but for the confirmation of the truth: to which the devils are no apt inſtruments; becauſe all that they do is with intent to ſeduce therefrom. The devils indeed have a faculty, and ſagacity (both much enabled by long experience in things) above us men: and ſo may work (in many things) to amaze, as well as delude us. But ſuch ſtupendous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And for the reality of effect, it is not ſo much thanks to their admirable power, or manner of working, as to the natural (though ſecret) diſpoſition of the matter they work upon. Neither are they permitted often to work any reality of effect (but onely to delude with preſtigious appearances) becauſe God ſeldom ſuffers Nature, or the creature to be ſo blemiſhed, or abuſed. And though they had a liberty to effect really, in things to be admired: yet (ſo falſe is their diſpoſition) they would chuſe, and labour to be preſtigious. And where they are tempted (or urged as they ſay, by Art) to do thoſe things that are not within their power, or permiſſion: there are they forced to be preſtigious, and deluſory; for the ſaving of their credit amongſt their own. Now this preſtigiouſneſſe or illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (whether freely from themſelves, or as it were forced by others) is a ſigne of their impotency, as well as their fallacy: and either of them are a ſufficient argument to exclude them utterly from a power of working Miracles. And therefore, if they will needs be contending for the devils power in, and by Magicians, Aſtrologers, Necromancers Conjurers,

               <p n="6">6. Whether there be any ſuch ſecrets in Nature, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to work Miracles? Although it be confeſt, that there are ſundry admirable ſecrets hidden in Natures boſome: yet we muſt profeſſe, that her hand is here ſhortned. Becauſe it is the nature of a Miracle to exceed Natures power. It muſt be above, beſides, againſt Nature: and not particular onely, but univerſal, or whole created Nature. Though a Miracle be wrought in Nature, yet it muſt be quite beyond Natures prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, law, order. Nature of it ſelf muſt not ſo much as incline or diſpoſe to it. Yea it muſt be in the very nature of the thing to be otherwiſe, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, the more alien the effect is to Nature, and the more remore from Natures order: the greater is the Miracle, and the more to be admired. Wherefore we conclude (againſt thoſe <hi>Mirions,</hi> who would make themſelves to be Natures Apes) that not onely any particular nature, is not able to worke a Miracle beſides, or againſt the order of whole Nature: but the vertue even of whole Nature, is not able to worke a Miracle upon any particular nature whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether Miracles may be wrought by Art? The flat Negative is to be concluded upon theſe Arguments. 1. Art cannot exceed Nature. Now Nature (in all her mirables) is but Miracles Ape; and Art is but Natures Ape: what then are the Magical Mirabilaries (at moſt) but Apes of Art? 2. The ſtrength of Art is acquiſite: the vertue of Miracles is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſd. 3. An Art operates onely according to reaſon and knowledge: but a Miracle altogether above them. 4. Art effects nothing, but according to ordinary rules, obſervations, experiments, cuſtoms: but a Miracle is ſo extraordinary, that it were no Miracle, except it were effected contrary to all theſe. 5. Art (for the moſt part) is of neceſſaries: a Miracle (for the moſt part) is of contingents. 6. If Art ſerved to worke Miracles, then were the power of them acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If it were in the Artiſts power, it ſhould be a Miracle to one man, and not to another. 9. Prophane men, and the greateſt ten pters of God, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,

and Nature, ſhould ſo do moſt Miracles. 10. Art rather ſerves to prevent many things for ſeeming Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: becauſe it helps to finde out the ſuddain cauſe. For either it lets to underſtand the cauſe, or not: if it doth not, then it is no Art; if it doth, then it is no Miracle.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whether it be lawful, neceſſary, convenient (not onely for the working of Miracles, but for the finding out of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables) to operate (either by Art, or violence) againſt the order plac't in Nature? Doubtleſſe, it is no furth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r lawful; then it may be either neceſſary, or convenient. That is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, and directly tending to ſome publike, or private uſe, or benefit. Nature may have many pretty mirables (which they title <hi>Admired Auditions, Natural hiſtory, Mirables of the world, Occult Miracles of Nature, Occult Philoſophie, ſubtilities and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of things, ſecrets, myſteries, memorables, unheard of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c.) Yet for all that, are they not ſuch, as Magicians fain, or fable, in animals, plants, herbs, ſtones, &amp;c. Nor are they (a many of them) ſo mirable in themſelves; as either to mens fancies, or ignorances.

                  </gap>ccult and profound: as who can tell where to finde them; or how to apply them; ſo as to urge Nature (by the help of Art) to worke wonders? Who can do ſuch a thing (eſpecially make it his trade, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, oſtentation, ſo to do) and not be ſubject to, or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tempting God, provoking the Devil, tormenting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, abuſing the creature, loſing time, diſparaging himſelf, and deluding the world? It is for none but God to worke ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely againſt the order of whole created Nature: becauſe he could have inſtituted another order of Nature. And all things are ſubject to him; not ſo much from a neceſſity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſecond cauſes: as according to the abſoluteneſſe of his own power, and liberty of his own will. And it is for none to undertake to alter the order of particular Nature; but in, by, under, and for God: yea (I may ſay) according to God; and not otherwiſe. As. 1. God acteth not againſt the order of nature (in any particular of it) ſave onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt and weighty cauſes: how then dare prophane men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to do ſuch a thing joculatorily, jugglingly, to make ſport and paſtime; or yet for no other end or uſe, but vain and idle

experiments ſake; or onely to feed, or ſatisfie vain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous curioſity? 2. God, though he may act againſt that order which one creature hath to another: yet acts he not againſt that order, which the creature hath to himſelf. For ſhould he act againſt the order of nature, as it depends upon himſelf; he ſhould ſo act againſt himſelf: in like manner, neither ought man to act againſt the order of nature, or of the creature ſo far forth as it depends upon God; nor yet ſo far forth as it is not intended by God, to be ſerviceable and uſeful unto men. 3. God acts not againſt the law and courſe of nature, ſo as to violate his own great Law; <hi>ſc.</hi> that of his wiſdome, goodneſſe, juſtice, in diſpoſing the creature: neither ought men ſo to do, beyond the great Law of uſing the creature aright, and to thoſe very ends for which God ordained it. For it can never be lawful or warrantable, ſo to tranſgreſſe natures order, as to abuſe the creature in any kinde. Now do they not know, that the creature may as well be ſpiritually, and ſpeculatively abuſed, by ſuperſtition, and curioſity: as practically, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by violence, or ſenſuality.</p>

10 Whether Miracles may be wrought out of the Church. Although we make not the power of working miracles to be the perpetual note of Gods Church: yet we determine the Church to be the proper ſeat of them. And in determining, we do thus diſtinguiſh; That God may be pleaſed to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles all the world over; and that by his Angels, as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Government thereof: but employs not men to that purpoſe, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve onely within his Church. And do diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh again, that privative miracles, or thoſe of wrath and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be wrought out of the Church: but not poſitive, or thoſe of Grace and mercy. And our reaſons are, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the main end of working Miracles is for the plantation and confirmation of the Goſpel, the truth of Gods word: and that cannot be without the Church. 2. The power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Miracles is from a promiſe, and that belongs to the Church alone. 3. In a Miracle is conſiderable not ſo much the evident effect as the ſecret intent, and this conſideration is onely for the faithful in the Church. 4. The truth of the word is not to be meaſured by miracles; but the truth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by the Word: and where is that but in the Church? 5. Miracles tend as to the glory of God, ſo to the edification of the Godly; and who looks for that or them, out of Gods Church. 6. Satans ſtupendous prodigies are moſtly wrought out of the Church: but Gods wonderful miracles within it. 7. Though it hath been ſaid, that miracles were intended for Infidels; yet were they not effected but by believers: and by believers, either to convince, or to convert thoſe Infidels.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Whether wicked men and reprobates may be workers of miracles? Not by Angelical aſſiſtance, not by diabolical confederation, not by the ſecret of Nature, not by the ſtudy of Art: but by divine diſpenſation they may. 1. Becauſe God may be pleaſed to employ them to this purpoſe; and yet give them no more but a faith of miracles; which is common to reprobates. 2. Becauſe that of miracles is a gift not ſimply making accepted: but may be given onely for others ſakes. 3. God hath wrought miracles by dead inſtruments: and why not by men of a dead faith, and dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes? 4. Wicked men may be uſed in the working of miracles, for a teſtimony of Gods truth: yet not in a manifeſtation of their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58142:115"/>
own graces. 5. Bad men have been imployed in working of miracles: that good men might not be proud, or overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of common gifts. 6. The working of miracles is not appropriated to godly men: leſt ordinary Graces might be undervalued; and weak Chriſtians might take ſcandal, and deſpair in their defect of the extraordinary gift.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherein differ true and falſe miracles: or divine and diabolical; Theological, and magical? 1. The one kind are wrought by God, by Angels, Prophets, Apoſtles, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Saints: the other not but by devils, magicians, Juglers, ungodly men. 2. The one are ſolid and real in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: the other are phantaſmatical, and praeſtigiouſly deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe. 3. The one God freely calls to do: the other are not done but by tempting both God, and the Devil. 4. The one are ſerious, and upon occaſions of importance: the other are ludicrous, and ſerve to make vain men ſport. 5. The one tend to confirm the Church: the other to ſeduce from it. 6. The one are liberal: the other mercenary. 7. The one profitable: the other pernicious. 8. The one make humble and modeſt: the other arrogant and full of oſtentation. 9. The one ſerves to inſtruct: the other onely to aſtoniſh. 10. The one are wrought with devout Prayer, Supplication, Thankſgiving: the other by ſuperſtitious imprecation, adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, incantation; with many ridiculous ſignes, and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ceremonies, nothing pertaining to the producing of the effect. And thus they differ in their Authors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtruments, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity quality, duration, utility, end, and effect.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Whether Magicians, Conjurers, Inchanters, Witches, &amp;c work not their miracles, (or rather ſignes, wonders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, portents) by the devils means? It is affirmed that they do ſo, for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe they do them not by God, Angels, Nature, or Art (as appears ſufficiently by what hath been ſaid already) and therefore they muſt needs do them by the devil. 2. Becauſe they operate upon a compact: which is evident in that invocation, adoration, ſacrifice, immolation, &amp;c. is hereunto required. 3. Becauſe they operate by idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, ſuperſtitious, ſorcerous, execrable, ridiculous ſignes, rites and ceremonies. 4. Becauſe they ſecretly invoke, although they outwardly would ſeem to command: which implorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58142:116"/>
and imperiouſneſſe, yea and diſſimulation between both theſe, is to God, and good Angels, abominable. 5. Becauſe their Prayers and preparations are blaſpheming, railing, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating, threatning, prophane, ſuperſtitious, abſurd, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: which neither God nor good Angel can indure. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeek either to allure, or compel their operating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by things ſenſible. 7. Becauſe the fact exceeding Natures order, and Arts efficacy: yet there can be no reaſonable cauſe why ſuch an effect ſhould be aſcribed either to God, or good Angels. 8. Becauſe the effect is by them aſcribed to times, places, figures, characters, rites ceremonies, &amp;c. 9. Becauſe there are uſed hereunto words (beſides names of God, and Angels) barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unknown, inſignificant, incoherent, apocryphal, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, ſorcerous, detorted, abſurd, ridiculous, &amp;c. 10. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make uſe of means unlawful, unapt, and not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch a purpoſe. 11. Becauſe they do their feats upon vain and light occaſions. 12. Becauſe they effect that (or ſeem ſo to do) at a diſtance: which the cauſes themſelves could not naturally do, were they proximately applyed. 13. Becauſe their miracles or wonders are not wrought, but at certain times, in certain places, and by certain means: as under ſuch conſtellations, by ſuch configurations, by ſuch animal parts, ſtones, herbs, preparations, confections, &amp;c. 14. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeem to make many cautions in the preparation; which they violate in the execution. As they caution to clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, chaſtity, temperance, ſobriety, juſtice, charity, &amp;c. yet the exerciſe is wholly of, and to the contrary. 15. Becauſe they are not onely ungodly men that do them: but they do them for wicked ends: As idolatry, murder, theft, convetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, luſts, pride, ambition, vain-glory, &amp;c. 16. Becauſe if there be any truth or reality of extraordinary effect, either through natures ſecret diſpoſition, or Arts ſtudious operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet diabolical ſuggeſtion intervenes, and prompts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to mingle many vanities and fallacies of ſignes and ceremonies, whereby to delude and deceive. 17. Becauſe they are ſeldome or never ſo prodigious and ſtupendous in effecting; as in troubled and diſtracted States. 18. Becauſe their monſtrous prodigies &amp; portents are moſtly wrought out of the Church, or in falſe and heretical Churches, or where

Whether there be any verity, or reality of miraculous effect, in thoſe things that are miridically done by the Devill, and Magicians: Reallity of effect there may be ſeen; but of miraculous effect none: That is, there may be ſome reall effect upon the patient indirectly, and conſequentially (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For we ſee that men are really affected, and terrified, even from ſpectrous and ludibrious phantaſmes. Our concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſtated, ſtands firm, for theſe proofes. 1. The Devill and Magicians cannot doe that which is poſſible to neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, nor to both of them together, (no though they had all the Angels joyned to them) that is, to worke true miracles. 2. God ſeldome or never permits, and the devill ſeldome or never intends, any verity and reallity of effect in ſuch caſes; Becauſe he delights to be a falſe emulator, but no true imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Gods workes. 3. If there be produced (at any time) any reallity of effect; it is not beyond the ſecret diſpoſition of the matter they worke in; then which nothing can bee more defective to the forme of a miracle. 4. All their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous transformations, and tranſportations are but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract one thing (by a ſwift and imperceptible motion) and ſubſtitute another in the place; and ſo either delude the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, or deceive the ſight. 5. Thoſe mutations, or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they worke, are but by actives and paſſives artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applyed; which though nature alone would not have p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that the vertue of effecting is ſimply and primarily in the naturall power, or property; and but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, and conditionally, in the artificiall or cunning application. 6 All their repreſentations, and oſtentations are phantaſmaticall and ſpectrous; either in reſpect of the preſtigious tranſpoſition of the object, the organ, or the meane. 7. The intent and end of ſuch their operations are repugnant to true and faithfull profeſſion, and holy and righteous converſation; and ſerving only to inſinuate or

But the Magicians did theirs at the <hi>call</hi> or <hi>command</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> verſ. 11. And therefore ſeeing there was not the ſame Authority of doing miracles; doubtleſſe there was not the like efficacy between them, or miraculous effect. 2. <hi>The Magicians of Egypt,</hi> though it be ſaid, <hi>they alſo did ſo, or in like manner:</hi> yet it is to be underſtood <hi>in ſpecie, non jure;</hi> in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but not indeed.

Others derive it from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root, that ſignifies involving, covering, hiding; to note, with what occult and involved ſlights and covertures, they ſought to conceal their preſtigious pranks; ſo as they might appear otherwiſe then indeed they were. Beſides, the word is ocmmonly uſed (in Hebrew Authors) to ſignifie diabolical and preſtigious works. 3. True miraculous effects may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and concord together; and never oppoſe, or deſtroy one another: it is a ſign of falſe circulatory phantaſms, that they are ſoon vaniſhing, and diſperſing, when they preſume to come in competition with true divine miracles.

Whether his rod did ſo while it was yet turned into a ſerpent, it skilleth not to diſpute: the Miracle was the greater, if it did ſo after it was turned into a rod again.

The truth of the Goſpel would ſtill be called in queſtion, and thought du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious and uncertain; if it always needed ſuch confirmation. The promiſes and faith would thus be evacuated: becauſe the walking would be, not by Faith, but by ſight. There would be no end of ſeeking after ſenſible ſignes and means; and ſo prophane men would ſtill be tempting unto them; and weak Chriſtians would be diſcouraged in their defect. Not onely ordinary graces would ſo grow vile; but even miracles themſelves: for they would be thought no miracles, by being ſo commonly obvious, and aſſiduous. What need we to ſtand upon ſuch, when the greateſt work of God, and moſt profitable for man, is not alwayes the greateſt miracle? Have we not perpetually Gods ſpiritual miracles, in our voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, converſion, juſtification, regeneration, ſanctification, &amp;c.? And his ordinary miracles, in our creation, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſervation, &amp;c.? And what need we more? To conclude, was there no other cauſe, our ſinnes are ſufficient to make divine miracles to ceaſe: ſhall we then look after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical miracles, ſignes, and wonders; ſuch as are ſet up by the ſins of men.</p>

               <p>IS not the rarity of miracles (already proved) enough to prove the ſtories of Magical Mirables to be but meer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? We need not therefore their pardon to call them ſo: nay, they ought to gratifie us that we call them not worſe then ſo. Seeing the vertue of miracles and miraculous operation, is in Gods word alone: and neither in Nature, nor Art, nor Artifice. What can we ſay leſſe, then that all ſuch natural Mirables, are onely for meere naturals to admire? Whoſe Authors have been ſome of them ſpurious; moſt of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; all of them (in that particular) vain and nugacious. Who take up their authorities by tradition; from paganiſh ſtory, poetical fiction, and mythological relation, of ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, as were never in Nature, or the world. Who uſe to cite their mirables with ſuch a <hi>(they ſay)</hi> as if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not onely aſhamed to own them; but afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them. Who ſtuffe up their legendary ſtories of magical mirables, with tales of ſuch ſtrange things, and they ſo incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and under ſtrange Names, and they ſo unknown; and in ſuch ſtrange places, and they ſo remote: as that they are not worth ſeeking after; or if they were, yet neither name, nor thing, nor place is to be found. Who urge us one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this; that ſuch their wonders are not to be proved by reaſon, but referred to experiment: and yet we are as far from ſeeing the one; as from hearing the other. Nevertheleſſe, all theſe are impudently urged, and impoſing upon our Faith, to admit, and admire, what wonderful effects of configurations conſtellations, influences, impreſſions, ſeales, characters; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Elements, Minerals, Stones, Vegetables, Animals; yea and Rationals not excepted.

The <hi>Rabbines</hi> ſay, there is an Animal called <hi>Jedua,</hi> having a humane ſhape, in the middle of whoſe Navel comes forth a ſtring, by which it is faſtned to the ground like a Gourd, and as far as the length of that ſtring reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it devoures all that is greene about it: and deceiving the ſight, cannot be taken, unleſſe that ſtring be cut off with the ſtroke of a dart, which being cut off, it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dyes.

               <p>Beſides all theſe (and infinite ſuch like) ſpeculative interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as touching auſpicating elections (common both to preſcribers and conſulters) there are, together with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, certain practical configurations: as the fabricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Images, ſtatues, pictures, <hi>Taliſmanus,</hi> idols (painted, molten, graven) under certain ſydereal conjunctions; for the repelling of things hurtful from you; and procuring of things helpful to you, <hi>viz.</hi> If you would drive away any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous ſerpent, or noyſom beaſt; make the figure thereof in ſome certain matter, under ſome convenient conſtellation, and inſcribe thereupon the name of the ſigne aſcending, and the name of the thing you would expell, &amp;c.

But I am weary with reckoning up (in part) things of ſo great folly; and of greater impiety. Onely I ask (not them, but the ſound, and ſober) if indeed they be not ſo? I mean, if the buſineſſe, and folly of the world (brought and

               <p>WHether Magicians and Aſtrologers themſelves, have not plainly and plentifully, diſcovered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, the vanity and impiety of Magick and Aſtrology?

For who can more truly and fully ſet them forth, then they that have given themſelves over to ſtudy and practiſe them? How many things (of old, and of late) have been ſpoken (either through a ſpirit of recantation, a conſcience of conviction, or a fury of exclamation) by magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, againſt Magick; and by Aſtrologers, againſt Aſtrology?

               <p>Whatſoever things have here already, and ſhall afterward be ſaid by me; I would not have any one <hi>aſſent</hi> to them: nor ſhal I my ſelf any further, then they ſhall be approved of by the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church,</hi> and the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>faithful</hi>—Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and thoſe who were the authors of this Art amongſt the Antients, have been <hi>Chaldeans, Aegyptians, Aſſyrians, Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Arabians;</hi> all whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> was perverſe, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted idolatry.

onely related out of other Authors, and not put down by us, for truth; but for a probable conjecture, which is allyed to truth; and an inſtruction for imitation in thoſe things that are true.—Of Magick I wrote (whilſt I was very young) three large books, which I called <hi>Of Occult Philoſophie;</hi> in which what was then, through the curioſity of my youth, erroneous, I now being more adviſed, am willing to have retracted, by this <hi>Reeantation:</hi> For I have heretofore ſpent very much time and coſt in theſe <hi>vanities.</hi> At length I grew ſo wiſe, as to underſtand how, and by what reaſons I was bound to dehort others from this deſtruction. For whoſoever do not in the truth, nor in the power of God, but in the deluſions of Devils, according to the operation of the evil ſpirits, preſume to <hi>divine,</hi> and <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and by <hi>magical vanities,</hi> exorciſms, inchantments, love po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, allurements, and other deviliſh works and deceits, of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, exorciſing preſtigious things, and making oſtentation of phantaſms, boaſting themſelves to work miracles, preſently vaniſhing: all theſe, with <hi>Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> and <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> ſhall be deſtinated to the torments of eternal fire.</p>
               <p>The antient Philoſophers teach us to know the nature of the <hi>genius</hi> of every man, by ſtars, their influx, and aſpects, which are potent in the <hi>nativity</hi> of any one: but with inſtructions ſo diverſe, and differing amongſt themſelves; that it is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to underſtand the myſteries of the Heavens by their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> following the <hi>ſtoicks,</hi> affirms that the foreknowing of future things belongs onely to the Gods.

The <hi>Astrologie,</hi> which is <hi>Aſtronomie</hi> (or rather the <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> which is <hi>Aſtrologie)</hi> is wholly fallacious; and much more nugacious then the fables of <hi>Poets,</hi> whoſe Maſters (bold men in truth, and authors of prodigies) out of an impious curioſity, after their owne fancy, and above humane capacity (as if it were <hi>Baſilides</hi> the hereticke his <hi>Abraxas)</hi> fabricate the heavenly orbes; and depaint the meaſures of the ſtarres, their motions, figures, images, numbers, concents; as if they were but of late deſcended downe from heaven, and had been there converſant for ſome time: by which they imagine all things ſtand, are done, and may be knowne. And yet about theſe very things they are greatly diſagreeing among themſelves, and contrary, and repugnant one to another: ſo that I doubt not to ſay with <hi>Pliny,</hi> it plainly argues the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of this Art, and that it is none: in that, teaching the very principles of it, one way thinke, or judge the <hi>Indians,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Mores,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Jewes,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Arabians</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Greekes,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Latines;</hi> otherwiſe the ancient, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the moderne Authors.

<pb facs="tcp:58142:132"/>
and as touching the motion of the eighth Orbe, and of the fixed Stars, they are very various amongſt themſelves. For the Chaldeans and the Aegyptians affirm it to be carried with one motion onely: to whom aſſent <hi>Alpatragus,</hi> and of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Alexander Aquilinus.</hi> But the reſt of the Aſtronomers, from <hi>Hipparchus</hi> to our times, ſay that it is carried about with many motions. The <hi>Talmudiſticall Iewes</hi> aſſigne to it a double motion. <hi>Azarcheles</hi> and <hi>Tebith,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus</hi> have aſcribed to it the motion of <hi>Trepidation,</hi> which they ſay is of acceſſe, and receſſe; above the little circles that are about the head of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra.</hi> But in this they differ among themſelves: becauſe <hi>Azarcheles</hi> ſaith, the moveable head cannot be diſtant from the fixt, more then ten parts. But <hi>Tebith</hi> ſaith, not more then four parts, with ten, and almoſt nine minuts. <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus</hi> ſaith, not more then eight parts: and therefore the fixed Stars not alwaies varying to the ſame parts of the world; but they conceive them ſometime returning where they began. But <hi>Ptolomy, Albategni, Rabbi Levi, Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezra, Zacutus,</hi> and (amongſt the moderne) <hi>Paulus Florentinus,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinus Ritius</hi> (very familiar to me in <hi>Italy)</hi> affirm the Stars to be moved alwaies and continually, according to the ſucceſſions of ſignes. The latter Aſtronomers attribute a tripple motion to the eighth Sphere; one proper, which we have called that of <hi>Trepidation;</hi> which is compleated once in ſeven thouſand yeeres: another which they call that of <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> from the ninth Sphere, whoſe circumvolution is not finiſhed in leſſe then forty nine thouſand yeeres: the third, from the tenth Orbe, which they call the motion of the <hi>Firſt moveable,</hi> or the motion of <hi>Rapture,</hi> or the <hi>Diurnall;</hi> which within a naturall day returns daily to his beginning. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they who attribut a double motion to the eighth Sphere, doe not all of them agree among themſelves: For almoſt all the modern, and they who admit of the motion of <hi>Trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> doe argue it to be hurried along in a ſuperiour Sphere: but <hi>Albategni, Albuhaſſen, Alfraganus, Averroes, Rabbi Levi, Abraham Zacutus, Auguſtinus Ritius,</hi> doe think that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall motion,</hi> which others think to be the motion of <hi>Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is not proper to any Sphere, but is done by the whole Heavens. And <hi>Averroes</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (in his book
<pb facs="tcp:58142:132"/>
which he inſcribed of <hi>narrations)</hi> doth deny the motion of <hi>Gyration.</hi> And <hi>Rabbi Levi</hi> ſaith, he thinks with <hi>Averroes,</hi> that the <hi>Diurnall motion</hi> is done by the whole Heavens. Again, they no more agree, about the meaſure of the motion of the eighth Orbe, and of the fixed Stars. For <hi>Ptolomy</hi> thinks that the fixed Stars are moved one degree in an hundred yeers. <hi>Albategni</hi> contends this to be done in ſixty ſix <hi>Aegyptian</hi> yeers: To whom aſſent <hi>Rabbi Levi, Rabbi Zacutus,</hi> and <hi>Alphontius,</hi> in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his Tables. <hi>Azarcheles</hi> the <hi>Moore</hi> ſaith, they are moved one degree in ſeventy foure yeeres: <hi>Hipparchus</hi> in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and eight. Many of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as <hi>Rabbi Ioſue, Moyſes, Maymonides, Rabbi Avenezra,</hi> and after them <hi>Hay Benrodam,</hi> in ſeventy yeeres: <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus,</hi> in eighty yeers: <hi>Auguſtinus Ritius</hi> holds the middle betwixt the opinions of <hi>Albategni</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> thinking that the fixed Stars are not moved one part of the Heavens, ſooner then ſixty yeeres; nor ſlower then ſeventy yeers. But <hi>Rabbi Abraham Zacutus</hi> (as <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> tels us) teſtifieth out of the tradition of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that there are yet in Heaven two Stars Diametrally oppoſite one to the other; which, contrary to the order of ſignes, fulfill not their courſe in leſſe then an hundred forty foure yeeres. Alſo <hi>Alpetragus</hi> himſelfe thinks, that there are in the Heavens vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motions, yet unknown to man; which if it be ſo, there may be Stars and bodies there, to which thoſe motions may agree; which either men cannot diſcerne by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding altitude; or no Arts as yet have by obſervation found out. To which <hi>Phavorinus</hi> the Philoſopher in <hi>Gellius,</hi> aſſents; in his oration againſt the <hi>Genethliacks.</hi> It therefore remaines to conclude, that no Aſtronomer as yet hath deſcended from Heaven, who could teach us the inerrant motion truely and certainly. Neither hath the true motion of <hi>Mars</hi> hitherto been known; which alſo <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus</hi> complaines of, in a certain Epiſtle to <hi>Blanehinus.</hi> Alſo one <hi>Gulielmus de ſancto Clodoaldo,</hi> an excellent Aſtrologer, hath left written the errour of the ſame motion, in his obſervations two hundred yeers ſince and more; and none of the latter hath hitherto corrected either him or it. Moreover it is unpoſſible to finde out the true ingreſſe of the <hi>Sunne</hi> into the <hi>aquinoctiall points:</hi> which <hi>Rabbi Levi</hi> proveth by many reaſons. But what ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:58142:133"/>
we ſpeake of thoſe that are found out ſince; how the former have erred about them? For many, with <hi>Tebith,</hi> have thought the greateſt declination of the Sunne to be continually varied: when nevertheleſſe it is alwaies carried in one meaſure. Yet <hi>Ptolomy</hi> thought otherwiſe of it; and it wat otherwiſe found out by <hi>Rabbi Levi, Avenezra,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus.</hi> In like manner, concerning the motion of the Sunne, and meaſure of the yeere, they have found it otherwiſe, then <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parchus</hi> have delivered. Likewiſe, as touching the motion of the <hi>Stage</hi> of the Sunne, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> conceives one thing; but <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bategni,</hi> and the reſt another. Moreover of the images, and conſiderations of the fixed Stars; the <hi>Indians</hi> have delivered their opinions after one manner, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> after another, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> another, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> another, the <hi>Arabians</hi> another, <hi>Timotheus</hi> another, <hi>Arſatilis</hi> another, <hi>Hipparchus</hi> another, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> another, and the <hi>moderne</hi> writers another. I paſſe by here to tell, how they befoole themſelves about the right and the left principle of the heavens; concerning which St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> the <hi>Almaine,</hi> two ſuperſtitious divines, while they ſeriouſly endeavoured to ſay ſomething, could finde nothing to ſay: neither could any man certainly ever finde out any thing. Moreover the <hi>Galaxia,</hi> or the <hi>milkie circle,</hi> what it is, the Aſtrologers are yet ignorant of. I alſo forbeare to lengthen my ſpeech about the <hi>excentricks, concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks, apicyeles, retrogradations, trepidations, acceſſes, receſſes, raptures,</hi> and other motions, and circles of motions: ſeeing all theſe are not; are neither the workes of God, nor of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but monſters of the <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and trifles of Feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, derived from corrupt Philoſophy, and the Fables of Poets; to which nevertheleſſe, as it were to true things, and created by God, or eſtabliſhed in nature, theſe Maſters are not aſhamed to give ſo much Faith, as to referre unto theſe trifling vanities, as unto cauſes, whatſoever things are done in theſe inferiours: and ſay, that thoſe feined motions are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all inferiour motions. Such Aſtronomers as theſe, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naximenes</hi> his mayd hath opportunely caſtigated, by a ſaying not to be deſpiſed; for ſhe uſing to walke abroad with her maſter <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> who on a certain day going early out of his houſe to inſpect the Starres, while he was ſurely intent in
<pb facs="tcp:58142:133"/>
looking up to the heavens, he, unmindfull of the places ſite, fell ſuddenly into a ditch; then ſaid his mayd, I wonder Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon what reaſon you ſhould perſwade your ſelfe that you can foreknow ſuch things as are in Heaven; when as you cannot foreſee thoſe things that are before your own feet. The ſame facetious paſſage is reported concerning <hi>Thales Mileſius;</hi> in like manner reproved by his hand-mayd <hi>Treſſa.</hi> And it is not unlike to theſe, that <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith; The Aſtrologers while they are ſearching after the coaſtes of Heaven, none of them perceives what is before his own feet. I my ſelfe of a child, have taken in this Art from my parents; and further, I have loſt much time, and labour in it: at length I have learned that this whole art, and every part of it, leaves you no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but meere toyes and figments of imagination. And it now irketh, and repenteth me of my labour loſt heretofore; and I did deſire to bereave my ſelfe of all memory, and uſe of it, and had long ſince caſt it out of my mind; nor would I ever have reaſſumed it, but that the violent intreaties of ſome potent ones (who are wont ſometimes to abuſe great &amp; good wits, to unworthy artifices) had compelled me to fall upon it again; yea, and my own domeſticall utility did perſwade me, that I ought ſometimes to enjoy their folly, and to obſerve them with trifles, that ſo greatly coveted after trifles. I truly ſay trifles; for what elſe hath Aſtrologie, but meere trifles of Poets and Fables, and portentous figments, with which they faine the heavens to be fully ſtored? Neither doe any kind of men agree more together, then Aſtrologers and Poets doe; excepting that they diſſent about <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Veſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this diſcord of Aſtrologers about the ſite of Stars and Planets, had I not now remembred it, I had paſſed it by: in as much as it belongs not to Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſo much as Philoſophers.

Neither is there any conſtancy of opinion amongſt them about the Celeſtials, nor yet truth; neither is that any marvell, ſeeing the Heaven it ſelfe, which they ſearch, is of all other moſt inconſtant, and moſt repleniſhed with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles and fables; for the very <hi>Twelve ſignes,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Boreall</hi> and <hi>Auſtrall</hi> images, had never aſcended up to heaven, but by Fables. And yet the Aſtrologers live by theſe Fables, and impoſe them upon others, and make a gain thereby. But the Poats in the mean while (the egregious inventors of them) grow poore, and hungry.</p>
               <p>There remaines yet another ſpecies of Aſtrologie, which they call the <hi>Divinatory,</hi> or the <hi>Judiciary;</hi> which treats of the revolutions of the yeers of the world, of <hi>nativities,</hi> of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, of elections, of intentions and cogitations, of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or powers; for the foretelling, caſting up, eſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or repelling the events of all things future; even of the ſecret diſpoſitions of divine providence it ſelfe. Hereupon the Aſtrologers doe mart, or vent the effects of the Heavens, and the Stars, from yeers moſt remote, and before all memory of things, or the times of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> or (as they ſay) from the great <hi>conjunctions</hi> before the <hi>Flood.</hi> And they affirm that the effects, forces, motions of all living creatures, ſtones, metals, herbs, and whatſoever things in theſe inferiours, doe flow from theſe ſame Heavens, and Starres, and doe altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, and may be ſearched out by them. Verely theſe are incredulous men, and not leſſe impious, in not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging this one thing, that God had already made the Herbs, Plants, and Trees, even before the Heavens and Stars. Moreover, the moſt grave Philoſophers, as <hi>Pythagoras, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Bion, Favorinus, Panaetius, Carneades, Poſſidonius, Timaeus, Ariſtoteles, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyrius, Avicenna, Averroes, Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Galenus, Alexander Aphrodiſaeus, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58142:134"/>
and many more, who have ſearched the cauſes of things from every Art and Science; yet never remit us to theſe Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall cauſes: which although they were cauſes, yet becauſe they plainly knew not the courſes of the Stars, and their forces (which is a thing moſt known to all wiſe men) they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot give a certain judgement of their effects. Neither are there wanting among them (as <hi>Eudoxus, Archelaus, Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus, Hoychilax, Halicarnaſſaeus)</hi> moſt skilfull <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and many other modern and moſt grave Authors, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it is impoſſible that any thing certain ſhould be found out concerning the ſcience of ſuch judgements: both becauſe of innumerable other cauſes cooperating together with the Heavens, which muſt be attended together; for ſo <hi>Ptolomy</hi> bids: as alſo becauſe very many occaſions doe hinder them; as namely cuſtomes, manners, education, ſhame, command, place, geniture, blood, meat, liberty of mind, and diſcipline; ſeeing theſe influxes compell not (as they ſay) but incline. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, they who have preſcribed the rules of judgements, doe for the moſt part determine ſuch diverſe and repugnant things of the ſame matter; that it is impoſſible for a progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticator to pronounce any thing certaine, from ſo many, and ſo various, and diſſonant opinions; unleſſe there be in him ſome intrinſicall ſenſe of things future, and occult; or ſome inſtinct of preſage, or rather occult and latent inſpiration of the Devill, by which, among theſe he may be able to diſcerne, or may be induced by ſome other way, to adhere now to this, now to that opinion: which inſtinct whoſoever wanteth, he (as <hi>Haly</hi> ſaith) cannot be a Tel-troth in Aſtrologicall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wherefore now, Aſtrologicall prediction muſt conſiſt not ſo much of Art, as by a kind of obſcure, lot, or chance of things. And as in the books, or games of Lottery, ſometimes ſuch an one is drawn forth, as ſpeaks truth, and hits right; yet not by art, but by chance; ſo it is by chance, and not by art, that vaticinations come forth truely either from the mind, or the mouth of an Aſtrologer. To which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> atteſts ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſcience of the Stars is from thee and from them: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the prediction of things future and occult, is not ſo much from the obſervation of the Stars, as from the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind. Therefore is there no certainty of this Art,
<pb facs="tcp:58142:135"/>
but it is convertible to all things, according to the opinion which is collected by conjectures, or imagination, or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible ſuggeſtion of Devils, or ſome ſuperſtitious lot or chance. This art therefore is no other then a fallacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of ſuperſtitious men, who through the uſe of long time, have made a ſcience of uncertain things: in which, for the beguiling men of their money, they may deceive the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and may alſo be deceived themſelves. And if the Art of theſe men be true, and be underſtood by themſelves, whence then bubble out ſo many and ſo great errors in their progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications? But if it be not ſo, doe they not vainly and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and impiouſly, to profeſſe a ſcience of things, that are not, or not underſtood? But the more cautelous of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce not upon futures, ſave obſcurely: and ſuch as may be applied to everything, and time, and Prince, and Nation. Out of a verſatile artifice, doe they feyne ambiguous prognoſticks; and after that any of them ſhall happen, then doe they gather the cauſes thereof; and after the fact or effect, then doe they eſtabliſh old vaticinations with new reaſons; to the intent they may ſeem to have foreſeen. Juſt as the interpreters of dreames, who when they have a dream underſtand nothing of it for certain: but after that ſomething is hapned unto them, then doe they adopt the dream to that which hapned. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſeeing it is impoſſible, in ſuch a variety of Stars, but to finde ſome of them well, ſome of them ill poſited; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they take occaſion of ſpeaking what they pleaſe; and to whom they will they predict life, health, honours, riches, power, victory, ſoundneſſe, off-ſpring, marriage, Prieſthood, Magiſtracy, and the like: but if they be ill affected to any, to them they denounce deaths, hangings, reproaches, deſtructions, baniſhments, barrenneſſe, deſolation, calamities, &amp;c. not ſo much out of a wicked art, as out of wicked affections, drawing on to deſtruction thoſe men that are credulous to theſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous curioſities: and oft times committing among themſelves both Princes and people, in deadly ſeditions and warres.

But though they lie daily, and be convinced of lying, then they excuſe it by blaſphemy, or cover one lie with another, ſaying, a wiſe man ruleth over the Stars: when as in truth, neither doth a wiſe man overrule the Stars, nor the Stars a wiſe man, but it is God that ruleth over them both; or elſe they ſay, that ſome ineptitude, or incapacity of the receiver hindred the celeſtiall influxes.

For if from the Stars be mens lives and fortunes, why feare we? why are we troubled? Rather let us leave theſe to God, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, who neither can erre nor doe evill. And ſince we are but men, let us not be over wiſe in high matters, and more then is meet, and above our powers; but only ſo far forth as behooveth humane creatures.

But if our life and fortune be not from the Starres, then doth not every Aſtrologer run in vaine?

To which truely they who truſt moſt, are rendred of all men the moſt unhappy.

Alſo they think that the fidelity of every one, towards men, or towards God, and profeſt Religion, and ſecrets of Conſcience, may be deprehended from part of the Sun, and from the third, ninth, and eleventh houſes of heaven: and they delivering many rules of foreknowing the thoughts, and as they ſay, the intentions of men.

But for all this, to theſe execrable fopperies, and pernicious hereſies <hi>Petrus Apponenſis, Roger Bacon, Guido Bonatus, Arnoldus de nova villa,</hi> Philoſophers; and <hi>Alyanenſis,</hi> a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and a Theologue, and divers other <hi>Doctors</hi> of a Chriſtian name (not without an infamy of hereſie) do ſubſcribe: yea and dare teſtifie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that they have experienced theſe for truth. But <hi>Johannes Picus Mirandula</hi> of late yeers, hath written againſt <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> in twelve Books; and that in ſo great copiouſneſſe, that ſcarce any argument hath eſcaped him: as alſo with ſo great efficacy; ſo that hitherto, neither <hi>Lucius Balnutius,</hi> an eager propugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Aſtrologie, nor yet any other defender of this Art, could ſave it from thoſe reaſons, that <hi>Picus</hi> hath brought againſt it. For he proveth, by moſt ſtrong arguments, it to have been the invention not of men, but of Devils. Which ſelf-ſame thing <hi>Firmianus</hi> ſaith; by which they have endeavoured to aboliſh all Philoſophie, Medicine, Laws, and Religion, to the utter exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of man-kind. For firſt, it detracts from the faith of Religion, it extenuates miracles, it takes away providence: while it teaches that all things come to paſſe by the force of conſtellations, and that they doe depend by a fatal neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtars. Moreover it patronizes vices, excuſing them as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from heaven upon us. It defiles and overthrows all good Arts; eſpecially Philoſophie; traducing cauſes from true reaſons, to fables; and Medicine in like manner, turning from natural, and effectual remedies, to vain obſervations, and perverſe ſuperſtitions, deſtructive both to body and minde. Further, it utterly undoes Laws, manners, and whatſoever Arts of humane prudence: while it would have Aſtrologie onely conſulted, at what time, after what maner, and by what means any thing is to be done; as if it alone, drawing its authority over all down from heaven; did hold the ſcepter over life,
<pb facs="tcp:58142:138"/>
manners, and all both publike and private matters; and as if all other things were to be reputed vain, that did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for patron. Indeed an Art moſt worthy for devils to profeſſe from the firſt, to the deceit of man, and diſhonour of God. Moreover the hereſie of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> wholly taking away all liberty of will, flowed not elſwhere, then from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers falſe opinion, and doctrine of Fate. From the ſame fountain alſo ſprung the hereſie of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> who pronounced 365. heavens, made of one another by ſucceſſion and ſimilitude, and the oſtenſion of theſe to be the number of the dayes of the yeer (or the number of the days of the yeer to be the oſtenſion of theſe) aſſigning to every one of them certain principles, and vertues, and Angels, and feigning names for them: but the chief of them all is <hi>Abraxas;</hi> which name, according to the Greek letters, containeth in it 365. which namely are the local poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe heavens commentitiouſly diviſed by it. Theſe things are therefore ſhown, that ye may know, that Aſtrology is the begetter of hereticks. Furthermore, as all the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Philoſophers do explode this divinatory Aſtrologie: ſo <hi>Moſes, Eſaias, Job, Jeremias,</hi> and all the other Prophets of the old Law, do deteſt it.

Wherefore, all thoſe arts of divination, how far they are from truth they plainly diſcover themſelves in this; in that they uſe principles ſo manifeſtly falſe, and feigned by a poeticall temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which neither are, nor have been, nor ever ſhall be; yet are they made the cauſes, and ſignes to which all events of things are to be referred, contrary to all evident truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magick</hi> is ſo neer joyned to, and of affinity with <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> ſo that he who profeſſeth Magick without Aſtrologie, doth nothing, but erreth altogether.</p>
               <p>There is an Art given to mortal men, whereby they might gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate certain latter things, not partaking of truth, and divinity, but might deduce certain images like unto themſelves: and Magicians, moſt audacious men, have gone ſo farre to perpetrate all things, that old and ſtrong <hi>Serpent,</hi> the promiſer of Sciences, eſpecially favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that they, like to him, Apes, have endeavoured to emulate both God and nature.</p>
               <p>To ſuch a height of madneſſe ſome of the Magicians are grown, that from diverſe conſtellations of the Stars, through internals of times, and by a certain reaſon of proportions, being rightly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they think that a fabricated image of the heavenly creatures may with a becke receive the ſpirit of life and underſtanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may anſwer thoſe that conſult it, and reveale the ſecrets of hid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den truth. Hence it is plain; that this <hi>naturall Magick</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enclined towards <hi>Goetie</hi> and <hi>Theurgie,</hi> is inſnared very oſten in the wiles and errours of evill ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Of ceremoniall Magick there are two parts, <hi>Goetie</hi> and <hi>Theurgie. Goetie</hi> unfortunately began by the commerce with unclean ſpirits, compacted of the rites of wicked curioſity, unlawfull charms, and deprecations, is exerated, &amp; baniſhed by the verdicts of all Lawes.—Theſe are they who carry about them familiar ſpirits—doe feigne themſelves to prophecy.—Some of them ſtudy to call and compell evill ſpirits adjured by ſome certain powers, eſpecially of divine names, &amp;c.—Others moſt wicked, and by miſchiefe deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be puniſhed with all fires, ſubmit themſelves to devils,
<pb facs="tcp:58142:140"/>
ſacrifice to them, and adore them, and are become guilty of idolatry, and the vileſt abaſements; to which crimes if the former be not obnoxious, yet they expoſe themſelves to manifeſt dangers. For even compelled divels doe watch, to the intent they may alwaies deceive us in our errours. From this Sect (or rather ſinke) of the <hi>Goeticks</hi> have iſſued all theſe books of darkneſſe, &amp;c.—excogitated by men of deplored wits.—Which books to him that more acutely looks into them, and into the canon of their precepts, the cuſtome of rites, the kind of words, and characters, the order of extruction, and the inſulſate phraſe, doe openly bewray themſelves, to containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but mere toyes, and impoſtures; and to be pulcht up in latin Hims by the forlorne artificers of perdition, ignorant of all ancient Magick, out of certain profane obſervations, mixt with the ceremonies of our religion, many unknown names and ſeales inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that they might terrifie the rude and ſimple, and be an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſenceleſſe, and ſuch as know not good Letters.—But this is the reaſon why theſe <hi>Goeticks</hi> onely make uſe of evill ſpirits; becauſe good Angels will hardly appeare; for they expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and aſſemble not but with men of clean heart, and holy life; but the evill ones eaſily exhibite themſelves to be invoked, falſly favouring, and belying a divinity, are alwaies at hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by their ſubtilty, to the intent they may be worſhipped and adored.</p>
               <p>Many think that <hi>Theurgie</hi> is not unlawfull, as if this were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by good Angels, and a divine power: when as very often under the names of God, and Angels, it is obſtringed with the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of evill ſpirits.—Of this ſchoole are the art <hi>Almadel,</hi> the art <hi>Noterie,</hi> the <hi>Pauline</hi> art, the art of <hi>Revelations,</hi> and many more of the ſame ſuperſtition; which are ſo much the more pernicious, as to the unskilfull they ſeem the more divine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cabalie</hi> is an art (as is reported) very ancient, and yet the name hath not been known among Chriſtians but of later times.—This art of <hi>Cabalie,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſo boaſt of, I ſometimes have ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with much labour; and I finde and confeſſe it to be nothing elſe but a meer <hi>rapſodie</hi> of ſuperſtition, &amp; a certain <hi>theurgicall</hi> magick, but if proceeding from God (as the <hi>Jews</hi> boaſt) it any whit conduced to the perfection of life, to the ſalvation of men, to the worſhip of God, &amp; to the underſtanding of the truth, verily that <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> which (the <hi>Synagogue</hi> rejected) came unto us to teach us all truth, would not have concealed it from his Church until theſe laſt times,
<pb facs="tcp:58142:140"/>
which truly knoweth all things that are of God.—But that we try, and ſee, that by the revolutions (as they call them) of this art, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſentences of great myſteries are wreſted out of ſacred Letters; the whole is nothing elſe; but a certain playing upon Allegories; which idle men, buſied in every letter, point and number (which this tongue, and the manner of writing eaſily ſuffer) do feign &amp; refeigne at their pleaſure.—Therefore this <hi>Cabalie</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> is nothing elſe but a certaine pernicious ſuperſtition, which collecteth, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, transferreth words, and names, and letters ſcatteringly placed in the Scripture; and as they liſt making one thing of another, they diſſolve the parts of truth, the ſpeeches, the inductions, and making parables here and there of their own fictions, they would adopt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the words of God, defaming the Scriptures, ſaying, that their figments do conſiſt of them, they calumniate the Law of God by their impudently extorted ſupputations of dictions, ſyllables, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, numbers; they attempt to inferre violent and blaſphemous proofe of their perfidiouſneſſe. Furthermore, being puft up with theſe trifles, they boaſt themſelves to finde out, and to know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable myſteries of God, and ſecrets that are above the Scriptures; by which they are not aſhamed to lie with great boldneſſe, and without bluſhing, that they themſelves can prophecy and work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and mighty works.</p>
               <p>But let us return unto Magick, parcell where of is the artifice of preſtigious things, that is, of illuſions; which are only done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to appearance, by which Magicians ſhew phantaſms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> play many miracles by circulatory frauds, and cauſe dreams: which is done not ſo much by <hi>Goeticall</hi> incantations, imprecations, and deceits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; as alſo by certain vapors of perfumes, lights, <hi>phyltres, collyries,</hi> alligations, and ſuſpenſions; and beſides by rings, images, glaſſes, and ſuch like drugs and inſtruments of magicall art, and by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and celeſtiall vertue. Alſo many things are done by a prompt ſubtlety and induſtry of hand; of which ſort we ſee ſome are done daily by Stageplayers and juglers, which therefore we call <hi>Chiroſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts,</hi> that is, ſlight-handed.—And now, by what hath been ſaid, it is plaine, that Magick is nothing elſe but a collection, or compact of idolatry, <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> and ſuperſtitious Medicine. And now alſo there is, by <hi>Magicians,</hi> a great company of <hi>Hereticks</hi> riſen up in the Church, who as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> reſiſted <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo have they reſiſted the <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> truth.</p>
               <p>All this is uttered againſt them by one <hi>Arch magician,</hi> I mean <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Agrippa:</hi> not a little to the like effect might be collected out

of another of them, namely <hi>Johannes Trithemius;</hi> yea undoubtedly, he that had but the opportunity to peruſe their Authors (old, and of late) needs for their confutation, to urge them with no more, then their own confeſſion. Onely I would aske of them this one thing, what doe they think of this one Magician, for this one act of his? Whether doe they conceive him (in charity) to have thus confeſſed, retracted, recanted, repented returned? &amp;c. or, doe they uncharitably account him for it, to be humorous, cynicall, ſatyricall, invective, diſtracted, mad, male content, &amp;c? And whether for this one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his will they have him called a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> a <hi>Daemon,</hi> an <hi>Heroe,</hi> a <hi>God, all things,</hi> or nothing? Does not he himſelfe tell us, what kind of cenſure he ſuſpects from all kinds of <hi>Mag-aſtro-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers?</hi> Alas (quoth he) with how many of their machinations will they oppugne me? with how many devices will they aſſaile me? with what ignominies will they perſecute me?—The impious <hi>Mathematician</hi> will preſcribe me both earth and heaven—The ſortilegious <hi>Pythagoriſt</hi> will ſuppute for me unlucky numbers. The pointing <hi>Geomantick</hi> will caſt unhappy figures, and project for me a priſon, and ſorrow.—The <hi>Fatall Aſtrologers</hi> will threaten any hanging, and by a ſlippery turning of the heavens, inhibit my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the Gods above. The menacing <hi>Diviner</hi> will ominate all manner of evill to me. The importunate <hi>Phyſiognomiſt</hi> will defame me for frigide, and inſufficient. The doting <hi>Metopoſcopiſt</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce me for a brainſick Aſſe. The fatidicall <hi>Chiromantiſt</hi> will divine all things ſiniſterly of me. The preſaging <hi>Aruſpex</hi> will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurate me with all manner of ill luck. The portentous <hi>Speculator</hi> wil ſend revengefull flames of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and fires of preſaging thunder. The dusky <hi>Oniropoliſt,</hi> or Dream-teller will affright me with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnall <hi>Ghoſts</hi> and <hi>Goblins.</hi> The <hi>furious Vaticinator</hi> wil deceive me with an ambiguous Oracle. The prodigious <hi>Magicians</hi> wil tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me (as another <hi>Apuleius</hi> or <hi>Lucian)</hi> not into a golden, but peradventure into a dirty Aſſe. The black <hi>Goeticke</hi> wil perſecute me with <hi>Spectres</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi> The ſacrilegious <hi>Theurgiſt</hi> wil conſecrate my head to the Crows, or perhaps to the Jakes. The circumciſed <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> wil imprecate their curſe upon me. The old doting <hi>praeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator</hi> will repreſent me as an headleſſe Eunuch, &amp;c. To conclude therefore in a word, ſince this is the ſuſpition of one of their own, what then muſt another expect from them? But (God be bleſſed) we are taugh to diſcover their madneſſe, and deſpiſe their malice, by a better light, and ſtrength, then all their own confeſſions can afford us.</p>

That the proper fruits of their Schooles, Colledges, Societies, Religion, profeſſion, practice, were the nouriſhing of Nations in Idolatry, ſuperſtition, ſorcery, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, &amp;c. That the cauſes of mens ſeeking after, or conſulting with any ſuch, have been alwaies ſome depraved paſſion, and corrupt affection. That alwaies men of the greateſt learning, wiſdome, valor, vertue, conſcience, have derided and deſpiſed; but they have been men of the contrary diſpoſition, that have moſt believed, or feared their prognoſtications, or predictions.

So <hi>Iupiter</hi> wept ſhowers of blood, becauſe he could not deliver his ſonne <hi>Sarpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> from death.</p>

Contrarily, <hi>Apollo Pythius</hi> contends, that the fates may be diſſolved by maleficall arts, for when one enquired, why <hi>Apollo</hi> had judged him fit for nothing, and what was to be done, that he might be thought fit for ſomething? he anſwered, the force of the Fates did hinder him; yet he might avoyd them by magicall arts.</p>
                  <p>Almoſt infinite numbers, both of <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> yea women, and tender children, have faineleſly and willingly left their bodies, and imbraced their deaths: now this cannot be applied to the neceſſity of Fate.</p>

                  <p>AMong the <hi>Seranes</hi> there is a law not to kill, nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, not to worſhip Images; whence in that region, there's no temple to be ſeen, no harlot, no adultreſſe, none is a thiefe, none a man ſlayer; neither doth the fiery ſtarre of <hi>Mars,</hi> conſtituted in the midſt of heaven, compell the wil of anyone of them to the murder of men: neither doth <hi>Venus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to <hi>Mars,</hi> cauſe any one of them to ſolicite another mans wife: and yet every day <hi>Mars</hi> muſt needs come there into the midſt of heaven; and that in ſo great a Region that men are born there every houre, is not to be denied.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Bactrians,</hi> there are many thouſands of men, which they call <hi>Brachmans;</hi> they both by traditions, and laws of their Fathers, neither worſhip Images, nor eate any thing that is animate, they neither drink wine or beere, but farre from all malignity, are onely attending upon God: but yet all the other <hi>Indians</hi> in the ſame Region, are involved in adulteries, murder, drunkenneſſe, idolatry; yea, there are found ſome of them, dwelling in the ſame climate, which hunting men, and ſacrificing, devoure them. And yet not any of the <hi>Planets,</hi> which they call good and happy, could prohibite theſe from ſlaughter, and miſchiefe; neither could the malefick ſtarres impell the <hi>Brachmans</hi> to malefice, or malefacture.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Perſians</hi> there was a law, of marrying daughters, ſiſters, and mothers themſelves: neither did they celebrate theſe nefarious marriages in <hi>Perſia</hi> onely, but alſo in all other cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the world whereſoever they came: whoſe wickedneſſe other Nations abominating, called them <hi>Maguſiaeans;</hi> and there are in <hi>Aegypt, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> very many of the <hi>Magufiaeans,</hi> that by ſucceſſion from their fathers, are ſtill pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the ſame wickedneſſe.

in the Nativities of them all, there was <hi>Venus</hi> in termes, and in the houſe of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and with <hi>Saturne, Mars</hi> aſpecting.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Getulians,</hi> this is the law or cuſtom: the women till the fields build houſes, and doe all ſuch like works; and moreover they may meet with whom they pleaſe: neither are they accuſed for it by their husbands, nor called therefore adultereſſes though they mingle indifferently with all, and eſpecially with ſtrangers. Alſo their women contemne all perfumes, neither weare they dyed garments; but goe bare footed. On the contrary, their men delight in veſtures, and odours, and various colours; yet doe they it not out of effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; for they are valiant and warlike above other Nations. Nevertheleſſe all the women that are born among them, had not <hi>

                  <p>Among the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> the women uſe gallant ornaments, and precious oyntments, and are more reverenced by their handmayds and ſervants, then their husbands are, and ride abroad in a ſingular pompe, their horſes adorned with trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of gold and precious ſtones: neither doe they live chaſtly, but mingle with ſervants as well as ſtrangers: nor are they accuſed by their husbands, becauſe they Lord it over them.

                  <p>Amongſt the <hi>Arabians</hi> all adultereſſes are put to death, and thoſe puniſhed, that are onely but ſuſpected.

Contrarily we ſee among the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> parricide is not expiated, but by the greater penalty. Among the <hi>Atrians</hi> or <hi>Adroams,</hi> he that ſtole the leaſt thing was ſtoned: but among the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> he that ſtole but petty things was onely ſpit upon: yet among the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſuch an one was beaten and wounded.

City of the Gentiles, propoſed this condition: that if he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dead, then <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be ſlaine, who injuriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked ſo great a power (for ſo he was called) but if <hi>Peter</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the fact, he ſhould in like manner be avenged of <hi>Simon. Peter</hi> is content and <hi>Simon</hi> begins: and drawing to the dead mans bed, ſo ſoon as he began to inchant, and murmurre his charms, the dead corps ſeemed to move the head, thereupon great was the cry of the Gentiles, that he was alive already, and ſpake with <hi>Simon:</hi> and a greater indignation againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> that he durſt offer to compare himſelfe to ſuch a power. The holy <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſiring ſilence, ſaid, if the dead be raiſed indeed, and live, let him riſe, walke, ſpeake: all this is but a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſme, and no reality: call but <hi>Simon</hi> away from the bed ſide, and then ſhall ye ſee not ſo much as the leaſt ſhew of it. Well, <hi>Simon</hi> was brought from the bed, and there remained not ſo much as a ſigne of any motion in the dead man. Then <hi>Peter</hi> intent on prayer a while within himſelfe, and ſtanding aloofe off from the corps, cryed with a loud voyce, Young man ariſe, <hi>the Lord Jeſus</hi> healeth thee: and ſtraight way he aroſe, and ſpake, and walked, and received meat, and he delivered him to his mother, who deſired him, that he would not depart from him: to whom he ſaid, he ſhall not be forſaken of him who hath made him to riſe again, whoſe ſervants we are: and thou mother, be ſecure of thy ſonne, and feare not, for he hath his keeper.

The Magician was much tormented in himſelfe at this glory of the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> and collecting himſelfe, and ſummoning up all the force of his charmes, he gathers the people together, and complaines, that he had been greatly offended by the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> and therefore would now leave the City, which he was wont ſo to defend. And appoints a day, on which he would goe flie, and ſo would aſcend into thoſe ſupernall ſeats; for the heavens was open to him when he pleaſed: upon the ſaid day he gets up the <hi>Capitoline</hi> Mount, and ſo caſting himſelf from the top of a Rock, began to flye.

power of God, and not of men, to flye with a body; and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf did no ſuch thing.

                     <hi>MIleſian Apollo</hi> being conſulted about <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether he was God, or man, gave this anſwer: That he was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall according to fleſh, or body; wiſe in portentous, or monſtrous workes; but being apprehended by armes under <hi>Chaldean</hi> Judges, with nailes and clubs, he made a bitter end. Upon which <hi>Lactantius</hi> his comment is, That although the Oracle (as it was forced) began to ſpeak truth; yet it did it ſo ſubtilly, and perverſely, as with intent to deceive the conſulter, being altogether ignorant of the myſtery of God and man: and ſo ſeems to deny him to be God, by confeſſing him to be man. But in that it acknowledgeth him to be <hi>mortall,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, it is not inconſequent (although againſt the mind of the Oracle) but that he was immortall, and God never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, according to the Spirit. And why muſt he needs make mention of the fleſh; when as it was enough to ſay him <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall?</hi> but being preſſed with truth, he could not deny the thing to be, as it was: as he alſo was forced to confeſſe him to be <hi>wiſe.</hi> And what ſaies <hi>Apollo</hi> to himſelfe? If he be wiſe, then is his doctrine wiſdome, and no other: and they are therefore wiſe that follow it, and no other. Why then doe their vulgar account us vain and fooliſh: ſince we follow a maſter, and Teacher wiſe, by their Oraculous gods own confeſſion? In that he ſaith, that he did portentous works (by which he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the faith of a Godhead) he ſeems to aſſent unto us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith him to doe thoſe very things, which (rightly underſtood and believed) we glory in. Nevertheleſſe he recollects himſelfe, and returnes to his daemonicall frauds of calumny and blaſphemy. For albeit he ſpake ſome truth, as neceſſitated, yet he ſeems to be a betrayer of himſelfe and the gods: in as much as he would have enviouſly concealed (through an inimicall and deceiving lie) that which the truth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58142:160"/>
partly wrung from him. And therefore he ſaith him to have done wonderfull workes; but he meant it ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not by a divine, but by a magicall or divining power. But whereas he ſaith further, that he was apprehended under <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Judges, &amp;c. I demand hereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether they were <hi>Chaldeans</hi> by nature, or by profeſſion? The firſt is not to be conceded as concerning <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat;</hi> nor yet properly as touching <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> and therefore (ſince he will needs call them <hi>Chaldeans)</hi> the latter is rather to be ſuppoſed: it is not ſtrange to be believed, that any one of them might be of the Chaldean profeſſion, or addicted to it. And why might not the Chaldaeanizing Oracle be drawn to confeſſe ſo much againſt it ſelfe? And might it not be one end of the <hi>Ecclipſe</hi> at his <hi>paſſion,</hi> to make even all the Chaldaeanizing Aſtrologers to confeſſe, with ſome of their fellows, that it was no other but the God of nature, that now ſuffered?</p>
                  <p>One asking <hi>Apollo,</hi> what God he might appeaſe, whereby to recall his wife from Chriſtianity? The Oracle gave this anſwer (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cites it from <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> a great enemy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Chriſtians) Sooner mayſt thou write in water, or fly in the ayre like a bird, then remove the opinion of thy impious wife; let her goe on as ſhe will, and ſing a dead God in vaine fallacies, and falſe lamentations: whom (the Judge rightly determining) an ill death hath ended. This <hi>Porphyrius</hi> cites, and expounds blaſphemouſly; as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> died deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the juſt ſentence of his Judges. But St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conceives <hi>Apollo</hi> ſpake not thus; but his vaticinating Diviner: and yet not he, but this magicall calumniator; that durſt blaſpheme above the devill himſelfe. For <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe durſt not but ſpeak well of him, ſaying, he was ſuch a God, and King, as made the heavens, the earth, and Sea, and the deep things of Hell to tremble; of whom both he, and his fellow Daemons were afraid. Such alſo was the anſwer of <hi>Hecate</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſo were all the reſt of them.

This man, of race a Chriſtian, then relapſed, is now returned a penitent: and being terrified with the power of the Lord, he is now againe received to the mercy of the Lord. Seduced he was by the enemy, and long continued a Mathematician; not onely ſeduced, but ſeducing; as wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving as deceived. Many lies hath he ſpoken againſt God (who gave unto him a power to doe good, not to doe evill) ſaying, It is not a mans will, that makes him commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but <hi>

How many Chriſtians hath he gulled of their money? How many have bought lying predictions of him at a deare rate? But now (as we believe of him) he abhors this lying trade. For having enticed others, he now perceives himſelf to be the moſt enſnared by the devil. And now penitent before God and men, he is become a true convert. For we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves, it onely proceeds from the awfull feare of his heart. Did we not rejoyce at that <hi>Mathematicians</hi> converſion, who converted from a pagan; although he ſeemed to doe it for ſome promotion in the Church? But this penitent ſeeks for mercy onely; and therefore is the rather to be commended both to your eyes and hearts. Receive him, and love him, leſt <hi>Satan</hi> again may tempt him. Let your teſtimony and approbation confirm his converſion. He was loſt, but now is found. Long did he knock at the doores of the Church, ere he was ſuffered to enter: but he is now brought in, and hath brought with him his bookes to be burnt (by which himſelfe might have burned unquenchably) that they caſt into the fire, himſelfe might enter into that everlaſting refreſhing. We ſuffered him the longer to ſupplicate for the remedy from the ſchoole of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe the art wherein he hath been exerciſed, is to be ſuſpected, not onely of falſity in it ſelfe, but of fallacy in good. And therefore we delayed him, that he might not delude and tempt us. But now we have admitted him, that he might not be tempted again, and deluded himſelfe. Pray ye therefore to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for him; for the prayer of his Church is available againſt all impoſtures and impieties.</p>

                  <head>20. Of the abſurd and ridiculous reaſons, which have been rendred by Mag-aſtro-mancers, both for the rules of their art, and their practice upon thoſe rules, and the events upon thoſe practices; yea, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of thoſe events.</head>
                  <p>THey of <hi>Lebedia</hi> ſacrificing before the Oracle of <hi>Iupiter Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonius,</hi> the cocks hapned to crow apace all the while; This, ſaid the Soothſaying Sacrificuliſts, preſaged victory to the <hi>Baeotians,</hi> over the <hi>Thebanes.</hi> And they gave this reaſon for their divination: becauſe that bird is ſilent, being vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; but crowes alwaies when he is conquerour.</p>
                  <p>A certain <hi>Courſer,</hi> intending to try his ſpeed at the <hi>Olympick</hi> games, dreamt the night before, that he was carried thither in a Chariot: and conſulting a <hi>Conjecturer</hi> upon it, Thou ſhalt winne (ſaid he) I warrant thee; for a Chariot ſignifies ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>Another of them dreamt, that he was turned into an Eagle. Thou ſhalt get the maſtery (quoth the interpreter) becauſe this Foule flies the ſwifteſt of all other. Another of them dreaming the like dream, ah (quoth the diviner) it is to be feared thou wilt come laſt, becauſe this bird purſuing her prey, follows in the taile of the other.</p>
                  <p>A certain Matron (longing to be pregnant) dreamt her belly was ſealed up: this preſages barrenneſſe, ſaid one divining expounder, becauſe nothing can come forth of that which is ſealed up. Nay, ſaid another, this imports fruitfulneſſe, becauſe no body uſes to ſeale up that veſſell, or bagge which is empty, and hath nothing in it.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thus derides their reaſons: Can any thing be more ridiculous then to ſay (as the prognoſticating Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers uſed) that if a man be born under the Signe of <hi>Aries,</hi> he ſhall be wiſe in counſell. And why? becauſe the Ram is eminent in leading the flock. <hi>Item,</hi> he ſhall be rich. And why? becauſe the Ram hath every yeer a rich fleece growing on his back.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58142:176"/>
If he be born under the ſigne <hi>Taurus,</hi> he ſhall be ſtrong, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, potent in ſervice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why? becauſe the <hi>Bull</hi> or the <hi>Oxe</hi> ſubmits his neck to the yoke. He that is born under <hi>Leo, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, Piſces;</hi> ſhall be fierce, malicious, ſilent: And why? becauſe <hi>Lyons</hi> are fierce, <hi>Scorpions</hi> are poyſonous, and <hi>Fiſhes</hi> are mute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the Statue of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> there was inſcribed <hi>Caeſar?:</hi> now it being thunder-ſtriken, it happened that the letter C was thereby blotted out: upon which it was anſwered by the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Oraculiſts, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had onely a hundred dayes to live; becauſe the letter C notes that number: and after that ſhould be tranſlated among the Gods; becauſe <hi>Aeſar</hi> in the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> language ſignifies a God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Livia</hi> being great with childe, and willing to take the Omen, whether ſhe ſhould bring forth a ſon, or a daughter; an egge was taken from under a ſitting hen, and (according to the preſcripts of divining omination) was kept warm in her hands, or in the hands of her maids, hatching it by turns; till at laſt comes out a Cock gallantly creſted or Combed, whereupon <hi>Scribonius</hi> a Mathematician promiſed famous things of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; and that he ſhould raign, but without any kingly enſign. That it ſhould be a male childe, he gathered from the Cock chicken; but (by the ſame reaſon) why ſhould he be without any kingly enſigne, ſeeing the Cock was ſo bravely creſted, or combed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proclus</hi> gives an example in a ſpirit, which was wont to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the form of a Lyon; but by the ſetting of a Cock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, vaniſhed away: becauſe there is a contrariety betwixt a Cock and a Lyon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> ſaith in his hieroglyphicks, Dawes, that are twins ſignifie marriage: becauſe this animal brings forth two eggs, out of which male and female muſt be brought forth. But if (which ſeldom happeneth) two males be generated, the males wil not couple with any other females, nor females with any other males, but will alwayes live without a mate, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary. Therefore, they that meet a ſingle Daw, divine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that they ſhall live a ſingle life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eagle</hi> portends victory, but by blood, becauſe ſhe drinks no water, but blood. An <hi>Owle</hi> becauſe ſhe goes to her young
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58142:176"/>
by night unawares, as death comes unawares, is therefore ſaid to foretel death. Yet ſometimes, becauſe ſhe is not blinde, in the dark of the night, doth betoken diligence and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which ſhe made good, when ſhe ſate upon the ſpear of <hi>Hiero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fauſtina</hi> the wife of <hi>Antonius,</hi> fell in love with a ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player, and fell ſick for him: her husband how this might be remedyed, made his conſult with the ſoothſayers: whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was to kill the Fencer, and let his wife bathe her in his blood, and preſently accompany with her himſelf; and ſo the paſſion would be allayed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melampus</hi> the <hi>Augur</hi> conjectured at the ſlaughter of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by the flight of little birds; when he ſaith, thou ſeeſt that no bird taketh his flight in fair weather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Swallowes,</hi> becauſe when they are dying, they provide a place of ſafety for their young; do portend a great patrimony, or legacy after the death of friends. A <hi>Bat</hi> meeting any one that is running away, ſignifies an evaſion: for although ſhe have no wings, yet ſhe flies. A <hi>Sparrow</hi> is a bad omen to one that runs away: for ſhe flies from the Hawk, and makes haſte to the Owle, where ſhe is in great danger. To meet a Lyon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe is amongſt animals the ſtrongeſt, is good: but for a woman to meet a Lyoneſſe, is bad; becauſe ſhe hinders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; for a Lyoneſſe brings forth but once. A <hi>Dog</hi> in a journey is fortunate; becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> being caſt into the Woods was nouriſhed by a Dog, till he came to the Kingdom. <hi>Mice</hi> ſignifie danger; for the ſame day that they did gnaw gold in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> both the <hi>Conſuls</hi> were intercepted by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by way of ambuſh neer <hi>Tarentum.</hi> The <hi>Piſmires,</hi> becauſe they know how to provide for themſelves, and to prepare ſafe neſts for themſelves, portend ſecurity, riches, and a great Army. Hence, when the Piſmires had devoured a tame Dragon of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Caeſar,</hi> it was adviſed that he ſhould take heed of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of a multitude.</p>
                  <p>If a Snake meet thee, take heed of an ill-tongued enemy: for this animal hath no power, but in his mouth. A Snake creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Tiberius</hi> his palace, portended his fall. Two Snakes were found in the bed of <hi>Sempronius Gracchus;</hi> wherefore a ſoothſayer told him, if he would let the male go, or the female
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58142:177"/>
eſcape he, or his wife ſhould ſhortly dye: he preferring the life of his wife, killed the male, and let the female eſcape, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes he dyed. But <hi>Tully</hi> tels the ſtory otherwiſe, and reaſons better upon it. I marvel (ſaith he) if the emiſſion of the female Snake ſhould bring death to <hi>Tiberius Graccbus;</hi> &amp; the emiſſion of the male Snake were deadly to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> why he did diſmiſſe either of them. For the ſoothſayers anſwered nothing of any future accident, if neither were diſmiſt. And that <hi>Graccbus</hi> his death followed, the cauſe (I believe) was ſome diſeaſe, and not the Serpents diſmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Meeting of <hi>Monks</hi> is commonly accounted as an ill omen, and ſo much the rather if it be early in the morning: becauſe theſe kind of men live for the moſt part by the ſuddain death of men; as Vultures do by ſlauhgters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and his companions (according to his advice) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>phantaſm</hi> of an <hi>Hagge</hi> to vaniſh away by reviling it: for he knew that was the beſt remedy againſt ſuch invaſions. For ſo fearful is this kind of ſpirits, that they once moved, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and are compelled by feigned terror, and falſe and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble threats. So the Hagge of <hi>Menippus Lyeius,</hi> who was the cauſe of the Peſtilence, being ſtoned by his command, and the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ceaſed. And was not that, becauſe they are afraid of impoſſible beatings, as well as impoſſible threatnings?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>CAlchas,</hi> and <hi>Mopſus,</hi> two great Augurs, or Aſtrological di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners, meeting together at an Oracle of <hi>Apollo Clarius</hi> fell to conteſt about their skill in the conjecturing art.

Which <hi>Mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> gueſt at, and miſt not a hair: but <hi>Calchas,</hi> becauſe he could not do ſomuch; pining with grief, or envy, took pet and dyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the chief Aſtrologer of his time, affirmed, that the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58142:177"/>
                     <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are not to be credited in their natalitial prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or predictions. <hi>Panaetius</hi> a Stoical Philoſopher, and yet rejected the predictions of the Aſtrologers. <hi>Anchialus,</hi> and <hi>Caſſander,</hi> excelling in all parts of Aſtrology; yet uſed it not, or rather abuſed it not to predictions. <hi>Scylax Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> although eminent in Aſtrology, nevertheleſſe abandoned the whole <hi>Chaldaical</hi> way of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> ſleeping, his head ſeemed to ſhine, or burn: ſome of the Diviners ſaid, that ſignifyed, he ſhould periſh by lightning; others, that it was a token he ſhould obtain Regal dignity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius</hi> dreamed that the Camp of the <hi>Macedons</hi> was on fire, and that he ſaw <hi>Alexander</hi> coming to him, in clothes of the ſame faſhion, as his own were, and that he was carryed on horſeback through <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo vaniſht out of ſight. At this, the dream-ſpellers were divided in their divinations; ſome interpreting it a fortune, ſome an infortune; ſome to the one ſide, ſome to the other.</p>
                  <p>Betwixt the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> was a ſemblable prodigie (blood on the one part ſeen in iron; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part in bread.) They of either party interpret it as a token of good ſucceſſe to themſelves. But <hi>Ariſtander</hi> (the moſt skilful of the Diviners) expounded it thus on the <hi>Macedonian</hi> behalf; if the blood had appeared outwardly, it had ſignifyed ill fortune to the <hi>Macedons,</hi> that were without: but for as much as it was within, it portended the like to them that were within the City, which they now beſieged. Again, a huge ſea-monſter appeared in the ſight of both parties; and they both made themſelves merry, in prognoſticating (according to their Magaſtromantick teachers) good luck to themſelves; but were both of them deceived in the truth, if not both in the event.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> having left off to conſult with his diviners; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found them ſo various and uncertain) had yet again an itch to the ſuperſtition; and called his Aruſpicks, to inſpect the entrayls; commanding that the ſignification ſhould be be ſhewed to none but himſelf. <hi>Ariſtander</hi> is the man of art, and credit; but he notwithſtanding communicates the matter unto <hi>Erigius;</hi> who takes advantage thereby to diſſwade <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:58142:178"/>
reſolution. Upon which he calls for the artiſt, rebukes the betraying of his privy counſels and commands. The skilful man is now more amazed then at a prodigie: yet gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wits together to make ſome Apology for himſelf, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſome difficulty and danger from the inſpected entrails; but deeply profeſſed his love to, and care of his King notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The King perceiving the flexibleneſſe both of the mans nature, and of his art; wiſhes him to have a confidence of fortunate ſucceſſe, as well in this, as in former things. Whereupon the Aruſpick pores again, and comes in with his ſecond prognoſticks; and profeſſes to have found ſigns quite contrary to the firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> dreamed that he did ſeale up his wives bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that the ſeal left behinde the print of a Lion upon it; Certain wiſe men, or wizzards told him, that this gave him warning to look ſtraightly to his wife, and keep her cloſe. At<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the King was troubled; but <hi>Ariſtander</hi> (to make all good) told him his wife was with child, and had in her belly a treaſure worth the ſealing up.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day that <hi>Alexander</hi> was born, the Temple of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was burnt. This made the diſtracted Prieſts and vaticinators prognoſticate, that ſome great misfortune was that day born to all <hi>Aſia.</hi> But ſoon after news was brought to <hi>Philip</hi> of three great victories, which made him rejoyce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; now theſe predictors (to make up the triumph) praeſaged that his ſon, which was born with three great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhould be an invincible Emperour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dion</hi> being about to free his Country from the tyranny of <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> there happened an eclipſe of the Moon, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the ſouldiers not a little. Thereupon ſtood up one <hi>Miltas</hi> a ſoothſayer, and bad his fellow ſouldiers be of good chear; for the ſigne imported the impairing of dignity, meaning the tyranny of <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> But as touching the ſwarm of Bees, that lighted on the Poop of <hi>Dions</hi> ſhip; he told him, and his friends ſecretly, that he was afraid his acts would flouriſh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a while, and ſoon fade away. Again, <hi>Dion</hi> getting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his Clock, or Diall; and thence making an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> to promote their own liberty; the ſoothſaying prognoſticators liked it wel, and ſaid it was a good
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58142:178"/>
ſigne; for that he did now tread the ſumptuous edifice and artifice (and yet an Aſtrological artifice) of the Tyrant under feet. But becauſe the hand of the Dyal ſheweth the courſe of the Sun, which never leaveth moving, they were afraid that <hi>Dions</hi> affairs ſhould have a ſuddain change of fortune.</p>
                  <p>A certain Noble man of <hi>Sileſia</hi> was very inquiſitive with three ſeveral Aſtrologers, to know the manner of his own death. The firſt anſwered, he ſhould die of a feaver, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſaid, of a fall; the third anſwered, in the waters. And to make all good, thus (they ſay) it fell out. Firſt the Feaver (forſooth) ſeized on him: then the frenzy thereof made him caſt himſelf out of a window, and that window was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Moate; and ſo he fell into the water, and there periſhed. The like tale do the Country people tell of our <hi>Merlin;</hi> the the King talking with <hi>Merlin</hi> about mens fates, cauſed a Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner of his to paſſe by diſguiſed, and demanded, what kind of death ſhould that man dye? <hi>Merlin</hi> anſwered, he ſhould be hanged. The ſame man comming by the ſecond time, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſguiſe, and the like demand made, he anſwered, he ſhould be ſtabd; and the third time it was reſolved he ſhould be drowned. And thus (they ſay) it happened: The King being on hawking, the Hawke took pearch on a tree hard by a River ſide: the Faulconer climing up to fetch down his Hawke, a grayne of a branch got hold of his neck, and there he hung; that breaking he fell upon a ſplinter, and it ſtabd him; that not holding, he fell into the River, and ſo was drowned. That the Magaſtromancers may thus contradict themſelves, and one another, is eaſily to be believed: but that their various prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were thus compleated, let the faith thereof be with the Authors.</p>

throughly conſidered the adventures, acts, and geſts of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> how long he lived, and how he died: all theſe being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, he did boldly judge, that <hi>Romulus</hi> was conceived in his mothers womb, in the firſt yeere of the ſecond <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 23 day of the moneth, which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> call <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now is not this old way of calculating a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, quite contrary to the new? But of the twaine, which is the moſt certain? that a <hi>priori,</hi> or <hi>a poſteriori?</hi> ſc. from the acts and accidents of life, to the birth: or from the birth to the acts and accidents of life? The Hiſtorian notes the one for falſe and vaine; what then is to be thought of the other?</p>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>Kenneth</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> appeared two dreadfull <hi>Comets;</hi> one before the Sun-riſing, the other after the ſetting; alſo armies were ſeen in the ayre, and noyſes of armes, and horſes heard. Alſo a Biſhops Croſier ſtaffe was burned, as he held it in his hand, in time of ſervice, and could not be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. But the prodigies were not ſo various, as were the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticators interpretations; whereof ſome were delivered for good, ſome for bad, but none for true.</p>
                  <p>When the Image of <hi>Apollo Cumanus</hi> wept, ſome of the Aruſpects were for the caſting of it into the ſea, becauſe of the terrible portent: but other more skilful heruſpicks, were for the interceſſion, becauſe the Images weeping portended proſperous things.</p>

                  <p>After that the Serpents had thrice eaten up the liver of the ſacrifices, and the inſpecting Augurs had conſtantly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it for the good of <hi>T. Gracchus:</hi> yet his unfortunate end followed upon it for all that.</p>

If any forbid, there's no more conſulting for that day: if it be permitted, then to anſwer the faith of the auſpicies, they goe on to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate the voyces and flights of birds.

To this purpoſe they carry their Idol <hi>Fire</hi> in a Cenſer up and down with them, and commit it to conflict with the other Idols of Gold, Silver, Wood, Stone, &amp;c. and it conſumes them all. The fame of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Fire devouring all where it came, coming to the eares of the Prieſt of <hi>Canopus</hi> (an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> god, in whoſe Temple was taught Magick by <hi>Aegyptian</hi> letters; and not unlike Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie too, or divining by the Stars, ſince they have a Star alſo of that name) this put him upon a crafty device to ſave the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his god. He took a great earthen water pot full of holes, and ſtopped them with Wax, and filled it with water, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it over, and ſet it up inſtead of his God (or rather this water pot was the belly of <hi>Canopus</hi> himſelfe ſo faſhioned.) In come the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and as the two gods are put to the bickering, the Wax melts, and the water runs out, and ſo the Fire is quenched: and now is <hi>Canopus</hi> accounted for the victor. After this comes <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Chriſtian Prieſt to conteſt with him; and he (by the power and providence of God) makes the very creature Fire to conſume all, in deſpight of all magicall force or fraud: and ſo works the reformation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Alexandrians</hi> not well knowing how to prohibit the Aſtrologers directly, did it ſubtilly. They exacted a yeerly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not onely of the Aſtrologers, but of all thoſe that conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58142:207"/>
them. And this exaction they called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the fooles tribute; thinking that either the charge or the ſhame of it would thus reſtrain, if not reform it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gathered up here and there all the fatidicall books he could; and thoſe that were ſpread abroad under none, or no apt authors, he cauſed them to be all burnt, to the number of two thouſand: and onely retained the <hi>Sibylline</hi> books, and them too with choice, commanding that even they ſhould not be lookt into by any others but the <hi>Quindecemvirs</hi> onely.</p>
                  <p>In the too long protraction of the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> warre, their religion became ſo diſtracted by the turbulencies of the times, that all ſexes, ages, and degrees of people turned ſacrificers and vaticinators. Complaint hereof was brought to the Senate; and they laid the blame on the inferior Magiſtrates for not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting them. At length the buſineſſe was committed by the <hi>Senate</hi> to M. <hi>Aemilius,</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbane Praetor,</hi> who made proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whoſoever had any books of vaticination or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Oriſons or arts of ſacrificing, letters, &amp;c. that they ſhould bring them all to him within ſuch a day. And thus he freed them from ſuch confuſions as were crept into their religion.</p>
                  <p>As they were plowing in the field of L. <hi>Petilius</hi> the Scribe, certain books of <hi>Numa</hi> were there found in a cheſt of ſtone. Which Q. <hi>Petilius</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbane Praetor</hi> hearing of, ſent for them; and reading onely the ſumme or contents of them, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they tended to the utter diſſolving of religion, told L. <hi>Petilius,</hi> that he intended to burn them. The Scribe appealed to the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the people; they referred it to the <hi>Senate:</hi> where it was decreed, that the Pretor ſhould keep his vow or reſolution; and ſo they were burned by the <hi>victimaries,</hi> or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers themſelves, in the ſight of all the people.</p>
                  <p>It being related to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> by <hi>Quintilian</hi> a Tribune of the people, concerning a book of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> which <hi>Caninius Gallus</hi> a <hi>Quindecemvir</hi> would have received among the reſt of the prophecies; <hi>Tiberius</hi> hereupon ſent letters to the <hi>Senate,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely checking at <hi>Caninius,</hi> who being verſed in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, would admit of an ode or a charm, whoſe authour was uncertain; which the maſters had not read, nor the Colledge approved: putting the <hi>Fathers</hi> in mind of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his edict, to carry all ſuch to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbane Praetor:</hi> and that the <hi>Sibylline</hi> verſes, belonged to the care of the Prieſts, to diſcern which were true,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:58142:208"/>
and which falſe. And that they ſhould eſpecially acquaint the <hi>Quindecemvirs</hi> therewith, and not tranſact any thing raſhly in a cauſe of religion.</p>
                  <p>Under <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentinian,</hi> one <hi>Hilarius</hi> a Car-man was brought before <hi>Apronius</hi> the praefect of the City; becauſe he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his ſonne to a venefick, necromancer, or ſorcerer, to be brought up or traded in ſuch arts as were interdicted by the laws; and was therefore condemned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amantius</hi> an aruſpick was ſolicited by <hi>Hymetius</hi> to ſacrifice for depraved and maleficall intents: which being proved by papers found in his houſe, the conſulter was baniſhed, and the practitioner condemned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lollianus</hi> a very young magician, being accuſed, that he had written a book of pernicious arts: for feare that <hi>Maximinus</hi> would baniſh him, appealed to <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly puniſhed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Palladius</hi> a veneficke, and <hi>Heliodorus</hi> a genethliacke, or one that interpreted fate by genitures, were therefore accuſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Modeſtus</hi> the <hi>praetorian</hi> praefect. <hi>Palladius</hi> impeached <hi>Fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius, Praeſidatis, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Pergamius</hi> for their abhominable charms. <hi>Fiduſtius</hi> confeſſes his vaticinating malefice, and joyns with him <hi>Hilarius</hi> and <hi>Patricius. Pergamius</hi> accuſes many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands as conſcious of the ſame arts. <hi>Hilarius</hi> and <hi>Patricius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſortilegious fact, with all the circumſtances. Wherefore all theſe, and many other Philoſophers are puniſhed with fire and ſword; as <hi>Paſiphilus, Diogenes, Alypius, Simonides,</hi> and others. And laſt of all, that no mention might be found of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull arts, innumerable books and volumes are all heaped together, and burnt in the Judges ſight.</p>
                  <p>Under <hi>Manuel Commenus,</hi> one <hi>Araon</hi> was accuſed, in that there was found in his houſe the image of a Tortoiſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it the picture of a man chained, and pierced through the breaſt: and that he carried about him the old conjuring book that was called <hi>Solomons;</hi> which while he read it, legions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels would appeare, and ask him wherefore he called them, and would quickly execute his commands. Of which being convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had his eyes put out, the uſual puniſhment of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sicidites</hi> about the ſame time was impeached, for caſting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigious miſts before mens eyes; and for ſending out his devils to terrifie and torment men. The ſame man ſitting by the water

ſide with ſome of his companions askt them what they would give him, and he would make the Boatman (that then paſſed by with a load of earthen veſſels) to break all his own wares, with his own Oare? Something they promiſed him, and he muttered a few words, and it came to paſſe accordingly. The man being askt after that, why he was ſo mad as to break his wares? anſwered, he thought he ſaw before him an ugly great Serpent ready to devour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> him, which ſtill crept neerer to him the more he ſtruck at it, and when all his pots were broken in pieces then it vaniſhed. For this and other ridiculous pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tricks, he was ſerved as <hi>Araon</hi> was, <hi>ſc.</hi> had his eyes put out; an apt puniſhment for all peepers, and Star-gazers.</p>
                  <p>In vain was all the Pagan reformation of Magick and Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. For they put the Artiſts or practitioner away with one hand, and pull'd them to them with another: witneſſe the edicts of <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberius, Nero, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itellius, Domitian,</hi> &amp;c. and their own repealing acts, and eſpecially the <hi>Senate</hi> that baniſhed <hi>Martha</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> propheteſſe: and yet a little after retained and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <hi>Batabacus</hi> a predicting diviner. The <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> therefore ſaid wel and truly on both parts. This kind of men, treacherous to Potentates, and deluſive to all conſulters and confiders, are alwaies inhibited our City, and yet alwaies retained in it.</p>
                  <p>I ſay no more of Imperiall edicts: nor of thoſe after the Emperours became Chriſtian; nor of provinciall Lawes, nor of municipall Statutes; nor of generall Councels, nor of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Canons; nor of Fathers ſentences, &amp;c. All theſe are ſufficiently collected againſt them. I onely conclude with an animadverſion to our own Countreymen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PLiny</hi> (writing of Magick) ſaith, that in his daies the Art thereof was highly honoured by the <hi>Britaines,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Nation ſo deeply devoted thereunto, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it performed with ſuch complements of all ceremonies, that a man would think, the <hi>Perſians</hi> had learned all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick skill from them. And in truth our own hiſtories report, that the firſt Rulers of this Land, were Magicians, Aſtrologers. Diviners, (ſuch as were <hi>Samothes, Magus, Sarron, Druis, Bardus)</hi> and that under a colour to teach men the knowledge of the Stars: they brought men to the worſhip of the Stars. Yea, &amp; that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58142:209"/>
they thus begat here their ſects of <hi>Samotheans Magicians,</hi> (In ſo much as the <hi>Perſians</hi> have been thought to have borrowed their word <hi>magi</hi> from hence.) <hi>Sarronides, Druides, Barditaes</hi> or <hi>Bardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> and theſe kinds of ſects were propagated amongſt us, till the preaching of <hi>Fugatius,</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Lucius:</hi> and then they began thus to be aboliſhed, and put to flight. What? two Preachers put down ſo many ſects of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians? What a ſhame and miſery were it now, if one Society of Artiſts ſhould ſet up themſelves to pull down ſo many prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel? <hi>Philip de Cominees,</hi> ſpeaking of fooliſh fantaſticall prophecies, ſaith, The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> are never unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht of ſuch, from the cabaliſticall diſpoſing, and expounding of certain letters. What would he have ſaid, if he had ſeen his own <hi>Frenchman</hi> tranſlated amongſt us? Again, he ſaith, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> attribute much to prophecies and vaticinations: and alwaies are weak, when they treat of hard matters, to produce ſome ſuch kind of thing. Which, for all his reputed ſobriety, we cannot but take for a calumny. Who doe unanimouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (againſt all <hi>Merlinicall</hi> arrogators, prorogators, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) that we are of the mind of <hi>William of Newborough;</hi> that ſharply inveighed againſt <hi>Geffray ap Arthur,</hi> for advent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And doe herein approve of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> for inhibiting the publication of <hi>Merlines</hi> books. Although we take them to be (as ſome of their own ſaid of them) like the Aſtrologers, who to ſave their <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> fram'd to their conceit, <hi>Eccentretes,</hi> and <hi>Epicydes,</hi> and a wonderfull engine of orbs, though no ſuch things were, &amp;c. We alſo doe commend the many wholſome Laws, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and municipall, among Chriſtians and Heathens, that have been juſtly enacted againſt them. And doe adviſe them not to make ſlight of the Eccleſiaſticall penances; however not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect true repentance. Otherwiſe we could wiſh that our owne Statute-laws were but duly executed upon the ſeverall kinds of them.
