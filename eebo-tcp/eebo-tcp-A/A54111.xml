            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT hath of long time reſted with ſome preſſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Spirit, for <hi>Zion's</hi> ſake, and the Peace of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to write ſomething of the <hi>Nature of True
Spiritual Liberty;</hi> Liberty, one of the moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Words and Things in the World, but little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and frequently abuſed by many. I beſeech
Almighty God to preſerve you, his People, in the right
Knowledge &amp; Uſe of that <hi>Liberty,</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
the <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi> hath purchaſed for us, and
is redeeming us into, who hath <hi>led Captivity captive,</hi>
and is <hi>giving Gifts to them that truly believe in his Name.</hi>
Chriſt's <hi>Liberty</hi> is obtain'd through Chriſt's <hi>Croſs;</hi>
they that would be his <hi>Free-men,</hi> muſt be his <hi>Bonds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and wear his bleſſed <hi>Yoke.</hi> His <hi>Liberty</hi> is <hi>from Sin,
not to Sin;</hi> to do his Will, and not our own; no, not
to ſpeak an Idle Word. 'Tis <hi>not I that live</hi> (ſaith the
Apoſtle) <hi>but Chriſt that liveth in me,</hi> who had <hi>ſet him
Free from the Power of Sin, and brought Immortality to
Light</hi> in him; whence he learned thus to triumph,
<hi>O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy
Victory!</hi> This is the Perſonal <hi>Freedom</hi> that comes by
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to as many as receive him in the Way,
and for the End for which God hath given him, to wit,
<pb facs="tcp:60045:3"/>
               <hi>to be a Saviour and a Leader, to ſave us from our Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and guide us in the Narrow Way of his holy Croſs,
and through the ſtrait Gate of Self-denyal,</hi> which lead
to <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> And as many as have entered at this
Door, are come to have <hi>Vnity with God, and one with
another; To love him above all, and their Neighbours as
themſelves;</hi> yea, to prefer each other before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Such will not violate the great Law of their
Lord and Maſter; <hi>Love one another,</hi> the <hi>New;</hi> and yet
the <hi>Old Commandment:</hi> Theſe dwell in <hi>Love,</hi> and ſo
they dwell in <hi>God; for God is Love.</hi> 'Twas the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Diſciples Teſtimony, and it comes up to what
another man of God hath ſaid, namely, <hi>The Church
that dwells in God, if ſhe dwells in God, then in Love;
conſequently her Members are in Vnion, of one Mind in
Church Matters, ſince ſhe has but one Head to Rule her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Peruſe this brief Diſcourſe in this <hi>Love,</hi> and it may
be to Edification. My aim is to aſſert the Truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
Error, and point in true Brotherly Kindneſs at
thoſe Shoals and Sands ſome by Miſtake, or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldneſs,
have and may run upon. O <hi>Friends!</hi> I
greatly deſire, that the Spirit of <hi>Love, Wiſdom, and a
ſound Vnderſtanding, of Meekneſs, Judgment and Mercy</hi>
may ever reſt upon you, that blameleſly you may be
kept, an holy Family, at Unity with it ſelf, to the Lord
God your Redeemer, that he over all may in you,
through you, and by you be Exalted, Honoured and
Praiſed, who is worthy and bleſſed forever.</p>

            <head>A Brief
Examination and State
OF
Liberty Spiritual, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> VVHat is Spiritual Liberty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is twofold; there is a true
and a falſe Liberty, as a true and falſe
Spirit, the right diſcerning of which concerns every ones
Eternal Well-beeing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What is true Spiritual Liberty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Deliverance from Sin by the Perfect Law in the Heart,
<hi>The Perfect Law of Liberty,</hi> James 2. otherwiſe called, <hi>The Law
of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, that makes Free from the Law
of Sin and Death;</hi> elſe-where ſtiled, <hi>The Law of Truth writ in the
Heart,</hi> which makes Free indeed, as ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If the Truth
make you Free, then are you Free indeed.</hi> So that the Liberty of
Gods People ſtands <hi>in the Truth, and their Communion in it,</hi> and
in the Perfect Spiritual Law of Chriſt Jeſus, which delivers and
preſerves them from every Evil Thing that doth or would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondage.
In this bleſſed Liberty, it is not the Will nor Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of man, neither the vain Affections and Luſts that rule, or
give Law to the Soul; for the Minds of all ſuch as are made Free
by the Truth, are by the Truth conducted in doing and ſuffering
through their Earthly Pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What is Falſe Liberty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. A Departing from this bleſſed Spirit of Truth,</hi> and <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
againſt this Perfect Law of Liberty in the Heart,</hi> and being at
Liberty to do our own Wills; upon which cometh Reproof and
Judgment.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60045:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But are there not ſome things wherein we ought to be left to
our own freedom?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. We are not our own, for we are bought with a Price;</hi> and
in all things ought we to glorifie God with our Bodies, Souls and
Spirits, which are the Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But muſt we have a Motion or Command from the Spirit of
Truth for all things that we do?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That may be according to the Truth, which may not
be by the immediate Motion or Command of the Truth; for that
is according to the Truth, that is not againſt the Mind of the
Truth, either particularly or generally expreſt. The Truth
commands me to <hi>do all to the Praiſe and Glory of God;</hi> but not that
I ſhould wait for a Motion to do every particular thing. For
<hi>Example:</hi> The variety of Actions in Trading, Commerce and
Husbandry, the variety of Fleſh, Fiſh and Fowl for Food, with
more of the ſame Nature, in all which there is a Choice and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
but ſtill according to the Truth, and within the holy
Bounds and Limits of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Then it ſeems there are ſome things left to our Freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes; but it muſt ſtill be according to the Mind of Gods
Truth: There are things enjoyned, ſuch as relate to our Duty to
God, to our Superiours, to the Houſhold of Faith, and to all
Men and Creatures, theſe are <hi>Indiſpenſible.</hi> There are alſo
things that may be done or left undone, which may be called
<hi>Indifferent;</hi> as what ſort of Meat I will eat to day, whether I
will eat Fleſh, Fiſh or Herbs, or what Hours I will eat my Meals
at, with many ſuch outward things of Life and Converſe; yet
even in theſe caſes I ought to act according to the Truth, in the
Temperance and Wiſdom of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But doth not Freedom extend farther than this; for ſince
God hath given me a Manifeſtation of his Spirit to profit withal, and
that I have the Gift of God in my ſelf, ſhould I not be left to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as I am free and perſwaded in my own Mind, in the things that
relate to God, leſt looking upon my ſelf as obliged by what is revealed
unto another, though it be not revealed unto me, I ſhould be led out of my
own Meaſure, and act upon anothers Motion, and ſo offer a blind Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is true in a ſence, that is, if thou art ſuch an one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60045:4"/>
that canſt do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth, then
mayſt thou ſafely be left to thy freedom in the things of God,
and the Reaſon is plain; Becauſe thy Freedom ſtands in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Law of Liberty, in the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt
Jeſus, and in the Truth, which is Chriſt Jeſus, which makes
thee Free indeed, that is, Perfectly Free from all that is Bad,
and perfectly Free to all that is <hi>Holy, Just, Lovely, Honest,
Comely, and of good Report;</hi> but if thou pleadeſt thy Freedom
againſt ſuch things, yea, obſtructeſt and ſlighteſt ſuch <hi>Good,
Wholeſome</hi> and <hi>Requiſit</hi> Things, thy Freedom is Naught, Dark,
Perverſe, out of the Truth, and againſt the perfect Law of Love
and Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But muſt I conform to things whether I can receive them or
no? Ought I not to be left to the Grace and Spirit of God in my own
Heart?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt part of the Queſtion, Nay; to the laſt, Yea.
But now let us conſider what is the Reaſon thou canſt not receive
them: Is the fault in the things themſelves? Are they inconſiſtent
with Truth, or will not the Truth own or aſſent unto them, or is
the fault in thee? that is to ſay, Is it thy Weakneſs, or thy Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
If thy <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> it is to be born with, and to be informed; if
thy <hi>Careleſneſs,</hi> thou oughtſt to be admoniſhed; for it is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Principle, and pernicious to true Religion, and which is
worſe, it is the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Ranteriſm</hi> to aſſert, <hi>That nothing is a Duty
incumbent upon thee, but what thou art perſwaded is thy Duty;</hi> for
the <hi>Seared</hi> Conſcience pleads his Liberty againſt all Duty, the
<hi>Dark</hi> Conſcience is here unconcerned, the <hi>Dead</hi> Conſcience is
here uncondemned, unleſs this Diſtinction be allowed of, that
there may be an Ignorance or an Inſenſibility from <hi>Inability</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity,</hi>
or a Dark <hi>Education,</hi> and an Ignorance and Inſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
from <hi>Careleſneſs, Diſobedience, Prejudice,</hi> &amp;c. So that though
thou art not to conform to a thing ignorantly, yet thou art ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to conſider, why thou art ignorant, and what the cauſe of
ſuch Ignorance may be; certainly it can't be in God, nor in his
Gift to thee; it muſt then needs be in thy ſelf, who haſt not
yet received a Senſe for or againſt the Matter, about which thou
art in doubt. To the ſecond part of the Queſtion; <hi>Ought I not
to be left to the Grace of God in my own Heart? Anſ.</hi> That is of all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60045:5"/>
things moſt deſirable, ſince they are well left that are there left;
for there is no fear of want of Unity, where all are left with the
one Spirit of Truth; they muſt be of one Mind, they can't be
otherwiſe. So that to plead this againſt Unity, is to abuſe the very
Plea, and to commit the greateſt Contradiction to that very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Scripture, viz. <hi>That all ſhould be guided by the Grace and
Spirit of God in themſelves;</hi> for the end of that Doctrine is, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
<hi>They ſhall all know me, ſaith the Lord, from the leaſt to the
greateſt. And I will give them one Heart, and one Way, that they
may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their Children after
them,</hi> Jer. 32. 39. <hi>And I will give them one Heart, and I will put
a new Spirit within you; and I will take the Stony Heart out of their
Fleſh, and will give them an Heart of Fleſh,</hi> Ezekiel 11. 19.
<hi>And the multitude of them that believed were of one Heart, and
of one Soul,</hi> Acts 4. 32. Is not this Unity too? <hi>I will reſtore
unto you a pure Language; they ſhall be of one Heart and of one
Mind, and great ſhall be their Peace.</hi> Therefore I muſt ſay to
thee, Friend, What if thou wilt not be left with the Grace and
Spirit of God in thy ſelf, nor wait for its Mind, nor be watchful
to its Revelations, nor humble and quiet till thou haſt received
ſuch neceſſary Manifeſtations, but pleadeſt againſt the Counſel
of the Spirit of the Lord in other faithful Perſons, under the
pretence of being left to his Spirit in thy ſelf; by which means
thou oppoſeſt the Spirit to the Spirit, and pleadeſt for Diſ-unity,
under the Name of <hi>Liberty;</hi> I ask thee, May not I exhort thee
to the Practice of that I am moved to preſs thee to the Practice
of? If not, thou art the Impoſer, by reſtraining me from my
<hi>Chriſtian Liberty;</hi> and not only ſo, but away goeth Preaching,
and with it the Scriptures, that are both appointed of God for
<hi>Exhortation, Reproof</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But are there not various Meaſures, diverſities of Gifts, and
ſeveral Offices in the Body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True; but therefore are not the Members of one
Mind, one Will and one Judgment in common and univerſal
Matters, eſpecially relating to the Family and Church of God?
And indeed there can't be a falſer Reaſoning than to conclude
<hi>Diſcord</hi> from <hi>Diverſity, Contrariety</hi> from <hi>Variety.</hi> Is there Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of <hi>Bloods, Lifes, Feelings, Seeings, Hearings, Taſtings,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60045:5"/>
Smellings</hi> in one and the ſame Body, at one and the ſame time?
No ſuch matter: Experience is a Demonſtration againſt all ſuch
Inſinuations. So that though it be granted, that there is Diverſity
of Gifts, yet there is no Diſagreement in Senſe; and though
Variety of Offices, yet no Contrariety in Judgment concerning
thoſe Offices. Well ſaith the holy Scriptures of Truth, <hi>there is
but One God; the Lord our God is but One Lord; there is but One
God and Father of all things (that are good;) and there is but One
Lord, One Faith and One Baptiſm;</hi> and his Light, Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is at Unity with it ſelf in all; what comes from the Light,
Life or Spirit in one, it is the ſame in Truth and Unity to the
reſt, as if it riſe in themſelves: This is ſeen in our Aſſemblies
every day, and will be throughout all Generations in the Church
of God, among thoſe that live in the lowly Truth, in which the
pure Senſe and ſound Judgment ſtands; <hi>God is not the God of
Confuſion, but Order:</hi> Every one in his Order is ſatisfied, hath
Unity and true Fellowſhip with whatever comes from the Life of
God in another; for this precious Life reacheth throughout the
Heritage of God, and is the common Life that giveth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Feeling and Senſe to the Heritage of God. Degree or
Meaſure in the ſame Life can never contradict or obſtruct that
which is from the ſame Life for the common Benefit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of God. <hi>The Lord is the Vnmeaſurable and Incomprehenſible
Glorious being of Life,</hi> yet have we Unity with him in all his
Works, who are come to his divine Meaſure of Light and Truth
in our own Hearts, and live therein; and ſhall we not have Unity
with that which proceeds from a Fellow Creature? In ſhort;
the Saints Way is in the Light, wherein there is neither Doubts
nor Diſcord; yea, they are Children of the Light, and called
<hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>The Lights of the World;</hi> and can it be ſuppoſed that
ſuch ſhould diſagree and contradict each other in their exteriour
Order and Practice in the Church before the World; Oh, the
bleſſed Seamleſs Garment of Jeſus! where that is known, theſe
things can never riſe. But yet again, <hi>The Juſt Mans Path</hi> is not
only a Light, <hi>but a ſhining Light,</hi> Brightneſs it ſelf: Certainly
there can be no ſtumbling. It is alſo ſaid, <hi>That Light is ſown for
the Righteous;</hi> then the Righteous ſhall never want Light upon
any occaſion: And ſaith that beloved Evangeliſt and Apoſtle of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60045:6"/>
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>They that walk in the Light have Fellowſhip
one with another,</hi> 1 John 1. Whence it is eaſie to conclude, they
that go out of the Fellowſhip, go out of the Light; but if they
that walk in the Light, have Fellowſhip one with another, what
ſhall we ſay of thoſe that plead being left to the Light to juſtifie
their not having Fellowſhip one with another? and which is yet
worſe, who ſuppoſe People may Conſcientiouſly and Juſtifiably
Diſſent within themſelves, and that by reaſon of the Variety of
the Degrees of the Spirit and Grace that are given of God unto
them; as if the leſſer Degree may diſſent from the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of its not being able to comprehend it. And to make this
Principle more Authentick, ſuch tell us, <hi>This is the Antient
Principle of Truth;</hi> and object, <hi>How will you elſe be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the</hi> Quakers <hi>Principles?</hi> The Fallacy of all which, lieth (as
I ſaid before) in not rightly diſtinguiſhing between Diverſity
and Diſagreement, Variety and Contrariety; for this Diverſity
hath Concord, and this Variety hath Unity: And it is a Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that hath too much of late happened to ſome, by going from
the one Life and Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, firſt to fall into
Diſagreements, and then plead for it, under the Notion of
<hi>Diverſity of Meaſures.</hi> I would ask all ſuch Perſons, who arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
to themſelves ſuch a peculiar Knowledge of the Antient
Principles of Truth, or the <hi>Quakers</hi> firſt Principles; 1ſt, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they believe there be a Chriſtian Body?</hi> 2dly, <hi>Whether this
Body hath a Head?</hi> 3dly, <hi>Whether Chriſt be not this Head?</hi> 4thly,
<hi>Whether this Head be without Eyes, Ears, Smell and Taſte, and
this Body without Sence and Feeling?</hi> If not, <hi>Whether this Head
Seeth, Heareth, Smelleth, Taſteth</hi> DIFFERINGLY <hi>and</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRARILY
<hi>to it ſelf? And whether this Body hath a Contrary Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at the ſame time about the ſame thing?</hi> And if it be true,
that the Church of Chriſt, redeemed by his moſt precious Blood
to live to him, ſee with the ſame Eye, hear with the ſame Ear,
ſpeak with the ſame Mouth, live by the ſame Breath, and are
led by the ſame Spirit, where is this <hi>Diſagreement, Contrariety</hi> or
<hi>Diſſent</hi> about the things of his <hi>Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But the Members of Chriſts Church in the Primitives had
<hi>different Apprehenſions;</hi> as the Apoſtles, and the People gathered
by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60045:6"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Pray let me know who they were, and in what Caſes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> The Perſons were <hi>PAUL</hi> and <hi>PETER,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
that differ'd about Meats; and the Scripture is plain in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Difference</hi> between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> [in the <hi>Acts</hi>]
teſtifies the Weakneſs of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the place juſtifies <hi>Paul</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
of his too great Compliance with the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſome of their
<hi>Rites;</hi> which makes againſt <hi>Liberty of various Practices</hi> in the
Church of Chriſt, and not for indulging them. That Inſtance
about the Difference of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as to <hi>Meats,</hi> &amp;c. has nothing
in it to the end for which it is alledged; for this related not to
<hi>Church-Order</hi> or <hi>Communion,</hi> but Private and <hi>Perſonal Freedoms,</hi>
what each might do with reſpect to themſelves; that is, they
might make Laws to themſelves, in things that only concern'd
private Perſons, and it centred there; Here, <hi>What I will eat,
When I will eat;</hi> things to my ſelf, and for my ſelf, as a man
having Power over my own Appetite: This <hi>Liberty</hi> in things
Private, Perſonal and Indifferent, makes nothing for <hi>Diſſenting
about Church Matters in things of Communion and Society,</hi> and that
alſo are not Indifferent, as to <hi>eat Fiſh,</hi> or <hi>eat Fleſh,</hi> or <hi>eat Herbs,</hi>
plainly is: But neceſſary; As to be careful and orderly about the
External Buſineſs of the Church: Theſe are no <hi>Jewiſh Rites,</hi> nor
<hi>Shadowy Ceremonies,</hi> no <hi>Meats</hi> nor <hi>Drinks</hi> that are Private and
Perſonal, where Weakneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is apt to miſtake (That were an
Unneceſſary and an <hi>Vnchriſtian Yoke</hi> to bear) but things comely,
orderly and of good Report, that tend to Purity, Peace and
Diligence in things acceptable to God, and requiſit among his
People in their Temporal Chriſtian Capacity. And herein the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exerciſed his Godly <hi>Authority;</hi> and we find that
not only thoſe that oppoſed themſelves to it, as thinking, <hi>he took
too much upon him, (demanding a Mark of Chriſts speaking in him</hi>)
are in Scripture branded with <hi>Contention.</hi> But the true Believers,
that had in themſelves a <hi>Mark of Chriſts ſpeaking in him,</hi> were of
<hi>One Mind, and avoided ſuch as were given to Contention;</hi> for it
was not the Cuſtom of the Churches of Chriſt. Thus were
Chriſt's People of <hi>One Heart,</hi> in things relating to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
Yet a little further; They that have the Mind of
Chriſt, are of One Mind; for Chriſt is not divided: They that
have Chriſt for their Head, have One Counſellor and Prophet,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60045:7"/>
One Seer and Biſhop, they diſagree not in their Judgments in
things relating to him, and the good of his Church; they have
one and the ſame Guide; <hi>For the one Spirit, into which they have
all drank, and by it are baptized into one Body, leads them all.</hi>
Now to every Member is <hi>a Meaſure of the ſame Spirit given to
profit with;</hi> and though every Member is not an <hi>Eye,</hi> nor an
<hi>Ear,</hi> nor a <hi>Mouth,</hi> yet every Member hath Unity with the <hi>Eye,</hi>
with the <hi>Ear,</hi> with the <hi>Mouth</hi> in their proper and reſpective
Acts, and they one with the other: The <hi>Eye</hi> ſees for the <hi>Mouth,</hi>
the <hi>Mouth</hi> ſpeaks for the <hi>Eye,</hi> and the <hi>Ear</hi> hears for <hi>both;</hi> this
Variety hath no Diſcord, but in this Diverſity of Gifts and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
each Member is ſenſible of the other, and moves and acts
by one and the ſame Life, Spirit and Guidance, which is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
proportionable to every Member in its diſtinct Office.
It muſt be granted, that there are Helps in the Church, as well
as that there is a Church at all; and the holy Ghoſt has compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thoſe Helps (as is before mentioned) to ſeveral Members
and Senſes of mans Body, as an <hi>Eye,</hi> an <hi>Hand,</hi> a <hi>Foot, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Smelling, &amp;c.</hi> All then cannot be the Eye, neither can all be
the Hand, for then they would confound their Office, and act
diſagreeably to the Ordination of the great Orderer of his
Church. And if I will not comply with him that God hath
made an <hi>Eye,</hi> becauſe I am not that Eye, or an Hand, becauſe I am
not that Member my ſelf, nor a Party to the Action, or Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that Member, I reſiſt the Lord, though under pretence of
reſiſting man for the Lords ſake. And truly, this is the Rock
that ſome of our own time, as well as Perſons of former Ages have
ſplit upon; they have not been contented with their own Station
in the Body, they have not kept to their own Gift, nor been
taken up with the Duty of their own place in the Church. If
he that is a Foot would be an Hand, and the Hand covets to be
an Eye, envying others their allotted Station, through highth of
Mind, and walking looſe from the holy Croſs, there can be no
ſuch thing as Concord and Fellowſhip in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, ſince the Spirit of the Lord is one in all, it
ought to be obeyed through another, as well as in ones ſelf;
and this I affirm to you, That the ſame lowly frame of Mind that
receives and anſwers the Mind of the Spirit of the Lord in a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60045:7"/>
mans ſelf, will receive and have Unity with the Mind of the ſame
Spirit through another, and the Reaſon is plain; Becauſe the
ſame Self-evidencing Power and Virtue that ariſeth from the
Meaſure of the Spirit of Truth in ones ſelf, and that convinceth
a man in his own Heart, doth alſo attend the Diſcovery of the
Mind of the ſame Spirit, when delivered by another; for the
words of the <hi>Second Adam, the quickning Spirit</hi> through another,
are Spirit and Life, as well as in thy own particular; this is
diſcerned by the Spiritual Man that judgeth all things, although
the Carnal Man pleadeth, <hi>Being left to his Freedom;</hi> and it may be
talks of <hi>being left to the Spirit in himſelf too,</hi> the better to eſcape
the Senſe and Judgment of the Spiritual Man. It is my earneſt
Deſire, that all that have any Knowledge of the Lord, would
have a tender care how they uſe that Plea againſt their faithful
Brethren, that God put into their Mouthes againſt the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Prieſts and Hirelings of the World, namely, <hi>I muſt mind the
Spirit of God in my ſelf;</hi> for though it be a great Truth that all are
to be thereunto left, yet it is as true, that he whoſe Soul is left
with the Spirit of Truth in himſelf, differs not from his Brethren
that are in the ſame Spirit; and as true it is, that thoſe who err
from the Spirit of Truth, may plead, <hi>being left to the Spirit
in themſelves,</hi> againſt the Motion and Command of the Spirit
through another, when it pleaſeth not his or her high Mind and
perverſe Will; for a Saying may be true or falſe, according to
the ſubject Matters it is ſpoken upon, or applyed to; We own
the Aſſertion, we deny the Application: There lies the Snare.
'Tis true, the People of God ought to be left to the Guidings
of the Spirit of God in themſelves; but for this to be ſo applied,
as to diſregard the Preachings or Writings of Chriſt's enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Servants, becauſe by them applied properly to the Preaching
or Writing of falſe Prophets and Seducers, will by no means
follow. I ſay the Doctrine is true, but not excluſively of all
external Counſel or Direction; therefore falſe in application,
where men are allowed to have had the fear of God, and
the mind of his Spirit, and are not proved to have acted in their
own Wills and Wiſdom, or without the guidance of the Spirit
of God, about the things of his Church and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60045:8"/>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But though this be true, which hath been alledged for heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Concord, yet what if I do not preſently ſee that Service in a thing,
that the reſt of my Brethren agree in; in this caſe what is my Duty and
theirs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is thy Duty to wait upon God in Silence and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
out of all fleſhly Conſultations; and as thou abideſt in
the Simplicity of the Truth, thou wilt receive an Underſtanding
with the reſt of thy Brethren about the thing doubted: And it
is their Duty, whilſt thou behaveſt thy ſelf in Meekneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
to bear with thee, and carry themſelves tenderly and
lovingly towards thee; but if on the contrary, thou diſturbeſt
their Godly Care and Practice, and groweſt Contentious, and
exalts thy Judgment againſt them, they have Power from God
to Exhort, Admoniſh and Reprove thee; and (if thou perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
therein) in his Name to refuſe any further Fellowſhip
with thee, till thou repenteſt of thy Evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But leſt I ſhould miſtake, when thou ſpeakeſt of true Liberty,
that it ſtands in being made Free by the Truth, from all Vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>doſt thou mean, That</hi> no other Perſons ought to have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Exerciſing their Diſſenting Conſciences, but that Force may
be lawful to reduce ſuch as are reputed Erroniouſly Conſcientious?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By no means: It were a great Wickedneſs againſt
God, who is Lord of the Souls and Spirits of men, and ought
to preſide in all Conſciences, who, as the Apoſtle ſaith, is the
only <hi>Potentate,</hi> and <hi>hath Immortalety.</hi> For though I give the
true Liberty of Soul and Conſcience to thoſe only that are ſet
free by the Power of Chriſt, from the Bondage of Sin and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of Death, yet do I not intend, that any Perſon or Perſons
ſhould be in the leaſt harm'd for the external Exerciſe of their
Diſſenting Conſciences in Worſhip to God, though Erronious;
for though their Conſciences be blind, yet they are not to be
forced; ſuch Compulſion giveth no ſight, neither do Corporal
Puniſhments produce Conviction: This we above all People
in our Day have withſtood, in Speaking, Writing and Suffering,
and bleſſed be God, continue ſo to do with faithlneſs. For <hi>Faith</hi>
is the Gift of God, and forced Sacrifices are not pleaſing to the
Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But according to thy Argument, it may be my Fault, that I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60045:8"/>
have not the Gift of Faith; and upon this Preſumption, it may be,
thou wilt inflict ſome Temporal Penalties upon me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſuch matter; for ſuch kind of Faults are not to be
puniſhed with Temporal or Worldly Penalties; for whether
the Errors be through Weakneſs or Willfulneſs, not relating
to Moral Practice, all External Coertion and Corporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is excluded. <hi>For the Weapons of our Warfair are not Carnal,
but Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But what then is the Extent of the Power of the Church of
Christ, in caſe of Schiſm or Hereſie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Power that Chriſt gave to his Church was this,
<hi>That Offenders, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition,</hi> (not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting)
<hi>ſhould be Rejected:</hi> Not impriſoned, Plundered, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
or put to Death; this belongs to the Whore and falſe
Prophet: Oh! all theſe things have come to paſs for want of
Humility, for want of the antient Fear, and keeping in the
quiet Habitation of the Juſt: The Truth in you all ſhall anſwer
me. And this I affirm, from the Underſtanding I have received
of God, not only that the Enemy is at work to ſcatter the Minds
of Friends, by that Looſe Plea, <hi>What-haſt thou to do with
me? leave me to my Freedom, and to the Grace of God in my ſelf,</hi>
and the like; but this Propoſition and Expreſſion, as now
underſtood and alledged, is a Deviation from, and a Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Antient Principle of Truth; for this is the plain
Conſequence of this Plea, if any one (eſpecially if they are but
lately convinced) ſhall ſay, <hi>I ſee no Evil in paying Tythes to Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Prieſts, in that they are not claimed by Divine Right, but by the
Civil Laws of the Land. I ſee no Evil in Marrying by the Prieſt,
for he is but a Witneſs.</hi> Furthermore, <hi>I ſee no Evil in declining a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Teſtimony in Suffering times, or hiding in times of Perſecution, for
I have</hi> Chriſt'<hi>s and</hi> Paul'<hi>s Examples. I ſee no Evil in Worſhipping
and Reſpecting the Perſons of Men; for whatever others do, I intend
a ſincere Notice that I take of thoſe I know, and have a good Eſteem
for.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>I ſee no Evil in keeping my Shop ſhut upon the Worlds</hi>
Holy-days <hi>and</hi> Maſs-days (as they call them) <hi>though they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lewdly and Superſtitiouſly than Religiouſly kept; for I would not
willingly give any Offence to my Neighbours.</hi> And ſince your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
is againſt Impoſition, and for leaving every one to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60045:9"/>
Meaſure of the Grace which God hath given him, not only, <hi>No
man hath Power to reprove or judge me, but I may be as good a Friend
as any of you, according to my Meaſure.</hi> And now, here is <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſet up againſt Meaſure,</hi> which is Confuſion it ſelf—<hi>Babel</hi>
indeed: This is that very Rock both Profeſſors and Prophane
would long ſince have run us upon, namely, <hi>That a way is hereby
opened to all the Worlds Libertines, to plead the Light within for their
Exceſſes;</hi> Which indeed grieves the Spirit of God, &amp; was ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judged by our Friends in the beginning, and is ſtill reproved
by them that keep their Habitation, though ſome are become as
wandering Stars through their own Pride, and the Prevalency
of the hour of Temptation that hath overtaken them; whereas
had they kept in the Channel of Love and Life, in the Orbe and
Order of the Celeſtial Power, they had ſhined as fixed Stars in
the Firmament of God forever. And from the deep Senſe that I
have of the working of the Enemy of <hi>Zions</hi> Peace, to rend and
divide the Heritage of God, who under the pretence of crying
down <hi>Man, Forms</hi> and <hi>Preſcriptions,</hi> is crying down the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Man Christ Jeſus, his bleſſed Order and Government,</hi> which he
hath brought forth by his own Revelation and Power through his
faithful Witneſſes. This I further teſtifie, <hi>First,</hi> That the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by theſe fair Pretences ſtrikes at the Godly Care and Travail
that dwells upon the Spirits of many faithful Brethren, that all
things might be preſerved Sweet, Comely, Virtuous, and of
good Report in the Church of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there never
was greater neceſſity of this Godly Care than at this day, ſince
we were a People, wherein the Croſs by too many is not ſo
cloſely kept to as in dayes paſt, and in which there is not only
a great Convincement, but a Young Generation deſcended of
Friends, who though they retain the Form their Education hath
led them into, yet many of them adorn not the Goſpel with that
ſenſible, weighty and heavenly Converſation as becomes the
Children of the Undefiled Religion, and the Seed of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Faith which works by the Love that Overcomes the World.
And the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, that hath ſent his Son
Chriſt Jeſus a Light into our Hearts and Conſciences, to whoſe
Search and Judgment all ought to (and muſt) bring their Deeds,
&amp; render up their Account, beareth holy Record, that for this end
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60045:9"/>
hath he moved upon the Spirits of his Servants, and for this good
end only have his Servants given forth, recommended, and
put in Practice thoſe things that are now in Godly Uſe among
his People, whether in this or other Nations, relating to <hi>Men</hi>
and <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> and their divers and weighty <hi>Services.</hi>
And further; in the fear of the Almighty God, I ſhall add, That
heavenly Peace and Proſperity dwell with thoſe who are found
in a holy and zealous Practice of them; wherefore I warn all,
that they take heed of a ſlight and obſtinate Mind, and that they
have a care how they give way to the Outcry of ſome, faiſly
entituled, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience againſt Impoſition,</hi> &amp;c. for the
end thereof is to lead back again, and give eaſe to the Carnal
Mind, which, at laſt, will bring Death again upon the Soul to
God, and the living Society of his Children. And indeed, it is
a great ſhame that any who have ever known the Truth of God
in the inward Parts, and the ſweet Society of Brethren, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thoſe who were early in the Work of this bleſſed Day and
heavenly Diſpenſation, ſhould ſo far depart from the Fear and
Awe of the Lord, as to uſe ſuch Unſavoury, as well as Untrue
Expreſſions; this is very far from that Meek Spirit of Jeſus, and
the firſt Love, which they pretend to have ſo ſingularly kept
in, which beareth all things, ſuffereth all things, and endureth
all things, and teacheth to keep the Word of Patience in the
Hour of Tribulation; Nay, but this is judging of Spiritual
things with a Carnal and Prejudiced Mind, ſtumbling at the
Matter, for the ſake of the Perſons through whom it comes, not
eying nor weighing the Spirit the thing ariſes from, but the
Perſon by whom it is ſpoken, which darkens the Eye of the
Underſtanding, and blinds by Prejudice the Mind that ſhould
diſcern, taſte and judge; from whence many Miſchiefs have
ſprung to the Courch of Chriſt in divers Ages: Nor is it the leaſt
Evil this Spirit of Strife is guilty of, even at this day, that it
uſeth the words, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Impoſition</hi> againſt the
Brethren, in the ſame manner as our ſuffering Friends have been
alwayes accuſtomed to intend them againſt the perſecuting
Prieſts and Powers of the Earth, as if it were the ſame thing to

            <p>This, <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> I ſend amongſt you, as a token of my
true Love, in the Revelation of the free Spirit of our God and
Father, who have ever been a Friend to true Liberty, as in the
State according to Law, ſo in the Church according to Scripture,
and as it ſtandeth in the Truth of Jeſus, that makes them who
love it Free indeed. Let us all keep low, and remember the Rock
from whence we were hewn, and dwell in a tender and reverent
Senſe of the daily Mercies and Providences of the Lord, looking
well to our own Growth and Proſperity in his heavenly Way
and Work, then ſhall the Deſire of our Hearts be more and more
after him, and the remembrance of his Name, and with our
Love to God, will our Love encreaſe one towards another,
helping and aiding one another: And I no ways doubt, but God
that has brought us out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and out of the
Houſe of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and delivered us from the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Lyon,</hi>
and the <hi>Paw</hi> of the <hi>Bare,</hi> will preſerve his People from this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed
Spirit that is not in Covenant with God, nor under
the Yoke of his Holy Royal Law of <hi>True Spiritual Liberty;</hi> for
they that keep and walk in the Light of Jeſus, are fenced from
the Power of this Crooked Serpent, that ſeeks whom he may
betray; nor are any ſtung by him but the Unwatchful, the Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeners
and Hearkeners after his jealous Whiſpers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
Inſinnations: They are ſuch as make their Dwelling in
the Earth, where his Region is, and where he creeps and twiſts,
who is Earthly, Senſual and Deviliſh, and ſo is all the Wiſdom
that comes from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My dear Friends,</hi> Keep, I pray you, in the Simplicity of the Truth
and Croſs of Jeſus, and wait for your daily Bread, and to be daily
renewed from the Lord; look to your Increaſe about Eternal
Riches, and be ſure to lay up Treaſure in Heaven, that fadeth
not away, that your Faith and Hope may have Eternal Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which the croſs Occurrences of Time and fears of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
cannot move; and beware of that Looſe and Irreverent
Spirit, which has not thoſe in high eſteem among you, that are
faithful in the Lords Work, and that labour in his bleſſed Word
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60045:10"/>
and Doctrine: I plainly ſee a coldneſs and a ſhortneſs on this
hand, and be the pretence as it will, it is not pleaſing to the
Lord: They that love Chriſt, his Servants are dear to them, and
they bear a tender Regard to their Tryals, Travails, Spendings
and Sufferings, who ſeek not yours, but you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you may all
be preſented Blameleſs at the Coming of the great God, and our
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo the Goſpel Miniſtry and Teſtimony
may be held up with holy fervent Love and Godly Eſteem, to
the keeping under every raw and exalted Mind, and whatever
may ſlight and turn againſt it, leſt God that has Richly viſited us
with his Fatherly Viſitations and Day ſpringing from on High
ſhould remove his Bleſſing from amongſt us, and place his Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
amidſt another People. Be wiſe therefore, O <hi>Friends!</hi>
for behold, he is at the Door that muſt have an Account of your
Stewardſhip: Be watchful, keep to your firſt Love and Works,
that ſo you may endure to the End, and be ſaved: And having
Overcome, you may have right to eat of the Tree of Life, which
is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</p>
            <p>The God of Peace, who hath brought our dear Lord Jeſus from the
dead, and Vs with him, more abundantly enrich you all with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Knowledge, in the Revelation of himſelf, through Faith
in his Son, by whom in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken to us, who is
the bleſſed and only Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
who only hath Immortality; to whom be Honour and Power Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
