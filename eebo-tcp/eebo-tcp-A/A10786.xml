         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Vision of Sir <hi>George Ripley,</hi> Chanon of Bridlington.</head>
            <l>WHen busie at my booke I was vpon a certaine night,</l>
            <l>This Vision here exprest appear'd vnto my dimmed sight,</l>
            <l>A toade full rudde I saw did drinke the iuice of grapes so fast,</l>
            <l>Till ouercharged with the broath, his bowells all to brast,</l>
            <l>And after that from poysoned bulke, he cast his venome fell,</l>
            <l>For griefe and paine whereof his members all began to swell;</l>
            <l>With drops of poysoned sweate approching thus his secret den,</l>
            <l>His caue with blasts of fumous ayre, he all bewhited then:</l>
            <l>And from the which in space a golden humor did ensue,</l>
            <l>Whose falling drops fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> high did staine the soile with ruddy hew,</l>
            <l>And when his corps, the force of vitall breath began to lacke,</l>
            <l>This dying toade became forthwith like coale for colour black:</l>
            <l>Thus drowned in his proper Veynes of poysoned flood,</l>
            <l>For tear me of eightie dayes and foure he rotting stood:</l>
            <l>By tryall then this venome to expell I did desire,</l>
            <l>For which J did commit his carkase to a gentle fire:</l>
            <l>Which done, a wonder to the sight, but more to be rehearst,</l>
            <l>The toade with colours rare through euery side was pearst:</l>
            <l>And white appear'd when all the sundry hewes were past:</l>
            <l>Which after being tincted, rudde for euermore did last:</l>
            <l>Then of the venome handled thus a medicine I did make,</l>
            <l>Which venom kills, and saueth such as venome chaunce to take,</l>
            <l>Glory be to him the graunter of such secret wayes,</l>
            <l>Dominion, and Honour, both with worship and with prayse.</l>

                  <hi>Sampson</hi> his might which was so strong:</l>
               <l>King <hi>Saule</hi> also lost his kingdome,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Dauid</hi> was punished for his wrong:</l>

               <l>King <hi>Ezechias</hi> by sicknes had punishment,</l>

               <l>In the beginning when thou mad'st all of nought,</l>

               <l>Conteyning naturally all things without diuision:</l>
               <l>Of which in six dayes he made cleere distinction:</l>
               <l>As Genesis apertly doth record.</l>
               <l>Then heauen and earth were perfected by his word.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So through his will and power, out of one mas</l>
               <l>Confused; was made each thing that being is,</l>
               <l>But afore in glory as maker he was,</l>
               <l>Now is and shall be without end I wis,</l>
               <l>And purified soules vp to his blis</l>

               <l>For as of one masse was made all thing,</l>
               <l>Right so in our practize must it be,</l>
               <l>All our secreats of one Image must spring,</l>
               <l>As in Philosophers bookes whoso list to see,</l>
               <l>Our stone is called the lesse world, one and three;</l>
               <l>Magnesa also of sulphure and Mercurie,</l>

               <l>All Philosophers record and truely saine the same,</l>

                     <hi>SEperation</hi> doth each part from other diuide,</l>

                  <l>But in our <hi>Seperation</hi> Nature doth not blinn,</l>
                  <l>Making diuision of qualities elementall,</l>
                  <l>Into a fift degree till they be turned all.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Earth is turned into water vnder black and bloe,</l>
                  <l>And water after into ayre vnder very white,</l>
                  <l>Then Aire into fire, elements there be no moe,</l>
                  <l>Of these is made our stone of great delight,</l>
                  <l>But of this <hi>Seperation</hi> much more must we write,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Seperation</hi> is called by Philosophers definition,</l>
                  <l>Of the saide foure elements terraptatiue dispersion.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Of this <hi>Seperation</hi> I finde a like figure,</l>
                  <l>Thus spoken by the Prophet in the Psalmodie,</l>
                  <l>God brought out of a stone a flood of water pure,</l>
                  <l>And out of the hardest rock oyle abundantly,</l>
                  <l>So out of our stone precious if thou be witty,</l>
                  <l>Oyle incombustable, and water thou shalt draw,</l>

                  <l>Doe this with heate easie and nourishing,</l>
                  <l>First with moyst fire and after that with drie,</l>
                  <l>The flegme with patience out drawing,</l>
                  <l>And after that the other Natures wittely</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Seperation</hi> thus must thou oftetimes make,</l>
                  <l>Thy waters diuiding into partes two,</l>
                  <l>So that the subtile from the grosse thou take,</l>

                  <l>The other parte is spirituall and flying,</l>
                  <l>But thou must turne them all into one thing.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Then oyle and water with water shall distill,</l>

                  <l>This water is like to the venymous Tire,</l>

                  <l>At Pothecaries often therefore it is sought,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For then as is the Triacle true,</l>
                  <l>It is of poyson most expulsiue,</l>
                  <l>And in his working doth marueiles shew,</l>
                  <l>Preseruing many from death to life,</l>
                  <l>But looke thou meddle it with no corosiue,</l>

                  <l>Which as I saide is after <hi>Seperation</hi> celebrate,</l>
                  <l>In which the parties be left with least to colligate,</l>

                  <l>Of water and ayre, with earth and fire,</l>

                  <l>The first is called by Philosophers Diptatiue,</l>
                  <l>The which betwixt the agent and patient must be,</l>
                  <l>Male and female, <hi>Mercury,</hi> and Sulphure viue,</l>
                  <l>Matter, and forme, thinne, and thick to thrine,</l>
                  <l>This lesson will helpe thee without any doubt,</l>
                  <l>And our <hi>Coniunction</hi> truly to bring about.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The second manner is called Triptatiue,</l>
                  <l>Which is <hi>Coniunction,</hi> made of things three,</l>
                  <l>Of bodie, soule and spirit, that they not striue,</l>
                  <l>Which trinitie thou must bring to vnitee,</l>
                  <l>For as the soule to the spirite the bond must bee;</l>
                  <l>Right so the bodie the soule to him must knit,</l>

                  <l>OF <hi>Congelation</hi> I need not much to write:</l>
                  <l>But what it is, I will to thee declare;</l>
                  <l>It is of soft things induration of colour white,</l>
                  <l>And confixation of spirits which flying are;</l>
                  <l>How to congeale, he needeth not much to care,</l>
                  <l>For Elements will knit together soone,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>But Congelations be made in diuers wise,</l>
                  <l>Of spirits and bodies dissolued to water cleare,</l>
                  <l>Of salts also dissolued twice or thrise,</l>
                  <l>And then congeald into a fluxible matter;</l>
                  <l>Of such congealing, fooles fast doo clatter,</l>

                  <l>For it must euer stand in it vnctuous,</l>
                  <l>And it is also a tincture so bounteous,</l>

                  <l>Withouten blast: and beware of delusion,</l>
                  <l>For such congealing accordeth not to our conclusion</l>

                  <l>It longeth to multipliers, congealing vulgarly:</l>

                  <l>From egg-shels calcined, and from quick lime,</l>
                  <l>And in their manner yet sublime they right weele:</l>
                  <l>But such subliming accordeth neuer a deele</l>
                  <l>To our intents, for we sublime not so,</l>
                  <l>To true subliming therefore, now will I goe.</l>

               <lg>

                  <l>For without violence thou shalt it not downe bring</l>
                  <l>Againe, but there it will abide and dwell,</l>
                  <l>So it reioyceth with refrigeration I thee tell,</l>
                  <l>Keepe it therefore with temperate heate adowne</l>

                  <l>But not the truth with perfect complement,</l>

                  <l>For this is wholly to our intent,</l>

                  <l>If thou therefore be maister of this Arte,</l>
                  <l>Thy Fermentation let thus be doone,</l>
                  <l>Fixe water and earth together soone,</l>
                  <l>And when thy medicine as waxe doth flowe,</l>

                  <l>For that is medicine each deale perfite,</l>

                  <l>Right so thy medicine ferment thou shall,</l>
                  <l>That it may taste of the Ferment pure,</l>

               <lg>

                  <l>Which must be altred as I haue told thee;</l>
                  <l>The third most secret of which I meene,</l>

                  <l>And aske of workers, what is this thing?</l>
                  <l>Anon thereby I should them prooue,</l>
                  <l>If they had knowledge of our fermenting:</l>
                  <l>For manie a man speaketh with wondring,</l>

                  <l>For <hi>Fermentation</hi> true as I thee tell,</l>
                  <l>Is of the soule with the bodies incorporation,</l>
                  <l>Restoring to it the kindly smell,</l>
                  <l>With tast and colour by naturall conspissation,</l>
                  <l>Of things disseuered, a due reintegration,</l>
                  <l>Whereby the bodie of the spirit taketh impression,</l>
                  <l>That either the other may help to haue ingression.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For like as bodies in their compaction corporall,</l>
                  <l>May not shewe out their qualities effectually,</l>
                  <l>Vntill the time that they become spirituall,</l>
                  <l>No more may spirits abide with bodies stedfastly,</l>
                  <l>Till they with them be confixate proportionally,</l>
                  <l>For then the bodie teacheth the spirit to suffer fire,</l>
                  <l>And the spirit the bodie to enter to thy defire.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>Therefore thy gold with gold thou must ferment,</l>

                     <hi>MVltiplication</hi> now to declare I proceede,</l>
                  <l>Which is by Philosophers in this wise defined</l>
                  <l>Augmentation it is of the Elixer indeede,</l>
                  <l>In goodnes and quantitie both for white and red,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Multiplication</hi> is therefore as they doe write,</l>
                  <l>That thing that doth augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t medicines in each degree,</l>
                  <l>In colour, in odour, in vertue and also in quantitee.</l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:16471:41"/>
                  <l>And why thou mayst this medicine multiplie,</l>
                  <l>Infinitely forsooth the cause is this,</l>
                  <l>For it is fire, which kindled will neuer die,</l>
                  <l>Dwelling with thee, as fire doth in houses,</l>
                  <l>Of which one sparke may make more fire ywis,</l>
                  <l>As muske in pigments and other spices mo,</l>
                  <l>In vertue multiplied, and our medicine right so.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So he is rich which fire hath lesse or more,</l>
                  <l>Because he may so hugely it multiply,</l>
                  <l>And right so rich is he which any parte hath in store,</l>
                  <l>Of our Elixers which be augmentable infinitely,</l>
                  <l>One way if thou dissolue our pouders drye,</l>
                  <l>And make often times of them Congelation,</l>
                  <l>Thereof in goodnes then makest thou Augmentation.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The second way both in goodnes and quantitie,</l>
                  <l>It multiplyeth by iterate <hi>Fermentation,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>As in that chapter I shewed plainely to thee,</l>
                  <l>By diuers manners of naturall operation,</l>
                  <l>And also in the chapter of our <hi>Cibation,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Where thou mayst know how thou shalt multiplie,</l>
                  <l>Thy medicine with Mercurie infinitely.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But and thou wilt both loose and eke ferment,</l>
                  <l>Both more in quantitie and better will it be:</l>
                  <l>And in such wise thou mayst it soone augment,</l>
                  <l>That in thy glasse it will growe like a tree,</l>
                  <l>The tree of <hi>Hermes</hi> named seemely to see,</l>
                  <l>Of which one pippin a thousand will multiplie,</l>
                  <l>If thou canst make thy proiection wittely.</l>

                  <l>And like as Saffron when it is puluerizate,</l>
                  <l>By little and little if it with liquor be</l>
                  <l>Tempred, and then with much more liquor dilate,</l>
                  <l>Teyneth much more of liquor in quantitie,</l>
                  <l>Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being whole in his grosse nature: so shalt thou see,</l>
                  <l>That our Elixer, the more it is made thinne,</l>
                  <l>The further in tincture it fastly will rinne.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Keepe in thy fire therefore both euen and morrow,</l>
                  <l>From house to house that thou neede not to rinne,</l>
                  <l>Among thy neighbours thy fire to seeke or borrow,</l>
                  <l>The more thou keepest, the more good shalt thou win</l>
                  <l>Multiplying it alwaies more &amp; more thy glasse within,</l>

                  <l>For because of corruption their tinctures must fade,</l>

                  <l>Which after Proiection be brittle blew and black,</l>

               <l>Of diuers sulphures, and especially of two,</l>

               <l>Wherefore I say who will our pearle and Ruby make,</l>

               <l>Whereof doth spring both white and red naturally,</l>
