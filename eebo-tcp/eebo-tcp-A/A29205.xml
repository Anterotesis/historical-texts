            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the
CHRISTIAN READERS,
especially the
Roman-Catholicks of England.</head>
            <p>CHristian Reader, the great Bustling in
the Controversy concerning Papall power
or the discipline of the Church, hath been
either about the true sense of some Texts of holy
Scripture, As <hi>thou art Peter,</hi> and <hi>upon this
rocke will I build my Church,</hi> and <hi>to thee
will I give the Keies of the Kingdome of
heaven,</hi> and <hi>feed my sheepe:</hi> Or about some
privileges conferred upon the Roman See by the
Canons of the Fathers and the Edicts of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
but praetended by the Roman Court and
the mainteiners thereof to be held by divine
right. I e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>devour in this Treatise to disabuse thee,
and to shew that this challenge of divine right,
is but a Blind or Diversion to withhold thee
from finding out the true State of the Quaestion.
So the Hare makes her doubles and her iumpes
before she come to her Forme, to hinder Tracers
from finding her out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40675:3"/>I demonstrate to thee, that the true contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
is not concerning St. Peter, we have no
formed difference about St Peter, nor about
any point of faith, but of interest and profit,
nor with the Church of Rome, but with the
Court of Rome, and wherein it doth consist,
namely in these quaestions; VVho shall conferre
English Bishoprickes, who shall convocate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Synods, who shall receive tenths and first
fruites and Oathes of Allegiance and Fidelity,
VVhether the Pope can make binding Lawes in
England without the consent of the King and
Kingdome, or dispense with English Lawes at
his owne pleasure, or call English Subjects to
Rome without the Princes leave, or set up Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine
Courtes in England against their wills.
And this I shew not out of the opinions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Authors, but out of the publick Lawes
of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I prove moreover out of our fundamentall
Lawes and the writings of our best Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
that all these branches of Papall power
were abuses and innovations and usurpations,
first attempted to be introduced into England
above eleven hundred yeares after Christ, with
<pb facs="tcp:40675:3"/>
the names of the Innovators, and the praecise
time when each innovation began, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that was made against it, by our Kings,
by our Bishops<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> by our Peeres, by our Parliaments,
with the groanes of the Kingdome under these
Papall innovations and extortions.</p>
            <p>Likewise in point of doctrine, thou hast been
instructed that the Catholick faith doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
all those points which are controverted
betvveene us and the Church of Rome, vvithout
the expresse beliefe vvhereof no Christian can
be saved: vvhereas in truth all these are but
opinions, yet some more dangerous then others.
If none of them had ever bene started in the
vvorld, there is sufficient to salvation for points
to be believed in the <hi>Apostles Creed.</hi> Into this
Apostolicall faith professed in the <hi>Creed,</hi> and
explicated by the foure first <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,</hi>
and onely into this faith, vve have all
been baptised. Farre be it from us to imagine, that
the Catholick Church hath evermore baptised,
and doth still baptise but into one half of the
Christian faith.</p>
            <p>In summe doest thou desire to live in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the true Catholick Church? So do I.
<pb facs="tcp:40675:4"/>
But as I dare not change the cognisance of my
Christianity, that is my <hi>Creed,</hi> nor enlarge the
Christian faith (I meane the essentialls of it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
those bounds vvhich the Apostles have
set: So I dare not (to serve the interest of the
Roman Court,) limit the Catholick Church,
vvhich Christ hath purchased vvith his blood,
to a fourth or a fifth part of the Christian
vvorld.</p>
            <p>Thou art for tradition, So am I. But my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is not the tradition of one particular
Church contradicted by the tradition of another
Church, but the universall and perpetuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Christian vvorld united. Such a
tradition is a full proofe, vvhich is received
<hi>semper ubique &amp; ab omnibus;</hi> alvvaies, every
vvhere, and by all Christians. Neither do I looke
upon the oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of an handfull of Heretickes,
(they are no more being compared to the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
multitudes of Christians,) in one or
two ages, as inconsistent vvith universality,
any more then the highest mountains are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
vvith the roundnesse of the earth.</p>
            <p>Thou desirest to beare the same respect to the
Church of Rome that thy Ancestours did; So do I.
<pb facs="tcp:40675:4"/>
But for that fullness of power, yea coactive power
in the exteriour Court, over the subjects of
other Princes, and against their vvills, devised
by the Courte of Rome, not by the Church of
Rome; it is that pernicious source from vvhence
all these usurpations did spring. Our Ancestours
from time to time made Lavves against it: and
our reformation in pointe of discipline being
rightly understood, vvas but a pursueing of their
steppes. The true controuersy is, vvhether the
Bishop of Rome ought by divine right to have
the externall Regiment of the English Church,
and coactive jurisdiction in English Courtes,
over English Subjects, against the vvill of the
King and the Lavves of the Kingdome.</p>

Or
A cleare and
CIVIL ANSWER,
to the railing accusation of S. W.
in his late Booke called.
SCHISME DISPAT'CHED.</head>
            <p>Whatsoever S. W. alias Mr. Serjeant
doth intimate to the contrary, (for
he dare not cough out,) it is a most undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth, that no particular Church, (no
not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self) is exempted
from a possibility of falling into errours in
faith. When these errours are in Essentials
of faith, which are necessary to salvation
<hi>necessitate medii,</hi> they destroy the being of
that Church which is guilty of them. But if
these errours be in inferiour points, such as
are neither absolutely necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be known, nor to be believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be known; such an Erroneous
Church erring without obstinacy and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the truth implicitly <hi>in praeparatione ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi>
may and doth still continue a true
member of the Catholick Church, and
other coordinate Churches may and ought
to maintein Communion with it, not with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40675:6"/>
that they dissent in opinion. But
if one Church before a lawfull determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall obtrude her own Errours or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
upon all other Churches as a necessary
condition of her communion, or after De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
shall obtrude doubtful opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(whether they be Erroneous or not) as
necessary Articles of Christian faith, and so
not onely explain, but likewise enlarge the
Ancient Creeds, she becommeth Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call:
As on the otherside, that Church
which shall not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>twardly acquiesce after a
legall Determination, and cease to disturb
Christian Vnity, though her Iudgement
may be sound, yet her Practise is Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</p>
            <p>This is the very case betwixt the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Rome</hi> and England, Shee obtrudeth
Doubtfull Opinions as Necessary Articles
of faith, and her own Errours as necessary
conditions of Communion, Which <hi>Mr.
Serjeant</hi> everywhere misseth and misteth
with his Praevarications. I cannot more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resemble his Discourse then to a Winter
Torrent, Which aboundeth with Water
when there is no need of it, but in Summer
when it Should be useful, it is dried up: So
he is full of proofes (which he miscalleth
<hi>Demonstrations)</hi> where there is no controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
between us, and where the water sticks in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40675:6"/>
deed; he is as mute as a fish. He taketh
great paines te prove that the Catholick
Church is infallible in such things as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation. Whom doth he stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke?
He beateth but the aire, Wee say the
same: But wee deny that his Church of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>
is this Catholick Church, and that the
Differences between us are in such things as
are necessary to Salvation. Here where
he should Demonstrate if he could, he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
him self. He proveth that it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sonable
to deny that or doubt of it which is
received by the universall Tradition of
the whole Christian World. What is he
seeking? Surely he doth not seek the
Question here in Earnest, but as he who
sought for an Hare under the Leads; because
he must seek her as well where she was not,
as where she was. We confesse that writing
addeth no new Authority to Tradition, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Writings and Divine Tradition, Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Writings and Apostolical traditions, if
they be both alike certain, have the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
And what greater certainty can be
imagined then the Vniversall Attestation of
the Catholick Symbolicall Church of Christ.
But the right Controversy lyeth on the other
hand. Wee deny that the Tradition whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon
they ground their Opinions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
wee and They dissent, is universall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40675:7"/>
either in regard of time, or place.</p>
            <p>He endeavoureth with Tooth and Nayle
to establish the <hi>Roman Papacy Iure divino,</hi>
but for the extent of Papall power he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
it free to Princes, commonwealths,
Churches, Universities, and particular
Doctors to Dispute it and bound it, and to
be Judges of their own Privileges. Yet the
maine controversy, I might say the onely
necessary controversy between them and
us, is about the extent of Papall power, as
shall be seen in due place. If the Pope would
content himself with his <hi>exordium Vnitatis,</hi>
which was all that his primitive praedeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
had, and is as much as a great part of
his own Sons will allow him at this day;
wee are not so hard hearted and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
for such an innocent Title or Office,
to disturb the peace of the Church. Nor
doe envy him such a preheminence among
Patriarchs as <hi>S. Pieter</hi> had (by the confession
of his own party) amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g the Apostles. But this
will not be accepted, either he will have all
or none, patronages, tenths, first fruits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestitures,
appeales, legantine courts, and in
one word an absolute Soveraignty or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
It is nothing unlesse he may bind all
other Bishops to maintein his usurped Roial<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

encroachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts are directly destructive to the

Court who have deserted and disclaymed
his own just regulated authority, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the right stating of the question. But
<hi>M. Serjeant</hi> lapwing like makes the most pew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing

            <p>I heare moreover by those who seem to

and one which he wil not claw of so easily.
And if no man had informed me, I should

who have run over from us, proved vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

(as <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> for example). I
cannot include all in the same Guilt. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it proceed from the Consciousnesse of
their owne guilt in deserting us, at this time
especially; or the Contentment to gaine
Companions or fellow Proselites: or they
find it necessary to procure themselves to be
trusted; or it be injoyned to them by their
Superiours as a Pollicy to make the Breach
irreparable; Or what else is the true
reason I doe not determine. But this wee

View of Mr. <hi>Serjeants</hi> railing writings are a
sufficient Antidote to a staied man against
such extreme scurrility. And I wonder that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is so provident
that none of her Sons in their writings
swerve from their rule of faith, should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them so Licentionsly to transgresse the

seem to propugn true Piety, to abandon all
Civility, as if Zeale and Humanity were in

When the Holy Ghost fell upon the

            <head>A SVRREIOINDER
or
Defence of the Bishop of Derrys Reply
to the Appendix of Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

            <p>The First part of his Rejoinder is a Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,
drawn from his former Principles
brought against <hi>Doctor Hammond.</hi> That
<hi>little remaines to be replyed to mee in substantiall
points, Since neither can I deny there is now a bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach
made between us, Nor doe I pretend demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
and rigorous evidence, that the Popes
Authority was an Vsurpation, Nor lastly doe
I pretend that probable reasons are a sufficient
ground to renounce an Authority so strongly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by long possession, and Vniversall Delivery
of immediate Forefathers as come from Christ,
or that it was prudence to hazard a Schisme upon
the uncertain Lottery of a Probability.</hi> These
grounds are supposed by him to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
against <hi>Doctor Hammond;</hi> and are
barely repeated here, to try if he can kill two
Birds with one Bolt made of a Burre. But
I refuse the Province at present as a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and a thanklesse Office; N'eedlesse in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40675:11"/>
respect of his learned Adversary, who will
shew him sufficiently the weaknesse of his
pretended Demonstration,<note place="margin">Pag. 543.</note> And thanklesse,
in respect of him self, who had taxed mee in
this Rejoinder of busying my self to answer
an objection that was not addressed to me.</p>
            <p>Yet least <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> should feign that I
seeke Subterfuges, I wil briefly and clearly
declare my Sense of his grounds as they are
here proposed, that he may fight no more
with his own shadow as it is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use; in hope I may recover his good
opinion of my Candour and ingenuity. And
if it please him, he may borrow <hi>Diogenes</hi> his
Candle and Lanthorn at noon Day to search
for contradictions.</p>
            <p>First that there is a breach between them
and us is too evident and void of Question.
Whether they or wee be guilty of making
this breach, They by excommunicating us,
or obtruding unlawfull Conditions of their
Communion upon us, or wee by seperating
from them without sufficient Grounds, is
a question between us. But that which
changeth the whole state of the Question is
this, If any Bishop or Church or Court
Whatsoever, shall presume to change
the ancient Discipline of the Church
and Doctrin of Faith, either by Addition
or by Substraction, either all at once or by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40675:12"/>
degrees, and in so doing shall make a Breach
between them and the Primitive Church,
or between them and the present Catholick
Church; To separate from him or them in
those things wherein they had first separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Ancient or present Catholick
Church, is not Schism but trÃ»e piety. Now
wee affirm that the later Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>
did alter the Discipline of the Church and
Doctrin of Faith, by changing their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Vnity into a Plenitude and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
of Soveraign Iurisdiction, and by
adding of new Essentialls of Faith to the
Creed; and in so doing had made a former
Breach between them selves and all the rest
of the Christian World. Here the Hindge
of the Controversy is, moved. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all his supposed Demonstrations
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ght to have looked. Neither will it availe
him anything to say <hi>there can be no sufficient
cause of Schism,</hi> for in this case the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not Schisme but the cause is Schism.</p>
            <p>Secondly if by <hi>Demonstrative and rigorous
Evidence</hi> he understand perfect Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
according to the exact rules of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
Neither is this cause capable of such
demonstrations, nor can his <hi>Mediums</hi>
amount unto it: but if by <hi>Demonstrative evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi>
he understand onely convincing proofes,
as it seemeth by opposing it to probable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40675:12"/>
reasons I have made it evident that the
Popes Authority which he did sometimes
excercise in <hi>England,</hi> before the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
when they permitted him, and which he
would have excercised alwayes <hi>de futuro,</hi> if
he could have had his own will, was a mere
Usurpation and innovation never attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the <hi>Brittish</hi> Churches for the first six
hundred yeares; Attempted but not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Churches for the next five
hundred yeares; And damned by the Lawes
of the successive <hi>Norman</hi> Kings ever since,
as destructive to the rights of the English
Crown, and the Liberties of the English
Church, as shall be manteined where soever
occasion offers it self. Yet all this while I
meddle not with his <hi>beginning of Vnity;</hi> If
he want that respect from me, it is his own
fault.</p>
            <p>And this includeth an answer to his third
ground that the Papall Authority which
wee rejected, was <hi>so strongly supported by long
possession and the Vniversall Delivery of Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as come from Christ.</hi> He had alwayes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
shew of right for his <hi>beginning of Vnity,</hi> but
no pretence, in the world for his <hi>Soveraignty
of power.</hi> To make Lawes, To repeale La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
to dispense with the Cannons of the
Vniversall Church, to hold Legantine
Courts, to dispose of Ecclesiasticall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40675:13"/>
to cal the subjets out of the kingdoms,
to impose tributes at his pleasure and the
like. Wee will shew him such an usurpation
as this; Let him prove such a Papacy by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
tradition, and he shall be great <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>
to mee. Wee doe not hold it <hi>prudence to
hazard a Schism upon probabilities:</hi> but trust me
such a multitude of palpable usurpations
as wee are able to reckon up, so contrary to
the fundamentall Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> which
were grounded upon the ancient Privileges
of the <hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, together
with the addition of twelve new articles or
Essentialls to the Creed at once by <hi>Pius</hi> the

more then probabilities. He converseth
altogether in Generalls, <hi>a Papacy or no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
which is commonly the Method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers:
but if he dispute or treate with us,
wee must make bold to draw him down to
particulars; Particulars did make the Breach.</p>
            <p>I censured his light and ludicrous title of
<hi>Down derry</hi> modestly in these words. <hi>It were
strange if he should throw a good cast who soales
his Bowle upon an undersong,</hi> alluding to that
ordinary and elegant expression, in our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
tongue,</hi> Soale your bowle well, that is,

runs at random, telling the Reader, that I

And that he him self is so <hi>inexpert, as not to
understand what is meant by sealing a Bowle
upon an undersong.</hi> If he were such a stranger
in his Mothers Tongue, Yet he might have
learned of some of his friends what soaling
a Bowle was, rather then burthen the presse,
and trouble the World with such empty and
impertinent Vanities Neither did his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
humour rest here, but twice more in
his short Rejoinder he is pursuing this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Bowle. Afterwards he telleth us
that I was <hi>beholden to the merry S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would needs make it his Post-past to his

himself: but it sheweth that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
was over scurriloufly audacious, to
make such Antepasts and Postpasts at his
pleasure. Neither is it likely that <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser
was such a perfect stranger to our langnage</hi>
as he intimateth in his Epistle, and the <hi>merry
Stationer</hi> so well versed in our <hi>Vndersongs.</hi>
But after all this he owneth it by telling us
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40675:14"/>
that <hi>the jeast was very proper and fatall.</hi> Yes as
fatall as it is for his Rejoinder to contein
666 pages, which is just the number of the
Beast. His merry Stationer might easily
have contrived it otherwise, for feare
of a fatality, by making one page more or
lesse, but his mind was otherwise taken
up, how to cheat his Customers with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
bills of fare, which they will

                  <p>To his former Proposition I made this

And that <hi>I strive Hocus-pocus like to

more of such like froath, where in there is
not a syllable to the purpose, except this,
that he <hi>did not mention the word Catholick in
that place.</hi> The greater was his fault. It is a
foule Solecisme in Logick not to conclude
contradictorily. I did mention <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church</hi> in the State of the Question.
<hi>Whether the church of England had separated
it self from the communion of the Catholick
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40675:16"/>
Church.</hi> And he had undertaken in the words
immediatly following, <hi>to charge that very
Schisme upon us with undeniable Evidence.</hi>
And in his very first Essay shuffles out
<hi>the Catholick Church,</hi> and in the place thereof
thrusts in <hi>the Church of Rome with all the rest
of her communion.</hi> He might have known that
wee doe not looke upon the Church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
with all the rest of her Communion as
the Catholick Church; Nor as above a
fifth part of the present Catholick Church;
And that wee doe not ascribe any such in
fallibility in necessary truths to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church with all her dependants, as
wee doe to the true Catholick Church, Nor
esteem it alwayes Schismaticall to seperate
from the modern Roman Church, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in those points wherein shee had first
seperated both from the primitive Roman
Church, and from the present Catholick
Church. But wee confesse it to be alwayes
Schismaticall to seperate from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Catholick Church united. Thus
much he ought to take notice of, and when
he hath oecasion hereafter to write upon
this Subject, not to take it for granted (as
they use to doe) that the Catholick Church
and the Roman Church are convertible
Termes, or tell us a Tale of a Tub what
their <hi>Tenet is, that these Churches which continue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40675:16"/>
in Communnion with the Roman are the onely true
Churches.</hi> We regard not their Schismaticall

we regarded the same tenets of the donatists
of old. They must produce better autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
then their Owne, and more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
proofes then he hath any in his Bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
to make us believe that the Roman
Church is the Catholick Church. It is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to acknowledge it to be <hi>a Catholick church</hi>
inclusively; but the greatest uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the world to make it <hi>the Catholick
church</hi> exclusively, that is to seperate from
Christ and from hope of Salvation as much
as in them lieth all Christians who are not
of their own communion. Howsoever, it is
well that they who used to vaunt that <hi>the
Enemy trembled at the name of the Catholick
church,</hi> are now come about themselves to
make the Catholick Church to be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix

the Apostles were even the same thing that Peter
was, endowed with an equall Fellowship both of
honour and power: but the beginning commeth
from Vnity, the primacy is given to Peter, to
signify one church and one chaire.</hi> It is wel
known that <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> made all the Bisshop
ricks in the World to be but, one masse, <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copatus
unus est Episcoporum multorum concordi

                     <note place="margin">Ep. 52. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. de Vnitate.</note> whereof every Bishop
had an entire part, <hi>cujus a singulis in solidum

<hi>St. Peter</hi> is this beginning of Vnity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40675:18"/>
this primacy of Order, this preheminence
to be the Chief of Bishops, To be Bishop of

Vnity did spring,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. 55. ad Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</note> Yet I esteem <hi>St. Ciprian</hi> as
fauorable an Expositor to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as any they wil find out of their own Chaire
that was no more interessed in that See.
This primacy neither the Ancients nor wee
doe deny to <hi>St. Peter,</hi> of Order, of Place, of
preheminence, if this first Movership would
serve his turn, this controversy were at an
end for our parts. But this Primacy is
over leane, The Court of Rome have no

upon earth, an absolute Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Soveraignty, A power to make Canons,
to abolish Canons, to dispense with Canons,
to impose pensions to dispose dignities, to
decide Controversies by a single Authority.
This was that which made the breach, not
the innocent Primacy of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> as I shall
demonstrate by evident proofes as cleare as
the noone day light.</p>

his pen upon this subject and not to

him endeavour to demonstrate these foure
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40675:18"/>
things which wee deny indeed.</p>
                  <p>First that each Apostle had not the same
power over the Christian world by virtue
of Christ Commission <hi>(As my Father sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly that <hi>St. Peter</hi> ever excercised
a single Iurisdiction over the persons of the
rest of the Apostles, more then they over
him besides and over and above his Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Order, or beginning of Vnity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly that <hi>St. Peter</hi> a lone had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
granted to him by Christ as to an
<hi>Ordinary Pastour,</hi> to him and his Successors,
And all the rest of the Apostles had their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
onely as <hi>Delegates</hi> for term of life;
This new hatched Distinction being the
foundation of the present Papacy, I would
be glad to see one good author for it, who
writ within a tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sand yeares after Christ.</p>
                  <p>Lastly that the Soveraignty of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
power and Iurisdiction rested in <hi>St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
alone, and was exercised by him alone,
and not by the Apostolicall College, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the hystory of the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Now let us proceed from <hi>St. Peter</hi> to the
Pope which is the second part of his rule of
Government.<note place="margin">The p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour to Saint Peter.</note> 
                     <hi>And that the Bishops of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
as Successors of St. Peter inherited from him
this Privilige in respect of the Successors of the
rest of the Apostles, And actually exercised this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40675:19"/>
power in all the Countreyes which kept Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Church of Rome.</hi> what Privilege?
To be the first Bishop, the Chiefe Bishop,
the principall Bishop, the first mover in the
Church, just as <hi>S. Peter</hi> was among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles?
we have heard of no other Privilege
as yet. If a man would be pleased ou: of meer
pitty to his starving cause, to suppose thus
much, what good would it doe him? Doth
he think that the pope or the court of <hi>Rome</hi>
would ever accept of such a Papacy as this,
or thanke him for his double diligence? He
must either be meanly versed in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Fathers, or give little credit to them,
who will deny the Pope to succced <hi>St Peter</hi>
in the Roman Bishoprick, or will envy him
the Dignity of a Patriarck with in his just
Bounds. But the Breach between <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> was not about any Episcopall, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical,
or Patriarchall rightes. A Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
hath more power in his proper Bishop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rick
then in his province, and more in his
province then in the rest of his Patriarchate:
But papall power is much greater then any
Bishop did ever challenge in his own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
In my answer to his Assumtion I shal
shew sufficiently who they were that Brake
this Bond of Vnion, and are the undoubted
Authors of Schisme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:40675:19"/>But before I come to that,<note place="margin">But not by Christs Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I would know
of him, how the Pope did <hi>inherit,</hi> all those
Privileges which he claimeth from <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
or how he holds them by <hi>Christs own ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in holy Scripture?</hi> First all the Eastern
Churches doe affirm Confidently that the
most of these Privileges were the Legacyes
of the Church representative, not Christ or
<hi>St. Peter.</hi> And it seemeth to be very true
by that of the Councell of <hi>Sardica,<note place="margin">Conc. Sardic. c. 3.</note> Si vobis

these Priuileges were the popes <hi>inheritance,</hi>
it was not wel done of old <hi>Osius</hi> to put
it upon a <hi>Si placet, content or not content,</hi>
and to assigne no better a reason then, the
memory of a Predecessour. It semeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be true by the Councel of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
which attributeth the primacy of the

                     <hi>Gloriosissimi Iudices dixerunt.
The most glorieus Iudges said, let both partyes

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40675:20"/>Secondly if the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did hold

the true <hi>Copyes</hi> of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell,
they rejected that part of papall power as

                  <p>Thirdly if by Prince of Bishops <hi>Mr Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant</hi>
understand an absolute Prince, one
who hath a single Legislative power, To

to secure him self from the Censures

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, before he can determine this to
be <hi>an vndeniable truth,</hi> and a necessary <hi>Bond

of all the Privileges of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> And
that <hi>this Principle is Christs own Ordination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Scripture,</hi> He must first reconcile
him self to his own party. There is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
upon the Synodall answer of the

Although the Pope as he is the Vicar of Christ

his Successour upon another account: but
by Christs own Ordination recorded in
Scripture he cannot be, if Christ himself
have not ordained in holy Scripture that
he should be. He addeth that <hi>I picked these
Words out of a Paragraph a leafe after.</hi> Why?
is he not bound to speake truth in one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph

he oblige one who combatteth with him

                  <p>How should the <hi>Bishop of Romes Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to S. Peter be Christs own ordination recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Scripture;</hi> When both his fellowes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40675:23"/>
and he himself doe ground the Bishop of
<hi>Romes</hi> right to succeed <hi>St. Peter</hi> upon the
fact of <hi>St. Peter:</hi> Namely, his dying Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
of <hi>Rome?<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 2 cap. 12. and lib. 4. ca. 4.</note> Bellarmine</hi> distinguisheth
<hi>between the Bishop of Romes succession of St.
Peter, and the reason of his succession. The
succession</hi> (saith he) <hi>is from the institution of
Christ by divine right, and commanded by
Christ: but the reason of this succession is from
the fact of</hi> S. <hi>Peter, not from the institution of
Christ.</hi> Which two are irreconciliable.
For if Christ commanded that the Bishop of
Rome should succeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> (as he saith)
<hi>Deus ipse jussit Romae figi Apostolicam Petri se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,
quae autem jubet Deus mutari ab hominibus
non possunt,</hi> Then not the fact of St. Peter,
but the mandate of Christ is the reason of
the succession. There was no need that St.
Peter should doe any thing to perfect the
commandement of Christ: and on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
if the fact of St. Peter be the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Bishop of Romes succession, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
it is evident that Christ did not command it.
Let it be supposed to avoid impertinent
disputes, that Christ did create a chiefe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
of his church as an office of perpetuall
necessity, without declaring his pleasure
who shall be his successour, but leaving
the choise either to the chief Pastor or to
the church: without peradventure in such a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40675:24"/>
case the Office is from Christ and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity
is from Christ, but the right of the
Successour is from them who make the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
whether if be the Cheif Pastor,
or the Church. The Succession of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>S. Peter.</hi> is not recorded in
Scripture; The fact of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Scripture. No such ordination
of Christ is recorded in Scripture, that the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should be S. Peters Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour;
And therefore it is impossible that the
Succession of the Bishop of Rome to <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
should be Christs own ordination recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then what is this Mandate of Christ?
and where conteined? The Mandate is an
old legend conteined in</hi> Marcellinus, Leo,
Athanasius, Ambrose, <hi>and</hi> Gregory, <hi>some
of which point at it, others relate it, some
define it as a matter of faith. That</hi> S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little before his Passion being ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of Rome did meete Christ in the gate
who told him that he came to Rome to be
Crucified againe, <hi>Thereby intimating
that</hi> St. Peter <hi>must suffer martyrdome
there. Here is no mandate of Christ to
S.</hi> Peter <hi>to fixe his See at</hi> Rome, <hi>much les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that he should place it there for ever,
never to be removed. True (saith</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40675:24"/>
                     <hi>but yet</hi> non est improbabile Dominum
etiam aperte jussisse ut Sedem suam Petrus it a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geret
Romae ut Romanus Episcopus absolute
ei succederet. It is not improbable that the
lord did command plainly that Peter should fixe
his See at Rome, that the Roman Bishop should
succeed him absolutely. <hi>Alas? this is but a
poore ground to build a mans faith upon,
that</hi> it is not improbable. <hi>And therefore

&amp;c. Although peradventure it be not of divine
right that the Romaen Bishop because he is the

                  <p>And though it were supposed a point of

                  <p>All which was agreed upon unanimouslly
between the Church of Rome and its dependents,
and the Church of England, and delivred from
hand to hand in them all by the Orall and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Tradition of a World of Fathers to a world
of Children successively, as a rule of Faith or
Difcipline received from Christ and his Apostles,
which so vast a Multitude of Eye witnesses did
see visibly practised from Age to Age, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
true, and such a rule is infallible and
impossibe to be Crooked.</p>
                  <p>But these two Rules are such Rules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And so he concludeth that</hi> they are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Vsurpations, <hi>and as</hi> easy to teach faith

                  <p>I have given his Argument as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and edge as I could possibly; but all this
Wind shakes no Corn. His other two
Rules were not so much to be blamed; as
this Rule of Rules, <hi>Orall and immediate
Tradition.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 6.</note> Of such Orall and immediate
Tradition it was that our Saviour told the

                     <note place="margin">1. Pet<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1. 18.</note> And <hi>St. Peter</hi> told the dispersed

such Traditions as The Iewes pretended
they had receiued from <hi>Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi>
as the Romanists pretend now to
have received their Traditions from <hi>Christ
and his Apostles.</hi> Otherwise, wee doe not
onely admit Orall Traditions in generall,
as an excellent Introduction to the Doctrin
of saving truth, and a singular help to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the holy Scriptures: but also parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
unwritten Traditions derived from
the Apostles and delivered unto us by the
manifest Testimony of the Primitive
Church, being agreeable to the holy
Scriptures. The Apostles did speak by
inspiration as well as write, and their
Tradition whether by word or writing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
was the word of God, into
which faith was resolved: The Traditions
of the Catholick Church of this present or
another age, have this Privilege, to be free
from all Errours that are absolutely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to Salvation: but this they have
not from the nature of Tradition; which
is subject to Errour, to Corruption, to
Change, to Contradiction:
<q>Mobilitate viget viresque acquirit eundo.</q>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40675:26"/>
but from the speciall Providence and
protection of Christ, who hath promised
to be with his Church untill the end of the
World.</p>
                  <p>In summe, I deny both his Propositions,
First his Major. Immediate Tradition
from Parents to Children is not a certain
and infallible Rule of Truth and Faith.
Traditions are often doubtfull, doe often
change with the times, and sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
one another: As we see in the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Traditions of the Eastern and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
Churches about the observation of
Easter, And the Councells of <hi>Nice</hi> and
<hi>Frankford</hi> about Images &amp;c. Neither
points of Faith nor Papall rights are so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
as he imagineth. Credulity, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Prejudice, and Passion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
doe all act their parts. Upon his
Grounds there can be no Ecclesiasticall U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations:
yet Experience teacheth us
that there have been such Vsurpations in
all Ages. If he had reason to renounce
the immediate Tradition of his Father and
Grandfather and great Grandfather; Then
others may have the like and better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Let him believe the Suns dancing
upon Easter morn, and the Swanssinging,
and the Pellicans digging of her Breast
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40675:27"/>
with her Bill, and all the Storyes of King
<hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> for it may be he
hath received all these from his Elders by
immediate Tradition.</p>
                  <p>He him self Confesseth that <hi>the possession
of goverument must be such a possession as may be
presumable to haue come from Christ, not of
such an one as every one knowes when it began.</hi>
P. 49. To what purpose is it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
tradition for all those branches of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
power which are in controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them and us, seeing all of them had
their first originall eleven hundred yeares
after Christ?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is not all, he ascribeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover
too much to the immediate Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the present Church, but much more
then too much to the immediate Tradition
of his elders, to make it absolutely infallible
<hi>cui non potest subesse falsum,</hi> and to resolve
Faith into it, The last resolution of Faith
must be into that which is formally the
word of God. The voice of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church may be materially the word
of God in regard of the matter and
thing testified: but it cannot be formally
the word of God, in respect of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and manner of testifying. But imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Tradition is often a Seminary of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40675:27"/>Thirdly he makes the Orall and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

doth hold, which was not instituted by councells,

These three markes, conjoinctly do most
firmly prove an Apostolicall Tradition. I
do not denie but that there have bene A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall

                  <p>To conclude we give all due respect to
Tradition; but not so much to Orall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as to Written Tradition, as being<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
certain, lesse subject to mistakes, and
more easily freed from mistakes, <hi>Liter a
scriptamanet.</hi> A serious person if he be but
to deliver a long message of importance
from one to another, will be carefull either
to receive it in writing, or put it in writing.
Nor so much to particular <hi>immediate</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as we do to Vniversall and perpetuall
tradition. He overshooteth himself beyond
all aime in affirming of immediate and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Tradition, that where it hath place
it is impossible for usurpations or abuses to
enter or find admittance. He might as well
tell us that it is impossible to make a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
line with a leaden Rule. Particular
Tradition is flexible and is often ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
according to the interests and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of particular ages and places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
He saith, that there <hi>can be no encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
so as men adhere to this method</hi> that is
immediate Tradition. He telleth us that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40675:28"/>
they did adhere to this Method, and that
there was such immediate Tradition: and
yet we have seen and felt that encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and vsurpations and abuses, did not
onely creep into the Church, but like a
Violent Torrent did beare down all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
before them. I produce but two
Witnesses, but they are beyond exception.
The one is Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the sixth in his
Instructions to his Nuncio <hi>Franciscus Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regatus</hi>
when he sent him to the German
Princes at the diet of <hi>Nuremberg,<note place="margin">Apud Goldast Const. Imper. pa. 29.</note> Wee know
that in the holy See for some yeares past, many
things have been to be abhominated, Abuses in
Spirituall things, Excesses in Mandates, and all
things changed perversly. Neither is it to be
marveiled at, if sicknesse descend from the head

that wee will doe our uttermost endeavour, that

that as the Corruption flowed from thence
to all inferiours; so likewise the health and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of all may proceed from thence.</hi> Pope
<hi>Adrian</hi> Confesseth abominable abuses, and
excesses, and perverse mutations and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions:
and yet <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> would make

us believe that where this Method of Orall
and immediate Tradition is used, there can
be no changes. Either this Method was not
used, or this Method is not a sufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative
against innovations: both wayes
his demonstration falleth to the ground.</p>
                  <p>My other Witnesse is the Councell of

                     <hi>But these two Rules</hi> (whereof
this is one part, that the Bishops of

agreed upon unanimously between the church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me

and delivered from hand to hand in them all by
the Orall and immediate Tradition, of a World
of Fathers to a World of children successively
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40675:29"/>
as a Rule of discipline received from Christ and
his Apostles, &amp;c.</hi> If all this were true, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
us nothing we may perhaps differ
from them in judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, but have no formed

ordinances of man, and to yeeld for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

rather more then is due, then lesse.
But otherwise how was that unanimously
agreed upon between the Churches of
Rome and England, and so delivered by
Fathers to Children as a thing accorded,
whereof the Church of Rome is no better
accorded within it self unto this day? I
mean concerning the divine right of the
Bishop of Rome to all the privileges
of St. Peter, when the Popes greatest
Champions maintein it so coldly as a thing
that <hi>is not improbable;</hi> that <hi>peradventure may
be,</hi> peradventure may not be, as grounded
upon a <hi>fact of St. Peter,</hi> that is as much
as to say not upon the Mandate of Christ?</p>
                  <p>And though wee should be so kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
as to suppose that there is some
part of Papall power, in the abstract not
in the concrete, which is of Christs own
institution, Namely, <hi>The beginning of
Vnity,</hi> that is a power to Convocate the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40675:30"/>
Church, and to preside in the Church, and
to pronounce the sentence of the Church,
so far and no further then power purely
spirituall doth extend; although there be
no speciall mandate of Christ to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for one to be the successour of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or any prime or chiefe of all other Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops:
yet in the Iudgement even of the
greatest opposers of Ecclesiasticall Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy,
it is the dictate of nature that one
should preside over the rest,<note place="margin">Beza defenf. pag. 153.</note>

that great Bulke of Ecclesiasticall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which hath been conferred upon that

Emperours<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which being Humane

convert a whole masse of Humane right
into divine? Wee see Papall power is not
equall or alike in all places, but is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or contracted variously according to
the different Privileges and liberties of
severall Churches and kingdomes. We
see at this day the Pope hath very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to doe in <hi>Sicily,</hi> as I have shewed
in my Vindication of the Church of

long since hath alienated in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the whole Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction
to the Soveraign Prince of the Country
and to his Heirs. Wee may call it by depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

it is to him and his He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is certain, divine right cannot be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or contracted; There is no Privilege
or prescription against divine right,
That which belongeth to one person by
divine right cannot be alienated to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
person by humane right; for then
Humane right should be stronger then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right.</p>
                  <p>In summe although there be some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or pretext of divine right for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Vnity, wheresoever the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church should fix it, yet it appeareth
evidently by the Vniversall practice of
the Christian world in all ages, that there
is no Colour nor so much as a shadow of
divine right for all the other Branches of
papall power, and those vast Privileges of
the Roman Court. In the Councell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
they damned most of the Articles of
<hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> down right without hesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">Concil. Constan. Sess. 8.</note>
but when they came to the one and
fortieth Article (<hi>It is not necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to believe that the Roman Church is supreme
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40675:31"/>
among other</hi> Churches,) they paused and used
some reservation, <hi>It is an errour if by the
Roman Church he understood the Vniversall
Chureh, or a Generall Councell, or for as much
as he should deny the primacy of the Pope above
other particular Churches,</hi> Their judgement
is clear enough, they yeilded to the Pope
<hi>primatum</hi> not <hi>suprematum.</hi> A primacy of
Order not a supremacy of power; They
made him a <hi>beginning of Vnity to all particular
Churches,</hi> Yet subjected him to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Church; They looked upon him as
<hi>Highest Bishop, and Successour of St. Peter,</hi>
but they believed that a Generall Councell
had power to shake his Candlestick, and
remove it, if they found it expedient for
the good of Christendome.</p>
                  <p>If he come so far short of divine right
in his faire pretensions; by what right will
he seek to justify all his foule Vsurpations

That</hi> the Church of England in Henry the

upon probable reasons, <hi>not convincing
grounds. Which being the main question,
he should have fortifyed with proofes:

to carry it with confidence and clamours,</hi>
Does not all the World grant and hold that
King Henry denyed the Popes Supremacy:
Does not all the World see that the pretended
Church of England, stands now otherwise in
Order, to the Church of Rome, then it did in
Henry the sevenths dayes? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Was Papall power cast out before? was it not

What Papall power king <hi>Henry</hi> did cast
out, and what Papall power we hold out,

as are not to be gainsaid for matter of

                  <p>But before I gird my self to the worke,
it will not be amisse for the freeing of

                  <p>The second Circumstance is concerning

                     <hi>In the dayes of Henry the

eighth;</hi> And it is thus far true, that then
the breach was declared, and the War pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
to all the World: but this breach
was making long before Henry the eighth
was born; form the dayes of Pope <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi>
for about four hundred yeares. There
was no open hostility indeed between
the Court of Rome and the Church and
Kingdome of England: but they were still
upon their Gards, and still seeking to
gaine ground one upon another, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the decrees and Lawes and Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of those times. A breach in a strong
Tower is long making before the Walls
tumble visibly down; A Scathfire is long
kindling before it breake out in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

and forming before the certain
Symptoms there of doe appeare. We use
to say <hi>the second blow makes the fray,</hi> but the
first blow makes the Battery and the guilt.
All that time that they were forcing their
grosse usurpations upon us, the Breach was
making.</p>
                  <p>I have done wich his two Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">Every one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a Schism<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is not a formall Schtsmatick.</note>
The Substance of his Assumtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40675:33"/>
But before I grapple with him
about that, give me leave to lay down four
grounds or Considerations, so indifferent
that no rationall man can deny them. The
first is that every one who is involved mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
in a Schism is not a formall Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
no more then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hee that marrieth after
long expectation, believing and having
reason to believe that her former Husband
was dead, is a formall Adultresse, or then
he who is drawn to give divine Worship to
a creature by some misapprehension, yet
addressing his devotions to the true God,
is a formall Idolater. A man may be <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satus
voto</hi> (as <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> said) baptised in
his desire, and God Almighty doth accept
it: why may he not as wel Communicate
in his desire, and be accepted with God li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise?
If <hi>S. Austin</hi> say true of Heresy,
that.<note place="margin">Ezech. 162.</note> 
                     <hi>He who did not run into his Errour out of
his own overweening presumption, nor defends it
pertinaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>asly, but received it from his seduced pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and is carefull to search out the truth, and
ready to be corrected if he find it out, he is not to
be reputed among Hereticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is much more true of Schism, that he who
is involved in Schism through the errour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40675:34"/>
of his Parents or Predecessors, who seeketh
carefully for the Truth, and is prepared in
his mind to embrace it whensoever he finds
it, he is not to be reputed a Schismatick.
This very Bond of Vnity and preparation
of his mind to peace, is an implicit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
and abjuration of his Schism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

for ignorant Roman Catholicks, as for any
persons that I know, Who are hurried
hoodwinked in to erroneous tenets as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
points of faith, and Schismaticall
Practises, meerly by the authority, and to

courses of the Roman Court.</p>
                  <p>My second ground is this, God almighty
doth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

further then they doe either
imitate them or maintain them. Suppose
these calumnies had been truths which
some have belched forth against our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
that they had Sacrilegious or
other sinister ends, it signifieth nothing
to us, so long as wee neither justify

not over upright; and yet God himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40675:34"/>
his Reformation. Suppose any of
our Reformers have run into any excesses
or extremes, either in their expressions, or
perhaps in their actions, (it is a difficult
thing in great changes to observe a just
meane,) it may be out of humane frailty,
as Lycurgus out of hatred to drunkennes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as we practise the meane and maintain

us to thinke well of our Predecessors, and
Theology to look well to our selves.</p>

time in that case, but they prove not a right
<hi>ad semper,</hi> to doe it at all times The reason
is evident, Particular Acts may be done by
Connivence, or by speciall License; but a
Generall Prohibition implyeth a perpetual
right. As for instance I produce Negative
Presidents, both Generall Lawes against all
appeales to <hi>Rome,</hi> that no man may appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale
to the Pope without the Kings Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
and Particular Prohibitions out of the
Kings Courts, by form of ordinary Iustice,
against such and such Appeales or such
and such Sentences upon Appeales, This
argueth a perpetuall Right to forbid Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales,
whensoever it is Iudged expedient:
On the otherside he preduceth Presidents
of Particular Appeales to <hi>Rome,</hi> (which he
may doe of later Dayes, but for the First
eleven hundred years it was not so, This
Proveth onely the Kings License or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence
in such cases,<note place="margin">negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents prove more strongly then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve.</note> it doth not prove a
perpetuall Right, because two perpetuall
Rights contradictory one to another can
not be.</p>
                  <p>My fourth and last ground is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth nor any of our
Legislators, did ever endeavour to deprive
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> of the power of the

did ever challenge or endeavour to assume
unto them selves either the Key of order or

which they deprived the Pope of, all which

Necessary grounds, I come directly to the
Substance of his Assumption, and affirm,
That neither the King of <hi>England,</hi> nor
the Church of England, neither Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
nor Parliament, did breake his two
Necessary Bonds of Christian Vnity) or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, or any part of either of them.
But that the Very Breakers and Violaters
of these Rules were the Pope and Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> They did breake his Rule of Faith,
by adding new points to the Necessary
Doctrin of saving Truth, which were not
the Legaceyes of Christ and his Apostles,
nor delivered unto us by Universall
and perpetuall Tradition. The Pope and
Court of Rome did breake his second
Rule of Vnity in Discipline, by obtruding
their excessive and intolerable usurpations
vpon the Christian world, and particularly
upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as necessary
Conditions of their Communion.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth plainly by comparing that
which hath been said with his positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the
case, that after all his Bragges of <hi>undeniable
evidence</hi> and <hi>unquestionable certeinty.</hi> he hath
quite missed the question. We joine with
him in his rule of Faith, Wee oppose not
<hi>St. Peters</hi> Primacy of Order, and he him
self dare not say that <hi>St. Peter</hi> had a larger,
or more extended power then the rest of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40675:37"/>
his Fellow Apostles. And though wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
force our understandings to assent, that
after the death of <hi>S. Peter, Linus,</hi> or <hi>Cletus,</hi> or
<hi>Clemens,</hi> or <hi>Anacle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and had actuall Iurisdiction, over
him, who had as large a commission imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
from Christ as S. Peter himselfe, and
larger then any succeeding Romane Bishop
ever had: Yet to shew him how little
wee are concerned in it, and for his
clearer conviction, wee are willing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that they were his Superiours, and
give him leave to make all the advantage
of his second Rule which he can in this
cause.</p>
                  <p>And here if I regarded not the satisfaction
of my self and the Reader more then his
opposition, I might withdraw my hand
from the Table. But I am so great a Friend
of Ingenuity, that I will for once discharge
his Office, and shew the World demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and distinctly, what Branches of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
power were cast out of <hi>England</hi> by
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; upon which considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the weight of the whole Controversy
doth lye. For it is agreed between us,
that if it appeare <hi>by rigorous Evidence,</hi> that
all those Branches of Papall power, which
were renounced and cast out of <hi>England</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:40675:38"/>
by <hi>Henry</hi> the eight were grosse <hi>Vsurpattons,
then his renouncing was no eriminall Breach,
but a lawfull self enfranchisement.</hi> And by
undeniable consequence the Guilt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>chism
resteth upon them who made the Vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that is, the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> I
adde further upon the equity of my second
Ground; that although <hi>Henry</hi> the eight
had cast out something more then be ought,
yet if wee hold not out more then wee
ought, and be ready to admitt all which
ought to be admitted by us, then we are
innocent and free from the Guilt of Schism
and it resteth soly upon them, who either
will have more then their due or nothing.
Wheresoever the fault is, there the Guilt
of Schisme is: If the fault be single, the
Guilt is single,<note place="margin">What bran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches of Papal power were cast out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the 6.</note> if the fault be mutuall, the

                  <p>And for <hi>rigorous Evidence,</hi> There cannot
possibly be any Evidence more demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
what Papall power was cast out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
then the very Acts of Parliaments
themselves, by which it was cast out. Let
us view them all. The first Act made in the
Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, which hath any
referente to <hi>Rome,</hi> is the Act <hi>for holding
Plurality of Benefices against the lawes of the
land by dispensation from the Court of Rome,</hi>
making <hi>licenses for non Residence from the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40675:38"/>
Court of Rome to be voide, and the party who
procureth such Licenses for Pluralityes or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>residence
to forfeyt twenty pounds,</hi> and <hi>to lose the
profits of that Benefice which he holdeth by such
dispensation<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi> It were a pretty thing indeed,
if the Church and Kingdome should make
necessary lawes, and the Pope might give
them liberty to break them at his pleasure.<note place="margin">23. Hen. 8. cap. 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Act is, that <hi>No person shall be
cited out of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to reflect upon the Court of Rome: yet I

                  <p>The third Act is meerly declarative of
the law of the land, as well the Common
lawes as the Statute lawes, and grounded
wholy upon them, as by the View of the
Statute it self doth appeare. So it casteth
out no forraine power, but what the lawes
had cast out before.<note place="margin">24. Hen. 8. ca. 12.</note> The summe of it is
this, That all Causes <hi>Matrimoniall, Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,

doe all proclaime that this power is merely
Politicall. Christ gave <hi>St. Peter</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to preach, to baptise, to bind and

did he give him a Commission to give Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40675:41"/>
to grant Facultyes, to make Lawes,
to dispense with lawes to receive appeales,
to impose Tenths and First fruits in other
mens Kingdomes, whether the right owner
will or no?<note place="margin">Luke. 12. 14.</note> Who gave him power to take
other mens Subjects against their Wills to

more power then Christ himself did chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

                  <p>And now Reader take a Stand and looke
about thee; See among all these Branches
of Papall power which were cast out of
England, if thou caust find either of <hi>St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Keys,</hi> or his <hi>Primacy of Order,</hi> or his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Vnity,</hi> or anything which is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirituall, that hath no further influence
then merely the Court of Conscience.
No: but on the other side behold a pack of
the grossest Usurpations that ever were
hatched, and all so late, that is was above a
thousand years after the death of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> be
fore any of his pretended Privileges did see
the sun in <hi>England;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">21, Hen. 8. ca. 13.</note> observe them one by one.</p>
                  <p>The first is a <hi>power to dispense with English
Subjects for holding Plurality of Benifices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Lawes of England,</hi> And for <hi>non
Residents</hi> contrary to the Statutes of the
Realm. It had been much to have made
Merchandise of his own Decrees: but
to Dispense with the Lawes of the Land,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40675:42"/>
                     <hi>Non auderet haec facere Viduae mulieri.</hi> He
durst not doe so much to a poore widow
woman, as he did to the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of England, to dispense with their La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wes
at his pleasure. It is but vain for the
Flower of our Kingdome to assemble aud
consult about healthfull Lawes: if a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer
have power to dispense with the
breach of them as it seemeth good in his
Eyes, They might as well sit them down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietly
&amp; fall to pilling of rushes,</p>
                  <p>The second Branch of Papall power
which was Excluded out of England, was
the Popes Iudiciary power. I doe not mean
in Controversies of Faith when he is in the
Head of a councell:<note place="margin">Conc. Basil. Sess. 16 in revoc bullae 3.</note> Yet <hi>Eugeniur</hi> the fourth
confesseth that <hi>in points of Faith the sentence of
the councel is rather to be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the sentence
of the Pope.</hi> But I mean in points of <hi>meum</hi> and
<hi>tuum,</hi> not onely in some rare cases between
Bishop and Bishop, which had been lesse
intollerable, and had had more shew of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
but generally in all cases promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
as if the whole nation wanted either
discretion or Law to determin their own
differences at home,<note place="margin">24. Hen. 8 cap 12.</note> without the help of the
Roman Courtier tosqueese their purses. It
was not <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, but the old Lawes
of England which gave them this blow
against Appeales to Rome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:40675:42"/>The third Branch of papall power which
was turned out of England by Henry the
eighth was the Popes Legislative power,
especially in making new Heresies by his
own Authority, and for his own Interest,
prescribing the punishment, as if all the
world were his Subjects. Mr. Serjeant may
be pleased to inform himself better, that
the Popes Canons and decretalls never had
since the First Conversion of <hi>England</hi> the
force or power of Lawes in <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they were received by the Nation,
nor then any further then they were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Branch is the Soveraign pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
of the English Church with all
those rights aud appurtenances which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
thereunto, as to convocate the clergy,
and Dissolve their Assembly, To exempt
their persons from secular Iudgement, To
have the Disposition of Ecclesiasticall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnityes
and the Custodium of them in the
Vacancy. But these things are so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ious,
to all those who are acquainted with
the Ecclesiasticall Customes of <hi>England,</hi>
that there can be no manner of Qnestion of
it. The Convocation was alwayes called
and dissolved by the absolute and precise
Mandate of the King to the Arch-Bishop;
Yea even when the Arch-Bishop was the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40675:43"/>
Popes legate, and when he might have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged,
another right, if the Pope had had
any pretense. The temporaltyes of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
in the Vacancy were ever sÃ¨ised
into the hands of the King, untill he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out his Writ of <hi>Manum amoveas,</hi> or <hi>Oster
la main:</hi> If ordinary Patrons did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in due time to a benefice, it devolved
to the Ordinary, and from him to the King,
there it stayed, <hi>Nullum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth Privilege was the receiving of
Tenths and First fruits, which were a
late encroachment of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
upon the Clergy, without any just ground,
and upon that score were condemned in
the Councells of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile,</hi> and
now were seised into the Kings hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the discharge of the Ecclesiasticall
Burthens of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>The last perqnisire whith the Pope lost
was all the profits of his Court, by Bulls,
and Palls, and Pensions, and Reservations,
and Exemptions, and Licenses, and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
and Consirmations, and Pardons,
and Indulgences, and an hundred other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary
Artifices practised in his Court at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and in his Legantine Courts and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatures
abroad. But this abuse is so foule,
that the Popes own selected Cardinalls doe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40675:43"/>
cryshame upon it, as much as wee, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down

so the contrary practice would bring much

                  </p>
                  <p>These are the reall differences between

of England concerning the papacy.<note place="margin">The true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</note>

                  <p>The maine quaestious are or may be reduced
to four heads. The first grand quaestion
is concerning the Soveraignty of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Church in respect of the externall
Regiment thereof. This hath four sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Branches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40675:44"/>First who is the right Patron of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Church under God, the King or the
Pope? Secondly, who hath power to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
Synods of the Kings subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
England, The King or the Pope? Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly,
whether the Pope have justly imposed
new Oaths upon the Arch Bishops and Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops?
fourthly whether Tenths and first
fruits in England be due to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second question is concerning the
Popes legislative power. Whether the
Canon law or the decretalls have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
esteemed binding lawes in <hi>England</hi>
or ought to be so esteemed, except they
be received by the English Nation, and
metriculated among our lawes.</p>
                  <p>The third is concerning his judiciary
power, Whether the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> can
receive Appeales from <hi>England</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
lawes of that Land, and send for
whom he pleaseth to <hi>Rome?</hi> 2. Whether
Bulls and Excommunications from <hi>Rome</hi>
can be lawfully executed in <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the King give leave for the execution
of them? 3. Whether the Pope can send
Legates and set up Legantine Courts in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
by the Ancient lawes of that Realme.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Difference is concerning
the popes dispensative power, whether the
Pope can dispense with the lawes of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40675:44"/>

A strange presumtion in a Soveraign
Prince, if you marke it well, to hold his
subjects hands within his Hands, whilest
he was swearing his Allegiance;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40675:46"/>
But the maine exception was the Homage
or Oath of Fidelity it self. And was it not

swearing of Fidelity to their Native Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
whom the Bishops of Rome intended
to exempt from his Iurisdiction, aud to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
them turn Subjects to themselves: as
they did in a great part effect it very short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

men.</hi> Were they so indeed? Here is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Confession of the Popes own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
Keeper.</p>
                  <p>Indeed at the first whilest they were rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the King of the Iewells of his Crown,
they preached up nothing but free Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:<note place="margin">Mat. Par. an 1229.</note>
but after they had onte seised their
prey, they changed their once forthwith
to <hi>Dei &amp; Apostolicae Sedis Graria, By
the Grace of God and the Apostolique See:
Or ex plenitudine Ecclefiasticae potestatis out of
the Fulnesse of our Ecclesiasticall power.</hi> And
when this Bell had rung out a while, <hi>Egypt</hi>

then our Native Country did with Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and reservations, and Pensions, with all
the <g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>hellish arts of Sublimated Simony.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40675:46"/>
Then our best dignityes and Benefices were
filled with Strangers (who could not speak
an English word, nor did ever tread upon
English ground,) dayly more and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
these well chosen Pastors who knew
how to sheare their Flocks, though they
did not know how to feed them,<note place="margin">Mat. Par. m. Hen. 3. an. 1345.</note> received

who should thinke the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
did not lick their own Fingers.</p>
                  <p>There remaineth but one thing to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
to stick the Guilt of this intolerable V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation

that is to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ew that the Investiture of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
was the undoubted right of the

                  <p>This is as cleare as the Sun, both in our

records if I had the meanes to producethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
and also in our ancient Lawes published

of the fundamentall law of the land.</p>
                  <p>First for our Histories <hi>Gervasius Dorober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis</hi>
relateth that <hi>Lanfrank</hi> desired of
<hi>William</hi> the conquerer the Patronage of the
Abby of <hi>S. Austin:</hi> but the King answered.
<hi>Se velle omnes baculos pastorales in manu tenere</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:40675:47"/>
That <hi>he would keep all the Crosier staffes</hi> (that
is the Investitures) <hi>in his own hand.</hi> The same
is testified <hi>Anselm</hi> himself by one whose
Authority cannot be doubted of, <hi>He</hi> (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm)
<hi>after the manner and Example of his
Predecessor was inducted according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Land,<note place="margin">Eadm. lib 1. pag. 20.</note> and did Homage to the King</hi>
(homo Regis factus est) <hi>as Lanfranke</hi> (his

<hi>in his time had done.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eadm. lib. 1. pag. 18.</note> And the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Investiture is related, how the
Bishops pulled him, and haled him as it
were by violence to the Kings bedside <hi>(Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Rufus)</hi> where he lay sick, and helped
to thrust the Crosier staffe by force into his
hand. Yet all that time, though Anselm
had many other Pretenses, he had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
against Investiture by a Lay hand:
but shortly after it grew to such an height,
(and <hi>Anselm</hi> was the chief Stickler in it)
that <hi>William</hi> the Agent of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
First protested openly to Pope <hi>Paschall,
Whatsoever is said on this side or on that,<note place="margin">Eadm. lib. 3. pag. 73.</note> I
would have all men here present to know, that
my Lord the King of</hi> England, <hi>will not suffer
the losse of his Investitures for the losse of his
Kingdome.</hi> To whom Pope <hi>Paschall</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as resolutely, but not so justly, <hi>Know thou
I speake it before God; that</hi> Paschall <hi>the Pope
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40675:47"/>
will not suffer him to keep them without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no not for the redemtion of his head.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither was this the case of</hi> Anselm <hi>or</hi>

of the same author,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ead. mer. in praefat. pag. 2.</note> To conclude, the very cause
<hi>(of the difference between the King and
Anselm)</hi> seemed a new thing <hi>(or innovation)</hi> to
this our age, and unheard of to the English
from the time that the Normans began to Reign,
(that I say not sooner,) For from the time that
<hi>William</hi> the Norman conquered that Land, no
Bishop or Abbat was made before <hi>Anselm,</hi> who
did not first doe Homage to the King, and from

Kings Court did conferre all dignities ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40675:48"/>
onely for Many yeares but for many Ages,</hi>
king Edgar did grant to the monkes of Glastenbury
the free Election of their Abbat for ever: but he
reserved to him self and to his Heirs the power
to invest the Brother elected by the tradition of the
Pastorall staffe. <hi>Thus for our histories now
for our Lawes where of I shall need to cite
but three.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The First is the Statute or <hi>Assise</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall</hi>
of <hi>Clarendon</hi> containing part of the
ancient Liberties and Customes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme,
made in the Generall assembly of the
Kingdome, King, Bishops, Peers, to which
they gave both their oathes assertory for the
truth of it, and Promissory for performance
of it. The fourth Custome was this, that
<hi>when an Arch Bishoprick Bishoprick Abbacy
or Priory did fall void, the Election was to be
made by such of the Principall Dignitaryes or
Members of that respective Church which was
to be filled as the king should call together for
that purpose, with the kinges consent, in the kings
own Chappell. And there the person elected
was to doe his Homage and Fealty to the King
as to his Liege Lord,</hi> The Pope had no part to
Act, neither to collate, nor consent, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
nor Institute, nor induct, nor ordeine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second Law is the Statute of</hi> Carlile
<hi>made in the time of</hi> Edward <hi>the First.<note place="margin">the right to give Bishop-Ricks in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d is the Kings</note> The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40675:48"/>
summe of it is this, That</hi> the king is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of all Bishopricks, and ought to have the
Custody of them in the Vacancyes, and the right
of Patronage to present to them. And that the
Bishop of Rome usurping the Right of Patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
giveth them to aliens. That this tendeth to
the annullation of the State of holy Church, to the
Disinheriting of Kings, and the Destruction of
the Realm. <hi>And they ordained in full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that</hi> this is an Oppression <hi>(that is as
much as an entroachment or Vsurpation)</hi> and
should not be suffered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third law was made in the 15th yeare
of</hi> Edward <hi>the third, called the Statute
of</hi> Provisors, <hi>wherein they affirm that</hi> Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were First granted by the Kings Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
upon a certain form or Condition to demand
Licenfe of the King to chuse, and after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
to have his Royall Assent. Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
not being kept, the thing ought by reason
to resort to his First nature. <hi>And there fore
conclude, that</hi> in case Reservation Collation
or Provision be made by the Court of Rome of any
Arch Bishoprick &amp;c. Our Soveraign Lord the
King and his Heirs shall have and enjoy the
Collations for the same time to the said Arch
Bishopricks Bishopricks and other dignityes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
which be of his Aavowre, such as his
Progenitors had before the free Election was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40675:49"/>
granted. <hi>They tell the King plainly that</hi>
the Right of the Crown of England and the Law
of the Land is such, that the King is bound to make
remedyes and Lawes, against such mischiefes.
<hi>And they acknowledge</hi> that he is AdvowÃ©e
Paramont immediate of all Churches, Prebends,
and other Benifices which are of the Advowry
of holy Church. <hi>That is as much as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Patron of the Church; Where no
Election can be made without the Kings</hi>
CongÃ© d' Estire <hi>or leave antecedent, nor stand
good without his subsequent consent; it is
all one as if the Crown did Collate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come next to the second Branch of the
First Question,<note place="margin">the right to conv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocate English Synods is the Kings.</note> about the Patronage of the
Church, Who hath power to Convocate
and Dissolve Ecclesiasticall Assemblyes? and
whether the Crown or the Pope have usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
one upon another in this particular? I
cannot tell whether <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth or <hi>Paul</hi>
the third, did mistake more about that Aiery
title of the head of the english church <hi>Henry</hi>

That is the Politicall head. This truth

                     <note place="margin">Eadm. l. 5. p. 120.</note> This was the ground of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the English Bishops to the Pope. That
<hi>the Church of</hi> Canterbury <hi>might not be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of its dignity in his times,</hi> and that <hi>he would
neither Diminish it him self, nor suffer it to be
diminished.</hi> As appeareth by the Popes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
in his answer.</p>
                  <p>But to come up close to the Difference,
The Question is not whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>he Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> have Authority to call Synods. He
is a Bishop, a Metropolitan, a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
a Prince in his own Dominions.
As a Bishop he may Convocate his Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
As a Metropolitan his Province; As a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40675:50"/>
Patriarch his Patriarchate, under the pain
of Ecclesiasticall Censure, more or lesse
compulsory according to that Degree of
Coactive power which hath been indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to him in these Distinct Capacities by
former Soveraigns: And as a Prince he
may convocate his Subjects under Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
paines. The more these two powers
are united and complicated, the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
is the Censure. And therefore our
kings would have their Bishops denounce
spirituall paines also against the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of their great Charters. Spirituall
paiues are more heauy then Politicall, but
Politicall most commonly are more speedy
then Spirituall. And more certain; Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
paines doe not follow an erring Key,
but Politicall doe.</p>
                  <p>Neither will I dispute at praesent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by his reputed <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Order</hi> or <hi>Beginning</hi> of Unity may
lawfully call an Oecumenicall or Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Councell, by power purely Spirituall,
which consists rather in Advise then in
Mandates properly so called, or in Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of Courtesy not Coactive in the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Court of the Church; considering
the Division and Subdivision of the ancient
Empire, and the present Distractions of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40675:51"/>
Christendome, it seemeth not altogether in
convenient. Wee see the Primitive Fathers
did Assemble Synods and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ake Canons,
before there were any christian Emperours,
but that was by aurhority meerly spirituall;
they had no coactive power to compell any
man against his Will. The Vttermost
they could doe was to separate him from
their Communion, and to leave him to the
Comming or Iudgement of Christ. Let him
be <hi>Anathema mar an atha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The true Controversy then is this,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 22.</note> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by his Legates, have
Coactive power in the exteriour Court,
to Convocate Synods of English Subjects
in <hi>England,</hi> when he will, where he will,
whom he will, without their Consents, and
without the leave of the Soveraign Prince
or King of <hi>England,</hi> The Case being thus
stated determineth it self. Where should the
Pope appoint a place of meeting in <hi>England</hi>
without the Leave of the King of <hi>England?</hi>
Wee see by often experience, that if the
Pope have a desire to summon a Councell
in <hi>Italy,</hi> within the Dominions of another
Soveraign Prince or Republick, although
they be of his own Communion; he
must First aske leave, and obtein leave,
before he can tell how to doe it; Or how
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40675:51"/>
should he pretend to any Coactive power
in <hi>England</hi> without the Kings grant or
leave, where the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> and
all Coactive force is legally invested
in the King. Thus for point of right.</p>
                  <p>Now for matter of Fact, First I doe
utterly deny that any Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by
his own Authority did Convocate any Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
in the Brittish Island during the First
eleven hundred yeares, Or preside in any
by his Legates, Or confirm them by his
Authority. If he be no table to produce so
much as one instance to the Contrary, he
may cry guilty to the Vsurpation where
of he is accused<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and hold his peace forever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I doe confesse that after ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hundred yeares, The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>
taking advantage of our civill combustions,
and prostituting the reputation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
See to their temporall ends, did by
the leave of our Kings, (not otherwise,)
sometimes call Synods in <hi>England,</hi> and
preside in them. The first Synod held in
<hi>England</hi> by any of the Popes Legats was at
<hi>London,</hi> in the yeare 1125. by <hi>Ioannes Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensis,<note place="margin">Gerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>robor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis.</note>
Which moved</hi> England <hi>into no smal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
to see a thing till then unheard of in the
Kingdome of</hi> England, <hi>A Priest sitting president
upon an high throne above Arch Bishops, Bishops,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40675:52"/>
bats &amp;c.</hi> But remember my third ground
or Consideration of the difference betwen
affirmative and negative Presidents. All
which this proveth, is that the King did
give leave or connive at that time<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But it
doth not prove, it cannot prove a right
to doe the same at other times when the
King contradicteth it.</p>
                  <p>Further wee ought to take notice that
there is a greate deale of difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
an Ordinary Synod and an English
Convocation. Although in truth our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
be Synods; So called from one
word in the Kings writ to Summon them,
<hi>Convocari facias.</hi> All the Clergy of the
Realm were not present at an ordinary Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod:
but all the whole Clergy, of the
Kingdome were present at a Convocation,
either in their Persons, or by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
sufficiently authorised. Secondly,
the absent Clergy had no such Obligation
to the Acts of a Papall Synod, as they had
to the Acts of a royall Convocation, <hi>sub
Hypotheca bonorum omnium, under the Caution
or Pledge of all their Goods and Estates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly to drive the naile home, and to
demonstrate clearly the Grossenesse of this
Papall usurpation; it remaineth onely to
shew that by the Ancient Lawes of <hi>England</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:40675:52"/>
the calling of Convocations or Synods,
belonged properly to the King, not to the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> or his Legates. And first
by reason. By the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> more
ancient then the Popes intrusion, no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Legat could enter into the Kingdome
withont the Kings leave, nor continue in
it longer then he had his License, as wee
shall see hereafter, and therefore they could
not convocate any Synods nor doe any
Synodicall Act without the Kings leave.
Secondly by Records of the English Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
itself, that <hi>the Convocations of the
Clergy of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>are, alwayes
have been, and ought to be Assembled by the
Kings Writ</hi> Anno 1532.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by the Form of the Writt,
which hath ever been the same in all succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Ages, constantly directed from the
King to the English Arch Bishops for their
distinct Provinces, The very Form speakes
it English sufficiently; <hi>For certain difficult
and urgent Businesses concerning the defence and
security of the English Church, and the peace
tranquility, publik good and defence of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Subjects, Wee command and require
you by that Allegiance and Love which you owe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Bishops of your Province, Deanes and Priors of
Cathedrall Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the whole
Clergy of your diocesse and Province, to meet

issue from the King for the dissolution,
<hi>Wee command you that you dissolve or cause to

Lastly by the concurring Testimonyes of
all our Historiographers, That all the space
of time of eleven hundred yeares, wherein
the Popes did neither call Councells, nor
Preside in them, nor Confirm them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

And particularly that <hi>Theodore</hi> Arch-Bishop

times, when Kings convocated Synods of

those things to be purely spirituall
which are truly Politicall, as the Patronage
of Churches and all Coactive power in the

cases the subject must desert the one or the

other and either suffer justly as a Traitour

is true, a Clerk may sweare allegiance to

full Canons oblige without an Oath. And
all that Coactive power which a Bishop
hath, is derived from the Prince and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the Prince.</p>
                  <p>The question then is not whether a Pastor
may enjoine his Flock to abstaine from an

The question is not whether Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
men transgressing of the Canons, ought
to be tryed by Canonicall Iudges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Canons, especially in the first
instance. For by the Law of <hi>England</hi> the

whether the Pope by any Act or decree of

                  <p>Wee have viewed the spoile Committed

Lawes of the Pope, (which they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,)
but as Graces aud Privileges gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Kings of England, aud there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they excluded from benefit of Clergy
such sort of delinquents as they thought fit,<note place="margin">6. H. 4. cap. 2.</note>
as <hi>Proditores,</hi> Traitours against the Person
of the King, <hi>Insidiatores viarum,</hi> such as lay

in wait to doe mischief upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes;
<hi>Depopulatores agrorum,</hi> such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated

Lawes that ever they made, are the Statutes

for siding with the Bishop of Rome
in his Vsurpations, even to the forfeiture
of their Goods and Lands, their Losse of
their Liberty, and the putting them out of
the Kings Protection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our Lawes doe acknowledge
every where that Homage and allegiance
is alwayes due to the King from all Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen
what soever. <hi>Edward</hi> the first <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined

no Fidelity or allegiance which is due to

Clergy man or Lay man; but the just
contrary that they are bound by their

Pope, for the redresse of these and such

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly these Papall Oaths doe necessarily
suppose a Voiage to Rome, either to take
the Oath there, or if the Oath was sent
them into <hi>England,</hi> one Clause in the

                     </gap>was, that they should come to Rome
in person to receive the Popes Commands
within a prefixed time. But this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to the Lawes of England,
which allow no Subject Clergiman or

If Christ be still crucifyed between two
Thieves, it is between an old overgrown

the Splendour of Religion, and the other

like Samsons Foxes locke contrary wayes,
but both of them have Firebrands at their
tailes: both of them prate of Heaven alto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether,
both of them have their hearts nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Earth. On the one side, if it had
not been for the Avaricious Practises of
the Roman Court, the Papacy might have
bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> a great advantage to the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> world
in point of Order and Vnity, at least it had

these will not suffer an <hi>Eugenius</hi> an <hi>Adrian</hi>

On the otherside these Counterfeit
Zelots do but renew the Policy of the two
old <hi>Sicilian</hi> Gluttons, to blow their Noses
in the dishes, that they might devour the
meate alone: that is cry down Church
Revenues as Superstitious and Dangerous,
because they gape after them themselves. If
it were not for these two factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, wee might
hope to see a reconciliation. Self interest
and self profit are both the procreating and
conserving cause of Disunion.</p>

an old Bishop abundantly, without
preying upon the poore Clergy for
Tenths and First fruits, and God knowes
how many other waies? The Revennes of

                  <p>The next step was to impose Tenths
upon the Clergy, not in perpetuity or as a
certain Revenue due to the Papacy, but for
a fixed number of yeares, as a stock for the
Defence of Christendome against the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

First fruits began to be exacted, not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

the Rights and Libertyes of the Gallican
Church. The Other, <hi>The Defence of the

impose Pensions in France upon any Benifices
having Cure of Soules, Nor upon any other,
but according to the Canons &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fourteenth Liberty is,</hi> Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

                  <p>This is the brief summe of those Liberties

But then those Canons are the Lawes of the
Church, not of the Pope: As those Canons in
the Acts of the Apostles were the Lawes of

Then their Lawes have no Coactive Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

All exteriour coactive power is from

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:40675:66"/>The Controversy is then about new up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
Papall Lawes either made at Rome
(such are the decretalls of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth,
<hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth and
succeeding Popes:) Or made in <hi>England</hi> by
Papall Legates, as <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Othobone;</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Pope or his Legates, have power
to make any such Lawes to bind English
Subjects, and compell them to obey them
against their Wills, the King of <hi>England</hi>
contradicting it. The first time that ever
any Canon of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any
legislative Legate of his, was attempted to
be obtruded upon the King or Church of
<hi>England,</hi> was eleven hundred yeares after
Christ. The first Law was the Law against
taking Investitures to Bishopricks from
a Lay hand. And the first Legate that
ever presided in an English Synod was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes
Cremensis,</hi> of both which I have spoken
formerly. Observe Reader and be
astonished, if thou hast so much faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, That the Pope should pretend to a
legislative power over British and English
Subjects by divine right, and yet never
offer to put it in execution for above eleven
hundred yeares.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth now to prove evidently that
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth by his Statute made for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40675:66"/>
that purpose, did not take away from the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> any Privilege which he and
his Predecessors had held by Inheritance
from St. Peter, and been peaceably possessed
of for fifteen hundred yeares. But on the
contrary, that eleven hundred yeares after
St. Peter was dead, the Bishops of Rome
did first invade the right of the Crown of
England, to make Lawes for the externall
Regiment of the Church, which the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had enjoyed
peaceably, untill the dayes of <hi>William Rufus,
nemine contradicente.</hi> And that the Kings
Lawes were evermore acknowledged to be
true Lawes and obligatory to the English
Subjects: but that the Popes decrees were
never esteemed to be binding Lawes in
England, except they were incorporated in
to our Lawes, by the King and Church or
Kingdome of England. Whence it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
by irrefragable consequence, that
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth was not the Schismatick
in this particular: but the Pope and those
that maintain him, or adhere to him in his
Vsurpations.</p>
                  <p>First, for the Kings right to make Lawes,
not onely concerning the outward Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
of the Church, but even co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerning the Keys
of Order and jurisdiction, so far as to oblige
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40675:67"/>
them who are trusted with that power by
the Church, to doe their dutyes, it is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to every one who hath but cast his Eyes
upon our English Lawes, that to bestow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
on proving it, were to bring Owles to
<hi>Athens,</hi> Their Lawes are extant made in all
Ages, concerning faith and good Manners,
Heresy, Holy Orders, the Word, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Bishops, Priests, Monkes, the Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Revenues of Holy Church, Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Divorces, Simony, The Pope, his Sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
his oppressions and usurpations, Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions,
Appeales from Eeclesiasticall judges,
and generally all things which are of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Cognifance; and this in those times
which are acknowledged by the Romanists
themselves to have been Catholick. More
then this, they inhibited the Popes own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<hi>to attempt to decree any thing contrary to the
Kings Crown and dignity,</hi> And if they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the decrees of the Popes Legates,<note place="margin">Ma. Par. an 1237. Flor. wigorn. an 1227.</note> they
<hi>confirmed them by their Royall Authority,</hi> and so
incorporated them into the Body of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the Popes decrees never
had the force of Lawes in <hi>England</hi> without
the Confirmation of the King, Witnesse the
decrees of the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> as they
are commonly called: but it is as cleare as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40675:67"/>
the day to any one who readeth the eleve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>th,
the six and fortieth, and the one and sixtieth
Chapters, that they were not made by the
Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> but some time after;
perhaps not by <hi>Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t</hi> the third, but by some
succeeding Pope. For the author of them
doth distinguish himself expresly from the
Councell of Lateran, <hi>It was well provided in
the Councell of Lateran</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But because that
statute is not observed in many Churches, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the foresaid statute doe adde</hi> &amp;c. Again,
<hi>It is known to have been prohibited in the councel,
of Lateran, &amp;c. But we inhibiting the same moro
strongly &amp;c.</hi> How soever, they were the Popes
decrees, but never were received as Lawes
in <hi>England,</hi> as wee see evidently by the third
Chapter, That the Goods of Clergimen
being convicted of Heresy be forfeited to
the Church, That <hi>all Officiers Secular and
Ecclesiasticall should take an Oath at their
Admission, into their Office, to their power to
purge their Territories from Heresy,</hi> That, <hi>if a
Temporall Lord did neglect, being admonished by
the Church, to purge his Lands from Heresy,
he should be excommunicated,</hi> And <hi>if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
to satisfy within a yeare, the Pope should
absolve his Subjects from their Allegiance.</hi>
And by the three and fortieth Chapter,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40675:68"/>
That <hi>no Ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>siasticall person be compelled to
swear allegiance to a Lay man.</hi> And by the
six and fortieth Chapter, that <hi>Ecclesiasticall
persons be free from taxes.</hi> Wee never had any
such Lawes, all Goods forfeited in that kind
were ever confiscated to the King; We
never had any such Oaths, Every one is to
answer for himself; We know no such
power in the Pope to absolve Subjects from
their allegiance in our Law; With us, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen
did ever pay Subsidies and taxes as
well as lay men. This is one Liberty which
England hath, not to admit of the Popes
Lawes unlesse they like them.</p>
                  <p>A second Liberty of <hi>England</hi> is to reject
the Popes Lawes in plaine termes.<note place="margin">20. H. 3. c. 9.</note> The
Pope made a Law for <hi>the Legitimation of
Children borne afore Matrimony as well as
those borne in Matrimony,</hi> The Bishops
moved the Lords in Parliament, that <hi>they
would give their consent to the Common Order of
the Church:</hi> But <hi>all the Earles and Barons
answered with one voice, that they would not
change the Lawes of the Realm, which hitherto
had been used and approved.</hi> The Popes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislation
could not make a Law in England,
without the concurrence of the three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Kingdome: and they liked their
own old Lawes better then the Popes new
Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:40675:68"/>A Third Liberty of England, is to give a
legislative Interpretation to the Popes
Lawes, which the Pope never intended.
The Bishop of Rome by a constitution
made at the Councell of Lions, <hi>excluded
Bigamists (men twice Married) from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of Clergy,</hi> that is, that should Marry
the second time <hi>de futuro:</hi> But the Parliament
made an Act that the constitution should
be understood on this wise, that <hi>whether they
were Bigamists before the constitution, or after,
they should not be delivered to the Prelates, but
Iustice should be executed upon them as upon
other Lay people. Ejus est Legem Interpretari
cujus est condere.</hi> They that can give a
Law a new sense, may abrogate it if they
please.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Liberty of England is to call
the Popes Lawes <hi>Vsurpations, Encroachments,
Mischiefs, contrary to, and destructive of the</hi>
Municipall <hi>Lawes of the Realme, derogatory
to the Kings Regality:</hi> And to punish such
of their Subjects as should pursue them,
and obey them, with <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> with
<hi>Confiscation of their Goods and Lands,</hi> with
<hi>outlawing them,</hi> and <hi>putting them out of the Kings
Protection.</hi> Witnesse all those noble Lawes
of <hi>Provisors</hi> and <hi>Premunire,</hi> Which we may
truely call the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40675:69"/>
preserved it from being swallowed up in
that vast Gulfe of the Roman Court;<note place="margin">25. E. 1. 27. E. 3. 2. H. 4 cap. 3. &amp; 4. 7. H. 4. cap 6.</note> made
by <hi>Edward</hi> the first, <hi>Edward</hi> the third;
<hi>Richard</hi> the second, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.
All those Collations, and Reservations, and
Provisions, and Privileges, and Sentences,
which are condemned in those Statutes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
were all grounded upon the Popes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>Lawes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and Bulls, and Decrees, which our Ancestors
entertained as they deserved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Othobon</hi> the Popes Legate in <hi>England;</hi> by
the Command of <hi>Vrban</hi> the fifth made a
Constitution for the endowment of Vicars
in Appropriations, but it prevailed not:
whereas our Kings by two Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did easily effect it. No Ecclesiastical
Act is impossible to them who have a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
power:<note place="margin">15. R. 2. cap 6. 4. H. 4 cap 12.</note> but many Ecclesiasticall
Acts were beyond the Sphere of the Popes
Activity in <hi>England.</hi> The King could make
a spirituall Corporation; but the Pope
could not. The King could exempt from
the Iurisdiction of the Ordinary; but
the Pope could not. The King could
Convert Seculars into Regulars; but the
Pope could not.<note place="margin">2. H. 4. cap 3. &amp; 4.</note> The King could grant
the Privilege of the Cistercians; but the
Pope could not. The King could Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
Churches; but the Pope could not.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40675:69"/>
Our Lawes never acknowledged the Popes
plenitude of Ecclesiasticall power,<note place="margin">2. H. 4. c. 3 &amp; 4.</note> which
was the ground of his legislation. <hi>Euphemius</hi>
objected to <hi>Gelasius,</hi> that the Bishops of

                     <hi>ab uno non potuisset damnari. Gelasius</hi>
answered, that he was condemned by the
Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and that <hi>his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>

not the Author of a new.</hi> This was all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Bishops of Rome did challenge, to be
Executors of Ecclesiasticall Lawes, and not
single Law makers. I acknowledge that in
his Epistle to the Bishops of <hi>Dardania,</hi> he
attributeth much to the Bishops of Rome
wich a Councell; but it is not in making
new Lawes or Canons, but in executing old,
as in the case of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome.

himself in the affaires of the Papacy,
that it should have no further influence
upon his subjects then he thought fit. He
who would not suffer any man to receive
the Popes letters without his leave, would
much less suffer them to receive the Popes
lawes without leave. And in his prescript
to Remigius Bishop of Lincolne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                        </gap>ave judged,
that the Episcopall</hi> (or Ecclesiasticall) <hi>lawes
which have bene of force untill my time in the
Kingdome of England, being not well constituted
according to the praecepts of the holy Canons,
should be amended in the common assembly, and
with the Counsaile of my Arch-Bishops and the
rest of the Bishops and Abbats, and all the
Princes of my Kingdome.</hi> He needed not
the helpe of any forreine Legislation, for
amending Ecclesiasticall Canons and the
externall regiment of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now let us see whether the Libertyes of
France be the same with our English Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.
The second Liberty is this, <hi>The
Spirituall Authority and power of the Pope is
not absolute in Franee</hi> (if it be not absolute
then it is not singly Legislative,) <hi>but limited
and restreined by the Canons and ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
of the Church.</hi> If it be lim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ted by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40675:70"/>
Ancient Canons, then it hath no power to
abrogate Ancient Canons by new Canons.
Their ancient Canons are their Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Lawes, as well as ours, and those must
be <hi>received in that Kingdome.</hi> They may be
excellent Advisers without reception: but
they are no Lawes without publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
Canons are no Canons either in
England or in France, further then they are
received.</p>
                  <p>The third Liberty is, <hi>No Command what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
of the Pope</hi> (Papall decrees are his
chief Commands) <hi>can free the French Clergy,
from their Obligation to obey the Commands of
their Soveraign.</hi> But if Papall power could
abrogate the ancient Lawes of France, it
did free their Clergy, from their Obedience
to their Soveraign Prince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sixteenth Liberty is,</hi> The Courts of
Parliament have power to declare null and
voide the Popes Bulls, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they are found contrary
to the Liberties of the French Church, or the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
Royall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The twentieth Liberty,</hi> The Pope cannot
exempt any Church, Monastery, or Ecclesiasticall
Body from the jurisdiction of their Ordinary, nor
erect Bishopricks into Arch Bishopricks, nor unite
them, nor divided them, without the Kings license.
<hi>England and France as touching their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
walk hand in hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:40675:71"/>To conclude, the Popes legislative power in
England was a grosse Vsurpation, and was
suppressed before it was well formed. But
they are affraid of the old Rule, <hi>Breake
ice in one place and it will crack in more.</hi> If
they did confesse one Errour, they should
be suspected of many; If their Infallibility
was lost, all were gone: And therefore they
resolve to bear it out with head and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and in place of disclaiming a single
power to make Ecclesiasticall Lawes, and
to give them a coactive obligation in exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Courts, they challenge a power to
the Pope (some say ordinarily, others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily;
some say directly other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,)
to make and abrogate Politicall
Lawes throughout Christendome, against
the Will of Soveraign Princes. They who
seem most moderate and Cautelous among
them are bad enough, and deserve right
well to have their workes inserted into the
Rebells Catechisme,<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. l. 5. c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>If a Civill Law be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Soules of Subjects and the Prince will
not abrogate it, If another Civill Law be health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Soules of the Subjects, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Prince will not enact it; The Pope as a
Spirituall Prince may abrogate the one, and
establish the other. For Civil power is inferiour,
and consequently subject to Spirituall power.</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:40675:71"/>
And, <hi>The Ecclesiastick Republ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ck ought to be
perfect and sufficient to atteine its end: But the
power to dispose of things Temporall is necessary
to atteine Spirituall ends.</hi> And, <hi>It is not lawfull
to chuse an Infidel or Hereticall Prince, but it is
the same danger or dammage to chuse one who
is no Christian, and to tolerate one who is no
Christian, and the determination of the Question
whether he be fit to be tolerated or not, belongs
to the Pope.</hi> In good time. From these
premisses, wee may well expect a necessary
Collusion. Who ever see such a Rope of
Sand, so incoherent to it self, and consisting
of such Heterogeneous parts, composed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
of mistakes? Surely a man may
conclude that either <hi>nocte pinxit,</hi> The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Author painted this Cypresse tree in
the night, or he hath a pittifull penurious
Cause, that will afford no better proofes,
But I hope the quarrel is dead or dying, and
with it much of that Animosity which it
helped to raise in the World. At least I
must doe my Adversaryes in this cause that
right, I find them not Guilty of it. Let it
dye and the memory of it be extinguished
for ever and ever.</p>

here of that great Controversy between

not find them so well agreed at home, who
this Iudge is. All say it is the Church,
but in Determining what Church it is, they
differ as much as they and wee. Some say
it is the Essentiall Church by reception,

is infallibly true; Others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ay it is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative

Church, that it is the Pope; Others say it
is the Virtuall Church and the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Church together, that is the Pope
with a Generall Councell; Lastly, others
say it is the Pope with any councell, either
Generall, or Patriarchall, or Provinciall, or
(I thinke) his College of Cardinalls, may
serve the turne.</p>
                  <p>And concerning his infallibility all men
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40675:72"/>
confesse, that the Pope may erre in his Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
and in his Tenets as he is is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
Doctor, but not in his Definitions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dly
the most men doe acknowledge, that
he may erre in his Definitions, if he Define
alone without some Councell either generall
or Particular. Thirdly others goe yet high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that the Pope as Pope with a particular
Councell may Define erroneously or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,
but not with a Generall Councell.
Lastly many of them which goe along
with others for the Popes Infallibility, doe
it upon a Condition, <hi>Si maturus procedat,

Wee give the Supreme Iudicature

But then wee would have the Bishops to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:40675:75"/>Against such Fortifications grounded
upon Prescription and Imperiall Lawes,
the Canon of the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> will
make no great Battery. Take the Councell
of <hi>Sardica</hi> at the best, waving all exceptions,
yet certainly it was no generall Councell; If
it were, it had been one of the four first. If
it had been a generall Councell it self, three
succeeding Popes were much to blame,
to Father the Canons of it upon the first
Generall Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Canons
of the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> did not bind the
Africans of old, much lesse bind us now.
Secondly, the Canon of <hi>Sardica</hi> doth onely
give way to Appeales to Rome in cases
between two Bishops: but the Court of
Rome admitteth Appeales from inferiour
Clergy men, from Lay men, from all sorts
of men, in all sorts of Causes that are of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Cognisance. Thirdly, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of <hi>Sardica</hi> is a meer permission, no
precept, what may be done in discretion,
not what ought to be done of necessity: it
was proposed with a <hi>Si vobis placet, If it
please you,</hi> and the ground of it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
<hi>Let us honour the Memory of S. Peter.</hi>
Fourthly, There is one great Circumstance
in our Case, which varieth it quite from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40675:75"/>
that proposed by <hi>Osius</hi> to the Sardican Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that is, that our King and the Lawes
of the Realm do forbid Appeales to Rome.
If there had been such an Imperiall Law
then, doe wee thinke that the Fathers of
<hi>Sardica</hi> would have been so disloyall, or so
simple to thinke to abrogate the Imperiall
Lawes by their Canons, which are no
Lawes but by the Emperours Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?
No, the Fathers of that Age did
know their duty too well to their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and if they could have foreseen what
avaricious practises, and what grosse Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
would have sprung in time from
this little seed of their Indulgence, they
would have abhominated them. Lastly,
supposing the Sardican Councell had
been of more Authority, and the Canon
thereof of more Extent then it was, and
more peremptory, and that there had been
no such intervening impediment why
English Subjects could not make use of
that Remedy: yet the Councell of
Sardica can give but humane right,
And a contrary Prescription for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years, is a sufficient Enfranchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from all pretence of humane
right.</p>

                  <p>Lastly for Legates and Legantine courts,

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40675:77"/>
of Assise of Clarendon formerly cited.

whatsoever he did.</hi> And when the Pope had

Legate into England, Queen Mary
being very tender of her Kinsmans Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

was yet mindfull of this point of old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Law, to cause all the Seaports to be

to her. Shee knew this was an old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40675:77"/>
not a new protestant Privilege: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would she ever admit the new Legate
to appeare as Legate in her presence.</p>
                  <p>Now let us see how these old English
Customes doe agree with the French Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
<hi>The Pope cannot send a Legate a</hi> latere
<hi>into France with power to Reform, Iudge,
Collate, dispense, except it be upon the desire or
with the Approbation of the most Christian King.</hi>
Neither can the Legate execute his Charge,
untill he hath promised the King under his
Oath upon his holy Orders, to make no
longer use of the Legantine power in the
Kings Dominions then it pleaseth him,
That he shall attempt nothing Contrary to
the Liberties of the Gallicane Church. And
it is lawful to Appeale from the Pope to a
future Councell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Liberty is,</hi> The Commissions and
Bulls of Popes are to be viewed by the Court of
Parliament, and registred, and published with
such Cautio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s as that Court shall Iudge expedient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A third Liberty is,</hi> Papall Bulls Sentences
Excommunications and the like, are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
in France, without the Kings command or
Permission.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> neither the King, nor his Realm, nor
his Officers, can be Excommunicated nor Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by the Pope.</p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:40675:78"/>And as England and France, so all the
seventeen Provinces, did enjoy the same
Privileges, as appeareth by the Placaet of
the Councell of Brabant, dated at Bruxelles
May 12, An. 1653. Wherein they declare,
that <hi>it was notoriously true, that the subjects
of those Provinces, of what State or Condition
soever</hi> (that is the Clergy as well as the
Laity) <hi>cannot be cited or convented out of the
Land, no not before the Court of Rome it self.
And that the Censures Excommunications<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

&amp;c of that Court, might not <hi>be published

It seemeth that if the Pope had any
judiciary power of old, he must seek it
nearer Home; People had no mind to
goe over the Alpes to seek for Justice.

                  <p>So from his Iudiciary power I come to
Papal dispensations,<note place="margin">Of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> the last of the grosser
Vsurpations of the Bishops of Rome. Where
I have a large Field offered me to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
in, if I held it so pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t to the present
Controversy. The Pharisees did never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
their Philacteries so much as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Courtiers did their dispensative power.
The Pope dispenseth with Oathes, with
Vowes, with Lawes, he looseth from
Sinnes, from Censures, from Punishments.
Is not this a strange Key, which can unlock
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40675:79"/>
both sinnes, and censures, and Punishments,
and Lawes, and Oaths, and Vowes, where
there are so many and so different wards? It
is two to one that it proveth not a right Key,
but a Picklock. Their doctrin of Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was foule enough, especially in such
cases as concern the Law of God or Nature;
as Oaths, Vowes, Leagues, Marriages,
Allegiance. For either they make the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
to be onely Declarative; and then
the Purchaser is meerly Cheated, who
payes his money for nothing: Or else they
make all Contracts, Leagues, promises to
be but Conditionall, <hi>If the Pope approve them,</hi>
which destroyeth all mutuall trust and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society: Or thirdly they make the
Popes Dispensations, to be a taking away
of the matter of the Vow or Oath, that is,
the Promise; as if the Papall power could
recall that which is past, or make that to
be undone to day which was done yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
or that not to be promised which was
promised: Or lastly they doe dispense with
the Law of God and Nature, as they doe
indeed, what soever they pretend to the
Contrary, or all this kind of dispensations
signify nothing.</p>
                  <p>But the Practise of Dispensations was

                  <p>But I must contract my discourse to those
Dispensations which are intended in the
Lawes of Henry the eight, that is, the power
to dispense with English Lawes in the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Court, Let him bindor loose inwardly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40675:80"/>
whom he will, whether his Key erre or not,
we are not concerned. Secondly as he is a
Prince in his own Territories, he that hath
power to bind, hath power to loose, He that
hath power to make Lawes, hath power to
dispense with his own Lawes. Lawes are
made of Common Events. Those benigne
Circumstances which happen rarely, are
left to the dispensative Grace of the Prince.
Thirdly as he is a Bishop, whatsoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative
power the ancient Ecclesiasticall
Canons, or Edicts of Christian Emperours,
give to the Bishop of Rome within those
Territories which were subject to his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
by Humane right, we do not
envy him; So he suffer us to enjoy our
ancient Privileges and Immunities, freed
from his encroachments and Vsurpations.
The Chief ground of the Ancient Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall

much more against a new pretense of divine

Kings and Bishops enjoyed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40675:80"/>
Dispensation in England, nor any sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of it when the Church was formed.
Where the Bishops of Rome had no Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slative
power, no Iudiciary power in the
Exteriour Court, by necessary consequence
they could have no Dispensative power.
The first reservation of any Case in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland

Pope, is supposed to have been that of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bericus</hi>

                     <hi>How the Liberties of</hi> France <hi>and the Lawes

                  <p>Thus we have viewed all the reall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between the Church of Rome and

                     </gap>y Abuses which we complain of,
but they may be all referred to one of these
four heads, The Patronage of the Church
of England, The Legislative, The Judicary,
and Dispensative powers. Other differences
are but the Opinions of particular Persons:
But <hi>where no Law is there is no Transgression.</hi>
Wee have seen evidently, that <hi>Henry</hi> the

<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth could make of his own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
which he might not have made of those
ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t lawes; except onely a gawdy title of
<hi>Head of the English Church,</hi> which survived

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:40675:83"/>And since I have mentioned the Novelty
of that upstart Vsurpation, give me leave
to let you see how it was welcommed into
<hi>England,</hi> whilest it was but yet hatching
with the shell upon the Head of it, By a
Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, about an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

in this Realm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer this Objection three wayes.
First as to the two Lawes of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, They are both repealed long since
by Queen Mary, and never were restored by
any succeding Prince, If there were any
thing blame worthy in them let it dye with
them. I confesse I approve not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing
of one Oath for another, nor the
swearing before hand to Statutes made or
to be made. But, <hi>De mortuis nil nisi bonum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer according to the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> my second ground, that although it
were supposed that our Ancestors had over
reached themselves and the truth in some
expressions: yet that concerns not us at all,
so long as we keep our selves exactly to the
Line and Level of Apostolicall Tradition</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and principally I answer, That
our Ancesters meant the very same thing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40675:85"/>
that we doe. Our onely difference is in the
use of the Words <hi>Spirituall Authority or Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
Which we understand properly of
Iurisdiction purely Spirituall, which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no further then the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
But by <hi>Spirituall Authority or Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
they did understand Ecclesiasticall
Iurisdiction in the Exteriour Court, which
in truth is partly Spirituall partly Politicall;
The interiour habit which enableth an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Iudge to Excommunicate, or
Absolve, or degrade, is meerly Spirituall, but
the Exteriour Coaction is Originally Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.
So our Ancestors cast out Externall
Ecclesiasticall Coactive Iurisdiction, The
same doe wee: They did not take away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the Pope the power of the Keyes, or Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
purely Spirituall; No more doe wee.</p>
                  <p>To cleare the whole businesse, We must
know, that in Bishops there is a threefold
power; The first of Order, The second of
Interiour jurisdiction, The third of Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
jurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. The first is referred to the
Consecrating and Administring of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
The second to the Regiment of
Christians in the interiour Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
The third to the Regiment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
people in the Exteriour Court of the
Church. Concerning the two former, I
know no Controversy between the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40675:86"/>
Church of Rome and us but one,
Whether the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> alone <hi>doe derive
his Iurisdiction immediatly from Christ, and all
other Bishops do derive theirs mediatly by him?</hi>
Yet I confesse this Controversy is but with
a part of the Church of Rome: For many of
them are of our mind, that <hi>all Bishops hold
their Iurisdiction immediatly from Christ, as well
as the Pope.</hi> And if it were otherwise, it
were the grossest absurdity in the world.
For thousands of Bishops in Christendome,
doe not at all derive their holy Orders from
<hi>S. Peter,</hi> or any other Roman Bishop, either
mediatly, or immediatly (especially in <hi>Asia</hi>
and <hi>Africa,)</hi> but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the other Apostles. Must
all these poore Bishops wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t the Key of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and be but half Bishops, to humour
the Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> For they never had ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or Delegation, or Commission from
<hi>Rome,</hi> either mediatly or immediatly, yet
the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> World hath evermore received
them for true complete Bishops.</p>
                  <p>But we have a Controversy with some
others, who acknowledge no power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
in a Bishop but meerly directive,
neither more nor lesse then a Phisitian hath
over his Patient, To advise him to abstain
from some meats because they are hurtfull
to him; which advise the Patient, may either
obey or reject without sinne. But all the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40675:86"/>
Schooles have tyed two Keys to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Girdle, the Key of Order and the
Key of Iurisdiction, and I doe not mean
to rob my Mother of one of her Keys.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>What
will ye, shall I come unto you with a Rod?</hi> A rod
is more then chiding. The principall Branch
of this Rod is Excommunication (a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more to be feared in the Iudgement
of the Fathers then all earthly Paines,) The
Spirituall Sword, Like the cutting of a
member in the Body naturall, Or the out
lawing of a Subject in the body Politicall. It
is a Question in the Schooles, whether the
Pastors Sentence in binding and loosing, be
onely Declarative, or also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>perative? As if
such glorious promises, and so great solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
where with this power was given, did
imply a naked declaration; Keys are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to signify the doore is open or shut, but
to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> or shut it indeed. For my part I have
alwayes esteemed this Questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, to be a meer
Logomachy or Contention about words.
They who make the Sentence onely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
in respect of man, doe acknowledge it
to be operative in respect of God. And they
who make it to be Operative, make it to
be Operative by the power of God, not of
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. Whether the effect be attributed to the
principall cause, or to the Instrument, being
rightly understood, it is both wayes true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:40675:87"/>But this will not excuse our Innovators,
who have robbed the Church of one of her
Keys, the Key of Spirituall jurisdiction.
They are so Iealous of the honour of God,
that they destroy the beauty of the world,
and jumpe over the backes of all second
causes; and so they would make the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
to be bare Sigus. As it was said
of old, <hi>the sword of the Lord and of Gideon:</hi> so
we may say now,<note place="margin">1. cor. 1. 12.</note> the Key of Christ and his
Pastor. <hi>St. Paul</hi> taxeth the Corinthians for
saying <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apollo, I am of
Cephas, I am of Christ, What</hi> (saith he) <hi>is Christ
divided?</hi> Is Christ divided from his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?
As it is an Errour on the one hand to
depend so much upon <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> and
<hi>Cephas,</hi> or any of them, as not to depend
principally upon Christ: so it is an Errour
on the other hand so depend so upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Christ,
as to neglect <hi>Paul Apollo</hi> and <hi>Cephas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In summe Christ made his Apostles not
onely Lawiers to give Advise, but Iudges
to give Sentence.<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 21.</note> He gave them not onely
a Command but a Commission, <hi>As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

between the binding and loosing of
Christ, and the binding and loosing of his
Ministers; His power is Originall, Primitive
Soveraign, Imperiall; Their power is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative,

                     <hi>It seemed good to the Holy

Court of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The third power of Bishops, is the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in the Court of the Church,
whereby men are compelled against their wills

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40675:88"/>
at this day in the Ecclesiasticall Court are
about Possessions, as Glebes, Tithes, Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

to <hi>England</hi> it self, Our Parliaments never
did pretend to any power to change or
Abridge divine right. Thus much our very

Whosoever shall sweare by him that liveth for

Schismaticall, in respect of any Branches
of Papall power, which shee hath cast out
at the Reformation, he shall not forswear
himself. But Wagers and Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,

I will shut up this long Discourse concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighths Reformation, with

Apostate from the Faith of our Ancesters in
this point of the Papacy, that it is we

Tradition of the Christian world. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas
it is we who maintain ancient Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Tradition against their upstart Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations:
whereas it is we who doe propug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the Cause of our Ancesters against the
Court of Rome. If our Ancesters were
Catholick in this Cause, we cannot be
Schismaticall. Let them take heed least
whilst they fly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a supposed Schisme, they doe not plunge
themselves over head and eares into reall
Schisme. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> choose, whether they will

joine with their Ancesters in this cause,<note place="margin">15. Ri. 2. c. 4.</note> or
with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for with both
they cannot joine. If true English blood
run in their veins, they cannot be long
deliberating about that which their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
even all the Orders of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
voted unanimously, <hi>That they would
stand by their King, and maintaine the rights of
his Imperiall Crown, against the Vsurpations of
the Roman Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have represented clearly to you the true
Controversy, betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>England</hi> and the Court of Rome,
concerning Papall power, not as it is stated
by private writers, but in our English
Lawes, a glasse that cannot deceive us, for
so farre as to let us see the right Difference.
Let them quit these grosse Vsurpations;
Why should they be more ashamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
our lust rights, then they were to
plunder us of them? Let them distinguish
between Iurisdiction purely Spirituall, and
Iurisdiction in the exteriour Court, which
for the much greatest part of it is Politicall:
between the power of the Sword, which be
longeth to the Civill Soveraign, and not to
the Church further then he hath been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pleased to communicate it: between
that Obedience with procedeth from feare
of <hi>wrath,</hi> or from feare of <hi>Gods Revenger to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40675:93"/>
execute wrath</hi> (that is, the Soveraign Prince)
and that Obedience which proceedeth
meerly from <hi>conscience;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ro. 13.</note> And then there is
hope we may come to understand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better.</p>
                  <p>It is true, there are other Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
between us: but this is the main Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which giveth Denomination to the
Parties, And when they come to presse
those Differences, they may come to have
such another account as they have now.

faith, nor concerning any Legacy
which Christ left to his Church, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the power of the Keys, or any Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
purely Spirituall: but concerning
coactive power in the exteriour Court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Politicall or Externall Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
of the Church, concerning the Patronage or
civill Soveraignty over the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d,</hi>
and the Legislative, Iudiciary, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative
power of the Pope in <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d,</hi> over
English Subjects; Which was no more then
a Reinfranchisement of ourselves, from the
upstart Vsurpations of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Of all which I have shewed him expresly
the first source, who began them, when, and
where; before which he is not able to give
one instance, of any such Practises attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and admitted
by the Church of England.</p>
                  <p>Who it is that <hi>lookes asquint or awry</hi> upon
the true case in Controversy between us,
let the ingenuous Reader Iudge. I doe not
deny, nor ever did deny, but that there was
a reall separation made, yea made by us
from their Vsurpations: but I both did deny
and doe deny, that there was any Separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:40675:95"/>
made by us <hi>from the Institution of Christ,</hi> or
from <hi>the Principles of Christian Vnity.</hi> This
Separation was made long since by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when they first introduced those
novelties into the Church: and this Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of theirs, from the pure Primitive
Doctrine and Discipiine of the Church,
doth acquit us, and render them guilty of
the Schisme before God and man.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is a vain and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Allegation of him to tell us, that <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
may lawfully declare themselves pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and solemnly, against the renouncers of
their Authority, by Excommunication;</hi> unlesse
he could shew that the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
hath such an absolute Soveraignty over us
as he imagineth, extending it self to all those
Acts which are in Controversy between us;
And that in the exercise of the power of the
Keys, they proceded duely in a legall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
And especially that they did not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
their own Vsurpation for the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ, as we affirm and know they
did.</p>
                  <p>His whole Discourse about immediate
Tradition, is a bundle of uncertain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions
and vain Suppositions. First he
supposeth that his <hi>Rule of so vast a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Eye-witnesses of Visible things,</hi>
is uniform and vniversall: but he is quite
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40675:96"/>
mistaken, the practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e was different. The
<hi>Papalms</hi> made Lawes for their Vsurpations,
and the three Orders of the Kingdome of
<hi>England</hi> made Lawes against them. To
whom in Probability should our Ancestors
adhere, to their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> Patriots, or to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?</p>
                  <p>Secondly he presumeth, that this uniform
practise of his Ancestors was invariable,
without any shadow of Change, but it was
nothing lesse. First Investitures were in the
Crown, and an Oath of Fidelity made to
the King without any Scruple, even by
<hi>Lanfranke</hi> and <hi>Anselm</hi> both Strangers;
Afterwards the Investitures were decried
as profane, and the Oath of Fidelity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
Next a new Oath of Allegiance
was devised of Clergimen to the Pope; First
onely for Archbishops, then for all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates;
And this Oath at first was moderate,
<hi>to observe the Rules of the holy Fathers,</hi> but
shortly after more Tyrannous, <hi>to maintain
the Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>alties of Sainct Peter,</hi> as their own Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificalls
the old and the new do witnesse.
First when they tooke away Investitures
from the Crown, they were all for <hi>free
Elections,</hi> but shortly after there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be heard of but <hi>Provisions,</hi> and such
Simoniacall Arts. It is as easy to shape a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40675:96"/>
Coat for the Moone, which alteretb every
day, as to fit one constant Tradition to all
these diversified Practises.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he supposeth, that all Paren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s
have Iudgement to understand aright what
they see, and to penetrate into the secret
Caballs and Practises of their times, And
Ingenuity void of self Interest, to relate
it rightly to their posterity: But herein also
he will fall much short of his aime. Most
Parents know what is acted publickly: but
they know little what is done in their reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Roome. They know who is their
Bishop: But who invested him, what Oa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
he hath made, they are to seeke. Most
Parents see a Bishop fit in his Consistory:
But by what authority he sits, whether
meerly by the power of the Keys, or part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Concession of the Soveraign Prince,
they know nothing. What doe thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
of any distinction between Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall?
What Legends of Fopperies have
been brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> into the Church, by this
Orall Tradition and the Credulity of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents?
And if all Parents had Iudgement
to understand these things: Yet who shall
secure us that they are void of Self interest?
The Philosopher found that all the people
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40675:97"/>
forsooke him, so soone as the market Bell
began to ring.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he supposeth one constant suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Truth, upon this <hi>Tenour</hi> or <hi>Method</hi>
throughout many Ages. Why doe wee
heare words, when we see deeds? We see
them change dayly; if they had not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
we had had no need to leave their
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany. I have shewed him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> and where
and by whom<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> all these changes wherein
they and wee differ concerning discipline,
did come into the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, at least
all those which made the Breach between us.
Immediate Orall Tradition, without any
further Corroboration, is but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>oy: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
and Vniversall Tradition is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Evidence; or so Vniversall for time
and place, That the Opposers have been
censured in a manner Vniversally for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
or Heterodox. In a chaine, if one linke
be loose, or have a notorious Crack or
Flaw, there is little trust to be reposed in it.
Then what Credit is to be given to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Chaine of Tradition, where the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
first Linkes are altogether divided from
the rest, and fastened to the hand of the
Soveraign Prince, beyond the Popes reach?
The four next Linkes are full of Cracks and
Flawes, the Pope pulling at the one end, and
the Prince holding at the other. The last
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40675:97"/>
Linke of all, in <hi>England</hi> is put again into the
hand of the Prince. Where so many Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are wanting, he is like but to maintain a
poor Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. All this while I speake onely
of the externall Regiment of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But it is a wonder to me, why he of all
others should so much magnify this <hi>Mediu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     </hi>
of Immediate Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, as an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>allible Rule:
For if I be not misinformed by some Frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds,
his Fathers chalked out another way to him
by their Examples and Instructions, to hold
himself in the Communion of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> But let that passe as not much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall.
If he reduce his Argument into any
Form, he will quickly find that it halteth on
both sides. <hi>Whatsoever we received by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Tradition from our Fathers, as the Legacy of
Christ, is infallibly true; But we received those
points of discipline wherein we differ, by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Tradition from our Fathers, as the Legacies
of Christ.</hi> I deny both his Propositions, my
reasons he will find formerly at large.</p>
                  <p>I charged him for making two distinct
Rules of Vnity, whereas one would have
served his Turne; that he might have
more opportunity to shuffle the later Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
of the Popes, into the ancient disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church. For this I am lashed,
as <hi>a man that cannot or will not write common
sense,</hi> with a deale of such poore stuffe not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40675:98"/>
worth repeating. Cannot a man abandon
his Religion unlesse he abandon his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
also? He might remember that I had
the honour to be a Doctor in the Vniversity,
I think assoone as he was a Schooleboy in
the Country. The first part of my Charge
is confessed by him self,<note place="margin">S. D. pa. 308</note> that <hi>his first Principle
doth also include the truth of the second.</hi> If his
second Principle be comprehended in the
first, then it is no new distinct Principle,
but either an inference, or a Tautologie.
But let him carve and mince his Principles
into shreds if he please, rather then I will
draw the Saw of Contention about the
dream of a Shadow. To the second part
of my Charge he answereth,<note place="margin">S. D. pa. 484</note> that <hi>Neither
I, nor any man else can instance of any Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which did ever come in, either in Secular
or Ecclesiasticall Government, pretending that
Tenour, or could come in so long as men adhered
to that Method.</hi> Doth not he <hi>pretend to
that Tenour?</hi> Or indeed taketh it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and would make us believe they doe
<hi>adhere to that Method?</hi> If they doe not,
his demonstration doth not weigh a Graine.
Yet I have shewed him heaps of usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s,
more perhaps the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he is desirous to see.
Some men have made the Pope infallible,
in point of faith formerly; but he is the first
that ever made him uncapable of usurping,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40675:98"/>
and I thinke will be the last; if he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us with reason to be thus mad, he
deserveth to have his head stroked, Go, Go
<hi>Mr. Serjeant,</hi> Learn better, there are more

introduced into the Church since the Reformation
no particular Form of Government, in stead of
that they renounced.</hi> A grievous accusation!
We had no need to introduce new formes,
having preserved the old. They who do
onely weed a Garden, have no need to set
new Plants. We have the Primitive Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church, and neither want Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
nor Ecclesiasticall, nor Politicall
Government. If you have any thing to say
against it, cough out and spare not. And
although we want such a free and generall
Communion with the Christian World as
we could wish, and such as Bishops had
one with another by their <hi>formed Letters:</hi>
Yet we have it in our desires; and that we

were set upon the Pin of making Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
doubtlesse this was dubbed
a famous Contradiction or an absurdity
at least. As if a man might not hold

one thing in words, and perform
another in deeds, <hi>Video melior a proboque,

                     <hi>They professe</hi>
(saith St. Paul) <hi>that they know God, but in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
they deny him.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
in words, to adde nothing to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
of Christ and his Apostles: but in their
deeds they doe adde and adde notoriously;
as the Vniversality of the Roman Church,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40675:102"/>
the doctrins of Purgatory, of Indulgences,
of Worshiping of Images, and the rest of
their new Essentialls of faith, <hi>Extra quas
nemo salvus esse potest</hi> (saith Pope <hi>Pius,) With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the beliefe of which no man can be saved.</hi>
Then no man was saved for a thousand
yeares after Christ. If there be the least Print
of a Contradiction here, it is not in my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
but between their own Principles
and their Practice. He taunteth me suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
for making the Apostles Creed, a
summary of all things necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by all Christians, calling it <hi>the wildest
Topick that ever came from a rationall head,</hi> and
would gladly perswade us that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Act of Prudence, to keep out hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
persons in that present age, which
was to be inlarged as often as new Heresies
did arise. I pitty the young man, who is

And elswhere he telleth us, that <hi>all
Catholicks doe confesse, that it is the unwritten
word of God.</hi> So there is more in the Creed
then a meer <hi>Shiboleth,</hi> to distinguish an
Ephraimite from a Gileadite. It is <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
firmum &amp; unicum,</hi> not onely a firm
but an onely Foundation. He asketh me
whether <hi>ever Protestant did hold, there is nothing
of Faith but the 12 Articles in that Creed?</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:40675:103"/>
I doe not know how I come to be obliged
to answer him to so many impertinent
Questions: but for once I will not refuse
him. Protestants doe know as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that there are many things of faith,
which are necessary to be believed by some
men at some times; as that St. Paul had a
Cloak: but there is no Article or Point,
absolutely necessary to Salvation to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
which is not comprehended within
the 12 Articles of the Creed. And here, he
serveth us up again his twice sodden Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts,
that <hi>the Procession of the Holy Ghost,
the Baptism of Infants, the Sacraments,
the Scriptures, are not comprehended
in the 12. Articles.</hi> I have but newly
answered the very same Objection, and
here Meander-like with a suddain turning
he brings it in again: but I will not wrong
the Reader so much, as to follow him in
his Battologies. Onely if he think the Creed
was imperfect, untill the word <hi>Filioque</hi> was
added, he is much mistaken.</p>
                  <p>But saith he, <hi>by the same Logick we may
accuse the Church, at the time of the Nicene
Councell, for pressing the word Consubstantiall.</hi>
Pardon us good Sr, there is no Analogy
between the Consubstantiality of the Sonne
with the Father, and your upstart Doctrins
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40675:103"/>
of Indulgences and Image Worship. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the word Consubstantiall, was not in
the Creed before the <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> but
the thing was, and was deduced from the
Creed. When the Apostles delivered the
Creed to the Church, they did it by Orall
Tradition: and this is that famous Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
much mentioned in the Fathers, which
you doe altogether misapply to the justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your new patches<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d when they deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vered
the Creed they delivered likewise the
sense of the Creed, by the same Tradition:
and it was the most proper worke in the
world, for those first Oecumenicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
to search out and Determin by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the right sense of the Articles where
in they were delivered by the Apostles. But
for us now after fifteen or sixteen hundred
yeares to inquire, not onely into new sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the old Articles, altogether unknown
to the Ancients: but to find out new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which have no relation to the old Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and all this by Tradition, is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
For whatsoever Tradition we have,
we have from former Ages successively:
and therefore if they had no Tradition for
such an Article, or such a sense; wee can
have none,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:40675:104"/>But such are all the twelve new Articles,
added to the Creed by <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth; not
onely new senses of old Articles, which
had been too much, but new Articles newly
coined, which have no relation to the old
Articles at all. Somethings are <hi>de Symbolo,</hi>
conteined in the Creed; somethings are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
Symbolum,</hi> against the Creed; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
<hi>praeter Symbolum,</hi> besides the Creed.
First, for those things which are conteined
in the Creed, either in the Letter or in
the sense, or may be deduced by good
consequence from the Creed; as the
Deity of Christ, his two Natures, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Holy Ghost: the Addition
of these is properly no addition, but onely
an Explication; Yet such an Explication,
none under a Generall Councell can impose
upon the Church. Secondly, such things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
as are contrary to the Creed, are not onely
unlawfull to be added to the Creed, but
they are Hereticall in themselves. Thirdly,
for those things which are neither of the
Creed, nor conteined in the Creed, either
explicitly, nor can be deduced by good
Consequence from the Creed, and yet
they are not contrary to the Creed, but
Opinions or inferiour truths, which may
be believed or disbelieved, without any
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40675:104"/>
great danger of Heresy (of this nature are
chose 12. points or Articles which <hi>Pius</hi> the
fourth added to the Creed: To make these
part of the Creed, and to oblige all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

as Pius the 4<hi rend="sup">â€¢h</hi> doth, <hi>without which

doth consist <hi>in indivisibili,</hi> and the Essentiall
parts of it, cannot be contracted or inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>This is that which we Charge the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
withall, and which I see not how
they will be able to shake of. Not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the old Articles of Faith, nor
the prescribing of inferiour truths as infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
truths to those who are under their
Iurisdiction, nor the obliging of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
not to oppose their Determinations
for peace and tranquilities sake: but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of new Articles or Essentialls to the
Creed, with the same Obligation that the
old Apostolicall Articles had, to be believed
under pain of Damnation. Either all these
12 new Articles which were added to
the Creed by <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, were impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
or virtually comprehended in the 12
old Articles of the Apostles, and may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40675:105"/>
from them by necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
(the contrary where of is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

that Pius the 4. hath corrupted the
Creed, and changed the Apostolicall
Faith.</p>
                  <p>He might even as well let our 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
alone for old acquaintance sake, <hi>(Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suenda
non dissecanda est amtcitia)</hi> as to bring
them upon the Stage, and have nothing to
say against them. Some of them are the
very same that are contained in the Creed:
some others of them are practicall truths,
which come not within the proper list of
points or Articles to be believed: lastly,
some of them are pious opinions or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
truths, which are proposed by the
Church of England to all her Sonnes, as
not to be opposed; not as Essentialls of
Faith necessary to be believed by all Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians

If he could charge us with this as
we do them, he said something. The

Faith which was defined, published, and
composed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, was the
Nicene Creed, or the Creed of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
explicated by the Nicene Fathers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we must consider that the Catholick
Church of Christ, from the very Infancy
of Christian Religion, did never admit
any person to Baptisme in an ordinary
way, but it required of them a free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Creed or Symbolicall Faith,

the whole Christian World, that is the

the same wherein all the Christian World,

Bishop by divine right, or of the
Doctrin of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> Indulgences,
Imageworship, or the like. Wherefore we
are resolved to adhere to that faith which
hath been professed alwaies, everywhere,
and by all Persons, and particularly both
by them and us at our Baptisms; in which
faith and which alone, we were made
Christians, without either diminution or

But he objecteth it is a great Absurdity,
that <hi>thus the Creed defined by the Fathers in the
Councell of Nice,<note place="margin">p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>

according to the Bishop are one and the same
Creed.</hi> Have you found out that? Yes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40675:108"/>
are they, and alwayes have been so
reputed in the Church, even in the Roman
Church it self in their ancient Leiturgies,
which call the Nicene Creed the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Creed, the Creed of the Apostles, inspired
by the Lord, instituted by the Apostles;</hi> and
when he groweth older, he will be of the
same mind.</p>
                  <p>I hope by this time he seeth that although
I did not cite the Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in
this place, and therefore could be no falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier
of it: Yet the Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> saith
more then I did in every respect. I said
onely the <hi>Councell did forbid:</hi> but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
it self goeth higher, that <hi>whosoever
should dare.</hi> I said <hi>forbid to exact:</hi> but the
Councell itself goeth higher, <hi>whosoever
should dare to compose, or publish, or offer.</hi>
The Originall word is <hi>Prospherein,</hi> to
offer, and as it is translated into Latin,
<hi>Qui verÃ² ausi fuerint aut componere fidem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram,
aut proferre, aut offerre. Whosoever shall
dare to compose, or to utter, or to offer another
faith</hi> or Creed. One may compose or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and not offer; one may offer and not
exact: but whosoever doth exact doth more
then offer. If the Councell doth forbid
any man to compose or publish, or offer
any other Creed, much more doth it forbid
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40675:109"/>
them to exact it. Thirdly I said <hi>to exact any
more</hi> then the Apostles Creed, as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
by the Fathers, that is, concerning
Essentialls of saith: but the Councell goeth
higher, to compose or publish or offer <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram
fidem, another Creed,</hi> containing either
more or lesse, either new Essentialls or new
Explications. I said onely <hi>at our Baptismall
profession:</hi> but the Councell extendeth it
further, to the reconciliation of Hereticks,
as well as the Baptism of Pagans and
Iewes; and generally to all occasions, not
allowing any man Clergy or Lay, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or publish any other Creed or form
of profession. So every way the Councell
saith more then I said.</p>
                  <p>But he saith, there is nothing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Baptismall profession,</hi> except the bare
word <hi>fidem.</hi> Well, <hi>fides</hi> in that place signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the Creed, and that Creed which all
Christians did professe at their Baptisme,
is their Baptismall Profession. But that is
not all, for as <hi>fides</hi> signifies their Creed
or Profession of faith: so those other words,
<hi>to any Persons willing to be converted from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme
or Iudaisme,</hi> signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ieth as much as
who desire to be Christened or to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised.
But he saith, these words <hi>if the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of another faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40675:109"/>
do make it impossible to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Baptism,</hi> because the Ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Baptisme is a Clergy man. If a
Sophister should have brought such an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in the Schooles, he would have
been hissed out for his labour. Because one
part of the Canon hath reference to Lay
men, therefore no part of it can have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Clergy men. Iust like this, an
Aethiopians teeth are white, therefore it is
impossible that any part of him should be
black. Whereas the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> saith expresly the
Contrary, if they be Bishops or Clerkes let
them be deposed, if Layme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Anathematised.</p>
                  <p>But this great Censurer himself doth
falsify the Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> indeed, twice
in this one place. Once in omitting the
word <hi>Prospherein, to offer.</hi> Secondly where
he saith, that <hi>Charisius had made a wicked
Creed.</hi> It was not a wicked Creed, but a
wicked exposition of the Creed which the
Councell condemned, <hi>Depravata Symboli
Expositio;</hi> Which was indeed produced by
<hi>Charisius,</hi> but neither made by him, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by him, but condemned by him as
well as by the Councell. Observe Reader,
with what grosse Carelesnesse these great

doe not <hi>clap it upon their whole Church</hi> (that

they who change the ancient <hi>Government of

with so many Cautions:</hi> but I spake expresly
of them, who ascribe infallibility and
temporall power over Princes to the Pope;
This is another injury or falsification.
Thirdly, how often must I tell him, that we
did not disunite our selves from their
Church: but onely reinfranchise ourselves
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40675:110"/>
from their Vsurpations? Lastly, this party
which advanceth the Papacy, above the
Representative Church, is no worse then
their Virtuall Church, the Pope and
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> with all their adherents,
they who have the Keys in their hands:
such a party as he dare not say his soule is
his own against them, nor maintain the
Contrary; that a Generall Councell is
above the Pope.</p>
                  <p>He urgeth, that I ascribe no more to S.
<hi>Peter and the Pope for their first Movership,<note place="margin">pag. 496. First mover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note>
but onely Authority to sit first in Councell or some
such things.</hi> I ascribe unto the Pope, all that
power which is due unto him either by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right or humane right, at the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, but I doe not hold it
meet, that he should be his own Carver.
And for S. <hi>Peter,</hi> why doth he not leave
his wording of it in Generalls and fall to
work with Arguments in particular, if he
have any? We offer him a faire tryall for it,
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> never enjoyed or exercised
any greater or higher power in the church,
then every one of the Apostles had, either
extensively or intensively, either in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

he scoffeth at every where: Yet neither
do we make his first Movership, <hi>void of all

First we know he had Apostolicall power,
which was the highest spirituall power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, <hi>As my Father sent me so send I
you.</hi> Secondly, some power doth belong to
a First Mover even by the Law of nature,
besides <hi>the First seate;</hi> As to convocate the

                  <p>The second part of my answer was,<note place="margin">Papall usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not univers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> that
as the Pope exercised more power then
was due to him, in some places, where he
could get leave: so in other places, no lesse
then three parts of foure of the Christian
World, that is all the Eastern, Southern,
and Northern Churches, his Vniversall
Monarchy which he claimed, was Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
rejected. For this I am first reviled.

                     <hi>Are moderate expressions of shamelesnesse suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to Character this man?</hi> &amp;c. If better was
within better would come out. But <hi>Stultis
the saurus iste est in linguasitus, ut discant male
loqui melioribus.</hi> And then when he hath first
censured me, he attempteth to answer me,
as well as he is able, that <hi>the Pope exercised
his power over them, by excommunicating them
as Revolters.</hi> As Revolters? In good time;
They were Christians and had Governours
of their own, before either there was a
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
never acknowledged themselves to be his
Subjects untill this day, nor regarded his
Excommunicatious upon that score at all.
If they were Revolters, the Apostolicall
Age and all succeding Ages were joined in
the Revolt. These are his <hi>rigorous demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi>
to prove the Popes single Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by divine right, from his own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Actions. If the Pope have a Supremacy
of Power by divine right, he hath it over
the world, but that we see evidently he
never enjoyed from the beginning: if he
did did not enjoy it universally from the
beginning, then certainly it cannot be an
Apostolicall Tradition.</p>
                  <p>I doe begin with the Eastern Church,
because their case is plainest, as having
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40675:113"/>
Proto-patriarchs of their own, and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Churches of their own: but when
that is once acknowledged, I shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to <hi>joine issue</hi> with him in the West,
First for our Britannick Churches, and
next even for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self;
that the Popes Vniversall Monarchy, and
plenitude of Soveraign power by divine
right, was neither delivered from Parents
to Children by perpetuall Tradition, as a
Legacy of Christ and his Apostles, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Sonnes of that Individuall
Church as a matter of Faith; but onely a
Primacy of Order or beginning of Vnity,
which we do not oppose, nor yet those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of humane power, which Christian
Emperours and Oecumenicall Councells,
have conferred upon that See, provided
they be not exacted as a divine right.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>First Movership</hi> and his <hi>First Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernourship,</hi>
are but generall unsignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Termes, which may agree as well
to a beginning of Vnity or Primacy of
Order, as to an absolute Monarchy or ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of power. If he will say any thing
to purpose he must say it particularly, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
began the breach particulars must
stop rhe breach. I have given him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
what particular Differences we have

the Pope, let him apply him self to
those, aud not make continuall Excursions
(as he doth) out of the Lists.</p>
                  <p>When I acknowledged an Authority due
to the Roman Bishop in the Church,<note place="margin">What respects due to the Pope.</note> as a
Bishop in his Diocesse, as a Metropolitan

tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>kes; there are many that will not

for this of <hi>frivolousnesse and insincerity.</hi>
Yet I will make bold to tell this <hi>Apprentice
in Theology,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">pag. 498.</note> that whensoever the case com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be solidly discussed, it will be found
that the principall grounds (if I had
said the onely grounds I had not said
much amisse) of the Popes pretended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
are the just rights and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his Patriarchateship, his Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriarchateship,
and his Apostolicall
Chaire, mistaken for Royalties, for want of
good Distinction. I know the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who have been accustomed in these latter
times, to milke the purses of their Clients,
doe not love such <hi>a dry Primacy</hi> (as he
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40675:114"/>
phraseth it): but where they have no more
right, and other Churches have a care to
preserve their own Privileges, they must
have patience perforce.</p>
                  <p>His Parallel between the King of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
and the Pope,<note place="margin">pa. 302. Extent of Papall power.</note> will be then to some
purpose, when he hath first proved that the
Pope hath a Monarchy: untill then it is a
mere begging of the Question; what a
grosse Solecisme that is in Logick, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse but know. But since he is favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
pleased to dispense with all men for
the extent of Papall power, so they believe
the Substance of it, and yet he himself
either cannot, or dare not determin

and not stile us Mountebankes, who

Although he stile us hereticks now, yet he

have continued so longer, if he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n Apostolicall Church,</hi> or Successor of St.
Peter. Much good may it doe him. As if
every Bishop of an Apostolicall Church,
were straight way an universall Monarch;
or as if Authority did alwaies necessarily
imply jurisdiction, or every Arbitrator or
Depositary were a legall judge. I had reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
to place <hi>a Bishop of an Apostolicall Church,</hi> in
my Climax, after a Patriarch, for the larger
extension of his Authority every where, not
for the higher intension of his jurisdiction
any where.</p>
                  <p>I urged that if the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did
succeed <hi>St. Peter,</hi> by the ordinance of Christ,
in this Privilege to be the Prince and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
of the Church, endowed with a
single Soveraignty of power, that <hi>the Great
Councell of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>was much to be blamed,
to give equall Privileges to the Patriarch af</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:40675:115"/>
Constantinople <hi>with the Patriarch of</hi> Rome,
<hi>and to esteem the Imperiall City more then the
Ordination of Christ.</hi> To the second part of
this Argument, that the great Councell of
<hi>Chalcedon,</hi> did ground the Advancement
both of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> upon the
Imperiall Dignity of those two Cities, and
to much more which is urged there against
him, he is as mute as a Fish: but to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part he answereth, <hi>that for any thing I
know to the Contrary</hi> Rome <hi>might remain supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in Iurisdiction, though they had equall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.</hi>
Very pretty indeed. He would have
his Readers to believe, that a Soveraign and
his Subjects have equall Privileges. Equalls
have no power one over another; there
may be a Primacy of Order among Equalls,
but Supremacy of power taketh away
Equality. Doth not he himself make it to
be <hi>S. Peters Privilege to be Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</hi>
And doth not he tell us that this <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege</hi>
descended from <hi>S. Peter</hi> upon the
Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi> Then if the Bishop of

this Privilege which descended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

<hi>(Nicene)</hi> Fathers did justly give Privileges to
the See of old Rome, because it was the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
City. And the hundred and fifty Godly
Bishops <hi>(in the Councell of Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</hi>
moved with the same consideration, did
give equall Privileges to the See of new Rome;
Rightly judging, that that City which was the
Seat of the Empire and the Senate, should enjoy
equall Privileges with the ancient Imperiall City
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and be extolled and magnified in
Ecclesiasticall affaires as well as it, being the
second in Order from it. <hi>And in the last sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Iudges, upon the Review of
of the Cause,</hi> The Archbishop of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> or new <hi>Rome,</hi>
must enjoy the same Privileges of honour, and
have the same power out of his own Authority, to
ordain Metropolita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s in the Asiatick, Pontick, and

Councells, which <hi>St. Gregory</hi> honoured

of Forgeries, this great Censurer hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>packed
together, in the compasse of a few
Lines. I need to cite no other Authority
to convince him, but the very Acts of the
Councell. Remember whilest thou livest
to distrust such Authors. First he saith,
<hi>This was no free Act,</hi> most falsly: the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
all owned it as their free Act by their
Subscriptions, and by their Testimonies
before the Iudges. Secondly he saith, <hi>the
Clergy</hi> of Constantinople <hi>extorted it, with
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40675:116"/>
tumultuous importunity,</hi> most falsly: for it
had been once decreed before in the free
generall Councell of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and
then the Clergy of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Popes Legates to be present at the
first debate of it, but they refused; and when
the said Legates alleged in Councell that
the Fathers were forced, they all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
testified against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, <hi>Nemo coactus
est.</hi> Thirdly he saith, <hi>it was voted after most
of the Fathers were departed, and onely those of
the party of</hi> Constantinople <hi>left,</hi> most falsly:
the Fathers were forbidden to depart,
and three of the Proto-patriarchs with
their subordinate Bishops determined it,
and subscribed the first day. Fourthly he
saith, <hi>it was disavowed by the Patriarch of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
and those under him,</hi> most falsly: for
the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> and those under
him did ratify it, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d subscribe it in Councell.
Fifthly he saith, <hi>No Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria
<hi>was there;</hi> Good reason: For there was none
in being, the See being vacant, by the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out of <hi>Dioscorus.</hi> Though this be
not so false as the rest, yet it is as deceitfull
as the worst of them. Sixthly he saith, <hi>the
Alexandrian Metropolitans and Bishops refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to subscribe it.</hi> They did not refuse to
subscribe it, but they requested the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40675:117"/>
that because it was their Custome
to subscribe nothing, untill first it was
subscribed by their Patriarch, that the
Subscription might be deferred, untill
they had a new Patriarch chosen; and they
themselves were contented to stay in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
untill this was effected. Now Iudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Opposition. I doe not looke upon any
such Sects, which did or do oppose the
Vniversall and perpetuall Tradition of
the Catholick Church before their dayes,
as living and lasting Streames, but as
suddain and violent Torrents: neither
do I regard their Opposition to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, any more then of a
Company of Phrenetick persons, whilest
I see plainly <hi>a parte ante,</hi> that there was
a time when the wheat did grow without
those Tares; and <hi>a parte post,</hi> that
their Errours were condemned by the
Catholick Church. This exception of his
hath great force against his immediate
Tradition; should the Children of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
or Socinians, persist in their Arrian
or Socinian Principles, because they
were delivered to them, as the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Christ and his Apostles, by
their erring Parents? But against my
Vniversall and perpetuall Tradition they
have no force at all. Neither do I looke
upon their petty interruption, as an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
to the Succession from the
Apostles, no more then I esteem a great
mountain, to be an Empeachment to the
roundnesse of the Earth.</p>

not know, that the Creed was a <hi>Tradition</hi>
both <hi>materially,</hi> as a thing delivered by the
Apostles, and <hi>Formally</hi> as being delivered
by Orall Tradition. But he who shall say
(as he doth) that <hi>all the points controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

from the Apostles,<note place="margin">No tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the points in differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> us.</note> in a Practise as dayly Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as is the Apostles Creed, by our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
as invoking Saints for their intercession, the
the lawfulnesse of Images, praying for the dead,
Adoration of the Sacrament  and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
the Subjection to the Pope as Supreme head</hi>
(to use his own phrase) is a <hi>frontlesse man,</hi>
His very mumbling of them, and chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of them by halves, as if he durst not
utter them right out, is a sufficient Evidence
of the Contrary. We doe not charge them
onely with <hi>invoking Saints for their intercession,</hi>
or to speake more properly with the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
God to heare the intercession of his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40675:120"/>
Saints: but with more insolent formes of ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
prayers to the Creatures, <hi>to protect
them at the houre of death, to deliver them from
the Devill, to conferre spirituall Graces upon
them, and to admitt them into heaven,</hi> preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
meritisque, <hi>not onely by their prayers but
likewise by their merits.</hi> As improper and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse,
as if one should fall down on his
Knees before a Courtier, and beseech him to
give him a Pardon, or to knight him,
meaning onely that he should mediate for
him to the King.</p>
                  <p>We do not question the lawfulnesse of
their <hi>having of Images;</hi> but worshipping of
them, and worshipping of them with the
same worship which is due to the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.
We condemne not <hi>all praying for the
dead,</hi> not for their resurrection, and the
consummation of their happinesse: but
their prayers for their deliverance out of
Purgatory. We our selves adore Christ
in the Sacrament, but we dare not adore the
Species of bread and wine. And although
we know no divine right for it: yet if he
would be contented with it, for peace sake
we could afford the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Order by humane Right, which is
all that antiquity did know. And if any of
our Ancestours in any of these particulars,
did swerve from the Vniversall Perpetuall
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40675:121"/>
Tradition of the Church, we had much
better warrant to return to the Apostolicall
line and Levell, then he himself had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
those principles temerariously, which
his immediate Forefathers taught him, as
delivered by the Apostles and derived from
them.</p>
                  <p>His next exception is a meere Logo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machy,
that I call two of his Assertions <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</hi>
What doth this concern either
the person or the Cause? Either this is to
contend about the shadow of an Asse, or
I know not what is. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> be premisses or
Conclusions which he will, they may be so
disposed to make them either; if they be
neither what do they here, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
they are inferences. He calleth
the former Conclusion their <hi>chiefe Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
who ever heard of an Objection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Inference? And the second is so far
from being no Inference, that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
four Inferences, one from the
first Principle, another from the second
Principle, and the third from both Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
That <hi>Churches in Communion with the
Roman have the onely right Doctrine in virtue
of the First Principle, and the onely right Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in virtue of the second Principle, and
Vnity necessary to Salvation in virtue of both
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40675:121"/>
Principles.</hi> And the last conclusion is the
Generall Inference from all these, <hi>And by
consequence we hold them, onely to make the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Catholick Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I said truely, that we hold both their
Rules of Vnity; I adde that we hold them
both <hi>in the right sense,</hi> that is, in the proper
literall sense of the words: but what their
sense of them is, concerneth them not us.
If by the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> he understand a
single Soveraignty or Supremacy of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by virtue of Christs own Ordinance;
we hold it not indeed, neither did the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church of Christ ever hold it. So
likewise if by <hi>Tradition of our Ancestours,</hi>
he understand Vniversall and Perpetuall
Tradition, or as it were Vniversall and
perpetuall; we joine hands with him: but
if by Tradition he understand the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Immediate Tradition of his Father,
or ten thousand Fathers, or the greater
part of the Fathers of one Province or one
Patriarchate, in one Age, excluding three
parts of the Catholick Church of this
Age, and not regarding former Ages
between this Age and the Apostles;
we renounce his Rule in this Sense,
as a Bond of Errour not of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And yet in generall, according to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40675:122"/>
the Literall sense of the words, we
embrace it as it is proposed by him self;
that <hi>The Doctrins inherited from our Fore
fathers, as the Legacies of Christ and his
Apostles, are onely to be acknowledged or
Obligatory.</hi> So we acknowledge both his
Rules in the Literall sense <hi>de facto:</hi> but
the Popes single Supremacy of Power and
particular Tradition, were never Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Vnity, neither <hi>de facto</hi> nor <hi>de jure;</hi>
and so he may seek for his flat Schismatick
<hi>de facto</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I said there was a Fallacy in Logick
of more interrogations then one, when
Questions of a different nature are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to which one Vniform answer can
not be given. He saith <hi>he put no Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
at all to me.</hi> True; but he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ambiguous Propositions to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by me, confounding St. Peter
and the Pope, an Headship of Order
and an Headship of power, which is
all one. An head of Order hath power
to Act First, as well as sit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>irst: but he
acteth not by his own single power, but
by the conjunct power of the body or
College.</p>
                  <p>To shew him,<note place="margin">Pa. 510.</note> that I am not ashamed of
my <hi>voluntary railing</hi> (as he phraseth it) <hi>too
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40675:122"/>
silly to merit transcribing or answering,</hi> I will
transcribe it for him. [The Church or
Court of Rome have Sophisticated the
true Doctrin of Faith, by their supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Articles, contrary to the First
Principle; and have introduced into
the Church, a Tyrannicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
contrary to the second Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and are so far from being the entire
Catholick Church, that by them both they
are convicted to have made them selves
guilty of Superstition and Schisme]. If
this be railing, what Terme doth his
Language deserve? If this be silly, what pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
stuffe is his?</p>
                  <p>He said <hi>my onely way to cleare our church
from Schisme,<note place="margin">The Proof rests on their side.</note> was to disprove his two Rules.</hi>
I answered he was doubly mistaken, first
in putting us to prove or disprove, who are
the persons accused, the defendants duty
is to answer not to prove: that is the duty
of the accuser. They accuse us of Schisme,
therefore they ought to prove their Rules,
whereon they ground their Accusation, in
that Sense wherein they take them; not put
us to disprove them. He urgeth that <hi>by
this Method, no Rebell ought to give any
reason why he did so, because he is accused
of Rebellion by his lawfull Governour.</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:40675:123"/>
By his leave, he that condemneth a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Rebellion, before he have proved
his accusation, doth him wrong, But he
saith, <hi>the truth is wheresoever there is a contest
each side accuses the other, and each side defends
it self against the others Accusations:</hi> but we
<hi>were the first accusers, who could not with any
Face have pretended to reform, unlesse we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
first our actuall Governour of Vsurpation.</hi>
I told him before that he was doubly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken;
now I must be bold to tell him that
he is three wayes mistaken. First the
Pope was none of our actuall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in the externall Regiment of
the Church, by the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>
Seco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>dly our Reformation was no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
but an Enfranchisement of
our selves <hi>sub moderamine inculpatae tutelae.</hi>
Thirdly, I have already manifested the
Vsurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> other
manner of grounds them his ambiguous
Rules. As we have proved our intention;
so let him endeavour to prove his.</p>
                  <p>My second answer was, that <hi>although
the proofe did rest on oursides: Yet I did not
approve of his advise,</hi> that was, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his two Rules. My reason is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
we approve of his two rules as they
were set down by himself; it is not we but
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40675:123"/>
they who have swerved from them, and
therefore it were madnesse in us to disprove
them. He saith, <hi>he dare sweare in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
that I never spake truer word in my life,</hi>
and out of his Supererogatory kindnesse
offers him self <hi>to be bound for me, that I shall
never follow any advise that bids me speake
home to the point.</hi> What silly nonsense is this,
should I follow any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s advise to disprove
that which I approve? I have spoken so
home to the point without any <hi>advise,</hi> that
I expect little thankes from him and his
fellowes for it.</p>
                  <p>What he prateth of <hi>a discipline left by
Christ to the Church of England in</hi> Henry <hi>the
eighths time,</hi> is ridiculous indeed. And it
equally ridiculous to hope to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Removall of a few upstart
Usurpations, <hi>is a change of the discipline left
by Christ to his Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">pag. 513.</note> And lastly it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to Fancy, that later usurpations
may not be reformed by the Pattern of the
Primitive times, and the ancient Canons of
the Church, and the Practise of succeeding
Ages, because we received them by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Tradition from our immediate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
That one place which he repeateth
as having been omitted by me, hath been

twenty times more then ours; We inherit
but one point in difference from them, but

from the greater part. If any of them were
deemed more propitious to us then the
rest, it was <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Cranmer:</hi> For both these we have
their own confession that they were theirs.
First for Henry the eight,<note place="margin">Guil. Alan. Apol. cap. 4. pag. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>We had a King

is adverse to them. Such were all the
Actors in this cause by their Confession.
If we acknowledged, that they who cast

Keys, or abridge the Bishop of Rome
of any Iurisdiction purely spirituall, or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40675:127"/>
any Legacy which was left him by Christ
or his Apostles: but onely to cast out his
usurped Coactive power in the exteriour
Court, without the leave of the Soveraign
Prince, which Christ and his Apostles did
never exercise or dispose of or meddle
with, and to vindicate to our Kings the
Politicall or externall Regiment of the
Church, by themselves and by their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and other fit delegates, as a Right due
to all Christian Princes by the Law of God
and nature.</p>
               <p>But he attributeth all this to <hi>the Feare</hi> of
the Clergy and the people, and <hi>the Kings
violent Cruelty:</hi> and for proofe of what he
saith, citeth half a passage out of <hi>Doctor
Hammond,</hi> but he doth <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
wrong. <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> speaketh onely
of the <hi>first</hi> preparatory act, <hi>which occasioned
them to take the matter of right into a serious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
in a Synodicall way:</hi> he applieth it to the
subsequent act of Renunciation after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
<hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> said onely <hi>it is easy
to be believed: Mr. Serjeant</hi> maketh it <hi>a just
Presumption or confest Evidence. Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
speaketh of no <hi>feare</hi> but the feare of
the law, the law of <hi>Premunire;</hi> an ancient
law made many ages before <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth was borne, the <hi>Palladium</hi> of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40675:127"/>
England, to preserve it from the Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Court of Rome: but he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applieth
it wholy to the feare of he Kings
violent Cruelty. Lastly he smothers <hi>Dr.
Hammonds</hi> Sense expressed clearly by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that <hi>there is no reason to doubt, but that
they did believe what they did professe, the feare
being the Occasion of their debates, but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or Arguments offered in debate the causes
(as in all Charity we are to Iudge) of their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
He useth not to cite any thing inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously.</p>
               <p>If he did, he could have told his Reader,
that this answer was taken away by me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was made by him. For two whole
Kingdomes, the Vniversities, the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
the Parliaments, to betray their
Consciences, to renounce an Article which
they esteem necessary to salvation, onely
for the feare of a Premunire or the losse of
their goods, to forswear themselves, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Essence of their faith, to turn
Schismaticks, as if they did all value their
Goods more then their soules, without
so much as one to oppose it; is a vain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
surmise or rather it is incredible,
and not onely incredible but impossible.
They were the men that advised the King
to assume the Supremacy.<note place="margin">Act. ad Mon.</note> Arch-Bishop

in his Baptism, being convicted with undeniable
evidence, he was necessitated out of Conscience,
to forsake the Church of Rome in this particular
Question of Supremacy, and to adhere to his
first wife the truth, and after her to his Prince
the Supreme head of the English Church upon
earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I pleaded that [although it
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40675:129"/>
doth not alwaies excuse <hi>a toto</hi> from all
guilt, to be misled by others into errour, yet
it alwaies excuseth <hi>a tanto,</hi> it extenuateth
the Guilt]. This Allegation is so evidently
true, that he hath not confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce enough to
deny it, (which is a wonder,) but argueth
against it, first, <hi>how could we thinke their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to be followed, whom we confesse to have
done what they did out of feare?</hi> Or rather what
a shamlesse untruth is this? His witnesse
saith, that feare might be the Occasion
of the debate, but reason and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
were their directours in the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and we have demonstrated that
their actions could not possibly proceed
from feare.</p>
               <p>His second answer is, <hi>why doe we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
follow them in renouncing their Schisme, as
those Bishops did after the Kings death?</hi> Once
proved false is alwaies presumed to be
false. Who told him that they <hi>made any
retractation af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>er the Kings death,</hi> after they
were freed <hi>from their imminent feare?</hi> They
made no Retractation, but held their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time untill other
Questions did arise, and executed the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Supremacy as rigorously as they did
in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time. For proofe where
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40675:129"/>
of, I cite the Testimony of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
given to their Faces in their lives times,
before the most eminent Embassadours
of the greatest Princes, when they might
have contradicted it if they could, when
the Emperour and other Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Princes interceded with her for the
displaced Bishops: She gave them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that <hi>they did now obstinately reject that

his Plea to the ground. Thirdly when

and consequently in a Capacity of doing

Men and inwardly Catholicks, yet being
made Bishops in the Schisme, they had not the
Spirit of courage. Therefore they resisted faintly
to the Kings Primacy, or rather they subscribed
simply both to it and all other innovations, which
seemed not to conteine open haeresy, least they
should lose their Bishopricks. <hi>When may
we expect a true word from him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he urged <hi>the beginners of a
fault, may be lesse culpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sme compared to the Motives of theirs
is in a manner</hi> gratis, <hi>all our reasons being
for our Livings and Interest heretofore, and
now a vain glorious Itch to approve our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to our party.</hi> We have had many
proofes of his Veracity, here is one more
of his Charity. Suppose his new light had
lead him into ready Paths not Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices,
(which no man will grant him, but
his own Fellowes): Yet why should he
accuse us of Hipocrisy rather then of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in Iudgement, who have lost all our
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40675:130"/>
estates for our Consciences, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
he never had to loose, nor would have
quitted it so if he had had it? but onely that
his own guilt doth dictate such uncharitable
Censures to him. No Mr. Serjeant, we are
no such Changlings or turning weather
cocks; that is your own part: And you may
live to act it over againe, such hot water
freeseth soonest. Are you so blind, that you
do not see that this Accusation might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
upon you, and upon your great
Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>verts whom you propose to us for Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns?
Who as you say had been Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time; you might
as well say for the most part of them in
<hi>Edward</hi> the sixths time also, and had no
other way in the World to preserve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their Bishopricks in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi>
dayes but by prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding at least such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
But we are not so uncharitable as
you, we Iudge them by their profession and
leave their Consciences to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I pleaded that although those
who cast the Popes pretended Soveraignty
out of <hi>England,</hi> had been Schismaticks as
they were not: yet we cannot be charged
with Schisme, so long as we seek carefully
after truth, and are ready implicity in the
preparation of our minds to embrace it,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40675:131"/>
whensoever we find it. Because he shall
not Prevaricate with us, I will reduce my
Argument into Syllogisticall Forme. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
invented not their false Opinions
themselves, but learned them from their
erring Parents, are not to be reputed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
(much lesse Schismaticks,) if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> not with pertinacious animosity,
but inquire carefully after the truth, and
be ready to embrace it, and correct their
errours when they find them: But if we
had any false opinions we invented them
not our selves, but learned them from our
erring Parents. Therefore we are not to
be reputed Hereticks (much lesse Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,)
if we defend not our Opinions with
pertinacious Animosity, but inquire care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
after the truth, and be ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, and Correct our Errours when we
find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.<note place="margin">Aust. Epist. 162.</note> The Major is <hi>St. Austins</hi> to a word,
and is yielded by <hi>Mr. Serjea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t</hi> to be true. The
Minor is evident to all the world and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not
be denied: Therefore the conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is firme.</p>
               <p>I doe not urge this, as though I had the
least suspition in the world that our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
did erre, but to shew that although
they had erred, yet we are not to be reputed
Hereticks or Schismaticks whilest we doe
our endeavours to find the truth, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it implicitly in the preparation of our
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40675:131"/>
minds. Neither do I urge this to convince
others who do not know our hearts, and
perhaps will not believe us, when we tell
them that we hold the truth implicity: but
for the satisfaction of our own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
We know whether we hold Opinions
pertinaciously or not; and whether we
desire and endeavour to find out the truth
or not; and whether we are willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the truth whensoever God shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
it or not: None know it but God and
ourselves, Mr. Serjeant cannot know it.
And therefore as his answer is improper
and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>rary to the Rules of Logick, to
deny the Conclusion or Condition contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Conclusion: So it is vain and
presumptuous to Iudge of another mans
Conscience, which is known onely to God
and himself. I cited S. <hi>Austin</hi> to prove the
Proposition which he yieldeth, not the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumtion
which is too evident in it self to be
denied, much lesse to be a witnesse of our
hearts which it was impossible for <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
to know. Iudge Reader what <hi>Ardelioes</hi>
and busy bodyes these are, censuring and
damning all Protestants to the Pit of Hell
as Hereticks and Schismaticks, and yet
when they are pressed home, are forced
to confesse, that if they doe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to find out the truth, which all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40675:132"/>
good Christians doe; then they are neither
Hereticks nor Schismaticks. This may
be a great Comfort and Satisfaction to all
Consciencious Protestants, who are dayly
molested by these men and terrified with
such Bugbeares as these. But Mr. <hi>Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi>
hath devised a new Method to discover
the hearts of Protestants, by <hi>the Testimony
of their eyes, and the undeniable Veredict of
their Reason,</hi> onely by viewing my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to his first Section. <hi>Risum tenealis
amici?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To draw the Saw of Contention to and
fro, about <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth <hi>Warham Heath
Tonstall Gardiner Bonner &amp;c,</hi> whether they
were Protestants or Papists is impertinent
and frivolous. Impertinent; let them call
them Protestants, or Papists, or neither, or
both, it it all one to my Argument, that it
is a violent Presumption of their guilt and
our Innocence, that all their great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
who preached for them, and writ for
them, and acted for them, and suffered for
them in all other differences, should
desert them in this. And frivolous; to
contend about the word when we agree
upon the thing. The thing is without
all Controversy or Dispute; they held
with the Protestants in the Article of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40675:132"/>
the Supremacy, and with the Papist in all
other Articles what soever.</p>
               <p>Now whether their Denomination shall
be from the greater part as it is in all other
cases, (mixe one drop of milk with twenty
or fourty of water, and we call it water
not milke) or from the Lesser part as <hi>Mr.
Serjeant</hi> would have it, I commit to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Iudgement, and desire him to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
it himself; whatsoever way he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins
it, his Iudgement will be lesse Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
then to be molested with such wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers.</p>
               <p>Protestants may persecute Protestants,
but not as Protestants, and Papists may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
Papists (as the <hi>Iansenists</hi> persecute
the <hi>Iesuits),</hi> but not as Papists; even <hi>Ishmaels</hi>
mocks are termed persecutions: but they
seldome make such bloudy lawes, against
those whom they acknowledge to be of
their own Communions, as the law of the

being, which he hath undertaken to
Combate; let him adorn that <hi>Sparta</hi> as he
is able: and if he did it with more Modesty
he were lesse to be blamed then he is. If
she had been but his old Friend, yet <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
ought to be unstitched by degrees not torn

Face of his own Mother, is a shrewd sign of
an ill nature. As the Foole said to a Favori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
<hi>If I fall I can rise againe, but if thou fall thou

is no great danger in it, because we keep

is the Apostles Creed; but their Change is
dangerous, who change their Creed, and
presume to adde new Essentials to the
old.</p>
               <p>He beareth such a perfect hatred against
<hi>Reformation,</hi> because it is destructive to his
Foundation of immediate Tradition, that
he maketh <hi>No Papist</hi> and a <hi>Reformer</hi> to be
the Character of a Protestant. Popes and

Churches and Councells have all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:40675:134"/>I pressed him that if <hi>the Renunciation of the
Bishop of Romes absolute vniversall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
by Christs own Ordination, be the
essence of a Protestant, then the Primitive
Church were all Protestants. He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
it is flatsy false. I am contented to
be silent for the present, but when time
serveth, it may be made appeare, to be
<hi>flatly true;</hi> and that all that the Primitive
Fathers did attribute to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
was no more them a Primacy of Order or
beginning of Vnity; and that an absolute
Monarchy by Christ Ordination, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
repugnant to the Primitive Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
               <p>I proceeded [then all the Graecian, Russi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Armenian, Abyssen Christians are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
this day]. He answereth, that <hi>it
it is partly true and partly false, and serveth
onely to prove that the Protestants have fellow
Schismaticks.</hi> And why partly true and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false? when all the world seeth, that all
these Churches doe disown and disclaime
the Popes Monarchy. This is just the old
condemned Tenet of the Schismaticall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,
who did most uncharitably limit
the Catholick Church to their own Party,
excluding all others from hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the Romanists doe now. The best
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40675:134"/>
is, we must stand or fall to our owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
But by this means, they have lost one
of the notes of their Church, that is <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi>
for they exclude three or four times
more Christians, out of the Communion
of the Catholick Church, then they admit
into it.</p>
               <p>I proceeded yet higher, [then we want
not store of Protestants, even in the bosome
of the Roman Church it self]. His answer
is, that <hi>to speake moderately, it is an impudent
falshood, and a plain impossibility, for whosoever
renounceth the Substance of the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and his being head of the Church, becomes
totally disunited from the Church.</hi> Good words!
His groundworke is to weake to support
the weight of such an heavy accusation.
A <hi>Primacy</hi> of Order implyeth an <hi>headship,</hi>
as well as <hi>Supremacy</hi> of power; neither is
it destitute of all power. It hath some
power essentially annexed to it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
<hi>sub paena purÃ¨ spirituali,</hi> to propose,
to give sentence according to the votes of
the College; It may have an accessary
power, to execute the Canons according to
the Constitutions of Councells, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
Sanctions, and Confirmations.</p>
               <p>But all this commeth far short of that
headship which he asserteth, <hi>a Soveraign
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40675:135"/>
Monarchicall Headship of absolute power,
above the whole Church by Christs Ordination.</hi>
This is that Headship which he maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
against me every where. This is that
Headship which the Primitive Church
never acknowledged. This is that Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which the <hi>Grecians, Russians, Armenians,
Abyssines</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
at this day. This is that Headship,
which many of his own Communion who
live in the bosome of the Roman Church,
do not believe; as the Councells of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
and <hi>Basile,</hi> and <hi>Pisa,</hi> the Schoole of
<hi>Sorbon,</hi> and very many others every where
who do all reject it, some more some lesse.
The maine difference and almost the
whole difference between him and me, is
concerning Coactive power, in the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Court, over the Subjects of other
Princes, against their wills; this is so far
from being vniversaly believed, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all places of the Roman Communion,
that it is practically received in few or no
places, further then it seemeth expedient
to Soveraign Princes. If the Pope himself
did believe, that he had such an absolute
Soveraignty of Monarchicall power, in the
exteriour Court by Christs own Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to him and his Successors, How
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40675:135"/>
could he alienate it from his Successors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wholy to the Princes of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to
their Heirs for ever, within that Kingdome:
Or how could the Princes retein it? If the
King and Kingdome of France did believe,
that the Pope had such an absolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
power, in the Exteriour Court, by
Christs own Ordination; how could the
King of <hi>France</hi> forbid the Popes Legates
without his License, or restrain their
Legantine Commissions by his Parliaments,
or sweare them to act nothing contrary to
the Liberties of the Gallican Church, and
to cease to execute their Commissions whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the King and Kingdome should
prohibit them, or reject Papall decrees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they are received in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
Or if the Councell of <hi>Brabant</hi> did
believe it, how could they forbid the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to repaire to <hi>Rome</hi> out of their own
Country, upon the Popes Summons? All
men know that there is no Privilege or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
against Christs own Ordination.
<hi>Qui pauca considerat, facile pronunciat.</hi> This
is ever the end of his Contradictions.</p>
               <p>Lastly he Chargeth me for omitting to
answer to his reason,<note place="margin">pa: 522</note> that <hi>the renouncing the
Pope is essentiall to Protestantisme.</hi> Truly I
neither did nor do hold it worth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering.
Cannot he distinguish between
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40675:136"/>
the whole Essence of any thing, and one
Essentiall? He might as well affirm, that
he who believeth but one Article of his
Creed is a Christian. This requireth no
great <hi>skill to explicate it:</hi> but I have remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this <hi>Controversy to the Reader as fittest for
his determination.</hi>

palpably and shamefully his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

was to shew that the ancient Kings of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40675:137"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> did assume as much power in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
affaires as Henry the eighth
did, that the Lawes of Henry the eighth
were no new Lawes, but onely renovations
and Confirmations of the ancient Lawes of
<hi>England,</hi> which had never bene repealed or
abrogated in the dayes of his Predecessors,
but were of force in <hi>England</hi> at that very
time when he made his Lawes; As the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> The Statute of <hi>Carlile,</hi>
The <hi>Articles of the Clergy,</hi> The Statutes of
<hi>Provisors</hi> and other old Lawes made in
the time of Henry the first, Henry the third,
<hi>Edward</hi> the first, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third,
<hi>Richard</hi> the second, Henry the Fourth, all
of them dead and gone many ages before
Henry the eighth was born. I shewed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
that they suffered not the Pope
to send for any English Subject out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to <hi>Rome</hi> without leave, nor to send
any Legate into England without leave, nor
to receive any Appeale out of England
without leave. They made it death, or at least
the forfeiture of all a mans estate, to bring
any Papall Bulls or Excommunications into
<hi>England.</hi> They called Ecclesiasticall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
made Ecclesiasticall Lawes, punished
Ecclesiasticall persons, prohibited Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Iudges, received Ecclesiasticall
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40675:137"/>
Appeales, made Ecclesiasticall Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

with a <hi>Nolumus;</hi> wee will not have
the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> to be Changed, or
gave Legislative Interpretations of them as
they thought fit. All this I have made evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
out of our ancient Lawes, our Records,
our Historiographers; in my Vindication,
in my Reply, and in this Treatise. And
therefore I might well retort upon him his
own Confident bragge, that it is <hi>as cleare
as the suns shining at noone day, or that the same
thing cannot be and not be at once;</hi> that our
Ancestours who did all this and much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
then this, did acknowledge no Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
power of the Pope in the Exteriour
Court, by Christs own Ordination, as
<hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> asserteth; and that they did
exercise as much power in the externall
Regiment of the Church, as <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth did; and that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
were no new lawes devised by himself,
but were the lawes of these ancient Kings
renewed by him, or rather the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Lawes and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by these ancient Kings as a Buckler
against the Encroachments of the Roman
Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:40675:138"/>Now to all this cleare evidence what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
doth <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> make? Iust <hi>Thraso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi>
when the matter comes to push of pike
he sneaketh away <hi>post principia, into</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curest
place he can find. Speak the truth
in earnest, <hi>did Pyrrhus use to doe thus?</hi> It is
not possible to squeese one word of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
answer out of him: onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
he saith <hi>I bring divers allegations,<note place="margin">Down Derry pa 311.</note> wherein
the Popes pretenses were not admitted</hi> &amp;c. And
so proceedeth, <hi>doe we professe the Pope can
pretend to no more then his right</hi> &amp;c.? Lawes
and Records are but bare <hi>Allegations</hi> with
him: and prohibiting under pain of Death
or Confiscation of Goods, is no more but
<hi>not admitted.</hi> Speake out man and shame
the devill; whether did <hi>the Pope pretend more
then is right</hi> or not? whether were the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
English Lawes just Lawes or not? This
is certain, his Pretensions and these Lawes
cannot both be just. The very substance of
his Monarchicall power in the exteriour
Court, is prohibited by these Lawes, his
Soveraign power or Patronage of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Church, his Iudiciary Power, his
Legislative Power, his dispensative Power,
all are lost if these Lawes stand. All which
Mr. Serjeant blancheth over with this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
expression, <hi>such and such things.</hi> Will
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40675:138"/>
the Court of Rome thank <hi>such and such</hi> an
Advocate, who forsakes them at a dead
lift? I trow no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And although I called upon him in my
reply, for a fuller and more satisfactory
answer to these Lawes: yet he giveth none
in his Rejoinder, but shuffleth up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Generalls.</hi> As for his particularities
entrenching on, or pretended to entrench on the
Popes Authority; whether they were lawfully
done or no, how far they extended, in what Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
or cases they held in what not, how
the Letter of those Lawes are to be understood
&amp;c. all which the Bishop Omitts, though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the bare words; it belongs to Canon and
Secular Lawiers to scuffle about them, not me.
I hold my self to the Lists of the Question, and
the limits <hi>of a Controvertist. Yes, even as</hi>
Thrasoheld himself to the Lists, <hi>when he stole
behind the second wards.</hi> This is neither
more nor lesse, but flat running away, and
crying to the Canonists for help. If the
subject be improper for him, why did he
undertake it, and not try first,
<q>
                     <l>Quid ferre recusent,</l>
                     <l>Quid valeant humeri.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Why did he undertake it with so much
youthfull Confidence and insulting scorn
and petulance, to accuse his adversary of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40675:139"/>
impudence? And as if <hi>impudence were too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
a Character for him, as a profest and
sworn enemy of truth shame and honesty;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him <hi>worse then a mad man or born foole.</hi>
And all this for pretending that <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth did no more against the Papacy,
then his Ancestour Kings had done before
him: and now when his Cavills are thrust
down his own throat, when the <hi>impudence</hi>
is brought home to him and laid at his own
doore, when the very Lawes of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
are produced wherein they provided
the same remedies for the Roman Court
that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth did; he would with
draw his own neck o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of the Collar, and
leave the defence of his cause <hi>to the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> and
Secular Lawiers, to scuffle about</hi> the sense of
these ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t Lawes, <hi>and whether they were law
fully done or no, and how far they extended, and
in what cases they hold in what not.</hi> And
this is all the answer, which he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
to these ancient English Lawes;
that is as much as to say he knoweth not
what to answer, or it doth not belong to
him to answer: and this he calleth <hi>hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himself to the Lists of the Question,</hi>
but all other men call it leaping out
of the Lists of the Question, and a shame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40675:139"/>

               <p>I ever acknowledged that <hi>Henry</hi> the

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>utes against
the Vsurpations of the Court of Rome: but
I adde that these Statutes were declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of old Law, not Enactive of new
Law. This is as cleare as his noone day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
And I proved it by the Authority
of two of our greatest Lawiers, <hi>Fitz Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
and my Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> persons sufficient
to know the difference between a Statute
declarative of old Law, and a Statute E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nactive
of new. Secondly, I proved it
by one of the Principall Statutes themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves:
those terms of Law which declare old
Law, are not the same with those which
enact new Law. This proofe is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative.
He urgeth, <hi>if there were something
new, it was new, and a Statute we Englishmen
use to term a Law.</hi> So if he new turn his
Coat, there is something new, yet we
English men say his Coat is and old
Coat for all that. <hi>Magna Charta</hi> or
<hi>the great Charter of England</hi> is an old
Law, yet it hath been renewed or newly
declared by almost every succeeding
King. New Statutes may declare old
Lawes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:40675:140"/>He saith I cite two Protestants Fitz-Herbert
<hi>and my</hi> Lord Cooke, <hi>both of mine
owne party, to speake in behalf of Protestants.</hi>
I cite no Protestants as Protestants, nor to
speak for Protestants, nor as witnesses in
any case in difference between Protestants
and Papists: but I cite two great English
Iudges as Iudges, to speak to the Difference
between a Declarative Statute and an
Enactive Statute by the Law of England;
and who could be so proper witnesses of
the <hi>Law</hi> of England as they. Secondly who
told him that <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> was a Protestant?
No more a Protestant then himself; for any
thing that ever I could perceive. He was
a great Iudge, lived in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths
time, and writ sundry workes. Where he
setteth down the Charge against a Papist,
he doth it in such a manner that it can hurt
no man, except he will confesse himself
to have done what he did <hi>obstinately</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fitz Herbert the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, pag. 111. &amp; p. 129.</note>
but where he setteth down the
charge of a Iustice of Peace against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
or Lollards, he giveth it home. But
<hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> hath the art to make Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
or Papists, of whom he list, so it serve
his present turn. Thirdly, though <hi>Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
and my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> had said nothing,
yet the case is as cleare as the light, that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40675:140"/>
this very Statute is Declarative of old Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Law not Enactive of new Law.</p>
               <p>And this I prove first by view of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
it self. He that hath but half an eye in
his head, may easily discern the difference
between an Enactive Statute and a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Satute. An Enactive Statute looketh
onely forward to the time to come, and
medleth not at all with the time past<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but a
declarative law looketh both wayes, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and forwards, forward to the time
to come and backward to the time
past. Again, the very from and tenour of
the words is not the same in an Enactive
Statute and in a Declarative Statute; An
Enactive Statute regardeth onely what
shall be, but a Declarative regardeth what
is and what hath been; an Enactive Statute
createth new Law by the authority of the
present Lawgiver, a Declarative Statute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
old Law, and is commonly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Fundamentall Constitution
of the Kingdome.<note place="margin">24. He. 8. cap. 12.</note> Now then let us take
a view of this very Law. <hi>By divers old
authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tick histories and Chronicles it is manifestly
declared, that this realm of England in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
and so hath been accepted in the world,
governed by one supreme head and King &amp;c.
unto whom a body Politick compact of all sorts
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40675:141"/>
and degrees of people, divided by names of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualty
and Temporalty, owe next to God a
naturall obedience, he being instituted by the
goodnesse of God, with plenary power to render
finall justice for all matters.</hi> You see plainly
that this Statute looketh both wayes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and backward, and doth not onely
create new Law, but also declare what
hath been, what is, and what ought to be
the perpetuall Law of <hi>England. By diverse
old authentick Histories and Chronicles it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
declared &amp;c.;</hi> then it is manifest that
this is a declarative Law.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>I quote the Schismaticall King
himself and the Schismaticall Parliament to
speake in their own behalf.</hi> By his leave,
he is mistaken, I ground not my reason
upon the Authority of the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but upon the form or tenour of
the Statute, whether these words doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the form of an Enactive Statute or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative
Statute. Secondly, if I did so,
yet he hath no reason to complain of it, who
maketh the Pope and his Councell to be
the last Iudge <hi>in his own</hi> case. Thirdly, I
shall be bold to scrue up this pin a note
higher, and tell him that if <hi>Henry</hi> the eight
did make himself the last Iudge, in those
differences between him and the Papacy,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40675:141"/>
which concerned the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>England,</hi> he did no more then many
other Christian Kings and Princes have
done before him; as I have shewed in the
Empire, <hi>Spain, Italy, Brabant</hi> &amp;c. Fourthly,
if that which was decreed in this Law, was
decreed in former Lawes standing in full
force and unrepealed, then it is not Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of new Law, but Declarative of old
Law: but I have produced him the Lawes
themselves, wherein the self same things
have been decreed, and he turneth his
back upon them, and referreth us to the
Canonists for an answer. Lastly, it, is so far
from being true, that those Statutes made
by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth were new Lawes, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
those ancient Statutes of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> of
<hi>Carlile, the Articles of the Clergy,</hi> the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>Provisors,</hi> were no new Lawes
when they were made: but new declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tall Lawes of <hi>England,</hi>
or of the Originall Constitution of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Empire; as appeareth undeniably by
the Statutes of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> the Statute of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi>
and the Statutes of <hi>Provisors;</hi> wherein
the same truth is affirmed as positively as I
can do it.</p>
               <p>But now, Reader, wilt thou see a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
proofe, of the extreme carelesnesse
and unconscionable oscitance of this great
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40675:142"/>
Champion, who writeth his answers at
Randome, and never so much as readeth
what is objected against him. I cited two
Statutes; the one of 24. Hen. 8. cap. 12.
the other of 16<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Ric. 2. cap. 5. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
citeth them right i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> the margent, but a
little confusedly: but when <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi>
commeth to answer them, he confoundeth
them indeed, attributing <hi>Richard</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
Statute to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. And
lest any man should excuse him and say
it was the fault of the Printer, heare him;
<hi>he alledgeth another Statute made in the 24. of
Henry the</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Yes, well guessed: otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the 16. of <hi>Richard</hi> the second. And a little
after, <hi>what maters it what this Statute sayes,
being made two yeares after his unlawfull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with</hi> Anna Bullen? I know not where
he learned this, except it was from the old
Puppet player, who would have Queen
<hi>Dido</hi> to be <hi>Richard</hi> the thirds Mistresse; he
might perchance have such another odde
Fancy that <hi>Richard</hi> the second was <hi>Anne
Bullens</hi> Servant. That which I observe in
earnest is this, that he answereth at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to he knoweth not what, and never
peruseth that which is objected against him.
If it had been some rare piece that was cited
that he could not have come by it, it had
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40675:142"/>
bene the more pardonable: but it is an
English Statute which he might have found
in every Bookebinders Shop, in every
Lawiers Study, in every Iustice of Peaces
Closet. And yet he is as confident as <hi>Gawen;
the best Statute he could pick out you may be sure.</hi>
How doth he know that? We all see he
never read it, nor knoweth whether it be a
Statute or no. Then he telleth us, <hi>there is
not a Syllable in it concerning Spirituall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
Well guessed by Instinct: but for
once his Instinct hath deceived him; if
Excommunication be any part of <hi>Spirituall
Iurisdiction,</hi> there is more then one Syllable
of Spirituall Iurisdiction in it. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our English Statutes both ancient
and new, which concern the casting of
Papall Authority out of the Kingdom,
I have given him a full satisfactory account
formerly, to which I refer him.</p>
               <p>We have seen how carelesse he is
in reading over Lawes before he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
them: Now let us observe the
same Oscitance or want of Ingenuity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Adversary, that he may learn
what he gets by his Falsifications
<q>Nempe hoc quod Veneri donatae a virgine puppae.</q>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:40675:143"/>
Reall falsifications retorted upon him in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead
of his feigned ones. He answered <hi>that
to limit an Authority, implyes an admittance
of it in cases to which the Limitation extends not.</hi>
I replyed, that these ancient Lawes of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
did not onely limit an Authority, but
deny it, that is deny it in such and such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
mentioned in the Lawes, deny it Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actively
in the exteriour Court without the
leave of the Soveraign Prince. So the
Lawes may differ, the restraints may differ,
the leave may differ in degrees, according
to the difference of places<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this denyall. That which he beateth
at is this, that <hi>we deny all Papall power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
but other Churches do onely limit it.</hi> I
answer, we doe not deny the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> all manner of power; We deny him
not the power of the Keys, we deny him
not any power purely Spirituall, we deny
him not his beginning of Vnity, if he could
he contended with it: but we deny him all
Coactive power in the Exteriour Court,
over the Subjects of other Princes, without
the Soveraigns leave. If some Princes give
more leave then others, as finding it more
expedient for their affaires; we doe not
envy it.</p>
               <p>But he urgeth, that <hi>I do not deny equivalent
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40675:143"/>
Lawes in France Spain Germany Italy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reply pa. 21.</note> I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny it nor affirm it, or I affirm it onely
in part [Yes, there are some such Lawes in
all these places by him mentioned, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not so many, but the Liberties of the
French Church are much the same with
the English]. <hi>Some such Lawes, not so many,
much the same,</hi> are no proofes of <hi>Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi>
or if he will call them <hi>Equivalent,</hi> it is
onely <hi>secundum quid</hi> not <hi>simpliciter,</hi> respecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
in some cases not vniversally in all
cases. But he hath another place, which
striketh home,<note place="margin">Vind. pa. 73.</note> where I affirm that [the lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
lawes may be found <hi>in Germany, Poland,
France, Spaine, Italy, Sicily,</hi> and if we will
trust <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> the Papacy it self]. But did
either I or <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> speak of those ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
English lawes by me cited, made to restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the Vsurpations of the Bishops of <hi>Rome?</hi>
So he saith, but it is a grosse Falsification.
I did neither speake of them in that place,
nor <hi>Padre Paolo:</hi> but we both speake of
another Law of a quite different nature
from these, that is the Law of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> a
Law meerly Politicall to restrain men from
giving Lands to the Church without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense.
Of this I said there are found like
Lawes to it in <hi>Germany, Poland, France,
Spain, Italy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> addeth in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40675:144"/>
the <hi>Papacy it self.</hi> What an Adversary have
I to deale with, who either understandeth
not what the Law of <hi>Mortmain</hi> is, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
not how he falsifieth his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
words?</p>
               <p>But from these mistaken and mishapen
premisses he draweth ten Conclusions,
every one of them driving me to a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or Absurdity at least<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
third and fourth are the same in effect,
or all comprehended in the first, that <hi>it is
opposite to the generall opinion of the whole world,
Catholicks, Protestants, Puritans.</hi> Secondly,
that <hi>it is against the profession of the Protestants,
who extoll that happy time when</hi> England <hi>was
freed from the yoke of</hi> Rome. Thirdly, that
<hi>it contradicts our Reformation in the point of the
Popes Supremacy, there could be no Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that which was not otherwise before; and
therefore</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth added something of
his own to these ancient Lawes.</hi> Fourthly, he
saith that Doctor Hammond <hi>acknowledgeth,
that Papall power was cast out of</hi> England <hi>in</hi>
Henry <hi>the eights dayes.</hi> And the sixth is, that
<hi>this Position is particularly opposite to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>onsent of the Catholick Countries, who all
looked on</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth and the Church
of</hi> England <hi>ever since as Schismaticall.</hi>
Doubtlesse he meaneth Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Countries. Was it not enough to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40675:144"/>
say that it was Contrary to the Generall
opinion of the whole world, unlesse he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Protestants, and Reformers, and <hi>Doctor
Hammond,</hi> and Roman Catholicks, as if
they were none of the world? Reader, I
undertooke to prove that He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ry the eighths
Lawes against the Vsurpations of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Bishop, were no new Lawes, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Lawes of <hi>England;</hi> I have done it by
producing the ancient Lawes themselves,
five or six hundred yeares old: and I am
yet ready to shew further, that they were
no new Lawes then, but the Fundamentall
Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> derived from the first
founding of the British and English Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as to the substance of them. To all
my premisses or <hi>particularities</hi> (as he calleth
them) he hath been able to answer nothing,
but <hi>leaves them to the Canon and Secular Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers
to scuffle about them:</hi> but he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
my Conclusion, what an absurdity
that is, he is not ignorant.</p>
               <p>But alas! what doth the world know of
the Municipall Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> untill
we instruct them better? and what Opinion
can Forreiners have of us, but what they
learn from him and his Fellowes? We
acknowledge with <hi>Doctor Hammond,</hi> that
Papall Vsurpations were cast out of <hi>England</hi>
in Henry the eights time: but we adde, not
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40675:145"/>
by the Creation of new Lawes, but by the
vigorous execution of the ancient Lawes,
being first renewed and confirmed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
We acknowledge that <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth did finally shake of the yoke of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which could not have been done, if
there had been nothing to have been sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of or reformed: but this doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
but that his Predecessors did attempt to
shake it of long before, even at the first
appearing of it; yea and did actually shake
it of, for a time, in a great part.</p>
               <p>His fifth Objection is, that <hi>according to
me the Lawes made by</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, did no
more then the former Lawes.</hi> Where did I say
so? untill he is able to shew it me, (which
I shall expect at the Greek Calends,)
I shall score it up among his lesser Falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And for his inference which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
that <hi>he never heard it pretended, that they
did shake of the Roman yoke in part, or for a
time, therefore they did it not;</hi> it sheweth but
his ignorance in the Lawes and histories of
his native Country. If he had perused them
diligently, he might have observed how the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and Crown of <hi>England,</hi> were
long upon their Gards watching one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and the one or the other gained or lost
mutually, according to the Vigour of their
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40675:145"/>
present Kings or Popes, or according to
the exigence of the times.</p>
               <p>His seventh Objection, that <hi>the like Lawes to
ours in England were made in the Papacy it self,
but those could not be against the Popes Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Church:</hi> and his tenth Objection
that <hi>then there never was a Papist Country in
the world, because equivale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t Lawes to ours were
made in France Spaine Italy Sicily Gormany
Poland, &amp;c:</hi> and his answer to my demand
[what law full Iur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sdiction could remaine
to the Pope in <hi>England,</hi> where such and
such Lawes had force?] <hi>The same that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
still to him in France Spaine Italy where
the like lawes are in force,</hi> in his last para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph;
are a dish of unsavoury mushromes,
all sprung up from his own negligent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
or wilfull Falsification (let him
chuse whether he will) in confounding the
Lawes of <hi>Mortmain</hi> with the other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
against the Popes Vsurpations;<note place="margin">Vind. pa 71.</note>
Which I distinguished exactly both at
the beginning of that discourse [the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Mortmain justified]</hi> and at the
Conclusion <hi>[But to leave this Digression.]</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vind. pa 74.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But besydes this grosse errour, there
want not other inconsequences and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in his discourse; as in his seventh
Objection from the Popes particular
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40675:146"/>
Headship of his own Church, to an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Headship over the Catholick
Church, and from an Headship of order to
a Monarchicall Headship of power; and in
his tenth Objection from [like lawes] to
the same Lawes, from Lawes made to
Lawes duely observed. We had Lawes
made against Non-conformists in <hi>England,</hi>
will he conclude thence that we have<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> no
Non-conformists in England? the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would hold better the Contrary way,
<hi>Ex malis moribus bonae leges.</hi> And in his last
Paragraph, from Coactive Iurisdiction in
the Exteriour Court to Iurisdiction purely
Spirituall in the Court of Conscience; and
from Coactive Iurisdiction with the leave
of the Prince to the same without Leave.
Wee see all Roman Catholick Countries,
doe stint the Popes Coactive Iurisdiction
over their Subjects more or lesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their severall Liberties, which they
could not doe at all, if he held it by Christs
own Ordination.</p>
               <p>His eighth Objection, that <hi>upon this new
Law made</hi> by <hi>Henry the eighth, England stood
at another distance then formerly from</hi> Rome;
is a Fallacy <hi>non causae pro causa,</hi> when a false
cause is assigned for a true cause. Our
just Lawes are not the right cause of our
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40675:146"/>
distance from <hi>Rome:</hi> but the Popes unjust
Censures, and that Character which some
of our Countrimen give of us. But this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is greater among the Populacy then
between the Estates, who do not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Popes Censures either in making
or observing of Leagues.</p>
               <p>To his ninth Objection in his order, and
his last in my order, that this <hi>Posi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>on takes
away the Question, and makes all the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertists
in</hi> England <hi>on both sides talke in the aire,
because it makes the Pope to have had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
there to be cast out.</hi> I answer, I wish it
did, but it doth not. The Pope had Authority
there, and Authority usurped fit to be cast
out, notwithstanding our former good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.
But yet I must confesse this Position
doth much change the Question, from spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Iurisdiction in the inner Court to
Coactive Iurisdiction in the exteriour
Court, and makes him and many other such
Controvertists talk in the aire, who dispute
onely about Headships and First Mover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
when the true Controversy lieth in
point of Interest and profit.</p>

He never read or quite forgetteth the State

               <p>Secondly, he pleadeth <hi>that for this many

the words of the Councell.</p>
               <p>Yet he asketh, <hi>what do the Scots concern the

not? Are not the Scots a part of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannick
Ilands, and so comprehended under
the name of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this
Question? Besides he must know that I
challenge some Interest among the Irish
Scots, from whom I derive my Episcopall
Orders. Against the Irish Ordination
never any man had any pretense of Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Scots a Colony derived from them.
That they are the ancient Scots, who did
join with the Britons in not submitting to
the See of Rome, I shall shew him clearly
from the Authority of <hi>Lawrence,</hi> Successor
to <hi>S. Austin</hi> in his Archbishoprick, and

They who had their first Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Ordeined among themselves, never had any
Ordination from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
consequently were never subject to the
Iurisdiction of the Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> For it
is a Maxime in the Law, and is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

And if it were not so, yet what
man in his right wits could Imagin, that
the <hi>Scots</hi> who were the Converters, should

Negative as this is: but the burthen

did depend upon the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in

and Iurisdiction; which he is not

Ordination is nothing at all to Iurisdiction,</hi> is
for want of Vnderstanding, because he is
not able to distinguish between <hi>the right of
Ordination,</hi> and the <hi>Act of Ordeining.</hi> We
attribute to the Scots the Act of Ordeining,
not a Superiour right of Ordination.</p>

subject to the Pope as to the Bishop of their

Bishop of an Apostolicall Church, that is,
to be guided by his grave advise and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
but I deny that ever the Saxon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were subject to the Pope, as to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute

or that the Pope enjoyed the Soveraign
Patronage of the Saxon Church, or the

and their Bishops under the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> ever enjoyed,
as the Britons did before them: and this
is all which our Kings desire, or we claime
for them. If he have any thing to say to

as if some French men comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>I said [the Saxon Conquest gave them as

were impowered by the British Bishops, or else
let me confesse that they could inherit no Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

Episcopall Ordination from the ancient

And many English Bishops have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their orders mediatly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or immediatly

               <p>I said most truely, that <hi>before he can allege
the Authority of the Councell of</hi> Sardica <hi>for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales
to</hi> Rome, <hi>he must renounce the divine
institution of the Papacy,</hi> or at least the divine
right of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Papacy:
<hi>because that Canon submitted it to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Fathers, and grounded it upon the
Memory of</hi> St. Peter, <hi>not the Institution of
Christ.</hi> The reason of this Consequence is
most evident. For the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi>
would not, nor could have submitted that
which is the Popes right, by Christs own
Ordination, to the good pleasure of the
Fathers, whether he should have it or
not; nor would have assigned their respect
to the Memorie of <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> for a
ground of that for which they had
the Commandement of Christ: But
the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> did submit
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40675:152"/>
the Popes right to receive Appeales, to the
good pleasure of the Fathers, <hi>Placetne?
doth it please you that we honour the memory of</hi>
St. Peter? Therefore, they did not hold
this right of the Pope to receive Appeales, to
be due to the Pope by Christs own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
or Commandement: This he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to call, <hi>a flat Falsification of the Councell,
there being not a word in it, either concerning
Papall power it self or its institution, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Appeales onely.</hi> I am grown pretty
well acquainted with his Falsifications.
Did I say there was any thing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
concerning the Papacy or Institution
of it? If I did, let him tell us where and
when, or els it is his own Falsification. But
by his own Confession, there is something
in the Councell concerning Appeales to the
Pope, and this is submitted by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
to the good pleasure of the Fathers, and
no higher ground assigned for it, then the
respect to the Memory of <hi>St. Peter:</hi> yet this
right of receiving Appeales is made by him
and all his Partakers, an Essentiall Branch
of Papall power. Therefore if he and his
Partakers say true, the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi>
did submit an Essentiall Branch of Papall
Power, (or Papall power in part,) to the
good pleasure of the Fathers; which is as
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40675:152"/>
much as to say they held it not to be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution. By this time I hope he
understandeth my meaning better.</p>
               <p>He presumeth, that <hi>some British Bishops
sate in Councell of Sardica;</hi> it may be <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>

that <hi>they assented to the Sardican Canon about
Appeales.</hi> It may be, or it may not be.
I should rather assent to their voting to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<hi>Athanasius,</hi> who testifieth of them that
<hi>they were right to the Nicene Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. ad Iovinia.</note> But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among all the Subscibers in the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dican
Councell, there is not one British
Bishop named. And in the Synodall
Letters of the Councell it self, wherein
they reckon all the Provinces, <hi>Britain</hi> is not
named. But what is the right of receiving
Appeales, to an Vniversall Monarchy, or
the decree of a Councell, to Christs own
Ordination? If we would be contented to
abrogate our old Lawes, and give the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

or favour to the <hi>Arrians</hi> (as for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianisme,
the <hi>Sardican</hi> Fathers did no more
then the <hi>Nicene</hi> had done before them):
but out of another Consideration, because
the presence of the five great Patriarchs
with their respective Bishops, or at least
the greater part of them, was ever more
held necessary to the being of a Generall
Councell; as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confesseth
that <hi>the seventh Synod judged the Councell of</hi>

no General Councell,<note place="margin">Bel. de Con. li. 1. ca. 17.</note> because it had not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs

had been a Generall Councell, why doe
<hi>St. Gregory</hi> the great, <hi>Isiodore</hi> and <hi>Venerable

Councells? Why did <hi>St. Austin, Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
and the <hi>African Fathers</hi> sleight it? And
which is more then all this, why doe the
Eastern Church, not reckon it among their
seven Generall Councells, nor the western

Councells? To Conclude, why did the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

and the second of <hi>Chalcedon?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apud Spelm. an. 680. p. 169.</note> Here he
may see a plain reason, why I say the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Sardica</hi> was never incorporated into
the English Lawes. I would know, whether
he or I be of the old English Religion in
this point; The five First Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
were incorporated into the Law of
<hi>England:</hi> but the Councell of Sardica
was none of them, Therefore no Generall
Councell. I have given him a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
concerning this Councell Sect. 1, c. 7.
to which I refer him.</p>
               <p>I said, and I said most truely, that the
Canons of the <hi>Sardican</hi> Councell touching
Appeales were never received in <hi>England,</hi>
nor incorporated into our English Lawes.
For proofe hereof, I bring him an evident
demonstration out of the Fundamentall
Law of <hi>England,</hi> as it is recorded in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Memoriall of Clarendon: All Appeales
in</hi> England <hi>must proceed regularly from the
Archdeacon to the Bishop, from the Bishop to
the Archbishop, and if the Archbishop
failed to doe Iustice, the last complaint must
be to the King, to give Order for redresse.</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:40675:154"/>
Our Ancestours had not so much respect
for Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> nor thought appeales to

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I said, [the Canon of the Councell of</hi>
Sardica, <hi>was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tradicted after by the Great
Councell of</hi> Chalcedon]. <hi>He rejuneth
that</hi> I neither thought the words worth citing, nor
the Canon where the Abrogation of the Sardican
Canon is found worth mentioning. <hi>Pardon me,
I said nothing of Abrogation, but I did say
it contradicted it: and for proofe of the
truth of what I said, take the very words
of two Canons of that Councell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Chalc. par. 2. Act. 14. cap. 9.</note> But if a
Clerk have a cause against his own Bishop, or
against another Bishop, let him be Iudged by
the Synod of the Province: but if a Bishop or a
Clerke have a Complaint against the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
of the same Province, let him repaire
either to the Primate of the Diocesse, or the See
of their royall City of Constantinople, aend let
him be judged there. <hi>Wee see every Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that is to say, every Patriarch in

and the Patriarch of</hi> Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople
<hi>in particular out of his own Diocesse,
is equalled by the Councell of</hi> Chalcedon
<hi>to the Bishop of</hi> Rome. <hi>The same in
effect is decreed in the seventeenth Canon,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40675:154"/>
that if there shall happen any Difference
concerning the Possessions of the Churches,</hi>
it shall be lawfull to them who affirm themselves
to be grieved, to sue before the Holy Synod of the
Province: <hi>but if any man be grieved by</hi> his
Metropolitan, let him be judged by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of the Diocesse, or by the holy See of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have read those silly Evasions, which
your greatest Schollars are forced to make
use of, for answers to these downright Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.
Sometimes by Primate of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
(which signifieth all Patriarchs) they
understand and the Pope. Do men use such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
expressions, which no man can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
in penning of Lawes? Is it not
a great Condiscension for the Visible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of all Christendome, to stoupe to so
meane a Title as the Primate of one single
Diocesse. But alas, it will do him no good!
For if it were taken in this sense, it were the
most uniust Canon in the world, to deprive
all Patriarchs of their Patriarchall Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
except the Patriarch of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Councell which is so
carefull to preserve the Bishop his right, and
the Metropolitan his right, could not be
so carelesse to destroy Patriarchall right; or
the Patriarchs themselves, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40675:155"/>
at the making of this Canon, so stupid
to joine in it.</p>
               <p>At other times they tell us that this is to
be understood onely of the first Instance,
not of Appeales. This is weaker and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
What hath a Metropolitan to doe
with private causes of the first instance, out
of his own Bishoprick? What have the
Patriarchs of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> to doe,
to Iudge causes of the first Instance in
other Patriarchates? The case is cleare: if
any man be grieved by his Bishop he may
appeale to his Metropolitan and a Synod;
and if any man be grieved by his Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
he may appeale to his Patriarch.
And if this absurd se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>se (which they Imagin)
were true, yet the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
might receive Appeales, from all parts of
the world, as well as the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Let them winde, and wrest, and turn things
as they can, they shall never be able to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>concile

belongeth to a Bishop, as well as the Key

Bishop of an Apostolicall Church, as Pope
<hi>Celestine</hi> was, and in such a case as that was
(the Pelagian Controversy) to testify the

between actuall Ordination, and a right to

was no precedent Obligation for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be ordeined, by that Bishop, doth
imply no Iurisdiction at all: but if there was
a precedent right in the Ordeiner to ordein
that man, and a precedent Obligation in
the person Ordeined to be ordeined by that
Bishop, then it doth imply all manner of
Iurisdiction, suitable to the Quality of the
Ordeiner; as if he were a Patriarch all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
Iurisdiction, if he were a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
all Metropoliticall Iurisdiction, if
he were a Bishop all Episcopall Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And the Inference holdeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
on the Contrary side, that where there
is no right precedent to Ordein, nor Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to be ordeined, there is no Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
followeth: but I shewed out of our
own Histories, and out of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters
so far as they are set down by <hi>Plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
that the Bishop of Rome had no right to
ordein our British Primates, but that they
were ordeined at home; and therefore
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40675:157"/>
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> could have no juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over them.</p>
               <p>I said no more of <hi>Phocas</hi> but this, that [the
Popes prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ses were more from <hi>Phocas</hi> then
<hi>St. Peter.]</hi> He referreth me to his answer to
<hi>Doctor Hammond.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pa. 1. Sect. 6.</note> And I refer him to <hi>Doctor
Hammond</hi> for a reply, as Impertinent to
my present businesse.</p>
               <p>When I did first apply my thoughts to a
sad Meditation upon this Subject, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
ingenuously, that which gave me the
most trouble was to satisfy my self fully
about the Popes Patriarchate: but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that which had been a cause of my
trouble, proved a meanes of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>inall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
For seing it is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
I concluded that he could not be a
Spirituall Monarch. The reasons of my
Resolution I have set down, and received
no answer: Yet it shall not seem irksome to
me to repeat them, as desiring nothing but
the discovery of the truth. First I argue thus,
The Soveraign Government and the Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Government, of the same person in
the same Society, or body Politick or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick,
is inconsistent: But the Popes
pretended Monarchy or Supremacy of
power over the whole Church, and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40675:157"/>
Dignity in the same Church, are
a Soveraign and Subordinate Government
of the same person in the same body Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick.
The reason of the Major is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Soveraign power is single of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Society: but this subordinate power
is conjoint of fellow Patriarchs. Soveraign
Power is Vniversall, but this subordinate
power is particular. And therefore as a
Quadrangle cannot be a Triangle, nor a
King a Sherif of a Shire or a President of a
Province within his own Kingdome: so
neither can the same person be an Vniversall
Monarch and a particular Patriarch.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Spirituall Soveraignty of
the Roman Bishop is pretended to be by
divine right, his Patriarchall power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
by humane right: but a Spirituall
Soveraignty by divine right and an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
dignity by humane right are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent.
As it is absurd to say that God
should make a man a Prince, and after the
people make him a Peer: or God should
give him a Greater Dignity, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ferre a lesse upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a Soveraignty above the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s,
besides the Canons, against the Canons, to
make them, to abrogate them, to suspend
them with a <hi>Non obstante,</hi> to dispense with
them at pleasure, where the Canon gives
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40675:158"/>
no dispensative power. and a Subjection to
the Canons to be able to do nothing against
them are inconsistent<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>h a Soveraign
Power is above the Canons, and such a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
power is subject to the Canons
Therefore they are inconsistent.</p>
               <p>All the answer he offereth to these two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
the one that <hi>Bishop</hi> Vsher <hi>was at
once Bishop of</hi> Armagh, <hi>and as such the Bishop
of</hi> Derries <hi>superiour.</hi> I answer, first he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staketh
much, The Primacy of <hi>Ireland</hi> and
the Archbishoprick of <hi>Armagh</hi> are not two
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>inct dignities, but one and the self same
dignitie: but the Monarchicall power of
the Pope by divine right, and his Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
power by Humane right, are two
distinct dignities. Secondly, the Primate
of <hi>Ireland</hi> is not indowed with Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
power: but all the difficulty here lieth
in the Conjunction of Monarchicall power
and Subordinate power. His other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>must a person leave of to be Master of
his own Family<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> because he is made King, and
his Authority extendeth over all England.</hi> I
answer, first his Argument is <hi>a transition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another kind,</hi> or an excursion from one
kind of power to another; from Politicall
power in the Commonwealth to an Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall
power in the Family. Secondly
it is one thing to make an inferiour person
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40675:158"/>
a King, and another thing to make a King
a Constable, or to make Soveraignty and
Subordination consist together. When a
King doth discharge the place of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of an Army he acquireth no new dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or power or place, no man calleth him
my lord Generall; but he doth it as a King
by his Kingly power, to which no higher
or larger power can be added: but the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop
of <hi>Rome</hi> did not, doth not exercise
Patriarchall power, by virtue of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
by divine Ordination, but by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
right; first by Custome or prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and then by authority of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Nice.</hi> All the world seeth and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
more power in his Bishoprick then he hath
out of it in the rest of his Province; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d more
power in his Province, then he hath out
of it in his Patriarchate, and more power
in his own Patriarchate, then he hath in
anothers Patriarchate: but if he had a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
of Power and Iurisdiction by
Christs own Ordination, he should have
the same power every where; if he had a
Soveraignty of Power and Iurisdiction by
Christs own Ordination, then all Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archall
power should flow from him, as
from the Originall Fountain of all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
honour. But the Contrary is most
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40675:159"/>
apparent, that all the Patriarchs, even the
Roman himself, did owe their Patriarchall
power to the Customes of the Church, and
Canons of the Fathers. These are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why I conceive Monarchicall Power
and Patriarchall power, to be inconsistent
in one and the same perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: But the Pope was
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fessedly a Patriarch, therefore no Monarch.</p>
               <p>The next thing which commeth to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
is his Exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s to <hi>Dionothus</hi> the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Abbat of <hi>Bangor</hi> his a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>swer to <hi>Austin,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing

except of Brotherly love, to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome.</hi> His first exception was the
naming of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> [Pope] without
any Addition of Name or place, contrary to
the use of those times. For a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>swer I committed
him and his Friend <hi>Bellarmine</hi> together, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the word Pope is put alone the Bishop of Rome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be understood,<note place="margin">Bell. li. 2. de Rom. Pont. cap. 31.</note> as appeareth out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>[the most blessed and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
man the Pope doth command us this,] without
adding</hi> Leo <hi>or</hi> Rome <hi>or the City of</hi> Rome <hi>or any
other thing.</hi> He sleighteth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me for folly, to think that Catholick
writers cannot disagree, and answereth the
<hi>Councell</hi> that <hi>thought the word</hi> [Pope] <hi>be alone
without Addition, Yet which is equivalent, the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40675:159"/>
Comitant Circumstances sufficiently indigitate
the person. For the words were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by</hi> Boniface
<hi>the Popes Vicegerent.</hi> As if there were not the
same indigitating Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>stances here as well
as there, the words being spoken by <hi>Austin</hi>
the Popes Legate and Vicar as well as <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
in the name of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
which were answered here by <hi>Dinoth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His second exception to <hi>Dinoths</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is, that there was no such Bishoprick
as <hi>Caerleon</hi> in those dayes, the See being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from <hi>Caerleon</hi> to <hi>Menevia</hi> or <hi>S. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi>
fifty yeares before this. That it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
before this I acknowledge, but how
long before this is uncertain. Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
make S. <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>S. David,</hi> to
have died on one Day s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>me years after this
meeting. And it is an usuall thing for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
to have two names, as the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick
of <hi>Ossory</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny</hi> is the same Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>he Bishoprick of <hi>Kerry</hi> and <hi>Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert</hi>
is the same Bishoprick. The See of <hi>Derry</hi>
was long removed from <hi>Ardstrath</hi> to Derry,
before it was commonly called the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick
of Derry; and so was <hi>Lindesfern</hi> to <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
I produced two witnesses for this very
Place of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> that it still reteined the old
name. The one the British History, <hi>Then
died</hi> David <hi>the most holy Archbishop of</hi> Caerleon
<hi>in the City of</hi> Menevia. And yet it is thought,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40675:160"/>
that the first removall of the See was made
by <hi>Dubritius to Landaff,</hi> and after from <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daffe</hi>
to <hi>Menevia</hi> by <hi>St. David,</hi> at whose
death it was stiled the Archbishoprick of
<hi>Caerleon.</hi> The other witness was <hi>Geraldus
Cambrensis, we had at</hi> Menevia <hi>five and twenty
Archbishops of</hi> Caerleon <hi>successively whereof</hi>
St. David <hi>was the First.</hi> He takes no notice
of the first Testimony, and puffes at the
second and sleights it:<note place="margin">p. 504.</note> but answereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Materiall, but that which will cut the
throat of his cause, <hi>Had</hi> Caerleons <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi>
(saith he) <hi>onely for some conveniency,
resided at</hi> Menevia, <hi>and the right of Iurisdiction
still belonged to Caerleon, it might more easily be
conceived fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sible.</hi> Take notice then that the
Bishops of <hi>Caerleon</hi> did remove from a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
City in those dayes, (as <hi>Caerle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
or the City of the Roman Legion was)
to <hi>Menevia</hi> onely for the conveniency of a
solitary life and contemplative devotion;
and it is more then p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>obable that the active
part of his Iurisdiction was still executed
at <hi>Caerleon.</hi> The See is changed so soone
as the Church is builded: but the City will
require longer time, to be fitted for Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
and furnished. All that he opposeth
to this, is that <hi>it was ordinarily called the
Bishoprick of</hi> Menevia. Who douhteth of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40675:160"/>
it? but that doth not prove that it was not
also called <hi>Caerleon.</hi> It was First the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of <hi>Caerleon</hi> alone, then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of <hi>Caerleon or Menevia</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
afterward the Bishoprick of <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
or <hi>St. Davids</hi> indifferently, and now
the Bishoprick of <hi>St. Davids</hi> onely. He
carpeth at the name of <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>Vske.</hi>
Why so? why not as well <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon
<hi>Vske,</hi> as <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> or <hi>Newark</hi>
upon <hi>Trent,</hi> or <hi>Newcastle</hi> upon <hi>Tine?</hi> Where
there are severall Cities of one name, as
there were Caerlegions or Cities of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Legions in Brittain, it is ever usuall to
give them such a marck of Distinction.</p>
               <p>But why doth he wrangle about names
and persecute an innocent paper after this
manner? The thing is sure enough, that
there was one <hi>Dinoth</hi> a learned Abbat of
<hi>Bangor</hi> at that time, who did oppose <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>
and stand for the Iurisdiction of his

               <head type="sub">That the King and Church of England
had sufficient Authority to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
their obedience from Rome.</head>
               <p>The sixth Chapter of my Vindication
comprehended my fourth ground consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of these three particulars. That the
King and Church of <hi>England</hi> had sufficient
Authority to reform the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
That they had sufficient Grounds for doing
it, And that they did it with due modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
His Rejoinder to this my fourth
ground is divided into three Sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this is the first. Whatsoever he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in this Section of my <hi>shuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the whole Question,</hi> by balking the Bishop of
<hi>Romes</hi> divine right to his Soveraignty of
power, to treat of his Patriarchall right,
which is humane; is first vain, For I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
was and still am ready to joine Issne
with him concerning the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi>
divine right to a Monarchicall power in the
Church; saving alwaies to myself and my
cause this advantage, That a Monarchy
and a Patriarchate of the same person in
the same Body Ecclesiasticall are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent.
And this right being saved, I shall
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40675:164"/>
more willingly join issue with him about
the Popes Monarchy, then about his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate.
Secondly as it is vaine, so it is
altogether impertinent, for my Ground is
this, that a Soveraign Prince hath power
within his own Dominions for the publick
good, to change any thing in the externall
Regiment of the Church, which is not of
divine Institution: but the Popes pretended
Patronage of the English Church, and his
Legislative Iudiciary and dispensative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in the exteriour Courtes of the same
Church, doe concern the externall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, aud are not of divine
Institution. Here the Hindge of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
doth move, without encombring
our selves at all with Patriarchall Authority.
Thirdly I say, that this discourse is not onely
vaine and extravagant, but is likewise false;
The Popes Protopatriarchall power, and
the Authority of a Bishop of an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Church as the keper of Apostolicall
Traditions deposited in that Church, are
the fairest flowers in his Garland. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
power he pretendeth to, over the
whole Church of Christ, above a Primacy
of Order, is altogether of humane right; and
the Application of that Primacy to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome</hi> is altogether of humane right.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40675:165"/>
And whatsoever he presumeth of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Tradition of the Christian Church,
or <hi>the Notion which the former and present
world, and we our selves before the Reformation
had of the Papacy,</hi> that is, of the Divine
right of the Popes Soveraignty, is but a
bold, ratling, groundlesse bragge. I did
and doe affirm, that the Pope hath quitted
his Patriarchichall power above a thousand
yeers since; not explicitly, by making a
formall Resignation of it, but implicitly,
by assuming to himself a power which is
inconsistent with it.</p>
               <p>I was contented to forbeare further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
about Patriarchall rights, upon two
Conditions; one that he should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that the Pope is a Spirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
without proving it. The other
that he should not attempt to make Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
Privileges, to be Royall Prerogatives.
This by one of his peculiar Idiotisms he
calleth <hi>Bribing of me.</hi> If he had had, so
much Civility in him, he might rather
have interpreted it a gentle forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of him, of two Errours which I
was sure he would Commit. After all his
Bravadoes, all that he hath pretended to
prove, is but a <hi>Headship,</hi> a <hi>First Movership,</hi>
a <hi>Chief Governourship,</hi> about which we have
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40675:165"/>
no Difference with them: and all the proofe
he bringeth even of that, is a bold presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that there is such an immediate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
There is not so much as a Nationall
Tradition, for those Branches of Papall
power which we have rejected, and much
lesse for the divine right of them. And if
there were such a Particular Tradition, yet
wanting both perpetuity and Vniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
we deny that it is a sufficient proofe
of any right. This and the Privilege to
receive Appeales, which is a Protopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triachall
Privilege, is all he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.</p>
               <p>If he would know what a Spirituall
Monarch is, let him consult with <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
de Visibili Monarchia,</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>

                     </gap>fice Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano.</hi>
But he is quite out of his aime, who
knoweth no meane between a <hi>flat Tyrant</hi>
and <hi>an Ordinary Chief Governour.</hi> Vpon these
Termes a President of a Councell, a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a College, a Major of a Corporation
should be so many Monarchs. I have
shewed him what are those Branches of
Soveraign Monarchicall Power which the
Popes have Vsurped, and when each Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did begin, (the first of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> about 1100.
yeares after Christ,) with the Opposition
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40675:166"/>
that was made unto them by the King and
Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> If he will speake to
the purpose, let him speake to these in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and trouble us no more with his
Chief Governourships, or hold his peace
for ever. All the Controversy between
them and us is in point of Interest, and the
Externall Regiment of the Church, which
is due to every Christian Soveraigne in his
own Kingdome. It is not we, but they
who have changed their Governour.</p>
               <p>He would faine perswade us if he could,
that <hi>no Catholick will believe that a Patriarch
is dependent on a King in Ecclesiasticall affaires:</hi>
yet he himself hath confes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as these were objected to Princes or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
in <hi>England;</hi> Secondly, we desire not the
extirpation of the Papacy, but the reduction
of it to the Primitive Constitution. Thirdly;
Monarchy and Episcopacy are of divine
Institution, so is not Papall Soveraignty
of Iurisdiction. To the first he saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but by way of Recrimination, the
most ignoble kind of answering, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when he himself cannot but condemne
them in his own Conscience, for notorious
Fictions of Cretian <hi>Minotaures:</hi> But these
abuses which we complain of, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
subject of the next Section.</p>
               <p>He is here pleased to relate a pretty story
of the late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury, that
he confessed himself to lein a Schisme, in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
discourse</hi> (I warrant it was private
enough, without either witnesse or parties)
as this Author <hi>was told by a very grave person,
whose Candour he hath no reason to suspect.</hi>
And why doth this grave person appeare
in a Vizard without a name, or appeare after
the parties death, that durst not have said it

                  </gap>fetime, and for feare to be detected
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40675:168"/>
now telleth us it was in private? And when
all is done, it is ten to one this worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(if he be <hi>in rerum natura)</hi> is an utter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and of another Communion. We have
had many abhominable lies spread abroad
in the world, upon the bare Testimony of
some such single Adversary; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy

Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> and that witnesse, knew
right well he never did in the presence of
any other, nor ever durst offer to him any
discourse of that nature.</p>
               <p>To the second he answereth, that <hi>we have
already ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>

never challenged, never exercised, never
medled withall; which the Church never
granted, never disposed. He might still for

of Order, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g as the Church thought
fit to continue it to that See, if this would
content him.</p>
               <p>To my third reason he excepteth. <hi>If Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
be of Divine Institution, the Venetians and
the</hi> Hollanders <hi>are in a sad case.</hi> I am glad
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40675:168"/>
when I find any thing in him that hath but
a resemblance of matter, more then wind
and empty words, although they weigh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
when they come to be examined. The
<hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> may be in a sad
Condition, in the Opinion of such rash
Censurers as himself is, who have learned
their Theology and Politicks but by the
halues. Who taught him to argue from the
Position of one lawfull forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the Deniall of another? All law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Formes of Government are warranted
by the Law of Nature, and so have their
Institution from God in the Law of Nature;
<hi>The Powers that be are ordained of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be Monarchicall, or Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
or Democraticall, Man prepareth
the Body, God infuseth the Soule of Power,
which is the same in all Lawfull Formes.</p>
               <p>But though all lawfull Formes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
be warranted by the law of nature,
yet not all in the same Degree of Eminency.
There is but one soule in the body, one
Sun in the heaven, one Maister in a Family,
and anciently one Monarch in each Society:
all the first Governours were Kings. The
soule of Soveraign Power is the same in all
Formes, but the Organ is more apt to attain
its end in one Form then another; in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy
then in Aristocracy or Democracy.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40675:169"/>
And we say God and Nature doe alwaies
intend that which is best. Thus it is in the
Law of Nature, which is warrant sufficient
for any form of Government: but in the
Positive Law of God, he never instituted
or authorised any form but Monarchy.</p>

So my Assertion be evidently true,
I weigh not his groundlesse Calumnies. Let
any man looke upon our Grieva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ces, and the
Grounds of our Reformation, 1. the intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
extortion of the Roman Court, 2. the
unjust Vsurpations of the Roman Court, 3.
the malignant influence of the Roman
Court upon the body politick, 4. the like
malignant influence of the Roman Court
upon the body Ecclesiastick, 5. and lastly the
Violation of ancient Liberties and Exemti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Roman Court; and he can not
doubt from whence we made our Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All our sufferings were from the Roman
Court; then why should we seek for ease
but where our Shoe did wring us? And as
our Grieva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ces, so our Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> was onely
of the Abuses of the Roman Court; Their
bestowing of prelacies and dignities in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:40675:170"/>
to the prejudice of the right patrons;
Their Convocating Synods in <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings leave; Their prohibiting
English Prelates to make their old Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dall
Oaths to the King, and obliging them to
take new Oaths of Fidelity to the Pope;
Their imposing and receiving Tenths and
First fruits, and other arbitrary Pensions
upon the English Clergy; And lastly their
usurping a Legislative Iudiciary and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative
Power in the exteriour Court by
Politicall Coaction. These are all the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Papall power which we have rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
This Reformation, is all the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that we have made in point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline.
And for Doctrine, we have no
Difference with them about the old Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls
of Christian Religion: And their
new Essentialls which they have patched to
the Creed, are but their erroneous or at the
best probable Opinions, no Articles of Faith.</p>
               <p>He is still bragging of his <hi>Demonstrations,</hi>
(yet they are but blind Enthymematicall
Paralogismes, wherein he maketh sure to
set his best legge formost, and to conceale
the lamenesse of his Discourse as much as he
can from the eyes of the Reader) and still
calling upon us for <hi>rigorous Demonstration.</hi> I

<hi>rigorous Demonstration</hi> is in Logick, for no
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40675:171"/>
other Demonstration is rigorous, but that
which proceedeth according to the strict
Rules of Logick, either <hi>a priore</hi> or <hi>a poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riore,</hi>
from the cause or the effect: And this
Cause in Difference between us (whether
those Branches of power which the Pope
claimeth and we have rejected, be the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Christ or Papall Vsurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s) is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of such rigorous Demonstration, but

                  </gap>derstand
convincing proofes, those grounds which I
offer in this Section do contain a <hi>rigorous
Demonstration.</hi> That Discipline which is
brimfull of intollerable Rapine, and Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Simony, and Sacrilege; which
robbeth Kings, and Subjects Ecclesiasticall
and Secular, of their just rights; which was
introduced into the Church of England,
eleven hundred yeares after Christ; which
hath a Malignant Influence upon the
Body Politick; which is Destructive to
the right ends of Ecclesiasticall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
which in stead of securing men
in peace doth thrust them into Manifest
and manifold Dangers, both of soule and
body; which is contrary to Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
and the ancient Liberties of particular
Churches: <hi>qua talis, as it is such,</hi> is no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40675:171"/>
of Christ, but ought to be purged and
reformed from all such abuses and Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s:
But such is that Papall Discipline, which
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> excercised in <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reformation, and lesse then which
they will not goe; and such are all those
Branches of Papall power which we have
cast out.</p>
               <p>The truth of this Assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> I have made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in my Vindication c. 6, and this is the
place of a further examination of it, if he
did discharge the part of a faire solid Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;
to leave his windy Invectives, which
signify nothing to the cause, but to his own
shame, and to proceed closely and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to the investigation of truth without
prejudice or partiality. But on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he minceth my grounds, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them, and skippeth over whatsoever
disliketh him, and choppeth them and cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them, and confoundeth them, that I
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not know mine own Conceptions againe
as he hath dressed them, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d disordered them,
and mutilated them. I proposed five distinct
Grounds of our Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d casting out
so many Branches as we did of Papall
power; if he dealt like a just Adversary, he
should pursue my Method step by step: but
he reduceth my five grounds into three,
that between two Methods he may
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40675:172"/>
conceale and smother whatsoever he hath
no disposition to answer, as he dealeth
with many points of weight and moment,
and particularly with all those Testimonies
and instances I bring to prove the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
extortions, and manifold Vsurpations,
and malignant Influence of the Roman
Coutt upon the Body Politick and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick,
being much the greater part of
my discourse. But I doe not altogether
blame him, for they are so foule, that a
man can find small credit or contentment
in defending them. For once rather then
loose his Company, I will pursue his
Method. Let us give him the hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He reduceth my five grounds to three,
first such as entrench upon Eternity and
Conscience.</hi> May not any Heretick ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that the Church imposed new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of faith &amp;c. or complain of new
Creeds, when she addeth to her publick
Professions some points of Faith held for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly?
Might not he Complaine of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
of Idolatry, as your Brother Puritans
did for Surplesses &amp;c? Might not he
pretend that all Hereticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
were good Christians, and that the
Church was Tyrannicall in holding them
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40675:172"/>
for excommunicate? Might he not shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
together Faith with Opinion, and
falsly allege as you doe here, you were
forced to approve the Popes Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Generall Councells, and take
Oaths to maintain Papall Vsurpations?
<hi>This is all the Answer I get of this brave
Disputant, as if the unjust complaints of
the</hi> Puritans <hi>did satisfy the just exceptions
of the Protestants. It is probable enough,
that he him self was one of our Brother Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans
in those dayes: otherwise he could
not well have talked so wildly of perill of
Idolatry from Surplesses. His discourse is
so sleight and impertinent, that I will not
vouchsafe any answer but leave it to the
Reader to compare my</hi> Vindication <hi>and</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<hi>with his</hi> Rejoinder. <hi>That they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
new Essentialls to Faith, is fully evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against them in this Treatise Sect. 1.
cap. 11. What our Iudgement is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Idolatry, he shall find exactly
set down in my answer to</hi> Militier <hi>Pa. 133.
As for the Oaths of Fidelity which every
Bishop must make to the Pope, he may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
him self Sect. 1. Cap. 5. and see the
From of it. cap, 7. Or if he Desire to see
a later form, let him take this. I</hi> Henry
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40675:173"/>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> will be
faithfull and Obedient to <hi>St. Peter</hi> from
this houre as formerly,<note place="margin">Antiq. Eccles. Brit. vita 66.</note> and to the holy
Apostolick Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to my
Lord Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth and his
Successours. I will give no counsaile nor
consent nor act any thing towards the
losse of their lifes, or members, or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I will discover their Counsailes to
no man to their prejudice, which they
have communicated to me by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or their Messengers. I will help
them to retein and defend the Roman
Papacy, and the Royalties of <hi>St. Peter</hi>
(saving my Order) against all men. I
will entertein the Popes Legates honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
going and comming, and help them
in their necessities. I will visit the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Court every yeare, if it be on this
side the Alpes, and every two yeares if
it beyond the Alpes, unlesse the Pope dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with me, So help me God and the
Holy Gospell. <hi>What fidelity can a King
expect from a Subject who hath taken this
Oath, if the Pope please to attempt any
thing against him? If the Popes Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40675:173"/>
above a Generall Councell, be but held
as an indifferent Opinion in their Church,
and not a point of Faith, as he intimateth: yet
it is such an Opinion as he dare not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
it is</hi> fere communis, <hi>it is</hi> almost the Common
Opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of all Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Catholicks, <hi>if</hi> Bellarmine <hi>say
true, and</hi> fere de fide, almost a point of Faith, <hi>upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
which</hi> modern Popes and Councells are accorded.
<hi>It is determined expresly in their last Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councell of</hi> Latera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,<note place="margin">Sess. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>that</hi> the Bishop of Rome
alone hath Authority over all Councells.</p>
               <p>Were these all the grounds he could find
which <hi>entrench upon Eternity and Conscience?</hi> He
might have found more, that by means of
Papall abuses there described, <hi>hospitality was
not kept, the poore not susteined, the word not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,<note place="margin">Math. Paris. an. 1245.</note>
churches not adorned, the Cure of soules neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
divine Offices not performed, Churches
ruined.</hi> He might have found <hi>Oaths, Customes,
writings, grants, statutes, rights, privileges, to have
been not onely weakened but exinanited, by the
Popes infamous Messenger</hi> called <hi>Non obstance.</hi>
And all this attested by the Lords Spirituall
and Temporall, and the whole Common-wealth
of <hi>England.</hi> But it is no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he take notice of it or not, whilest he
answereth nothing.</p>
               <p>He faith my second sort of Grounds, are
those <hi>which relate to Temporall inconveniences
and injuries to the State, by reason of the Popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40675:174"/>
encroachments, which I huddle together in
big Terms.</hi> Do I huddle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> together? Nay I
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dled them distinctly under three heads or
notions. First the intolerable Oppressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s and
Extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in points of
Fact, Secondly their grosse and grievous
usurpations in point of Right, Thirdly the
malignant influence of forrain discipline in
point of Policy. It is he that huddles them
together, because they are so foule and so
evident, that he dare not take a view of
them singly, much lesse repeat them: and
so they might be buried in Oblivion for
him, unlesse the Reader be pleased to take
a review of them. I shall not willingly
adde a word more, either to the Extortions
or Malignant Influence, because I Iudge
in Charity, that all good men doe wish
them amended as well as I: And for the
Vsurpations, being matter of perpetuall
right, I hope I have cleared them sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly
in this Treatise throughout the first Sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>:</p>
               <p>But what is his answer to all this? That
<hi>it is disputable between Canon and Civill Lawi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whether many of these were abuses or just
rights; of which kind of Controversy he neither
thinkes me nor himself competent Iudges.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that <hi>these Questions doe not concern our</hi>
present quarrell. How? not concern our
Quarrell? They are all the Quarrell we
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40675:174"/>
have: and not a Primacy of Order, or any
power purely spirituall in the Court of
Conscience. If he have nothing to doe
with these, why doth he meddle to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
whatsoever power was given by
Christ, or is recorded in Scripture, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
excepted out of our Law. And once
more Reader observe and wonder, that
these men who called upon us often for the
Grounds of our Seperation, must be called
on as often for a faire answer. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to shew the Readers <hi>a Monster in this
Section for pence a piece:</hi> It seemeth by his
bogling, he seeth something that he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to meddle with. I doubt he will prove
a true Prophet of himself, that all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
satisfaction for their money will be,
to tell them that <hi>he hath abused them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be he is better at his sword
then at his Buckler, at opposing in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls,
then defending himself from Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.

particular answer, to the truth or falshood
of the Crimes and inconvenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ces objected:
yet he giveth in seven generall Exceptions,
but it is with as much hast as the dogge by
<hi>Nilus,</hi> which runnes and drinkes. First he
saith, <hi>those inconveniences which I mention, if
they had been true, are abuses in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

taken away for them.</hi> Intolerable extortions
and grosse Vsurpations, are no more with
him then <hi>inconveniences.</hi> This Objection
was answered by me before it was moved
by him, if he had not thought fit to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it; where I distinguish between the
personall faults of Popes, and faulty prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
or Lawes, and shew how farre the
one and the other doe warrant a Seperation.
The former onely from the faulty person,
to preserve ourselves from participating
with him in his Crimes:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the faulty Office, so farre as it is faulty,
untill it be reformed. Neither have we
taken away any Office, but onely abuses
and Vsurpations.</p>
               <p>Secondly he excepreth, that <hi>some of these
pretended abuses are onely my own Deductions,
which I shew not evidently ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> of the Science of
Politicks, but out of two or three matters of Fact.</hi>
I answer, that experience is the Polititians
best Schoolmaster: and that every man fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
where his own Shoe wringeth him,
much better by wearing it himself, then by
hearing others discourse of it. But I thanke
him for his <hi>Memento,</hi> and the next time I
have occasion to make use of it, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>strate
to him out of the <hi>Scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of Politicks</hi>
that Forrain Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is uselesse and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40675:175"/>
to the Subject; Dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the King and Commonwealth;
a Rack and Gibbet to the Conscience, by
subjecting it to two Supremes who may
possibly clash one with another; and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
opposite to the Ecclesiasticall Policy
of the Primitive times, which conformed
the bounds of Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction to
the Civill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he pleadeth, that <hi>I doe not prove
that some of these pretended abuses were not just
rights, but onely shew that such and such things
were done,</hi> and that <hi>either party had learned
Lawiers for them,</hi> and that <hi>sometimes the
Kings renounced their pretenses, as in point of
Investitures.</hi> I answer, that the Opposition
of King and Kingdome to any branch of
Papall power, sheweth evidently that they
did not believe, that the Pope had any right
to it, divine or humane, and clearly destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Foundation of immediate Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How should they leave that to their
Children, as a Legacy of Christ or his
Apostles, which they themselves rejected?
Our Kings never renounced their right
of Investitures, onely they consented, that
they should not give Investitures in their
own persons, but by a Bishop, still retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
both the right of Patronage and their
Feudall Oaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:40675:176"/>Fourthly, he saith that <hi>these temporall Lawes
which I cite, concluder not evidently a right;</hi>
and <hi>reason gives more particular respect to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
lawes then to temporall.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
though such Lawes doe not alwaies
prove a right; Yet they alwaies prove the
common consent of the Kingdome, what
they esteem to be right; they alwayes
disprove the Popes Prescription. But he
is wholy mistaken, many of those Lawes
which I cited were Ecclesiasticall Lawes:
And the Popes Decretalls which he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth
for Lawes, are no Lawes, nor
ever were held for Lawes in <hi>England,</hi>

Kingdome. Reason gives more respect
to the Sanctions of Bishops then of Kings,

he might remember, first that our Grounds

it is the same which he himself adviseth in

they will grow Angry upon this, and break
Ecclesiasticall Communion themselves, it
is their Act, not ours, who have acted

be a Condition of their Communion. As
for <hi>Adamites</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> we know not
what they are, and for <hi>Socinians</hi> we hold
them worse then <hi>Arrians.</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi>
made Christ to be a Secondary God, <hi>erat
quando non erat:</hi> but the Socinians make him
to be a meer creature. And for Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
what my Iudgement is, he may find
fully set down in my reply to the Bishop of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40675:179"/>
                  <hi>Chalcedons</hi> Epistle.</p>
               <p>But saith he, every one of these hath a
<hi>different head of the Church, The English head
is the King, The Roman Catholick head is
the Pope, The Grecian head is the Patriarch,
The Presbyterian head is the Presbytery or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
and the Lutheran head is the Parish Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</hi>
First for the <hi>Lutherans</hi> he doth them
egregious wrong. Throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>Denwark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> they have
theit Bishops, name and thing, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Germany</hi> they have their Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
And to the rest I answer him,
that there are severall Heads of the Church,
Christ alone is the Spirituall head, the
Soveraign Prince the Politicall head, the
Ecclesiasticall head is a Generall Councell,
and under that each Patriarch in his Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate,
and among the Patriarchs the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> by a Priority of Order. We who
maintain the King to be the Politicall head
of the English Church, doe not deny the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Headship of Christ, nor the supreme
power of the Represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tative Church that is a
Generall Councell or Synod, nor the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
headship of each Patriarch in his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate,
nor the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> headship
of Order among them: and thus this great
Objection is vanished. By this he may see
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40675:180"/>
that we have introduced no new Form of
Ecclesiasticall Government into the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> but preserved to every one his
due right if he will accept of it: and that
we have the same Dependence upon our
Ecclesiasticall Superiours, which we had
evermore from the Primitive times.</p>
               <p>He chargeth us, that <hi>we give no certain Rule</hi>
to know which <hi>is a Generall Councell, which
not, or who are to be called to a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>
There is no need why we should give
any new Rules, who are ready to observe
the old Rules of the Primitive Church.
Generall Summons to all the Patriarchs,
for them and their Clergy; Generall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
of all Persons capable, to discusse
freely, and to define freely, according to
their distinct Capacities; and lastly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the five Protopatriarchs and their
Clergy, either in their persons or by their
suffrages, or in case of Necessity the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of them, doe make a Generall
Councell. Whilest we set this rule before
us as our pattern, and swerve not from it
but onely in case of invincible Necessity,
we may well hope that God who looketh
upon his poore Servants with all their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and expecteth no more of them
then he hath enabled them to performe,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40675:180"/>
who hath promised that where two or
three are gathered together in his name,
there will he be in the midst of them: Will
vouchsafe to give his assistence and his
Blessing to such a Councell, which is as
Generall as may be, although perhaps
it be not so exactly Generall as hath been,
or might have been now, if the Christian
Empire had flourished still as it did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.
In summe, I shall be ever ready
to acquiesce in the Determinaation of a
Councell so Generall as is possible to be
had: so it may be equall, not having more
Iudges of one Country then all the rest of the
Christian world, as it was in the Councell
of <hi>Trent,</hi> but regulated by the equall votes
of Christian Nations, as it was in the
Councells of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile:</hi> and so as
those Nations which cannot in probability
be personally present, may be admitted to
send their Votes and Suffrages as they did
of old: and lastly so it may be free, called
in a free place whither all parties may have
secure accesse, and Liberty to propose free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and define freely, according to the
Votes of the Fathers, without being stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or curbed or overruled by the Holy
Ghost sent in a Curriers Budget.</p>
               <p>And for the last part of his exception
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40675:181"/>
that <hi>Hereticks should not be admitted,</hi> I for
my part should readily consent; provided
that none be reputed Hereticks, but such
as true Generall Councells have evidently
declared to be Hereticks, or such as will
not pronounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> against all
old Heresies, which have been condemned
for Heresies by undoubted Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.
But to imagin that all those should
be reputed Hereticks, who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
of Heresy or Schisme by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Court for their own interest, that is
foure parts of five of the Christian world,
is silly and senselesse, and argueth nothing
but their fear to come to a faire impartiall
Tryall.</p>
               <p>And this is a full answer to that which
he allegeth out of <hi>Doctor Hammond,</hi> that
<hi>Generall Councells are now morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be had, the Christian world
being under so many Empires and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into so many Communions.</hi> It is
not credible that the Turke will send his
Subjects, that is four of the Protopatriarchs
with their Clergy to a Generall Councell,
or allow them to meet openly with the
rest of Christendome in a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
it being so much against this own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40675:181"/>
but yet this is no impediment why
the Patriarchs, might not deliver the Sense
and Suffrages of their Churches by Letters
or by Messengers; and this is enough to
make a Councell Generall. In the First
Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> there were onely five
Clergymen present out of the Western
Churches; In the Great Councell of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
not so many; In the Councells of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
and <hi>Ephesus</hi> none at all. And yet
have these four Councells evermore been
esteemed truly Generall, because the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Church did declare their consent and
concurrence. Then as there have been Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Orientall Councells, without the
personall presence of a Western Bishop: so
there may be an Occide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tall Councell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the personall presence of one Eastern
Bishop, by the sole Communication of
their sense and their Faith. Neither is such
Communication to be deemed impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
considering what correspondence,
the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Church did hold
long with the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
and the <hi>Abyssine</hi> hath long held, and
doth still hold with the Patriarch of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fessed that there are too many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Communions in <hi>Europe,</hi> it may be some
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40675:182"/>
more then there is any great cause for, and
perhaps different Opinions where there is
but one Communion, as difficult to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
as different Communions. But
many of these Mushrome Sects, are like
those inorganicall Creatures bred upon the
Bankes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which perished quickly
after they were bred, for want of fit Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
The more considerable parties, and
the more capable of reason are not so many;
if these could be brought to acquiesce in the
determination of a free Generall Councell,
they would towe the other like lesser Boats
after them with ease.</p>
               <p>No man wil say that <hi>the Vnity of the Church
in point of Government, doth consist onely</hi> in
their actuall subordination <hi>to Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</hi>
Generall Councells are extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Remedies, proper for curing or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
new differences of great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Faith or discipline. That being
done, Generall Councells may prove of
more Danger then use. No healthfull man
delighteth in a continuall course of Phisick.
But Vnity consisteth also and Ordinarily
in Conformity and submission to that disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
which Generall Councells have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to us, either as the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Christ and his Apostles, or as
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:40675:182"/>
Ecclesiasticall Policies instituted by them,
with the Concurrence or Confirmation of
Christian Soveraigns, for the publick
good of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He chargeth us, that</hi> we have so formed
Gods Church, that there is no meanes left to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssemble
a Generall Councell, having renounced
his Authority whose proper Office it was to call a
Generall Councell. <hi>His errours seldome
come single, but commonly by Clusters or
at least by paires. What height of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is it to affirm, that it is</hi> the proper Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Pope to call Generall all Councells, <hi>when
all ingenuous men doe acknowledge that
all the First Generall Councells, were</hi> Ab
Imperatoribus Indicta, Called by Emperours?
<hi>To which the Popes Friends adde, that it
was</hi> by the Advise and with the Consent of the
Pope. <hi>And</hi> Bellarmine <hi>gives diverse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why it could not be otherwise, First,</hi>
because there was a Law,<note place="margin">De Concil. lib. 1. cap. 14.</note> which did forbid fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Assemblyes for feare af Sedition. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
because</hi> no reason doth permit
that such an Assembly should be made in
an Imperiall City, without the leave of
the Lord of the place. <hi>Thirdly because</hi>
Generall Councells were made then, at
the Publick Charge. <hi>He might have
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40675:183"/>
added, that Councells did receive their
Protection from Emperours, and they who
sit in Councells were the Subjects of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the second place he erreth in this also,
that <hi>we have taken away the meanes of assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Generall Councells.</hi> We have taken
away no power from the Pope of convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
any Synods, except onely Synods of
the King of Englands Subjects, within his
own dominions, without his leave; which
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself acknowledgeth to be
agreable to reason. If the Pope have any
right, either to convocate Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
himself, or to represent to Christian
Soveraigns the fit seasons for Convocation
of them, either in respect of his <hi>Beginning
of Vnity,</hi> or of his Protopatriarchate, we
do not envy it to him, since there may be
a good use of it in respect of the division of
the Empire, so good caution be observed.
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth that that power which
we acknowledge, that is, that <hi>though the Pope
be no Ecclesiasticall Monarch, but
onely chief of the Principall Patriarchs,
yet the right to convocate Generall
Councells should pertein unto him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De concil. li, 1. c. 12.</note> But
it may be, this is more then <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> did

               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:40675:183"/>My last Ground, was the Exemtion
of the Britannick Churches from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
Iurisdiction, by the Generall Councell
of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> As to the Exemtion of the
Britannick Churches, he referreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to what he had said formerly, and so
do I. To the Authority of the Councell
of <hi>Ephesus</hi> he answereth, that howsoever
Cyprus <hi>and some others are exemted
from a Neighbouring Superiour, falsly
pretending a Iurisdiction over them,
yet I shall never shew a Syllable in the
Councell of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>exemting from the
Popes Iurisdiction as head of the Church.</hi>
Not directly, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> may safely sweare it, for
the Councell never suspected it, the world
never dreamed of it, the Popes themselves
never pretended to any such headship of
Power, and Vniversall Iurisdiction over the
whole Church, in those dayes. All that the
Primitive Popes claymed by divine right,
was a <hi>Primacy of Order or Beginning of Vnity,</hi>
due to the Chaire of <hi>St. Peter:</hi> all that they
claimed by humane right were some Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
partly gained by Custome or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription,
and partly granted by the
Fathers to to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> because it
was the Imperiall City. But there
is enough in this very Canon colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40675:184"/>
to overthrow all the Vsurpations
of the Roman Court. There is no need

themselves, which they hold onely by
Courtesy and favour from the Bishop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> Then the holy Synod was quite out,
to Determine so positively, that not onely
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> but <hi>every Province should enjoy its
rights and Customes inviolated, which it had
from the beginning,</hi> without a <hi>Salvo</hi> or saving
the right of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction,
so long as he pleaseth to permit
them; and to doe it in such Imperiall Terms,
<hi>It hath pleased the holy Synod,</hi> or such is our
pleasure. Lastly the Pope himself was out,
to ratify the Privileges and exemptions of
the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishops, not onely from the
Patriarch of Antioch, but from himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and to suffer his divine right to be
trampled under foot, by Customs and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
which are of no force without him.
But this is the least part of the passages
in the foure First Generall Councells,
which are repugnant to the Popes preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of a Generall Monarchy. The Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Churches doe still adhere firmly to
the Primitive Discipline, and for this cause
the Pope hath thought fit to excommunicate
them. <hi>Si violandum jus est, regnandi causÃ¢

extortions that ever were heard
of, most grievous Vsurpations, malignant
Influence both upon the State Politick and
Ecclesiastick, and undoubted Privileges,
he produceth nothing but <hi>immediate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi>
and you must be content to take
his bare word for it, for he is altogether
unfurnished of proofes. Some men by
telling strange Stories over and over, do
come at last to believe them. It may be,
he believeth there was a Tradition, for
those Branches of Papall power, which
we cast out: but we deny it altogether,
and require him to prove first that there
was such a Tradition in <hi>England,</hi> next
that a particular Tradition is a sufficient
proofe of divine Institution.</p>
               <p>We admit readily, that <hi>the Vnity of
the Church is of great importance,</hi> and
<hi>the breaking of it an heinous Crime,</hi>
and that <hi>no abuses imaginable are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
excuse for a totall desertion of a just</hi>
power. Thus far in the <hi>Thesis</hi>
we agree, but in the <hi>Hypothesis</hi>
we differ, That which is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground for a reformation,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40675:185"/>
is not a sufficient Ground for an extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.
So many, so grievous, so uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
extortions, and Vsurpations,
and malignant influences, as we complain
of and prove, are without all peradventure
a sufficient ground of Reformation, which
is all our Ancestours did, or we defend;
though not a sufficient cause of the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of any just Authority. Our Grounds
are sufficient for a Reformation of abuses
and encroachments, which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and which is all we did at the
Reformation: but for the abolition of
any just power, it is his fond Imagination,
we disclaime it altogether. We have cast
out all Papall Coactive Iurisdiction in the
Exteriour Court, as being Politicall
not Spirituall: but for any Papall Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
either purely spirituall or justly
founded, we have not medled with it; Those
things which we have cast out, are onely
abuses and Vsurpations. So there is no
need of that Consideration which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
whether the abuses were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
remediable, or not: for our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is that very Remedy which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath prescribed, to hold out encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the point of the sword, without
any medling with just right. Other division
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40675:186"/>
then this (which he himself hath allowed)
we believe our Ancestours intended none,
we hold none, and so are accountable for
none.</p>
               <p>The main Question is whether the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannick</hi>
Churches were <hi>de facto</hi> subject to
<hi>Rome</hi> or not. I have demonstrated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
already, that they were not, and had
alwaies their Ordinations at home. But his
Conclusion which he puts upon me, that
<hi>true complaints against Governours, whether
otherwise remediable or no, are sufficient reasons
to abolish that very Government,</hi> is a vain
assertion of his own, no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clusion of mine.</p>
               <p>He starteth a Question here little to his

of a Bowle;</hi> It may be it is true, but if I
should put him to prove this Negative, it
is impossible. But so farre as a Negative of
that nature is capable of proofe, I did prove
it, by our Addresses to Popes and Councells,
and long expectation in vain, that we had
no other Remedy then that which we used,
to thrust out their Vsurpations by the power
of the sword, which course he himself ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth,
and we practised. The division is not
made by them who thrust out Vsurpations,
but by them who brought them in and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them.</p>
               <p>I said, that not onely <hi>our Ancestors
but all Catholick Countries did maintein
their own privileges inviolated, and
make themselves the last Iudges of their
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40675:187"/>
Grievances, from the Court of</hi> Rome. Hence
he concludeth with open Mouth, therefore
<hi>there were other Remedies, there needed no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision.</hi>
Alas poore man, how he troubleth
himself about nothing! They and we used
the very same Remedies, the same that he
adviseth in this place. <hi>The Pope would not
ease them upon many addresses made. What
then? had not the King the Sword in his own
hands?<note place="margin">p. 571.</note> Did it not lie in his power to right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as he listed? and to admit those pretended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
onely so far as he thought just and
fitting?</hi> Yes, the King had the sword in his
hands, and did right him self, and cast out
those Papall Usurpatious so far as he found
Iust: and now when we have followed your
own advise, you call us <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and
<hi>Dividers.</hi> Sr. we are no Dividers, but we
have done our Duties, and if we prove those
things which we cast out to be Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(as we have done), you are the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
by your own Confession.</p>
               <p>He pleadeth, <hi>If Papall Authority be of
Christs Institution, then no just cause can possibly
be given for its Abolishment.</hi> Right: But
those Branches of Papall power which we
have cast out, are neyther of Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
nor of Mans Institution, but meer
Vsurpations. Neither doe we seek to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40675:187"/>
Papall Authority, but to reform it
from Accidentall Abuses, and reduce it to
its first Institution. The best Institutions
Divine or Humane, may sometimes need
such Reformation. Here is nothing like
proofe, but his <hi>World of Witnesses,</hi> and his
<hi>Immemoriall Tradition,</hi> presumed not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>To shew that no Nation suffred so much
as <hi>England</hi> under the Tyranny of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

                  <hi>VVhat hindereth that a man may

whether <hi>those Testimonies which

over the Heads of my Arguments, <hi>This

better to refute them, and shew that they
are not Demonstrative, then to trifle away

               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:40675:188"/>I shewed, that [England is not alone in
the Seperation, so long as all the Eastern,
Southern, Northern, and so great a part of
the Western Church, have seperated
themselves from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
are seperated by them from the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> as well as we]. In answer to this, he
bids me <hi>shew that those I call Christians, have
any infallible or certain Rule of Faith</hi> &amp;c.
This is first to hang men up, and then to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
their cause; first to excommunicate
four parts of five of the Christian world for
their own Interests, because they will not
submit their necks to the Roman Yoke, and
embrace their upstart Vsurpations, with as
much Devotion as the genuine Legacies of
Christ and his Apostles. It behoved the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to have weighed the case
more maturely, before they gave such a
temerarious sentence, against the much
greater part of Christendome, in so weighty
a cause. But for <hi>their rule of Faith,</hi> they
have a more certain and Authentick Rule
then he himself, by as much as the Apostles
Creed is a more Authentick rule of Faith,
then <hi>Pius</hi> the fourths Creed, and the Holy
Scriptures a more infallible ground, then
particular supposititious Tradition, which
wanteth both Perpetuity and Vniversality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:40675:188"/>I said that [we desired to live in the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable,
Communion of the Catholick
Church, as well as our Ancestours, as far
as the Roman Court will give us leave].
He answereth, that <hi>he knoweth very well we
would be glad that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>would
own us for hers &amp;c, That</hi> lack Straw <hi>or</hi> Wat
Tiler <hi>after they had rebelled, had no mind to be
hanged,</hi> That <hi>it is no Charity or Courtesy in us,
but a request of an unreasonable favour from
them, to admit us into their Communion, and
would be most absurd in Government, &amp;c.</hi>
Whether they hold us for theirs or not, is
not much materiall; if they did, it were the
better for themselves; if they doe not, it is
not the worse for us: so as Christ own us
for his, it skilleth not much whether they
say, <hi>come ye blessed, or goe ye cursed;</hi> whether
we be the wheat or Chaffe, their tongues
must not winnow us. Although he snuffe
at our desire of Vnion: yet God Almighty
sets a greater value upon it. He is not out
of the Church who is within it in the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of his heart, and implicitly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of his mind. Observe Reader
who are the procreative and conserving
Causes of this Schisme. They frighted us
from them with new Articles and Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they thrust us from them with new
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40675:189"/>
Censures and Excommunications; and if
we had a mind to return, they tell us <hi>it were

my chiefest wonder is, that he who was the

should talk so suddainly of <hi>hanging.</hi> Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Changes are alwaies dangerous, and
for the most part personated.</p>
               <p>He asketh, <hi>whether our Ancestours did
renounce the Popes Authority as Head of the
Church?</hi> If he mean a Head of Order, they
did not, no more do we: if he mean a Head
of Soveraign power, they did, and so do
we. What I granted once I grant alwaies,
it is for Turncoats <hi>to take their swings.</hi> I
write <hi>semper idem,</hi> of the same religion
wherein I was baptised: can he do the same?
But he urgeth, that <hi>I make it the top of my</hi>
Climax, <hi>that our Ancestours threatned to make
a wall of Seperation, between the Court of</hi> Rome
<hi>and them, which sheweth that they did it not:
but it is evident, that we have done what they
onely threatned to doe, and plead for our excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that we have more experience then our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
had.</hi> I made it the top of my <hi>Climax</hi>
indeed; honest mens words are as good as
deeds. But doth he thinke that our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
did onely make counterfeit <hi>Grimaces,</hi>
and threaten that which they could not
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40675:189"/>
Lawfully have performed? <hi>Absit:</hi> The
Lawes and the threatning are easily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.
Our Ancestours made very severe
Lawes against the Vsurpations of the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I have shewed in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
throughout: but they did not execute
them so rigorously, but connived at
many innocent or not pernicious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments,
in hope the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
and their Emissaries, would have kept
themselves within some tolerable bounds
of moderation. But they found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and we by much longer and surer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that all our Hopes were vaine,
that the Avarice of the Roman Court was
not to be satiated or to be stinted, that if we
give them leave to thrust in their head they
would quickly draw in their body after.
And therefore our Ancestours finding this
true in a great part, did threaten them to
make <hi>a wall of Seperation,</hi> that is, to execute
their Lawes rigorously, to use no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
or connivence, to take away
their Coactive power in the Exteriour
Court altogether, which the Lawes have
taken away before sufficiently. And we
being confirmed by much longer and surer
experience, have accomplished what they
threatned. So this <hi>threatned Wall of
Seperation</hi> is no new Law, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t a new
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40675:190"/>
Mandate to execute the old Lawes: and our
experience and our Ancestours materially
is the same, but ours is more grounded and
more sure; their seperation and ours was
the same to point of Law, but not of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
And the reason why <hi>our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
remedies were not Soveraign or sufficient
enough,</hi> was not want of virtue in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
but want of due application. Thus

Now I have told him the secret,
what good will it doe him? as much as he

                  <hi>We have more experience then
our Ancestours had, that their Remedies were
not Soveraign or Sufficient enough, that if we
give him leave to thrust in his head, he will
never rest untill he have drawn in his whole body

               <p>Now Readers looke to yourselves, out

staggers, now to the one, now to the other
far distant side of the Contradiction.</hi>
The Reader shall find that the fault is not
in the innocent Dutchman, who goeth
straight enough: but in the Prevaricators
eyes, who seeth double. Either he did never
know, or he hath forgotten what a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is. The Itch or humour of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
hath so far possessed him, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
not what the Rules of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are. The first Contradiction is, <hi>That
the Lawes of our Ancestours were not remedies
sufficient enough,</hi> yet <hi>I maintein stoutly that in the
Seperation no new Law was made,</hi> That is (as

it, nor of any the least opposition, which
ought alwaies to be made according to the
Rules of Logick, <hi>at the same time.</hi> I will

is a Roman Catholick, is just such
another Contradiction: or the same Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was not sufficient to cure such a sore at
one time, yet it was sufficient at another
time when the Body was better disposed.
All his Contradictions end in smoke and
laughter.</p>
               <p>The second Contradiction is, that I said
<hi>the Lawes of other Countries were equivalent to
those of</hi> England; but I acknowledge elswhere
that <hi>the Lawes of other Countries were sufficient;</hi>
and here I say that <hi>the Lawes of</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Here is another Contradiction,
like the former. The same Lawes proved
sufficient to <hi>France,</hi> yet proved insufficient
to <hi>England.</hi> It is another rule in Logick,
<hi>Opposition ought to have the same Subject
and the same Predicate without ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity:</hi>
but here the Predicate is diverse,
<hi>sufficient for France, not sufficient for England,</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:40675:191"/>
and ambiguity more then enough. He
might as well argue, The same Medicine
will work upon a child, which will not
work upon a Man: therefore the same Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
is not equivalent to it self.</p>
               <p>The third Contradiction is, that I say
<hi>All Catholick Countries did maintein
their Privileges inviolate, by meanes
which did not maintein them, or by
Lawes which were not sufficient to do it.</hi>
Where did I say this? It is his Collection
not my Assertion: but let it passe muster for
once. Here is a Contradiction deserves a
Bell and a Bable: Catholick Countries did
maintein their Privileges inviolate by such
means, at one time not at another, in one
place not in another, in one degree not in
another, in one respect not in another.</p>
               <p>The last mock Contradiction is, that I
say <hi>The Lawes which denied the Pope all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and were actually in force, that is, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
left him none, were not sufficient Remedies
against the abuses of that Authority, Which had
quite taken them away.</hi> This is not finding of
Contradictions, but making of them. Give
him leave to use this <hi>[id est, that is]</hi> and he
will make a hundred Contradictions in
every page of the Bible; as here,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40675:192"/>
                  <hi>actually in force, that is, which actually
left the Pope no Authority, or which had
quite taken his Authority away.</hi> If
this <hi>[id est that is]</hi> be mine, then he may
object the Contradiction to me, if it be not,
then he may keep the Contradiction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
such as it is. He knoweth, and all the
world know, that a law is said to be actually
in force, whilest it is unrepealed; in this
sense I did, and all men but himself doe use
that expression. And here he committeth
a third grosse fault against the Rule of
Opposition, which ought to be ever
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in the same Respect.</hi> The
Law taketh away abuses as a Rule: but the
Magistrate by due execution, as an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.
The Law is sufficient, when it is
sufficiently penned and promulged: but
the effect followeth the due execution.
The not observing of this obvious and easy
truth, hath made us all this stirre about
Imaginary Contradictions, as I have
shewed in my answer to his last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to all these pretended Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
but whether it will be so <hi>actually

then I know; if it do not, it detracteth

               <p>THis Section doth not much concern
either us or the merit of the cause. A
Reformation might be just and necessary,
although the Reformers did exceed the
bounds of due Moderation; neither are
we answerable for their excesses, further
then we ourselves doe maintein them. I
passe by his <hi>pleasant Topick</hi> unsaluted, as
being impertinent, and having nothing in it

               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:40675:193"/>I reckoned this as the first Branch of
our moderation, that we deny not to
other Churhes, the true being of Churches
nor possibility of Salvation, nor seperate
from Churches, but from Accidentall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
For all his scoffing, if their Church
would use the like moderation, it would
save the world a great deale of needlesse
debate. Against that which I say, he obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
thus, <hi>Now the matter of Fact
hath evidenced undeniably, that they</hi>
(the Protestants) <hi>seperated from those
points, which were the Principles of
Vnity both in Faith and Government.</hi>
He hath brought his <hi>matter of Fact</hi>
and his <hi>Principles of Vnity</hi> so often
upon the Stage already, and they have
been so often clearly answered, that I will
not insist upon such a threedbare subject, or
trouble the Reader with an irksome repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.
We have seen how far his <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Vnity,</hi> or his <hi>Fundamentall of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls</hi>
is true, and ought to be admitted:

               <p>He procedeth, that <hi>the Church of</hi>

(to use Cardinall <hi>Cajetans</hi> distinction),
Not in those things which are <hi>de fide forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi>

in those things which are <hi>fidei materialiter,</hi>
in inferiour Questions which happen in
things to be believed, that is to say <hi>Opinions,</hi>
wherein himself acknowledgeth that a

the right sense of the Article appeareth
hence; that the Article doth contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<hi>Credenda or things to be believed,</hi> not to
<hi>Opinions,</hi> but to <hi>agenda</hi> things to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>He urgeth, that we have declared <hi>four

That is to say, their Doctrin of Purgatory,

four points of their new Faith, enjoined by
<hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, but no Article of the old
Apostolicall Faith, and at the best onely
Opinions. Yet neither doth he cite our

them to be contrary to Scripture, but
onely besides the Scripture, or not
well grounded upon any Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>the like Character is given of

<hi>Our highest Act of Devotion</hi> Art. 31.

any Principles of Vnity in this place,

touch them gently and they sting you.</p>
               <p>The first part of our Moderation was,
not to censure other Churches for no
Churches, nor deny them possibility of
Salvation, nor thrust them from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
which I shewed in the Example of
<hi>St. Ciprian.</hi> In answer to this he sheweth
the unlawfulnesse <hi>of Communicating with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi>
which is <hi>reconciling Christ with Anti-Christ.</hi>
Was not this impertinent, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:40675:195"/>
were Iudge?</p>
               <p>I said, <hi>it might be very lawfull in some cases, to
communicate with materiall Idolaters Hereticks
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d Schismaticks,</hi> (that is such as erre through
ignorance and frailty, not obstinacy) <hi>in
Religious Duties.</hi> And for proofe hereof, I
produced the insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
communicating in some cases with
the Hereticall <hi>Arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ans,</hi> and the Schismaticall
<hi>Novatians.</hi> He demands first <hi>who forbids
them to goe visit the sick?</hi> I adde, or pray
with them also? which was as much as
I said there, but because he falleth with
such Violence upon the point, I will now
take the Liberty to expresse my self more
fully. First, it is to be remembred that I
did speake onely of Materiall Idolaters He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
or Schismaticks, not Formall. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of pious Offices not of Idolatrous Acts,
nor any thing favouring Heresy or Schisme.
Thirdly, I do new exclude case of Scandall,
for just scandall may make that Act to be
unlawfull, which in it self is Lawfull.
Fourthly, I except cases of Just Obedience,
the prohibition of a lawfull Superiour Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
or Ecclesiasticall, may make that Act
to be unlawfull, which was Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
Lastly, I distinguish between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Learned and grounded in Religion,
and persons unlearned and ungrounded;
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:40675:196"/>
the former may and ought to communicate
with Idolaters Hereticks and Schismaticks,
as far as they can with a good Conscience,
to gain them to the truth; the latter are
obliged not to come over near to pitch,
least they be defiled.</p>
               <p>The Question being thus stated, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the main point hath no great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in it. For they who are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Hereticks or Schismaticks onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,
not formally, that is, against
their meanings resolutions and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are no Idolaters Hereticks or
Schismaticks, in the eyes of God or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
men: neither are they out of the
Pale of the Church, or out of the way of
Salvation as the Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> saith
most truely,<note place="margin">De Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. cap. 2. pa. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>VVe allow all those to have
saving Faith, to be in the Church, in
way of Salvation, for so much as belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to Faith, who hold the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
points, and invincibly erre in not
Fundamentalls.</hi> But all Idolaters Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Schismaticks, who are onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
Idolatrous Hereticall or Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
doe erre invincibly: for if they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vincibly, then they were formall Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
Hereticks or Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:40675:196"/>Thus much I lay down for certain; the
rest I onely propose, that although they
were formall Hereticks or Schismaticks,
yet they are not altogether out of the Pale

allowed by the Church, delaying her Censures
as long as she can possibly, without wronging her
Government; as was</hi> de facto <hi>practised in</hi>
England <hi>till the 10 of Queen</hi> Elizabeth.
This is full as much as I said, that it may be
lawfull to communicate in some cases with
materiall Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:40675:197"/>And whatsoever I said, was rather to
make a Charitable Construction of their
materiall Idolatry, then out of fear that
they should be able, to attaint us of any
Schisme either materiall or formall: if he
had any thing of reality to object against us,
he would be ashamed to intimate our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to favour Arrianisme, which he
himself knoweth our soules abhorre, and
which he himself knoweth to be expresly
condemned, in the second Article of our
Church. He may find my Instances of the
Primitive Christians, communicating
with the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> in Church
Offices, in my answer to the Bishop of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi>
Preface, pa. 36, if he have any thing
to say to them. Neither was it at the first
sprouting of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresy, but after
they had formed severall Doxologies to
themselves; nor at the First beginning of
the <hi>Novatian</hi> Schisme, but towards the
Conclusion of it. I cited <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> for
no other purpose, but to shew that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in absteining from censuring
did preserve him free from Schisme, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was in an errour. When <hi>Optatus</hi>

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:40675:197"/>
                  <hi>Parmenian</hi> (a Donatist) <hi>would ranke
himself with Heretieks, who were falsifiers of
the Creed.</hi> If this be the infallible marke
of an Heretick, Let <hi>Pius Quartus</hi> and his
party looke to themselves.</p>
               <p>I disliked a position of his, which the
Reader shall have in his own words, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say my Religion is true, but I must say the
Opposite is false; mine is good, but I must say
the Opposite is naught; mine necessary, but I
must Iudge that which is inconsistent carries to
damnation. Therefore who does not censure a
Contrary Religion, holds not his own certain, that
is, hath none.</hi> Upon this he pursueth me
with a full Crye, that <hi>the Common Principle
of Nature [if any thing be true the Opposite is
false], or [a thing cannot both be and not be at
once], is denyed by the Bishop.</hi> Stay <hi>Mr.
Serjeant,</hi> be not so fierce; the Bishop know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as well as your self, that the disjunction
of Contradictories is eternall: and it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by what passed lately between us,
that he understandeth the Rules of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
or right Contradiction better then
your self.</p>
               <p>First the <hi>Emphasis</hi> lieth not in the word
[true], but in the words [say] and [censure].
Cannot a man believe or hold his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to be true, but he must necessarily say
or ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sure another mans, which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ceiveth
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:40675:198"/>
to be opposite to it, to be false. Truth and
Falshood are Contradictory, or of eternall
Disjunction; but there is a meane, between
believing or holding mine own Religion
to be true, and saying or censuring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans (which perhaps is opposite) to
be false, both more prudentiall and more
charitable, that is, silence; to looke cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly
to myself, and leave other men
to stand or fall to their own Maister. <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
did believe or hold his own Opinion
of Rebaptisation to be true, yet did not
censure the opposite to be false, or remove
any man from his Communion for it.
<hi>Rabshakeh</hi> was more censorious then <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
and down right Atheists then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
Christians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that which he calleth his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is no more in truth then his Opinion;
and different Opinions are stiled different
Religions. In opinions it is not necessary
to hold with any party, much lesse to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
other parties. Sometimes seeming dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions are both true, and all the
Opposition is but a Contention about
words, and then mutuall censures are
vaine: sometimes they are both false, and
then there is more use of Mutuall Charity
then mutual Censures: and evermore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

are like a coloured glasse, which makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

same colour: and on the otherside rancour
and animosity, like the tongue infected with
Choller, maketh the sweetest meats to tast

and his principle pernicious, that <hi>He who
doth not censure every Religion whieh he reputeth

               </p>
               <p>I set down some Principles, whereof this
is the first, [particular Churches may fall
into Errours.] He answereth, <hi>tis true if by
Errours he means Opinions onely.</hi> No, I mean
Fundamentall Errours also: and not onely
fall into some Fundamentall Errours, but
apostate from Christ and turn Turkes, and
change their Bible into the <hi>Alchor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>a;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have visible experience in the
world. He answers, that <hi>Principle is not so
undeniable as I thinke, in case that Particular
Church adhere firmly to her rule of Faith, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Tradition.</hi> Well, but we see visibly
with our eyes, that many particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
have not adhered to any Tradition,
Vniversall or Particular, Mediate or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate,
but have abandoned all Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:40675:199"/>
Tradition, then to what purpose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his Exception, <hi>in case that Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
firmly to immediate Tradition,</hi> when
all the World seeth that they have not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
firmly to Apostolicall Tradition?
His Preservative is much like that, which
an old Seaman gave a freshwater Passenger
when he was to goe to Sea, to put so many
pibble stones into his mouth, with assurance
that he should not cast, whilest he held
them between his teeth. What sort of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ought to be reputed Apostolicall,
what not, I have shewed formerly.</p>
               <p>My second Principle was, that [all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
are not Essentialls or Fundamentalls].
He demands, <hi>what is this to his Proposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which
spake of Religion, not of Opinions?</hi> Very much,
because he maketh Opinions to be Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls
of his Religion (as wee see in the new
Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> of fourth), so do not we. To
the third Principle we agree thus farre,
that an Errour <hi>de side formaliter,</hi> or in those
things which are Essentialls of Faith doth
destroy the being of a Church. I adde, that
Errours in those things, <hi>Quae sunt fidei ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialiter,</hi>
that is, in Inferiour Questions
which happen in or about things believed,
or which are not in Essentialls, howsoever
they may be lately crowded into the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40675:199"/>
Catalogue of Essentialls, do not destroy
the being of a Church.</p>
               <p>My fourth Principle was, that [every one
is bound according to the just extent of his
power, to free himself from such Errours
as are not in Essentialls.] He answereth,
<hi>Why so my Lord? if those errours be not Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
they leave accordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sufficient means of Salvation, and the true being
of a Church; How prove you then you ought to
breake Church Communion?</hi> &amp;c. As if no
Errours ought to be remedied, but onely
those which are absolutely exclusive from
all hope of Salvation: as if those Errours
which are onely impeditive of Salvation,
ought not to be eschewed. The least Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
maintained or committed against the
dictate of Conscience is a sinne; every good
Christian ought to doe his uttermost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavonr
to free himself from sinne; it is
not lawfull to doe evill that good may
come of it. Yes, saith he, but <hi>not to break
Church Communion which is essentially
destructive to the being of a Church,
or to endanger our soules where there
is no necessity.</hi> First, they who free
themselves from known Errours, doe
not thereby break Churchâ€”Communion:
but they who make their Errours to be a
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:40675:200"/>
Condition of their Communion. Let him
heare the Conclusion of the Bishop of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brief Survey cap. 2. s. 4.</note>
                  <hi>In case a Particular Church do require
profession of her Heresy, as a Condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with her, Division from her in this
case is no Schisme or sinne, but virtue and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;</hi>
Where he speaketh onely of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
Heresy. It was they who made
their Errours the Condition of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and therefore the Schisme and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeth
at their doores. Secondly, Schisme
doth not destroy the being of a Church, for
the Church continueth a Church still, after
the Schismaticks are gone out of it: but it
destroyeth the Schismaticks themselves.
Lastly, to free ourselves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> known Errours,
when they are made Conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
is so far from being dangerous to
salvation, that as the Bishop confesseth
truely, <hi>it is virtue and necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second proofe of our Moderation
was our Charity, that we left them as one
should leave his Fathers house, whilest it
is infected with some contagious Sicknesse,
with an hearty desire to return again so
soone as it is cleansed. This Charitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of ours, I prooved by our daily prayers
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in our Letany, that God would bring
them out of the way of Errour into the way
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:40675:200"/>
of truth: and particularly by our prayer on
<hi>Good Fryday</hi> for them, That <hi>God would have
mercy upon all Hereticks, and fetch them home
to his Flock, that they may be saved among the
remnant of true Israelites, and be made one
fold under one Shepheard Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
And this our Charity is the more conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
by this, that in <hi>bulla caenae,</hi> that is the
next day before, anniversarily, they doe as
solemnly curse and Anathematize us. To
this he answereth, first that <hi>they doe more for
us,</hi> and <hi>hazard their lifes dayly to convert us.</hi>
They hazard their lifes to serve a forrein
interest; not to convert, but to pervert as
many as they can; not to sow good seed in
the Lords Field, but to superseminare, or
sow Tares above the wheat. We should
thank them more to stay at home, then to
compasse Sea and Land to gaine Proselites
as the Pharisees did, and made them two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
more the Children of Hell then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
He saith, that <hi>this is the solemne Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of their Church every Good Friday.</hi> Let it
be so: but they have not the same incentive
and provocation which we have, we do not
curse and Anathematise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the day before,
as they doe us. This Advantage we have
over them, that we render blessing for
cursing, which they doe not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:40675:201"/>He addeth, that <hi>they cannot be understood
under the notion of Hereticks;</hi> first <hi>because we
acknowledge theirs to be a true Church, and
therefore not hereticall;</hi> Secondly <hi>they are of
Christs Flock already, and therefore not reduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Flock.</hi> To the First <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> answer, that a
particular Church which is onely material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Hereticall, not formally, doth still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a true Church of Christ. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> understood these things
much better then himself, this is confessed
by him in the place formerly alleged,<note place="margin">Brief Survey cap. 2. sect. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>A
particular Church may be really Hereticall or
Schismaticall, and yet morally a true particular
Church, because she is invincibly ignorant of
her Heresy or Schisme.</hi> We agree with him
wholy in the sense, onely we differ in the
expression. What he calleth <hi>really Hereticall,</hi>
we stile <hi>materially Hereticall;</hi> and what he
calleth morally a true Church, we use to
stile <hi>Metaphysically a true Church,</hi> that, is by
truth of Entity not of Morality. Secondly
I answer, that the Flock of Christ is taken
variously, sometimes more largely, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more strictly; more largely for all
those that are <hi>In domo,</hi> by outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
more strictly for those who are <hi>Ex
domo,</hi> so <hi>in the Church,</hi> that they are also <hi>of
the Church,</hi> by inward Sanctification. And
our Collect hath reference to this later ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:40675:201"/>
of this word <hi>[Flock]: So Fetch them
home blessed Lord to thy Floek, that they may
be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He taketh it ill, that our Church hath cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ged
these words in the Missall <hi>[recall them to our
Holy Mother the Catholick and Apostolick
Church], into this dwindling puling puritanicall
expression, of [one Floek and one Fold under one
Shepheard].</hi> Whether it be because he hath
a Pick against Scripture phrases, as soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too preacherlike; or rather because
our Church did presume to name the right
Shepheard <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and not leave it to
their Glosses to entitle the Pope to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
But certainly the Authority of the
Catholick Church, is not formidable at all
to any Genuine Sonnes of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doe readily acknowledge, that it is
the duty of each Orthodox Church to
Excommunicate Formall Hereticks, and
them who swerve from the Apostles
Creed as the rule of Faith: but this doth not
oblige the Church of England to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all materiall Hereticks, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the dictate of their conscience, in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Questions which are not Essentialls of
Faith, and do hold the truth implicitly in the
preparation of their minds. Neither do
I ever know that the Church of England
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40675:202"/>
did ever excommunicate Papists in grosse
<hi>qua tales,</hi> but onely some particular Papists,
who were either convicted of other Crimes,
or found Guilty of Contumacy. It were
to be wished, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would
use the same Moderation, and remember
how <hi>Ireneus</hi> reproved Pope Victor, <hi>that he
had not done rightly, to cut of from the Vnity of
the Mysticall body of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. li. 5. cap. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>so many and so
great Churehes of God.</hi> This is that great
nonsense, which this egregious Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
hath found in our Collect, that <hi>the
English Church cannot reconcile her doctrine and
her practise together.</hi> Let him not trouble his
head with that, but rather how to recoucile
himself with his own Church. He will
have prayers to be onely words no works:
but his Church maketh Prayer, Fasting and
Almes,<note place="margin">pa. 590</note> to be three satisfactory works.</p>
               <p>My third proofe of our Moderation was,
that we doe not challenge a new Church, a
new Religion, or new holy Orders: but
derive our Church, our Religion, our
Holy Orders, from Christ and his Apostles
by an uninterrupted Succession; we obtrude
no Innovations upon others. All this is
quite omitted by this great pretender to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
and yet he knoweth or may know,
that there have been, pretended Reformers,
who have committed all these excesses.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:40675:202"/>
But he catcheth hold of two words of my
defence, that we have <hi>added no thing</hi> (I
wish they could say as much) nor <hi>taken
away any thing but Errours.</hi> To the former part
he excepteth, that <hi>he who positively denies,
ever addes the contrary to what he takes away;
He that makes it an Article there is no Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
no Masse, no prayers to Saincts,</hi> hath as
many Articles as he who holds the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
I have taken away this answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and Demonstrated that no negative
can be a Fundamentall Article, or necessary
<hi>Medium</hi> of Salvation, because it hath no
Entity: That there are an hundred greater
disputes and Contradictions among them
selves, in Theologicall Questions, or in
these things <hi>quae sunt fide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those three are between us and them: Yet
they dare not say, that either the Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
or Negatives are Articles of Faith. The
Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Church for fifteen hundred yeares,
knew never more then 12. old Articles of
Faith, untill Pius the 4th added twelve new
Articles. And now this young <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
will make us more then 1200. Articles,
affirmative Articles and Negative Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Fundamentall Articles and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Articles. Every Theologicall truth
shall either be a Fundamentall Article, or an

                  <note place="margin">pag. 593.</note> I hope by this time
the Reader knoweth sufficiently, that his
penne is no slander. If the Church of

the Definition of the Church of England:
neither doth the Church of England define
any of these Questions as necessary to be

bindeth her sonnes for peace sake not to
oppose them. But he himself can hardly
be excused from lying, where he telleth us
<hi>the good simple Ministers did sweare to maintein
them.</hi> Perhaps he was one of the simple
Ministers, did he ever sweare to maintein
them? did he ever know any man who did

further, <hi>By the Bishops Logick, these propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
that there are not two Gods, that the devills
shall not be saved, nor the Saints in Heaven
damned, that there is no Salvation but
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40675:203"/>
through Christ; must cease to be Articles of
Faith, and become indifferent unconcerning
Opinions, because they are Negative.</hi> I wish
no more disparagement to any man, then to
be the authour of such an absurd assertion,
<hi>Either they are Fundamentall Articles, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning
Opinions.</hi> How should they
cease to be Articles, which never were Artic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les?
That there is one God, and one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Iesus Christ, that the life of the Saints
is everlasting, and the Fire of the devills
Everlasting, are Articles of Faith: but
every thing which may be deduced from
these, is not a distinct Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>To the latter part of my plea <hi>that we
tooke nothing away but weeds,</hi> he pleadeth,
first that <hi>it is but a self supposition,</hi> or a
begging of the Question. By his leave,
I have demonstrated that all the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Papall power, which are in
controversy between them and us, are all
grosse Vsurpations and weeds, which did
never sprout up in the Church of England
untill after 1100 yeares; no man can say
without shame, that such were planted by
Christ or his Apostles. Secondly he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth,
that <hi>to take away Errours, is a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
act af Iustice, not a proofe of Moderation:</hi>
On the contrary, therefore it is a
proofe of Moderation, because it is a
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40675:204"/>
requisite Act of Iustice; all virtue consisteth
in the meane or in a moderation. It is not his
particular, pretended, supposititious Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which doth secure us that Christ was,
and that the Holy Scripture is the Genuine
word of God: but the Vniversall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
Tradition of the Catholick Church
of Christ.</p>
               <p>My last proofe of our Moderation was,
that we are ready in the preparation of our
minds to believe and practice, whatsoever
the Catholick Church of this present Age
doth believe and practice. And this is an
infallible preservative to keep a man
within the Pale of the Church, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
doth this Cordially, cannot possibly be
a formall Heretick or Schismatick, because
he is invincibly ignorant of his Heresy or
Schisme;<note place="margin">Ang. Epi. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>No man can have iust cause to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
his Communion,</hi> a Communione or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis

this, his way had been to have proposed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething
which the Christian World united
doth believe or practise, which wee are not
ready to believe or Practice. This he doth
not so much as attempt to doe, but barketh
and raileth without rime or reason. First
he telleth us we say that there is no <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall

Church.</hi> Chuse Reader whether thou
wilt believe him or our Leiturgy, wherein
we pray dayly, that God <hi>will inspire the

Truth Vnity and Concord.</hi> He telleth
us, that <hi>they doe not doubt but we have
renounced our Creed.</hi> Chuse Reader
whether thou wilt believe him or our Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
wherein we make profession dayly
of the <hi>Apostolick, Nicene,</hi> and <hi>Athanasian</hi>
Creeds. He telleth us, that we have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
our reason.</hi> If he had said onely that
we had lost our reason, it is more then any
man in his right wits would say: but to
say we have renounced our reason, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
               <p>The reason of all this is, because <hi>we give
no certein Rule to know a true Church from an
Hereticall.</hi> He supposeth, that no Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Church is a true Church. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> may instruct him better,
that <hi>an Hereticall Church is a true Church
whilest it erreth invincibly.</hi> He saith that
<hi>he hath lived in Circumstances, to be as
well acquainted with our Doctrin as
most men are:</hi> Yet he professeth <hi>that
if his life were at stake, be could not
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:40675:205"/>
Determine absolutely upon our Constant
Grounds, VVhether Presbyterians Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
or Quakers are to be excluded
from the Vniversall Church or no.</hi> The
nearer relation that he hath had to the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> the more shame for
him to scoffe so often at the supposed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of his Mother, and to revile her
so virulently, without either ground or
Provocation, which gave him his Christian
being. He hath my Charitable Iudgement
of Presbyterians, in my Reply to the Bishop
of <hi>Chalcedons</hi> Epistle. And for the other
Sects, it were much better to have a
little patience and suffer them to dye of
themselves, then trouble the world so
much about them: they were produced in a
Storme and will dye in a Calme. He may
be sure they will never molest him, at any
Councell either Generall or Occidentall. It
is honour enough for them to be named in
earnest by a Polemick writer.</p>
               <p>But what manner of Disputing is this, to
bring Questions in stead of Arguments? As
what new Form of Discipline the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
have introduced? What are the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Conditions of a right Oecumenicall
Councell? What is the Vniversall Church,
and of what particular Churches it doth
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:40675:205"/>
consist? What are the notes to know a
true Church from an Hereticall? We
have introduced no new discipline, but
reteined the old. Our Conditions of a
right Oecumenicall Councell, are the
same they were, not altogether so rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
exacted in case of invincible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
We are readier to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ourselves, then to censure others:
either to intrude ourselves into the Office
of God, to distinguish perfectly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Schismaticks from materiall; Or
into the Office of the Catholick Church,
to determine precisely who ought to be
excluded from her Communion, who not.
We exclude all those whom undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Generall Councells have excluded,
the rest we leave to God, and to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of a free Councell as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
as may be. But because I would not
leave him unsatisfied in any thing, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to admit their own Definition of the
Vniversall Church, That is, <hi>the Company
of Christians knit together by the profession of the
same faith, and the Communion of the same Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
under the Government of lawfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours.</hi>
Taking away that purple patch,
which they have added at the latter end of
it, for their own Interest, <hi>And especially of
the Roman Bishop, as the onely Vicar of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:40675:206"/>
Christ upon Earth.</hi> And if they had stinted
at a Primacy of Order, or beginning of
unity, I should not have excepted against it.</p>
               <p>He objecteth, that <hi>Protestants have no
grounds to distinguish true believers from false.</hi>
That were strange indeed, whilest we have
the same Scriptures, interpreted by the
same perpetuall Tradition of the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Church, according to the same Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of Faith (wherein we give this honour
to the Fathers, not to be Authours but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of Tradition); whatsoever grounds
they have to distinguish true believers from
false, we have the same. But because I made
the Apostles Creed to be the rule of Faith,
he objecteth, First, <hi>then the Puritans who deny
the Article of Christs descent into Hell, must
be excluded quite from the Vniversall Church.</hi>
If they be so, what is that to the Church of
England? if they be turned out, yet let them
be heard first. They plead that the manner
of Christs descent is not particularly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined:
but let it be determined or not, they
ought to be turned out of the Vniversall
Church by a Generall Councell; and it may
be they will submit to the Authority of a
Generall Councell, then there will need
no turning out. Secondly he objecteth, <hi>So
a man may reject all Government of the Church,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:40675:206"/>
the Procession of the Holy ghost, all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all the Scriptures, and yet continue a
Member of Gods Church.</hi> Why so? When
I said the Creed was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ufficient Rule of
Faith, or <hi>Credendorum</hi> of things to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
I neither said nor meant, that it was
<hi>regula agendorum, a Rule of such things as are
to be practised;</hi> such as the Acts of discipline
and of the Sacraments are. The Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
enough for Salvation, touching the
Procession of the Holy Ghost, before the
words <hi>[Filioque]</hi> were added to it: and there
is great cause to doubt, that the Contentions
of the Eastern and Western Churches about
this Subject, are but a meer <hi>Logomachy</hi> or
strife about words. The Scriptures and
the Creed are not two different Rules of
Faith, but one and the same Rule, dilated in
the Scripture, contracted in the Creed;
the end of the Creed being to contein all
Fundamentall points of Faith, or a summary
of all things necessary to Salvation, to be
believed <hi>Necessitate medii:</hi> But in what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
writings all these fundamentall
points are conteined, is no particular
fundamentall Article it self, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in the Creed, nor could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in it; since it is apparent out of
Scripture it self, that the Creed was
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:40675:207"/>
made and deposited with the Church as a
Rule of Faith, before the Canon of the
new Testament was fully perfected. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and <hi>Socinians</hi> may perhaps wrest the
words of the Apostles Creed, to their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Sense: but not as it is explained by
the first foure Generall Councells, which
all Orthodox Christians doe admit. He
saith, they and we differ about the sense of
two Articles of the Creed, that is the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of Christ into Hell, and the Catholick
Church, but setteth not down wherein we
differ. He hath reason to understand our
Differences, having been of both Churches:
but I for my part do rather believe, that he
understandeth neither part right. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be, the Different Sense of an Article
doth make an Heretick, after it is defined
by the Vniversall Church, not before.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>he hath already shewed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Section, that the Protestant Grounds, have
left no Order and Subordination of Vniversall
Government in Gods Church.</hi> But he hath
neither shewn it in the foregoing Section,
nor any where else, nor is able to shew it.
We have the same subordination that the
Primitive Church, of Inferiour Clergy men
to Bishops, of Bishops to Archbishops, of
Archbishops to Patriarchs, and of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:40675:207"/>
to a Generall Councell, or as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
as may be. Let him shew any one
linke of this Subordination that we have
weakened. I said [we acknowledge not a
Virtuall Church, or one man as infallible as
the Vniversall Church]: He rejoineth,
<hi>Nor they neither.</hi> I wish it were so Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:
but the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who have the power of the Keys in their
hands (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> onely we accuse in this behalf)
do maintain the Contrary; that a Generall
Councell without the Pope may erre; that
the Pope with any Councell Generall or
particular, cannot erre; that the infallibility
of the Church is radicated in the Pope, by
virtue of Christs prayer for S. <hi>Peter, that his
faith should not faile,</hi> not in a company of
Counsailers, nor in a Councell of Bishops;
that the Pope cannot define temerariously,
in matters of Faith or good manners,
which concern the whole Church. What
a Generall Councell is, and what the
Vniversall Church is, and who ought
to be excluded from the one or the other
as Hereticks, I have shewed already;
namely, all those and onely those, who
doe either renounce their Creed, the
badge of their Christianity, the same
Faith whereinto they were baptised;
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:40675:208"/>
or who differing about the sense of any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
thereof, have already been excluded as
Hereticks, by the sentence of an undoubted
Generall Councell.</p>
               <p>Howsoever he sleighteth the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
which they have among themselves,
concerning the last resolution of Faith, as if
they were of no moment: yet they are not
of so little concernment to be so sleighted.
What availeth it to say they have the Church
for an infallible Iudge; whilest they are not
certain or do not know what the Church is,
or who this infallible Iudge is? May not a
Man say unto them as <hi>Elijah</hi> said unto the
Israelites, <hi>Why halt ye between two Opinions?</hi>
Or rather why halt yet betwixt five or six
Opinions? If the Pope alone be infallible
Iudge, follow him; If a Generall Councell
alone be this infallible Iudge, follow it; If
the Essentiall Church be the infallible Iudge,
Adhere to it; If the Pope and a Generall
Councell, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Councell, or the Pope and his Conclave of
Cardinalls, be this infallible Iudge, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them.</p>
               <p>He telleth us, that <hi>their Vniversall Church,
is as Visible as the sun at Noone day, to wit,
those Countryes in Communion with the See of</hi>
Rome. Without doubt they are Visible
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:40675:208"/>
enough: but it is as Visible, that they are
not the Vniversall Church. What shall
become of all the rest of the Christian
world? They are the elder Christians, and
more numerous fower for one, both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
and people. It is against reason
that one single Protopatriarch, should cast
out fower out of the Church, and be both
party and Iudge in his own Cause. But here
it ends not; If the Pope will have his Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church to be one Homogeneous body,
he must cast out a great many more yet,
and it is to be suspected this very <hi>Dispatcher</hi>
himself among the rest, for all his shewes.
They flatter the Pope with Generall Terms
of <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Chief Governour,</hi> and <hi>First

                     </gap>ings,</hi> and the
Iudgement of the Vniversity of Lisbone:
By the Lawes and Proclamations of the
Republick of Venice. This I made good,
in every particular branch of Papall power
which we have cast out of England; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
of the English Church, The right
to call and confirm Synods, to conferre Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks,
to receive Tenths and First
fruits and Oaths of Fidelity, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:40675:209"/>
the Supreme Legislative Dispensative
and Iudiciary power, in all things pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Externall Regimeut of the
Church. To all this, neither the Bishop
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> nor <hi>Mr. Serjeant,</hi> either in his
former Answer or in this rejoinder (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
provoked), have offered one word
of Answer.</p>
               <p>This Plea doth utterly destroy their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of <hi>Divine right</hi> and of <hi>uninterrupted Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
for all these Branches of Papall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
Can any man be so stupid as to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
that to be of <hi>divine right,</hi> which was first
tacked into the Church, with so much
Opposition, after eleven hundred yeares?
or that to be grounded upon perpetuall and
Vniversall Tradition, which hath been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in all Ages since it was devised, in all
places, by all sorts of persons; Kings and
their Parliaments and Councells, Synods
and Vniversities, Divines and Lawiers?
What shamefull Tergiversation is this,
which no ingenious Adversary could be
guilty of, but out of invincible necessity?
Thus he served me where I produced all our
old English Lawes. Thus he served me
where I produced their own Authours to
testify the intolerable extortions and Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s
of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Court. Thus he serveth
me here, and in place of so many lawes and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40675:210"/>
Proclamations, and Placaets, and Synodall
Acts, and Iudgements of Vniversities: he
shuffleth in so many of his fiddle-faddle
Contradictions, which are not all worth a
deafe Nut. If it were not that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
so far already; and <hi>Toto devorato Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,
turpe est in Cauda deficere,</hi> I would not
Vouchsafe to answer them but with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>Thus he begins, <hi>Nine or ten self Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
in one Section.</hi> He speaketh modestly,
if there be one, there are nine hundred.
This word [in effect] saith he, <hi>deserves a
Comment.</hi> It hath a Comment, wherein his
feigned Contradictions were satisfyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were hatched by him; the more
uningenuous person he, to take no notice
of it. He may find it in my reply to the
Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> cap. 7. s. 2. pa. 243.
Other Princes of the Roman Communion
have made lawes as well as we, to renounce
and abrogate all those branches of Papall
Authority which we cast out, that is, onely
Papall Vsurpations: but neither they nor
we ever <hi>defined against Essentiall right.</hi> We
deny not to the Pope a Superiority of Order
above the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but
we deny him a Superiority of power in the
Exteriour Court, that is, we deny him the
supreme Iudiciary Power: so did they. <hi>King</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:40675:210"/>
Henry <hi>the eighth abolished the Iurisdiction of
the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>within his Dominions, but
the Emperours did not so;</hi> If they did not so,
yet if they pleaded for it, or justified it,
it is as much as I said: And if they did
it by parcells (as I have shewed they
did) though they did it not in grosse, it is
the same thing in effect. <hi>Our Ancestours
threatned the Pope to make a wall of Separation
between him and them,</hi> not by making a new
Law, for it was the Common Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
but by declaring the Law, by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the Law: And though they had
threatned him to make one generall Law,
against all his Vsurpations in grosse; yet
formerly having made single Lawes against
the same in particular, it was but the same in
effect. This sucking Contradiction hath
been answered sufficiently in the last Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
He saith, <hi>our Controversy is not about
the extent of Papall Power, but about the right
it self.</hi> The just Contrary is true; Our
Controversy is onely about the extent of
Papall Power, or about those particular
Branches of Papall power which we have
cast out. He loves to hover in Generalls:
but we shall bring him willingly, or
against his will, to descend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:40675:211"/>He taketh notice here, of my <hi>complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that they answer not particulars, and I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Reader that if their cause would have
born it, they would have answered them.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
but how tame he is upon this Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that useth to be so fierce without
any Provocation. All the Answer it doth
extort from him is, <hi>Was ever man so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the common Lawes of Disputing? Needs
any more answer to be given to particulars which
one yields to, then to say he grants them?</hi> If he
be over much acquainted with the Lawes
of disputing, <hi>Reddat mihi Minam Diogenes;</hi>
Let him who tanght me Logick give me
my Money again. But it is well we have
his <hi>Concedo omnia &amp;c, We grant all his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Instances of these Contests between Kings
and Popes:</hi> Yet not so very well neither;
for what he granteth with one hand, he
taketh away with the other, <hi>Not entring
into that dispute, how farre they were
done Iustly, how farre unjustly, which
is little to our purpose, since the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
it self is acknowledged on both Sides.</hi>
It is little to their purpose indeed, but it is
much to ours. Is the Papall Power acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
where the Popes Soveraign Power,
his Legisllative power, his Iudiciary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
his dispensative power are all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:40675:211"/>
Much good may his <hi>dry Papacy</hi> (as
he pleaseth to call it sometimes) do him. In
every one of these Instances, besides meer
matter of Fact, there is an Inference to
matter of right. The <hi>Common Lawes of
Disputing</hi> require that he should have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that, as well as granted the other.
If his <hi>Dispatches</hi> be such as this, he may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
more answers in a day, then <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
could have made Oppositions in a
yeare.</p>
               <p>When I said, what is the Ground of his
Exception, Nothing but a Contradiction?
he urgeth, that <hi>I make account a Contradiction
is a matter of nothing.</hi> No, but I meant that
his vain Objecting of Imaginary Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
is a matter of nothing. Twenty
of them will not amount to one Fleabiting:
and I shewed him, that this ridiculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
which he bringeth here, is such
an one. The pretended Contradiction is
this, that <hi>their Doctrin concerning the
Pope is injurious to Princes, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
their Crownes: and yet, that they
hold and doe the same in effect against
the Pope that Protestants doe.</hi> A
doughty Contradiction; both parts are as
true as can be, <hi>referendo singula singulis,</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:40675:212"/>
referring what I said to the right Subject,
as I applied it. The Doctrin of the Pope
and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is injurious to Princes,
(of whom I speake expresly and no others:)
and yet soveraign Princes and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
have held and done, the same things
against the Pope in effect that Protestants
doe. Iust such another Contradiction as
this, The <hi>Guelphes</hi> are for the Pope against
the Emperour: yet the <hi>Gibellines</hi> are for the
Emperour against the Pope, and both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
Roman Catholicks. Thus he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
Subjects, and Predicates, and times,
and respects, and all Rules to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
But his defence is more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
then his pretended Contradiction,
That the <hi>substance of the Popes Authority is
the point which belongs to me to impugn.</hi> So
the Contradiction lieth not in what I did
say, but what I should have said, or rather
what he would have had me to have said.
When his <hi>Substance of Papall Authority,</hi> hath
lost all its extent (which he gives every man
leave to question), it is an <hi>Indivisible</hi> indeed.
His second Exception is just such another.
I pleaded that [I speake expresly of the Pope
and Court of <hi>Rome]:</hi> He rejoineth, <hi>No my
Lord, but I would not let you change <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ect
of the whole Question.</hi> If he will change my
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:40675:212"/>
sense, he must take the Contradiction upon
himself. These are the <hi>Common Rules of
disputing</hi> with this great Dictatour in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</p>
               <p>I chanced to say, that [our Religion and
theirs is the same]. He bids me <hi>answer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
whether the Roman Religion and ours do
not differ in this very point of the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy?</hi>
If the Roman Religion be the
Christian Religion, then our Religion is
the same. Every Difference in this point
or another point, doth not make a Diverse
religion. A Garden weeded and a Garden
unweeded is the same Garden. We esteem
it an honour to be Christians, and no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to us that we are no Papists; what
they think of us concerneth themselves not
us. We do gladly admit the old Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Rule of Religion: but we like not
their new Rules or new Creeds. And we
are ready for peace sake, to attribute as
much to the Pope as many of their own
Doctors doe, that is, a Primacy of Order
or beginning of Vnity: and the not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this, renders them guilty of Schisme
and breaking the Vnity of Gods Church.</p>
               <p>He demandeth, <hi>if these rigorous
Assertions be not the Generall Tenet of
their Church, whom do we impugn?</hi> We
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:40675:213"/>
impugn the Pope and Court of Rome,
whose Tenets these Rigorous Assertions are,
upon which they grounded their manifold
Vsurpations, which we have cast out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly;
and for so doing they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
us, and so broken the Vnity
of the Church. The substance of the
Popes just Authority is no more then a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Order, or beginning of Vnity at
the most; This we have not cast out. And
this Act we can justify, by <hi>betier Logick</hi> then
he can oppose it. We know the Pope hath
sometimes remitted of his rigour, when
he was not able to make good his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
by force: but it will trouble him to
find one instance of a Pope who hath ever
retracted his unjust censures out of pure
Conscience, or acknowledged his unjust
Vsurpations. Whether he did or no, we do
not much regard, being done with an erring
Key. Many Millions of Christians are
saved, which are out of <hi>his Catholick world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next follow two heavy Contradictions,
able to make <hi>Miloes</hi> back crack with their
weight. Take them in his own words, for
they are even absurd enough without any
Aggravavation. The Bishop said, that <hi>all
Catholick Kings, abetted by their Doctors and
Casuists, did resist the Pope</hi> in his Vsurpations,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:40675:213"/>
but here to shew how some Doctors at so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes
escaped the Popes Clutches, he
saith, that <hi>the Pope and his Court have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els to doe, then to enquire af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s of
private Doctors.</hi> Why may not this grow
to be a Contradiction in time? It is no
Conciliation already. The other Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is yet more silly. I said, <hi>perhaps some
of those Doctors lived about the time of the
Councells of</hi> Constance <hi>and</hi> Basile: that
is one Enuntiation, what is the other? Nay
there is none at all of mine. Yet he cryeth
<hi>score up another self contradiction.</hi> How? A
Contradiction of one Proposition? A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
with a <hi>Perhaps?</hi> Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
was never heard of in our dayes,
nor in the dayes of our Forefathers. But
though it be not a <hi>self Contradiction,</hi> yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may contradict the truth: No truly,
it con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>adicts the Truth no more then it self.
I will take away the [perhaps] to give him
Line enough. <hi>Some of the Opposers lived in
this last Age:</hi> Yet the Bishop saith <hi>some of them
lived in the time of the Councells of</hi> Constance.
This is the first time that ever a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
was pretended betwixt two
particular Propositions such as these. He
saith, <hi>that none can tell what I meane</hi>
by their living out of the Popes reach<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:40675:214"/>
I told him my self, their being protected
by Soveraign Power; <hi>My lord the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
defend me with the Sword, and I will defend
the with the Penne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>what the</hi> Sorbon Doctors
<hi>thought of the Court of Rome, concerns not me
nor the Question. They ever valued the Popes
Supremacy as a point of Faith, for the not doing
of which we are cast out of the Church.</hi> He
will find, that it doth both concern me and
the Question. If the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had
not obtruded another manner of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
then the <hi>Sorbon Doctors</hi> allowed, this
Schisme had never been. For all the Popes
Supremacy, they radicated Ecclesiasticall
power in the Church; they subjected the
Pope to the Church; they made him no
Soveraign Prince but a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi>
lesse then the Senate, that is, lesse then a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell. All that they allowed him
was a beginning of Vnity, where have we
dissallowed that?</p>
               <p>He accused, <hi>Our bloudy Lawes and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
Execution.</hi> I referred him to my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where this
Question is clearly stated, and fully discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
and I expected an account from him,
of that he had to say against it solidly and

               <p>Here he presents the Reader with two
new Contradictions of mine, as silly and
senselesse as the rest. They are these,
that I say <hi>the Instances cited by me, were before
the disloyall Opinions of the Romanists: and yet
some of my Instances were in Cardinall</hi> Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieus
<hi>dayes, and since very lately.</hi> Adding, that
I contradict myself <hi>yet once more, affirming
that I hope those seditious doctrins, at this day
are almost buryed.</hi> What Satisfaction doth
this man owe to his Reader, to conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale
from him all the Presidents Lawes
Sentences, of Emperours Kings Common-wealths
Vniversities, and to present him
nothing but such Fopperies as these? I will
not vouchsafe to spend any time about them,
but onely give the Reader an <hi>Ariadnes</hi> clew,
to guide him out of this Imaginary Maze.
I have shewed him, what these seditious
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:40675:215"/>
Opinions were, where they were hatched,
and when; namely, in the beginning of
Queen <hi>Elisabeths</hi> Reign.<note place="margin">Reply to the Bish. of Chalc. c. 3. sect. 4.</note> And though
some few of my Instances were after that
time, yet the maine body of them was much
more ancient; as in the Empire,, from
<hi>Charles</hi> the great to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and
in <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> downward.
So I might truely say that <hi>the Instances</hi> cited
by me, <hi>were long before those disloyall Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were hatched:</hi> and yet they are not so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
hatched, but <hi>I hope they are almost buried</hi>
at this day. A man would have thought
that I deserved thankes for my Charity,
not to be traduced. But it is all one, let
the Reader judge who it is that trippeth
up his own heeles.</p>
               <p>When I said, <hi>It was great Pity that he was
not one of Christs Counsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>lers when he formed
his Church;</hi> It did not suppose that Christ
had any Counsailers, but to taxe him who
takes upon him so Magisterially to dictate,
what was necessary then for Christ to doe.
This I called <hi>sawcinesse,</hi> and justly. Good
Christians (as I told him formerly) ought
to argue thus, Christ formed his Church
thus, Therefore this is the best Forme:
not thus, This is the best Forme, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
Christ Formed it after this manner.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:40675:216"/>
The onely reason why I cited that text of
<hi>St. Paul,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 4.</note> One Body, one Spirit, one Hope, one
Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God and
Father of all</hi> was this; that <hi>St. Paul</hi> reckoning
up seven Bonds of Vnity, should omit this
which <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> makes to be the onely
Bond of Vnity, namely, <hi>unus Papa, One Pope,</hi>
or one Bishop of <hi>Rome: Christ saw it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to make a Bond of Vnity between the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
And that for this reason he gave the
Principality to</hi> St: Peter, <hi>and Consequently to
the Bishops of</hi> Rome. All this he supposeth
on his own head, but doth not goe about
to prove any thing; if <hi>St. Paul</hi> had been
of the same, mind, that was the proper
place to have recorded it, and doubtlesse
he would not have omitted it. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which onely I used, he doth not touch:
but fancieth that I make these seven Bonds
of Vnity, or Obligations to Vnity, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Vnity, to be seven markes of those
which be in the Church; which I never
dreamed of. And therefore I passe it by
as impertinent: Onely adding, that our
Ground for Vnity of Faith is our Creed,
and for Vnity of Government, the very
same forme of Discipline, which was used
in the Primitive Church, and is derived from
them to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:40675:216"/>When I wished that <hi>he had expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more clearly, whether he be for a beginning of
Order and Vnity, or for a single head of Power
and Iurisdiction;</hi> I spake of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> of
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the case is cleare, that he had no more
power over his Fellow Apostles then they
had over him: and that the Supremacy of
Power rested in the Apostolicall College;
All that <hi>St. Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er</hi> had was a beginning of
Vnity, What <hi>St. Peter</hi> had, the Pope may
pretend a claime to, what he had not, the
Pope hath no pretence for. Neither <hi>Iohn</hi>
Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> nor any other
ancient Bishop, nor yet <hi>St. Gregory</hi> himself,
did ever dream of such a <hi>singular Headship
of Power</hi> as he mentions, that is, that <hi>no
Bishop in the Church should have Power but he;</hi>
Although the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
come very near it at this day, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all the power of Iurisdiction of all
other Bishops from the Pope. That Power
which <hi>Iohn</hi> affected, and <hi>St. Gregory</hi> impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
then, and we impugne now, is the
Power of Vniversall Iurisdiction in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Court; If that were an Heresy in
him (as he confesseth,) let them looke to
themselves. Neither is the Bishops Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Order, so <hi>dry a Primacy</hi> as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth,
nor destitute of those Privileges
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:40675:217"/>
which belong to a Primate of Order by the
Law of Nature, To call Assemblies <hi>sub

calling them, to propose doubts, to receive
Votes, and to execute so farre as he is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by the Church; This is the single
Power of a Primate of Order, but besides
this, he hath also a conjoint power in the
Government of the Church. What he saith
to the prejudice of Generall Councells, I
have answered formerly.</p>
               <p>He askes me, <hi>What other Successour</hi> St.
Peter <hi>had, who could pretend to an Headship
of Order, except the Bishop of</hi> Rome? I answer,
that I did not speake, of what <hi>St. Peter</hi> had,
but what he might have had, or may have
whensoever the Representative Church,
that is a Generall Councell, should give
the Primacy of Order to another Bishop.
Since he is so great a Friend to the Schoole
of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> he can not well be ignorant what

See is so fixed to</hi> Rome <hi>that it cannot
be removed,</hi> He urgeth, that <hi>then the Church
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:40675:217"/>
should remaine without this Principality at the
death of every Pope, untill all the Churches in</hi>
Iapan China <hi>and</hi> India <hi>had given their consent:
yet I acknowledge it to be of perpetuall necessity.</hi>
First, he doth me wrong, I did not say posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
that it is of <hi>perpetuall necessity:</hi> but
that I like it well enough, and the reason
being <hi>of perpetuall necessity,</hi> seemeth strongly
to imply the necessity of the thing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
I answer, that there is no need to
expect such far fetched Suffrages, so long
as the Primacy may remaine fixed where it
is, unlesse a Generall Councell or one
as Generall as may be, think fit to
remove it: and if a Generall Councell
remove it, it will take order for the
future succession. And this same reason
doth clearly take away his answer to
my instance, That as the Dying of such
a Bishop Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi>
doth not perpetuate the Chancellourship
to that Bishoprick, because there is a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Prince to elect another: so the dying
of <hi>St. Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
the Primacy to that Bishoprick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a Generall Councell when it is in
being, hath power to transferre it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
See, if they find it expedient for the
publick good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:40675:218"/>The Bishop knoweth right well, that the
Church of Christ is both <hi>his Spouse and his
Family,</hi> both the Governesse and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned;
The Supreme Governesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of its Representative a Generall
Councell, to which all Ecclesiasticall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
higher or lower, whether Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Christ or substituted by the Church,
doe owe an account; And the Governed
in respect of that <hi>Vniversality of Christians</hi>
which he mentioneth. And this sounds
much more sweetly in Christian eares, then
to make either the Pope the Maister, or
the Church of Rome the <hi>Mistresse</hi> of the

               <p>He brought an Argument for the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Roman Bishop, drawn from the
Vicissitude of Humane affairs. I reto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ted
it upon himselfe, that <hi>Rome</hi> itself was as
much subject to this Vicissitude, as any
other place, [it may be destroyed with an
Earthquake.] He saith, <hi>It must be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of Earthquake, which can swallow up the
whole Diocesse: if the City be destroyed, yet the
Clergy of the Roman Diocesse can elect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

that is both City and Diocesse, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

have run that Fortune; In that case what
will become of his Election. I added [it
may become Hereticall or Mahumetan].
He answereth, <hi>True, so may the whole
Church, if it had pleased God so to Order causes.</hi>
No, by his leave not so, Christ hath
promised that his Vniversall Church shall
never faile: but he hath not promised that
<hi>Rome</hi> shall never faile. I said, [the
Church never disposeth so of her Offices,
as not to be able to change her Mesnagery,
according to the Vicissitude of Humane
affaires]. He opposeth, that <hi>I granted in
the foregoing Page, that Christ himself and
not the Church instituted this Prineipality or</hi>
Primacy: and bids me <hi>shew, that the
Church hath Authority to change Christs
Institution.</hi> I did not grant it but sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose
it: but whether granted or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
it is not materiall to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The Church hath no power to
change Christs Institution in Essentialls:
but all Ecclesiasticall Officers whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
are her Officers, and she hath power
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:40675:219"/>
to dispose of them, and govern them, and
to alter what is not Essentiall.</p>
               <p>I know there are other meaus between
<hi>Tyranny and Anarchy,</hi> besides <hi>Aristocracy,</hi>
even all lawfull Formes of Government, as
<hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Democracy:</hi> but in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Catholick Church <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>
and Democracy had no place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it were in respect of Particular Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or Provinces; and therefore to have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Monarchy here, had been superfluous
and impertinent. But the Government of
the Primitive Church in the Apostles and
their Successours was ever Aristocraticall,
first by an equall Participation of power in
the Apostles, and then by a Subordination
of Bishops in their Successours; and this as
well out of Generall Councells as in them,
as well before there were Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
as after. It is not my want of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
but his want of Iudgement, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
such shadowes as these and nickname
them Contradictions.</p>
               <p>He askes, <hi>how should a Primate of Order,
who hath no power to Act at all in order to the

her good or procure her harme,</hi> then one who

                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:40675:220"/>
I told him that to looke upon men as they

that <hi>he lookes not upon men at all in this

he did <hi>looke at men in this place,</hi> otherwise
why did he adde this Condition; <hi>as a good

who lookes upon an Arbitrator so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
so pious, so Disinteressed as a good

men. And so in truth he ought to doe:

unsignificant Expressions of an <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
or <hi>Chief Governourship,</hi> or <hi>First
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:40675:220"/>
Movership,</hi> about which we have no
Controversy with them, and which are
equally appliable to a Primacy of Order and
a Soveraignty of Power), he saith nothing.
Whether the Pope be an absolute Monarch
or a duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> inferiour to the whole
Senate; whether he have a Coactive power
in the Exteriour Court, throughout all
other Princes dominions, without their
leaves; Whether he have the right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
Bishopricks, Convocate Synods,
Impose Pensions, For bid Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and require new Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to himself, Set up <hi>Legantine</hi> Courts,
Receive Appeales, make Lawes, dispense
with Lawes at his pleasure, he saith
nothing: yet these are the onely Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
we have with them, to aske what
we say to the Popes Authority, without
stating of it, without stinting of it, is an
unreasonable demand.</p>
               <p>I say secondly, that he ought to explain
himself, by what right he doth challenge
this Authority Divine or Humane, or onely
out of Prudentiall reasons. If he challenge
it by divine right or Humane right, he
ought to prove the right, according to the
just extent of that Authority which he doth
challenge: and not wave the extent, as a
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:40675:221"/>
thing Indifferent. If he challenge it out of
Prudentiall Reasons, it ought to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
whether the Hopes or the Hazards,
the Advantages or Disadvantages, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ces
or Inconveniences of such a Form
of Government particularly circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
doe over ballance the one or the
other; And the surest tryall of this is by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
It will trouble him to find so
many Advantages, which the Church and
Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> have received from
Papall Iurisdiction, (I speak not of the
Key of Order,) as may overweigh all
those Disadvantages which they have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined,
by the Extortions, and Vsurpations,
and Malignant Influence of the Papacy. If
he attribute no more power to the Pope,
then <hi>all Roman Catholicks universally</hi> do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
(which is the onely Rule that he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
us, to know what is the Substance of
Papall Authority), he need not be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous,
this Question is near an end.</p>
               <p>He askes <hi>whether wee, and the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Southern and Northern Christians,
be under the Government of Patriarchs
or any other Common Government?</hi>
I answer wee and they are under the same
Common Government, which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church was under from the Dayes
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:40675:221"/>
of the Apostles, long before there were any
Generall Councells; that was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Bishops under Primates or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs.
For as I have said formerly, a
Protarch and a Patriarch in the Language
of the Primitive Church are both one. We
have as much Opportunity to Convocate
Synods as they had then, before there
were Christian Emperours, and more: yet
by such Councells as they could Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
though they were not Generall;
they governed the Church. If there be
not that free Communication of one
Church with another that was then, either
by reason of the great distance, or our
mutuall misunderstanding one of another,
for want of the old <hi>Canonicall Epistles</hi> or
<hi>Literae Formatae,</hi> the more is the Pity:
We are sorry for it, and ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
our uttermost endeavours to the
Remedy of it.</p>
               <p>With these western Churches which
have shaken of the Roman Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke, we
have much more Communion, by Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
by Letters, by Publishing our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions:
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d we might justly hope for a much
nearer union yet, both in doctrine and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
if God would be graciously pleased
to restore an happy Peace. That we have it
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:40675:222"/>
not already in so large a measure as we
might, is their onely Faults, who would
not give way to an Vniform Reformation.
Sometimes they accuse us for having too
much Communion with them, at other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
they will not grant us to have any
at all.</p>
               <p>Concerning the rest of the Western
Churches which submit to the Papacy, we
have the same Rules both of Doctrine and
Discipline which they had, We have the
same that they have, saving their Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Errours. We have broken no Bonds
of Unity, either in Faith or Discipline;
we have renounced no just Authority, either
Divine or Humane; we adhere to the
Apostles Creed, as the ancient and true
Rule of Faith, into which alone all Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s
(that ever were) have been baptised, and
we renounce the upstart additionall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth. We are willing for
peace sake to give the Pope the same Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Order, which <hi>St. Peter</hi> had above
his Fellow Apostles: but the Supremacy
of power was not in <hi>St. Peter,</hi> but in the
Apostolicall College; neither is now in
the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in a Councell of
Bishops.</p>
               <p>He saith <hi>we maintein a larger Brotherhood
then they, but never goe about to shew any visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:40675:222"/>
Tye of Government.</hi> We shew them the
same Badge or Cognisance of our Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that is, the same Creed, and the same
Discipline or Government, that is, the
same Colours, derived down from the
Apostles by an uninterrupted Succession;
The same Doctrine and the same Discipline
is Tye enough. To take an exact <hi>View</hi> it
is necessary the <hi>Organ</hi> should be perfect,
the <hi>Medium</hi> fit, and the <hi>Distance</hi> convenient;
if any one of these were Defective in <hi>Mr.
Rosses View,</hi> he might well mistake: but I
may not doe him that wrong to trust your
Testimony, without citing his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He urgeth,</hi> If Christ have left any
Vnity of Government in his Church and
Commanded it to be kept, and we have
taken a Course to leave no such Vnity,
then we have rebelled against Christ and
his Church, and falsly pretend to have
him our Spirituall head. <hi>I admit this: now
let him Assume.</hi> But you <hi>(Protestants)</hi> have
taken a Course to leave no Vnity of Government
in the Church, which Christ left and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be kept. <hi>I deny his Assumtion altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
and he saith not one word to prove it.
This is his Enthymematicall manner of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:40675:223"/>He procedeth, That <hi>to have a Generall
Councell for an Ecclesiasticall Head, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that there is no Ordinary Vnity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Gods Church, but extraordinary onely
when a Councell sits.</hi> I deny this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
altogether, and the reason is Evident;
because besides a Generall Councell which
sitteth but rarely, (neither is it needfull that
it should sit often, <hi>Nisi dignus Vindice nodus
inciderit,)</hi> there are particular Councells,
which in lesser Exigents serve the turn as
well as Generall. There are Patriarchs
and Bishops, which are Ordinary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.
In an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that the Governours should be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
actually Assembled. In the first
three hundred yeares, there were no Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councells held, there was lesse hope
of ever holding them then, then now: yet
there was <hi>an Ordinary Vnity of Government
in Gods Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rch</hi> in those dayes, for which
they were not indebted at all to any visible
Monarch. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t when a Generall Councell
doth sit, the Supreme Ecclesiasticall power
rests in it.</p>
               <p>He wonders <hi>why I should make the King
onely a Politicall Head,</hi> Contrary to our
Common Assertion. It seemeth that though
he hath been bred among us, yet he hath
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:40675:223"/>
not been much versed in our Authors; No
man that ever understood himself, made
him otherwise. Yet this Politicall Head,
hath a great Influence upon Ecclesiasticall
Causes and persons, in the Externall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church. He demandeth, <hi>is
there any Orderly Common Tye of Government,
obliging this Head to Correspond with the other
head? If not, where is the Vnity?</hi> I answer, yes,
the direction of his Spirituall Guides, that
is, his Bishops and Synods; If this Method
be so great a Rarity with him, it is his
own fault. He had said more properly,
<hi>to Correspond with the other Heads</hi> then
<hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>It is false to say, that they have
sometimes two or three heads, since there can be
but one true or rightly chosen Pope.</hi> True, but
the Election may be uncertain, that no
man living can know the true Pope: so
whether there be three Popes, or one Pope
and two pretenders, yet if the right Pope
cannot be made appeare, it is all one rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to the Church; <hi>If the Trumpet give an
uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to
the Battell.</hi> He telleth us further, that <hi>when
the See of Rome is vacant, the Headship is in
the Chiefe Clergy whom they call Cardinalls,
as secure a Course as mans wit can invent.</hi>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:40675:224"/>
As Chiefe as their Cardinalls are, the much
greatest part of them, were but Ordinary
Parish Priests and Deacons of old. The
Cardinalls indeed have to doe with
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Vacancy: but
what pretense have they from <hi>St. Peter?</hi>
What have they to doe with the Vniversall
Monarchy of the Church? Before he told
us, that thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Headship was <hi>Christs own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>
now he telleth us that this Headship
is sometimes in the College of Cardinalls,
and that it is <hi>as secure a Course as mans wit
can invent.</hi> What a <hi>Contradiction</hi> would he
make of this?</p>
               <p>He demandeth, <hi>doth the Harmony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
shew, that we have</hi> one Common cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule of Faith, <hi>or any particular sort of
Government, obliging us to an Vnity, under the
Notion of Governed?</hi> I doe shew him one
Common certain Rule of Faith, even the
Apostles Creed: and a particular sort of
Government, even the same was used in the
Primitive Times. What am I the better? he
will take no notice of them, because I will
not fixe upon that Rule of Faith, and that
Form of Government which he Fancieth.
Yet I am for Tradition as well as he, but it
is Vniversall and perpetuall Tradition:
such a Tradition is the Creed, and in deed
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:40675:224"/>
is that very Tradition which is so renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Ancients.</p>
               <p>He chargeth me with saying, <hi>That Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
can have no Baptisme.</hi> Let him either
make his accusation good, or suffer as a
Falsifier. All that I say is, <hi>Turkes Iewes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
and Christians, have not the same Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>
The reason is plaine, because Turkes
and Iewes have no Baptisme at all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
we ought to distinguish between
the Baptisme of Hereticks, and Hereticall
Baptisme; if the Baptisme it self be good,
the Administration of it by Hereticks
doth not invalidate it at all: but if the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
baptise after an Hereticall Forme,
as without due Matter, or not in the
Name of the Trinity; such Baptisme is
Hereticall and naught. But all this is
needlesse to understand the right scope
of my words, I said that a Body cousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of Iewes Turkes Hereticks and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
had not the same Baptisme: I did
not say that every one of these wanted true
Baptisme; He might as well charge me
with saying that <hi>Christians can have no true
Baptisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have manifested elswhere, that the Creed
is a List of all Fundamentalls:<note place="margin">Sect. 1. cap. 2.</note> and in the
same Section and Chapter the Reader shall
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:40675:225"/>
find that the Bishop is not a Falsifier, bu
<hi>Mr. Serjeant,</hi> is both an egregious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator
and Falsifier of the Councell of
<hi>Ephesus.</hi> I to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ke the word <hi>Paganisme,</hi> in
the ancient Primitive sense for <hi>Infidelity,</hi> as
it is contradistinguished to Christianity.
The true reason of that Appellation was,
because Country Villages did continue long
in their Infidelity, after Cities were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to Christianity. So the Turkes are
the onely Pagans, which we have now in
this part of the World. What a piece of
<hi>Goteham Wisdome</hi> is this, to quarrell about
names, when we agree upon the things.
Turkes and Pagans in my sense were the
same thing: both Infidells.</p>
               <p>But he instructs the <hi>Learned Bishop, that
the Turkes acknowledge a God.</hi> So did the
Pagans also, if <hi>Lactantius</hi> say true, <hi>Non
ego illum Lapidem colo quem video, sed servio
eiquem non video.</hi> He addeth, that I <hi>affirme
the Councell of Ephesus held in the yeare</hi> 430,
<hi>Ordered something concerning Turkes, which
sprang not up till the yeare 630, and calleth this
good sport.</hi> If there be any sport, it is to see his
Childish Vanity. If I listed to play with
words, I could tell him that the Mahumetans
sprung up about the yeare 630, the Turkes
many Ages after. But the answer is plaine
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:40675:225"/>
and easy, the Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> did give
Orders for all Ages ensuing concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells:
but Turkes are Infidells, and so it
gave Order concerning Turkes.</p>
               <p>Socinians <hi>and</hi> Arrians, <hi>may admit the
Apostles Creed interpreted their own way:</hi>
but they ought to admit, it as it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by the Frst foure Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells;
that they doe not, and so they
believe not all Fundamentalls as they should
doe. What he Objecteth further, that
<hi>Puritans hold not the Article of Christs descent
into Hell,</hi> and <hi>the Roman Catholicks and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
differ about the sense of two other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
hath been answered formerly. The
Puritans will tell him, that the manner of
Christs descent hath not bene determined
hitherto. And I doubt much, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
not the Romish and English Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
so well as he should.</p>

               <p>My first Charge was this, That Member
of any Society which leaveth its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place, to assume an higher place in the
Body, is Schismaticall: But the Pope and
his Party do not content themselves that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should be the Sister of other
Patriarchall Churches, and the Mother of
many Churches, unlesse she be Lady and
Mistrisse of all Churches; or that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
should be the Brother of Other Bishops,
or a fellow of other Bishops (as he was
stiled of old), unlesse he may be the Lord
and Maister of all Bishops. That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is his proper place, I clearly proved
by Letters, not of himself to other Bishops,
that might be Condiscension; as for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
to call his Officers Fellow souldiers:
but of other Bishops to him; no under
Officer durst presume to call his Generall
fellow souldier. That he assumeth the
other place to himself, is proved out of the
new Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, <hi>I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40675:226"/>
the Roman Church to be the Mother and
Mistrisse of all Churches:</hi> and I promise and
sweare true Obedience <hi>to the Bishop of Rome,
as to the Vicar of Iesus Christ.</hi> And in the
Oath of Allegiance which all Bishops
sweare to the Pope, IAB <hi>Bishop</hi> &amp;c. <hi>will be
Faith full to</hi> St. Peter, <hi>and to the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to our Lord
Pope</hi> Alexander &amp;c. There is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between the old Brother Bishop and
fellow Bishop, and this Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to the Pope as to their LiegeLord.</p>
               <p>First he Chargeth me, that <hi>I doe flatly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sify
his words, which doe never deny her to be
a mother,</hi> but a <hi>Sister onely.</hi> Either I falsified
his words, or he falsified mine. My
words were these, <hi>First they make the
Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>to be not onely the Sister of all
other Patriarchall Churches and the Mother of
many Churches, but to be the Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
of all Churches.</hi> The two Former Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Sister and Mother are both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
the last onely of Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
is denyed. He falsifieth my words
in his answer thus, <hi>because she takes upon her
to be Mistresse, where she is but Sister to other
Churches.</hi> You see the word Mother is left
out, and because I bring it in againe as I
ought, to make the Argument as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40675:227"/>
his Curtaling of it, I am become the
Falsifier with him, and he who is the Falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier
in earnest is innocent.</p>
               <p>I cited the words of <hi>St. Bernard,</hi> to prove
that the Pope was not Lord or Maister of
other Bishops, and the Roman Church a
Mother of other Churches, not <hi>a Lady or
Mistresse.</hi> He distinguisheth between
<hi>Dominam</hi> and <hi>Magistram,</hi> an <hi>Imperious
proud Lady Mistrisse,</hi> and <hi>a Schoole-Mistresse</hi>
or <hi>Teacheresse;</hi> Adding, that
<hi>they use the word</hi> Magistram <hi>in the latter
sense.</hi> So they say no more then we;
we do acknowledge the Church of
Rome to be a <hi>Teacheresse,</hi> and the
Pope a <hi>Teacher,</hi> as it is an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Church and he an Apostolicall
Bishop: but all the Question is of the
other word <hi>Dominum,</hi> which the Pope
taketh to him self as well as <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum;</hi>
as we have seen in the Oath of
Allegiance which he makes all Bishops
to sweare. Neither doth <hi>St. Bernard</hi>
oppose proud Imperious Dominion to
Gentle Dominion, but he contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
Dominion to no Dominion;
<hi>and thy self not a Lord of other Bishops,
but one of them.</hi> Not a Lord of other
Bishops, saith <hi>St. Bernard:</hi> A Lord of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:40675:227"/>
other Bishops, saith the Oath of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
<hi>I will be faithfull to our Lord
Pope Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He urgeth, that <hi>the Bishop hath
brought a Testimony, which asserts the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be the Mother
of other Churches, and so of the Church
of</hi> England <hi>too. St. Bernard</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the
Mother of other Churches, so did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:
but not to be the Mother of all
other Churches, no more did the Bishop;
particularly not of the Church of <hi>Britain,</hi>
which was ancienter then the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and so could not be her daughter.
Let them prove their right that they are
our Mother, and we are ready to doe our
filiall Duty; saving alwayes that Higher
duty which we owe to our Mother <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi>
the Vniversall Church. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they prove their right that they are
our Mother, neither is that Subjection
which they Demand, the Subjection due
to a particular Mother, but to an Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Lord.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Schisme involves in its Notion disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce,
&amp;c.</hi> And so the Bishop <hi>concludes the Mother
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:40675:228"/>
Schismaticall because she is disobedient to her
Daughter.</hi> His first errour is, to make the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be our Mother. The
second, to thinke that a Mother may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
what Obedience she listeth of her
Daughter. The third, that Schisme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
altogether in the Disobedience of
Subjects. Causall Schisme may and doth
Ordinarily consist, in the unlawfuli Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Superiours.</p>
               <p>My second reason to convince them as
guilty of Schisme, was the new Creed set
out by <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth; This he calleth a
<hi>Calumny.</hi> He cannot speake lower then
<hi>Calumnies, Absurdities, Contradictions, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifications</hi>
&amp;c. A high <hi>Calumny</hi> to slander
them with a matter of truth; It is such a
<hi>Calumny</hi> as they will never be able to shake
of. He referreth the Reader to what he
hath said in the first Section, and I to my
Answer there. He saith it is known that
<hi>each point in that profession of Faith</hi> (that is the
twelve new Articles) <hi>was held of Faith by the
former Church.</hi> How? <hi>held of Faith?</hi> as an
Essentiall of Faith? And this known? to
whom? to the man in the Moone? But
here is the maddest Contradiction that ever
was, and might well have become his
<hi>Merry Stationer.</hi> It is a <hi>Contradiction to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40675:228"/>
that he</hi> (Pius the 4.) <hi>made a new Creed,
till it be shewn that any of these points was not
formerly of Faith, and be proved satisfactorily
that the Apostles Creed conteined all necessary
points of Faith.</hi> A Contradiction? I see
many men talke of <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> who never
shot in his Bowe: talke of Contradictions,
who know not what they are. Observe
the equity of these men, They Visibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
12 new Articles into the Creed, and
then would put us to prove, that <hi>they were
not of Faith before, and that all necessary points

He is resolved to keep two strings to his
Bowe, and knoweth not which of them to
trust to. Heare you Sr. If they be Articles
of Faith now, as you have made them, then
they were alwayes Articles of Faith: and
all those were damned which did not believe
them; but that you dare not say.</p>
               <p>My third Charge of Schisme was, because
they mainteine the Pope in his Rebellion
against Generall Councells. Here he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
between a <hi>Schooleman</hi> and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertist,
to no manner of purpose, for it
is altogether impertinent. There is no man
who inveigheth so much against <hi>wording</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d
<hi>Quibling</hi> as himself, and yet the world hath
not a greater <hi>Worder</hi> or <hi>Quibler</hi> then he is.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:40675:229"/>
Wherefore to prevent the Readers trouble
and mine own, and his shifting and flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and to tye him within his Compasse
perforce; I made bold to reduce my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to a Syllogisticall Forme. They
who subject a Generall Councell, which is
the Highest Tribunall of Christians, to the
Pope, are guilty of Schisme: But the Pope
and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all their maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
(that is, much the Greater part of
of their writers,) doe subject a Generall
Councell to the Pope. Therefore the
Pope and Court of Rome with all their
Mainteiners, that is the much greater part
of their Writers, are Guilty of Schisme.</p>
               <p>Here he should have answered Punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the Proposition or Assumtion, either
by denying granting or distinguishing: but
for all his calling for a <hi>Rigorous Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
way,</hi> he liketh it not, because he cannot
make such impertinent extravagant excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as he useth to doe, which are the
onely help he hath at a dead lift. All the
Answer he giveth is this, <hi>He</hi> (the Bishop)
<hi>is accused of a Contradiction and Non<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sense,
and to cleare himself he telles us,
he will now lay aside the one part of the
Contradiction and endeavour to make
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40675:229"/>
good sense of the other.</hi> To what Proposition,
to what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>erme doth he apply this answer?
I see no Contradiction, I see no Nonsense
in my discourse, nor any body living but
himself. I said no such thing as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
What doth the man meane by these
<hi>waves of brainlesse butterd fish,</hi> by these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous
incoherent Fopperies, and
<hi>Chimaeraes</hi> which have no existence but in
his own pate? If he meane to answer, let him
doe it clearly like a Schollar; since I have
found this way to tye him to his matter, and
restraine his torrent of words, I shall put it
in practice oftner. Yet if I meet with any
such thing as is substantiall among his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring
expressions, which hath but the
least resemblance of an answer, though
it be not reduced into Forme, I will
gleane it out, and examine the weight of
it.</p>
               <p>Such is this which followeth, <hi>Was it for
this Opinion of the Pope above the Councell</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>How were they guilty of Schisme for this? unlesse
they had denyed you Communion for holding the
Contrary, or prest upon you an unconscientious
approbation of it, which you know they did not.
Foole not your Readers my Lord; It was not for
this Tenet which you impute to the Court of
Rome, but for that of the Popes Headship or
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:40675:230"/>
Spirituall Iurisdiction over all Gods Church
held by all Catholicks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For which you are
excommunicated.</hi> It is true they did not deny
us Communion for holding this Opinion,
nor presse upon us an unconscientious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of this Opinion directly, for any
thing that I know: but neverthelesse, they
have by their power subjected a Generall
Councell to the Pope, they have procured
it to be defined (though not expresly) in the
Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> and to be expresly
defined in the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> under
<hi>Leo</hi> the tenth. Hence it is, that all the
Councells since the Councells of <hi>Constance</hi>
and <hi>Basile</hi> and the two <hi>Pisan</hi> Councells, have
wanted Conciliary Freedome, and been
altogether at the Disposition of the Popes;
to prorogue them, to tranfferre them, to
stin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> them what matters they might handle
and what not, to deferre their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
untill he had formed or created a
party, or wrought some of the dissenting
Bishops to his will, to ratify or reject their
decrees at his pleasure. When or where
was it ever heard before, that there was
twice as many Bishops of one Nation in a
Generall Councell, as of all other Nations
in the world? Hence was that complaint
of the Fathers in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that
the Synode was guided by the Holy Ghost
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:40675:230"/>
sent from <hi>Rome</hi> in a Male. If it had not
been for this thing, but the Fathers had been
permitted freely to have proceeded in the
Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the Resolution of that
noble Question concerning the Residence
and divine Right of Bishops: in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
this great rent had been made up, and
he and I had not needed to have disputed
this Question at this Day.</p>
               <p>Thus by this Opinion and by their Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Practises to establish it, they are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
and formally Schismaticall: and have
been both the procreating and conserving
Cause of this great Schisme; the procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
cause, by altering the Hierarchy, and
Disordering the Members, which doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
produce a disturbance and Schisme
in the Body; and the conserving cause, by
destroying the Freedome of Councells,
which are the proper Remedies of Schisme.
Whether these later Councells were Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall,
or Occidentall, or neither, is not
the point in debate; They are those which
they call Generall; They were as Generall
as they would permit them to be; and to
conclude, it was their fault that they were
not more Generall. So though this were not
the very cause alleged by them, why they
did excommunicate us: yet it was one of the
Causes of the Schisme, and consequently of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:40675:231"/>
our Excommunication.</p>
               <p>I leave every man free to Iudge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
but for mine own part I am so great a
Lover of the peace of Christendome, that
I should not oppose the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi>
headship of Order, if he would be content
with it; and that is as much as many whom
he stileth his own Sons do yield him. But
though that be sufficient for the Catholick
Church, it is not sufficient for the Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> to fill their Coffers; they love not
such <hi>a Dry Papacy.</hi> I dispute onely whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Popes right be Divine, or humane,
or mixed (as <hi>Gerson</hi> thought); either score
may justly challenge Duty: But I am very
positive, that whatsoever the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath more then this Primacy of Order or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Vnity, he had it by humane right,
and by humane right he may lose it. Neither
doe I goe about to deprive the Bishop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
or any Bishop whatsoever of any Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
purely spirituall, which was left them as
a Legacy by Christ or by his Apostles: but I
deny that Apparitors, or Pursivants, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are of Christs Institution; I deny that
Christ or his Apostles did ever either exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
themselves, or grant to others Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to exercise Coactive Iurisdiction in the
exteriour Court, over the Subjects of other
Princes, within their Dominions, and
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:40675:231"/>
without their leaves. If Subjects submit,
<hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> but then it is not Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;
If Princes give leave, (as they have
done in all Ages, so far as they judged it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for the publick good), then it is
very lawfull: but without the Subjects sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or the Princes leave, there may be
indeed a spirituall kind of Coactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Court of Conscience, but no true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
in the exteriour Court of the Church.</p>
               <p>I see he understandeth not the sense of
that Logicall restriction, <hi>The Papacy as it is
such;</hi> which signifieth not the Papacy as it
ought to be, or so far as all Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
doe agree about it; but the Papacy as
it is Qualified in present, or as it is owned,
or obtruded, or endeavoured to be obtruded
by the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> So the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
as it is such,</hi> is opposed or contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
to the Ancient Papacy in the purer
and more Primitive times, which was not
guilty of those Vsurpations which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Popes have introduced. Thus still my
Contradiction doth end in his misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
               <p>My fourth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d last charge of Schisme upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the
Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was thus. They who
take away the Line of Apostolicall Successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
throughout the world except in the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who make all Episcopall Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:40675:232"/>
to flow from the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
to be founded in his Lawes, to be imparted
to other Bishops as the Popes Vicars and
Coadjutors, assumed by them into part
of their Charge, are Schismaticks: But the
Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and their maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do thus: Therefore the Pope and
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and their mainteiners, are
Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>To this Argument, he vouchsafeth no
answer at all in due Forme as it ought to be,
and I have no reason to insist long upon his
Voluntary <hi>Iargon.</hi> All the Answer which
he intimateth is this, that <hi>this Tenet is not
Generall among them, but points of Faith are
held generally.</hi> Here is an answerlesse
Answer, without confessing or denying
either Proposition: such an Answer doth not
become one, who maketh himself so great
a Master in the Art of disputing; I charge
not their whole Church, but the Pope and
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all their Abetters and
Mainteiners, with the Crime of Schisme.
I conclude no more then I assume. He
answers that <hi>the whole Church dot not hold these
Tenets.</hi> What is that to the purpose? As if a
Particular person, as the Pope, or a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Society, as the Court of Rome, or
the greater part of a Church, as all their
Abetters and mainteiners, could not be
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:40675:232"/>
Schismaticks except the whole Church be
Schismaticall, which is most absurd. I am
free to charge whom I will, if he will not
answer for them, he may be silent: but if he
undertake to be their Advocate, let him
defend them in due Forme as he ought,
and not tell us, that <hi>he is not concerned as a
Controvertist to defend any thing but Points of
Faith.</hi> Which is neither better nor worse
in plain English, then to run away from
the Question. All our Controversy is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such and such pretended Privileges be
Papall Rights or Papall Vsurpations: If he
dare not maintein them to be just rights,
either by divine Law or humane Law, and
refuse to contend with us when we prove
them to be Vsurpations; to what end doth
he interest himself, and break other mens
heads with the clattering noise of his <hi>Sabots.</hi>

to free himself from such an horrid

To his Objection I answer, First, that
though we had no such certein Rule of
Faith: yet it was not presently necessary,
that we must tumble headlong into such
abhominable errours, as many of these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
held, which the Discreeter Heathen
did detest. Secondly, we have a certain
Rule of Faith, the Apostles Creed dilated
in the Scriptures, or the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into the Apostles Creed: and for
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:40675:234"/>
that ugly Fardle of Heresies, which he
mentioneth, we can shew that they are all
diametrally opposite to the Apostles Creed,
as it is explained in the foure first Generall
Councells. Reader have a care to presere
<hi>Epicte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>faithfull</hi> or rather feigned <hi>Protestations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He argueth, <hi>All those Hereticks had the
Same Rule or Grounds of their Faith that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
have, namely the Holy Scripture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are all of the Protestant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
In good time. All those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
had the same Rule or grounds of their
Faith, that Roman Catholicks have, namely
the Holy Scriptures, therefore they are of
the Roman Catholick Communion. If he
except, that the bare Letter of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
is not the Ground or Rule of Faith to
Roman Catholicks, but the Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
according to the Analogy of Faith
and Tradition of the Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Church
of <hi>England</hi> saith the very same for it self.
So if this be the source of all errour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
the Tradition of the Church, we
are far enough from the source of all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
This is the onely difference in this
particular betweene me and <hi>Mr. Serjeant,</hi>
what he attributeth <hi>to the Tradition of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Forefathers,</hi> I ascribe to the <hi>perpetuall
and Vniversall Tradition of the Catholick
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:40675:235"/>
Church.</hi> Who would believe, that this
man himself had deserted the Tradition of
his Immediate Forefathers?</p>
               <p>That which he addeth, the Traditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
of Immediate Forefathers <hi>is the onely Ground
of Faiths certainty,</hi> and the Denying of it
<hi>more Pestilentiall then the Denying of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of Christ, or the asserting the worst of those
errours which any of those old Hereticks held,</hi>
as there are two Gods, a Good God and
an Evill God; is most false and Dangerous,
to tumble into a certain Crime for feare of
an uncertein. What he addeth concerning
<hi>Sects new sprung up in</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Luther,
<hi>and</hi> Carolostadius, concerneth not us nor
the present Controversy.</p>
               <p>I said, that some few Eastern Christians

and in our Name, and in the name of all
those Churches which hold Communion
with us, I accursed all the Errours of those
Hereticks. Notwithstanding all this, he
saith that <hi>nothing is more right then to call them
so, that what I say here is contrary to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
and best intelligence we have from those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

                  <hi>aud</hi> Eutychians, <hi>though I say I will
not,</hi> that <hi>I stroake those errours which I accurse,
with a gentle hand, stiling them but unusuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</hi>
First for so much as concerneth my
self, I have renounced those errours, I have
accursed them: if yet he will not cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is nothing left for me to doe, but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to God the searcher of all hearts, that
what I say is true, and his accusations are
groundlesse Calumnies. But as to the
merit of the cause he addeth, that <hi>these unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
expressions were onely these, that Christ had
two distinct persons, and no distinct natures.</hi> Thus
he saith, but what Authours, what Authority
doth he produce, that any of these Churches
are guilty of any such expressions? None at
all, because for all <hi>his good intelligence,</hi> he hath
none to produce, nor ever will be able to
produce any; and so <hi>his good intelligence</hi> must
end in smoke and stinke, as his <hi>most faithfull
protestation</hi> did before. I will conclude this
point to his shame, with the Doctrin of
the English Church Art. 2. That <hi>the two
Natures Divine and Humane are perfectly
and inseperably conjoined in the Vnity of
the person of Christ.</hi> Doth this agree
with his counterfeit expressions, <hi>Christ
hath two distinct persons no distnct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi>

is we are either wheat or chaffe of the
Lords Floore, but their tongues must not
winnow us], these words [the best is], had
no such immediate Relation unto the words
immediatly following [we are either wheat
or Chaffe], but to the last<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> words [their

the complete sense, <hi>we are either wheat or

               <p>In my Reply to the Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>

is an unequall match, between <hi>Mr. Rosse</hi> a

in a cause concerning his own
Church. I meddle not with <hi>Mr. Rosse,</hi>
but leave him to abound in his own sense, I

but with Mr. Serjeant. I shall be bold to

               <p>The next instance concerning Purgatory,

it were a great shame to confute it; <hi>They
believe that the soules of the Dead are bettered
by the prayers of the living.</hi> Which way are
they bettered? That the soules of damned
are released or eased thereby, the Modern

Tiranny and lying supposititious
Traditions, so do we; but if they be
for <hi>the Authority of the Church,</hi> and for
genuine Apostolicall <hi>Traditions,</hi> Gods

the Grecians know no feast of <hi>Corpus
Christi,</hi> nor carry the Sacrament up and
down, nor elevate it to be adored. They
adore Christ in the use of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so do we: They do not adore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
no more do we.</p>
               <p>Yet from hence he inferreth, that <hi>there
is not a point of Faith wherein they dissent from
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>except that one of the
Popes Supremacy.</hi> It is well they will
acknowledge that. Yet, the <hi>Grecians</hi> agree
with us and differ from them, in his two
Rules or Bonds of Vnity. In the Rule of
discipline; the <hi>Grecians</hi> and we have the
same Government of Bishops under Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
and Primates, Secondly in the Rule
of Faith; the Grecians and we have both
the same Canonicall bookes of Scripture,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:40675:238"/>
both reject their Apocryphall Additions
from the Genuine Canon. They and we
have both the same Apostolicall Creed,
both reject the new Additions of <hi>Pius</hi> the

deny their Transubstantiation, their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
their Iustification by workes <hi>in
sensu forensi,</hi> their doctrine of Merits and
Supererogation, their Septenary number
of the Sacraments, their Image worship,
their Pardons, their private Masses, their
half-Communion. And to be briefe, the
<hi>Grecians</hi> doe renounce and reject all those
Branches of Papall power, which we have
cast out of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> As the
Popes Soveraignty over the Catholick
Church by divine Right, as <hi>Nilus</hi> saith; <hi>It
is intollerable that the Roman Bishop will not be
subject to the Canons of the Fathers, since he had
his Dignity from the Fathers.</hi> Secondly his
Legislative power, as <hi>Peter Stewart</hi> Vice-chanceller
of <hi>Ingolstad</hi> witnesseth, that the
<hi>Grecians</hi> object it as an errour to the <hi>Latines,</hi>
that <hi>they make the Popes Commandements to be
their Canons and Lawes.</hi> Thirdly his Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary

I am glad that <hi>Nilus</hi> is in his good grace, to
be stiled by him <hi>one of the gravest Bishops and
Authors of that party,</hi> for one moderate
expression wherein he saith no more then
we say<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> His Friend <hi>Possivine</hi> calls him a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
Adversary:</hi> and if ever <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi>
read him throughly, it is ten to one he will
change his note. Thus much for my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Eastern Churches, it is
the same with the Southern and Northern
Churches; all which doe plead better Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then himself.</p>
               <p>Whereas he saith that my Assertion, that
<hi>the Creed conteined all points necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
is grounded onely upon my falsifying of the
Councell of</hi> Ephesus; he bewrayeth his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
both in the Fathers and in his
own Authours. The Scripture is none of
those particular Articles which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation to be believed: but it is
the Evidence whereby those Articles are
revealed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and wherein they are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
The Creed was composed before the
Canon of Scripture was perfected. They
have not onely <hi>changed from their Ancestours
in Opinions:</hi> but they have changed their
own Opinions, into necessary Articles of
Faith, which is worse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:40675:239"/>I denied that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> was a
Generall Councell, as wanting the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Conditions of a Generall Councell,
which they themselves judge to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
The summons ought to have been
generall, but it was not. The great Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
ought to have been present, but they
were not; neither the Patriarchs of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,
Alexandria, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
nor any of them; nor yet the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
of <hi>Armenia, Abissina, Mosco, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall</hi>
&amp;c., nor any of them. He answereth,
<hi>they had no right to be summoned thither, unlesse
to be called to the Barre as Delinquents, nor to
sit there, nor are to be accounted Christians.</hi> It
had need to be a large Barre indeed to hold
them all. Was it ever heard before, that a
fifth part of a Councell did call foure parts
to the Barre? Their Ancestours had right
to be summoned to a Generall Councell,
and to sit and vote there as well as the best;
how have their posterity lost this right?
Had they been heard and condemned in a
Generall Councell? No. But he urgeth
<hi>what need hearing, when themselves in the Face
of the whole world publickly confessed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their imputed fault.</hi> How? what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
hearing? O Iust Iudge! He that
giveth a right Sentence, yet if he give it
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:40675:239"/>
without hearing, is an unrighteous Iudge.
<hi>They confessed their imputed Fault:</hi> but did
they confesse it to be a Fault? No I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
you, he can not say it for shame. Or
how should <hi>they confesse it in the Face of the
whole Christian world?</hi> They are the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world themselves, and your Roman
world is but a <hi>Microcosme</hi> in comparison
of them.</p>
               <p>The case is so evident and notorious, that
no man can doubt of it. The Continent
hath not left <hi>St. Peters</hi> Boat, but <hi>St. Peters</hi>
Boat hath left the Continent. The Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
or swerving from Apostolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
was not in the Christian world, but
in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
their Aristocraticall power to a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Monarchicall power: but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world would not give way to it; if
this were an errour in them, all their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
were guilty of it as well as they.
But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> being conscious to
themselves that they were the Innovators,
to free themselves from feare of being cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the Christian World, adventured
to give the first blow, by censuring the
whole Christian world it self. This was a
Bolder Act then that of Pope <hi>Victor</hi> which
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> misliked so much.</p>

of disputing by Questions; <hi>what certain
Rule have we to know, what Sects are of she
Church?</hi> Although I needed not, yet I have
answered this demand formerly. All
those are of the Church who weare the
Badge and Cognisance of Christians, that
is, the Apostles Creed as it is explicated by
the foure first Generall Councells, as all
those Churches doe: and have not been cast
out of the Church by the Sentence of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell, as none of these Churches
have; no nor yet by the Sentence of the
Roman Church it self, if we may trust the
Bishop <hi>of Chalcedons Survey</hi> cap. 8.
<hi>Neither doth the Roman Church excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all the Christians of</hi> Affrick
Asia Greece <hi>and Russia, but onely such
as doe vincibly or sinfully erre.</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that <hi>there are innumerable</hi> who
are not formall Hereticks, but onely <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticis
Credentes.</hi> These continue good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
still, and are Churches still, and ought
not to be excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Generall Councells,
though supposed to be materially in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
much lesse being innocent and in no
Heresy or Schisme either formall or Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:40675:240"/>I pleaded that <hi>though it were true, that all the
other Patriarchs were such Materiall Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
yet of all others they ought especially to
have been summoned.</hi> The reason is evident,
because they that are sick have more need
of the Physitian, then they that are in
health. Hence he inferreth, that it is more
necessary that Hereticks be called to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell, then Orthodox Fathers.
Not so, both are necessary, the one to
Cure, the other to be cured: but the
especiall Consideration or end of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
is for those that erre, that they may
be reduced.</p>
               <p>I said [the Pope hath not that Authority
over a Generall Councell, that the King
hath over a Parliament]. He answereth,
that <hi>he is so plaine a man, that he understandeth
not what the Authority of King or Parliament
signifies.</hi> I will help him. The King may
dissolve a Parliament when he pleaseth: so
may not the Pope a Generall Councell
against their wills. If the King dye by
whose writ it was called, the Parliament is
dissolved: so is not a Generall Councell by
death of the Pope. The King hath a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
voice in Parliament: so hath not the
Pope in a Generall Councell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="472" facs="tcp:40675:241"/>I urged, that the Proto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>patriarchs are not

first, <hi>this is onely said againe not proved.</hi>
He is alwaies stumbling upon the same
Block: It doth not belong to me to prove
they were not condemned; but to himself
who accuseth them, to shew when and
where they where condemned. Secondly
he answereth, that <hi>their Errours have
been condemned by Councells, and for the most
part some of their own party being present.</hi>
But the condemning of their errours, is
no sufficient warrant for the excluding
of their persons out of Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.
Neither were these Councells
Generall Councells, or such as had
any Iurisdiction over the Protopatriarchs.
Moreover, they condemne Papall Errours
as well as he condemneth their Errours,
whether is more Credit to begiven to the
Pope, in his own cause charging all the
Patriarchs in the world, or to all the other
Patriarchs in the world, unanimously
condemning his Vsurpations in the
name of the Catholick Church?</p>
               <p>He demands, <hi>whether there might not be a
Parliament of England, without having the fifth
part of the Members found in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and yet be a lawfull Parliament?</hi>
I think there might, if the absence of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:40675:241"/>
all the rest proceeded from their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect:
but not if it proceeded from want
of Summons, as the absence of the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriarchs
did.</p>
               <p>He bids me <hi>rub up my memory, he believes I
will find an English Law, that sixty Members is
a sufficient number to make a lawfull Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
I have done his Commands, and I
know no such law, nor he neither: and
then he must be a very confident man to
cite such a Law. Perhaps he hath heard of
some Ordinance of the House of Commons,
how many members at the least must be
present at doing of some inferiour Acts: but
neither is this Ordinance an English
Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or that House an English Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>I excepted against the superpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
multitude of Members out of one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
which never lawfull Parliament had.
Superproportioned</hi> indeed, where there were
double the Number of <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops to
all the other Bishops of the Christian world,
(this is no equall representative): and
these assembled thither not to dispute, as
he fancieth vainly, but meerly to overvote
the <hi>Tramontanes.</hi> A few Bishops had sufficed
to relate the Beliefe or Tradition of <hi>Italy,</hi> as
well as the rest of the world: but that had
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:40675:242"/>
not sufficed to doe the Popes worke, that
was, to overswey the rest of the Christian
world, with his <hi>Superproportioned multitude</hi>
of Italian Bishops. He saith, <hi>perhaps I will
pretend, that had the Catholick Bishops out of their
Provinces been there, they would have voted
against their Fellow Catholicks, in behalf of</hi>
Luther <hi>and</hi> Calvin, <hi>which were a wise answer.</hi>
I heed not much what he calleth wise or
foolish: I doe not onely pretend, but I
see clearly, that If the Bishops of other
Countries had been proportioned to those
of <hi>Italy,</hi> they had carried the Debate about
Residence and the Divine right of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy;
and that had done the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he quite omitteth the most materiall
part of my Discourse, concerning his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
between a Parliament and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell; That [the absence of whole
Provinces and the much greater part of
the Provinces, either of <hi>England</hi> or of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
for want of due Summons, doth
disable such a Parliament or such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
from being a Generall Representative
of the whole.] He might even as well say,
that an Assembly of the Peers and Burgesses
of <hi>Wales</hi> upon Summons, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
or summons of all the rest of the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:40675:242"/>
Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> was a lawfull Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of all England: as say the Councell
of <hi>Trent</hi> was a Generall Representative of
the Christian world, which was never sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned.</p>
               <p>I proved, that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>
was no Generall Councell, because it was
not Generally received, no not among the
Occidentall Churches: particularly, by
the Church of <hi>France</hi> in point of Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
He answereth that notwithstanding,
<hi>They acknowledge it to be a lawfull Generall
Councell, and receive it in all Determinations
belonging to Faith.</hi> Adding, that the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian
Lawes of a Generall Councell,
<hi>doe bind particular Countries onely in due Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and according to their Conveniences.</hi>
But the Contrary is most apparent, that
Councells truly Generall, being the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Tribunalls of the Catholick Church,
doe bind particular Churches as well
in point of Discipline as of Faith.
The Generall Councells of <hi>Constantinople</hi>

What Opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the King and Church

               </p>
               <p>That the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> was not a free

The French Ambassador (whom he thought
to passe by in silence) did not jeere: yet he
said the same thing in sad earnest. To my
third Argument he saith <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>t is nothing to the
purpose.</hi> How nothing to the purpose, for the
Pope when his affaires were going retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,
and his party like to be overvoted;
to create new Bishopricks, to ordaine new
Bishops, and pack them away presently to
the Councell to assist his party, and by that
means to gaine a plurality of Voices? Is this
nothing to the purpose in his Opinion? It
may be he thinkes, that <hi>Italy</hi> had not Bishops
enough there, (yet they had two thirds of
the Councell before): or that these new Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops,
did understand the Tradition and
Beliefe of <hi>Italy</hi> better then all the rest.</p>
               <p>If it be his mind to wave the Popes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
power, I am contented: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
his proofe will not weigh much, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we admit strangers (who know little
or nothing of our Privileges, more then we
know the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Privilege, before the
Councell of <hi>Ephesus)</hi> to be compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t judges,
and will interpret a Western Patriarch to
be the onely Patriarch of all the west. The
Archbishop of Yorke is Primate of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:40675:244"/>
and yet all England is not subject to his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
Forfeiture and Quitting are
two distinct Charges: an Office is Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by abuse, and quitted by assuming a
new Office inconsistent with the former;
as I have shewed the Papacy and a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate,
that is, a Soveraign and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
power to be. But a Patriarchate
and a Bishoprick, being both subordinate to
a Generall Councell, are not inconsistent:
and much lesse the Office of a King and
Master of a Family, the one being Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
the other Oeconomicall. But an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Monarchy by divine right, and
the Presidency of a Particular Province
by Humane right, are inconsistent; I gave
him my reasons for it, and he taketh no
notice of them.</p>
               <p>He excepteth against my styling Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archall
Authority, a <hi>Patriarchall Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall
dignity,</hi> which he calleth my <hi>thrice
repeated non sense.</hi> It is well he did not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
it a Contradiction. His reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                     </gap>e is a Government by one,
an Aristocracy by many.</hi> The answer is
Obvious and easy; a Patriarch is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
in the Government of his own Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate,
yet subordinate to a Generall
Councell: but in a Generall Councell or
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40675:244"/>
in the Governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of the Catholick Church,
he is but one of the <hi>Optimates,</hi> or a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
governour with other Bishops. He
saith, <hi>it was never pretended by Catholicks,
that the Pope was the King of the Church.</hi> I
wonder that he is no bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Sorbone</hi> disputes, whether the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>We have a Meritorious Sacrifice, that
is the Sacrifice of the Crosse; We have a
Commemorative and Applicative Sacrifice,
or a Commemoration and Application of
that Sacrifice in the Holy Eucharist. A
Suppletory Sacrifice, to supply any want
or defects in that Sacrifice, he dare not
owne, and unlesse he do owne it, he saith
no more then we say.</p>
               <p>What I spake of our Registers, I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
principally of that <hi>Register of the right
Ordination of Protestan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he had rather wrangle about it then take
such paines; if he will have a little Patience
I will ease him of that Labour and Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It is no insuperable difficulty nor
any difficulty at all to us, to find out that
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> which we have in our
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:40675:245"/>
Creed: but to find out his <hi>Roman Catholick
Church;</hi> is both a Contradiction <hi>in adjecto,</hi>
and an Apple of Contention, serving to
commit him and his Friends together
among themselves, which he knoweth and
therefore declineth it.</p>
               <p>I called not the Ancient Bishop of <hi>Italy</hi>
either <hi>Episcopelles,</hi> or the Popes hungry
Parasiticall Pensioners: but the Fla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>terers of
the Roman Court, and Principally those
petty Bishops, which were created during
the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> to serve the Popes
turne. If he think that Court free from
such Moths, he is much mistaken. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are these expressions mine originally,
I learned them from the ancient Bishops of
<hi>Italy</hi> themselves, who gave them those very
names of <hi>Episcopelles</hi> &amp;c. Neither did I
taxe any man in particular.</p>
               <p>He desires me <hi>to examine my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whether I doe not get my living
by preaching that Doctrine which I put
in my Bookes, which how many noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Falsities, Contradictions, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversations
they have in them, may be
judged by this present worke.</hi> Yes, if
he and his merry Stationer may be my Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Now his worke is ended and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:40675:245"/>
I will make him a faire offer; If he be
able to make but one of all his Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and Falsifications, and absurdities
good, I will be reputed guilty of all the rest:
if he be not, I desire him both to examine
his own Conscience and Discretion, what
reward he de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God and man, for so many notorious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.
As for his Faults, I shall rather
leave them to the Iudgement of the Reader,
then trouble myself with the Recapitulation
of them.</p>
               <p>In the close of my Discourse I answered
an exception of his, that <hi>I cited</hi> Gerson
<hi>against myself.</hi> The words of <hi>Gerson</hi> (or
rather of the Eastern Church when they
seperated from the Roman) are these, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam
tuam recognoscimus, Avar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>iam tuam
implere non possumus, Vivite per vos; We know
thy power, we cannot satisfy thy Covetousnesse,
Live by yourselves.</hi> They knew that he had
a Patriarchall power, and that he was the
first or chiefe of the Patriarchs: but this
power we deny not, that power which we
deny, is a Supremacy of single power, and
that by Christs own Ordination. The
Question is, whether the Grecians did
acknowledge such a power due to the
Pope in these words. That they did not, I
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:40675:246"/>
prove, first by the practice of most of all the
Eastern Churches, who excommunicate
the Pope yearly as a Schismatick for chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
this power. Secondly, I prove it
by the Testimony of all their writers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the modern Greeks, as <hi>Hieremy</hi> and
<hi>Cyrill,</hi> the two succeeding Patriarchs of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Nilus</hi> an Archbishop
&amp;c., who all deny this power to the Pope
in the name of the Greek Church. Thirdly,
I prove it by his own confession in this very
Chapter, <hi>There is no one point produced by him,
which our Church lookes upon as a point of Faith,
in which they dissent from us and consent with the
Protestants, except that one of denying the Popes
Supremacy.</hi> How? doe they grant the
Popes Supremacy and deny the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and yet continue the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Variation (as they have done)? I
doe not say this is a Contradiction, but let
the Reader Iudge.</p>
               <p>His reasons are mere Prevarications,
not reasons. First here is no <hi>Opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
power and covetousnesse,</hi> unlesse he mean
all Affirmatives and Negatives (whatsoever
be the Subjects or Predicates,) are Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites;
and if they were, it signifieth nothing.
Secondly, he demands <hi>what power had the
Pope over them except Spirituall Iurisdiction?</hi>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:40675:246"/>
I answer, he shewed them sufficiently at
the Division of the Greek Empire: and
then they stood in need of his assistence
against the Turke.</p>
               <p>His third fourth and fifth Arguments
may be reduced to one, and when they are
twisted they will not have the weight of
one single haire. <hi>The Difference was about
undue Subsid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>es and Taxes, but the Demanding
Subsidies seems incredible, had there not been
some preacknowledged power to ground such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
upon.</hi> Yes, there was his Protopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall
power, and that tentered and
stretched out to the uttermost extent: and
when he would have extended it yet higher,
the Grecians cast out his Vsurpations. I
see he doth but grope in the darke, I will
help him to some light. <hi>Peter Steward</hi>
upon <hi>Caleca</hi> tells him what these undue
Subsidies and Exactions were, <hi>when the
Popes Legates brought yearly the Chrisme from
the Apostolick See to</hi> Constantinople, <hi>they
would not depart from thence unlesse they had
eighty pound weight of Gold, besides other Gifts
bestowed upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly he addeth, Gerson <hi>concludes that
upon this Consideration, they might proceed to the
Reformation of the French Churches, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Contradiction which perhaps some of
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:40675:247"/>
the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>would make; which eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
that the acknowledgement of the Popes just
power was reteined, and encroachments on their
Liberties onely denyed.</hi> Concedo omnia.
His Protopatriarchall power was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
his Soveraignty of Iurisdiction
was denyed as an encroachment: and this
is the same Method which we observed in
England.</p>
               <p>And so <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> concludes his <hi>Rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
that <hi>the Bishop began like a Bowler and
ends like one of those Artificers, who going to
mend one hole, use to make other three.</hi> Iust
<hi>Mr. Serjeant,</hi> just, <hi>As your mind thinketh,
so the Bell clinketh.</hi> If there be any of those
Artificers here, it is yourself, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Custome is to make holes where there
are none, and out of an eager desire of
Contradicting others, to plunge yourself ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably
into reall Contradiction.
With Scurrility you began this <hi>Rejoinder</hi>
and with Scurrility you end it.</p>
               <p>That which followeth is a Dish of thrice
sodden Coleworts, or a vain recapitulation
of his own Imaginary Achievements, which
the Reader hath been troubled withall too
often already.</p>
               <p>I have done with <hi>Mr. Serjeants Rejoinder,</hi>
and have but one short request to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:40675:247"/>
That if he meet with any thing in
this Treatise, which is not becomming that
Gravity or Civility which one Scholer
oweth to another, especially in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
Inquisitions, <hi>Sciat responsum non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
esse.</hi> He will be pleased to consider,
that it is hardly possible to answer so much
Petulance, without some Tartnesse. For
the future, if <hi>Mr. Serjeant</hi> have any thing
to say upon this subject, let him say it Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically
and he will not have cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
that he is neglected: but if he pursue
this way of <hi>quibling</hi> and <hi>wording,</hi> (which he
complaineth of in others without a cause,
and practiseth himself) I shall make bold
to cull out and answer whatsoever I Iudge
materiall, and leave the rest to a younger
pen, which will attend his Motions.</p>
