            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Christ, at this day, and for euer.</p>
            <p>Hauing begd these graces, I returne vnto thee humble thanks for all thy benefits that I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; not onely before, but since my being, as for my electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before time, and for my voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in time, from whence haue followed my iustification, and some measure of sanctification in this life, and my assured hope of glorification in the life to come.</p>
            <p>For these inestimable blessings, which no minde can conceiue, nor tongue expresse, I returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, all such possible praise and hearty thankes as my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding can conceiue: beseeching thee that I may this day, &amp; all the dayes of my life, walke worthy of all these thy mercies. O Lord I thanke thee for these other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour testimonies of thy loue, which thou hast made more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the vniust, then with the iust; I thanke thee ô Father that thou hast shared mee out so

great a portion, euen beyond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy Saints &amp; seruants; Lord grant that while thou continuest the trust of them in my hands (for they are thy talents and not mine) I may soberly vse them to thy glory, and to mine owne comfort, and the comfort of the Saints.</p>
            <p>O Lord grant I may abound in charitie to all of all sorts, that I shall behold to stand in neede of my helpe: but especially to the houshold of Faith: and grant that I may giue no reliefe in worldly ostentation, or vaine glory, to bee seene or talked of, of men, but in an vpright heart &amp; good conscience vnto thee. And all this I beseech thee to grant, for Iesus Christ his sake my onely Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
            <p>Last of all, I beseech thee as a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling member of thy holy Church militant, howsoeuer, or whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer dispersed, scattered, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; for all thine that suffer any

            <p>ETernall God and louing Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, before thy Baptisme, thou didst send <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> to preach remission of sins, through repentance and faith in thy name: And after thou wert Baptized, and entered into thy Ministrie, thou that didst exhort all that were weary, and laden with their sinnes, to come vnto thee, saying, that thou cammest to call sinners to repentance, and that the whole had no need of the Phisitian, but the sicke. Wherefore, o Lord, being deadly sicke, with the sence of my sinnes, and with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane wounded vnto death: I entreate thee in the teares of a sorrowfull heart, to wash me, not onely my hands, feete, and head, but also my heart from sinne. O Lord powre into my wounds the oyle of mercy, that it may pacifie
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21554:64"/>
and quiet my minde in thee. O Lord wash me with the bloud of thy Sonne, as with Hysop, for I haue with the Prodigall sonne, and Lost sheepe erred in the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my minde. But, ô Lord, as <hi>Philip</hi> found <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> when hee looked not for him; So by true repentance, and hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, let me be found of thee, and in thee, now seeking after thee. O Lord I thirst after thee, and for thee, wherefore send thy holy Spirit into mee, to mollifie and comfort my hard and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant heart.</p>
            <p>O Lord, it cannot by nature, enter into my minde, that I am so wretched a sinner, but by thy word as vnto <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> thou hast made me to see, that except by true repentance I be regenerat, and so, as it were, borne againe, I cannot enter into the Kingdome of heauen; that is, possibly be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But, ô Lord, thou hast made me to know sinne, and how sinne
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21554:64"/>
became sinne, by the reuerent vse of thy word, for though there be sinne in vs, before the knowledge of thy Law, yet sinne without thy Law was not imputed: but thou hast giuen vs Christians, this thy law as a touchstone, to know sin, and that sinne is the transgression of the Law, for if there were no Law, there would be no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, wherefore thy Law which was ordained vnto me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, by the search thereof, hath slaine mee vnto death, and made me immeasurably sinfull, for by the Law, thou hast made mee to know sinne, which by no other meanes I could know, or should euer haue found out, for how should I haue knowne lust to be sinne, if thou hadst not said I should not lust. Wherefore, O Lord, seeing it is so with me, that I doe the euill which I would not, and leaue vndone the good that I would, binde this strong man in mee, that though Sinne
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21554:65"/>
dwell in mee, yet hee may not raigne ouer or rule in mee, yea mortifie the wicked deeds of my flesh, by thy holy word, and mighty operation of thy spirit. O grant that by the dying of the Lord Iesus, sinne in all his kindes and force, may be subdued, and dye in me: lest that thereby I be made to come short of thy glory, which thou hast promised to all repentant sinners.</p>
            <p>Good God grant, that I may not yeeld my members, seruants vnto sinnes, but reserue them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnto thee, in true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and holinesse, all the dayes I haue to liue in this life. O Lord, as <hi>Ammon</hi> hated his sister <hi>Tamar,</hi> after hee had abused her with himselfe, and himselfe with her, so that hee could not abide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21554:65"/>
they did each other, and thou them both. O Lord let the old man that is in me, be so crucified with Christ in the power of his death, that I may henceforth be no more seruant vnto sinne, for that thou hast said, that a carnall man liuing in sinne, cannot please thee. O Lord giue me thy spirit that I may hate the things of the flesh, which are nothing but san against thee, and loue the things of thy spirit, as ioy in the holy Ghost, peace of conscience, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, patience in bearing, and forbearing wrongs, with faith and the like graces and fruits of thy most holy spirit. O Lord, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I haue, to the subduing of sin, desired the gift of thy holy spirit, let mee be carefull, by the vse of all holy meanes, to walke in the spirit. And seeing thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned sinne, in him that knew no sinne, for my sake, O Lord condemne it not in me againe; and as the first birth is nothing but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21554:66"/>
sinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> Lord graunt that by this my second birth, I may be a continuall liuing spirituall man in Christ: thus hauing confessed my sinnes with hearty sorrow, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, for my Sauiour his sake, to forgiue me my sinne, and to strengthen mee all the dayes of my life to come, that with the man in the Gospell I may follow thy heauenly counsell and sinne no more, neither in action, affection, nor intention, lest this my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and contrition should be in vaine, which, O Lord forbid, for thy Christ his sake.</p>

this wonderfull variety of things which wee perceiue euery day most admirably to be made, not onely in the sensible, but also in all insensible liuing things: of all which workes, thou hast caused man, chiefely to excell, hauing in him most curiously epitomised all the glory of this earthly fabrick, and for all this thy great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, thou hast done vnto him, hast onely required of him, that he in the contemplation of these created things, not only without, but within himselfe, might finde out thee, a louing Father and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour; and doe vnto thee that high homage, that thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on this day, not as slaues, and seruants, but as sonnes filled with all duty &amp; obedience, which that wee might doe, thou hast charged vs, on the seuenth day to remember our Creatour, not onely by refraining our seruile la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which in the sixe dayes thou hast appointed vs, but by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21554:68"/>
leauing the wicked workes of darknesse, vnto which we are by nature, and wicked desires, so much addicted. O Lord graunt that I may sequester my selfe, this day vnto thy praise, not onely in thy holy Congregation, but in the secret cogitations of my heart. And graunt that euery word, or thing that I shall this day, heare with my eares, or see with my eyes, may be so digested in my soule, as fit subiects, out of which I may bee occasioned to magnifie thy praise and glory.</p>
            <p>O heauenly Father, graunt that all those Sabbath dayes which haue passed in my youth and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, while I knew thee not, may be now recalled, by double diligence, in the deuout hearing of thy Word, receiuing of the Sacraments, and calling vpon thy name, which on this day thou hast for euer commanded to bee done vnto thee in thy Church and holy Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:21554:68"/>
And, O Lord, let my heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, edified in thy most holy feare, not for the present while I am hearing, but for euer while I shall liue, and let some part of thy holy Word, which I shall heare expounded this day, abide in me, that at all times, when I shall haue occasion, or be called thereunto, I may bee fitted and furnished, to giue a full account, and reason, of the hope I haue in thee. O Lord, thy Apostles haue called this day, not now the seuenth day from the Creation, but the first day, and the Lords day, putting vs in mind of that high and admirable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our Redemption, as on this day accomplished by his glorious resurrection, for the which wee can neuer re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der too much thanks, neither publick nor priuate.</p>

            <p>And seeing thou hast said, not the hearers of the law, but the doers of the law are iustified: O Lord make me a doer of the law. And as thou hast againe said, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are yee, if ye doe these things. Wherefore Lord that I may bee

capable of thy blessing, graunt that this day, when I haue heard, I may doe the things, and (as thy blessed Mother) pondered all thy sayings, and layd them vp in her heart, to remember them. O sweet Sauiour, helpe me this day and other dayes and times, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I shall heare thy word, or reade the same, that my memory may be so quicke and fresh, that I may retaine and remember all, that shal most especially concerne me: and not to be filled with idle knowledge, but with constant doing, that I may be accepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those builders, that set their house vpon the rocke, most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lord let me not be so simple, as to thinke my selfe blessed, by bare looking into thy law, by an outward conformity, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to thy Church to heare, lest in so doing, I become as a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearer, that offers to thee a sacrifice of fooles, and so in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying this thy Sabaoth so idely,

thou cast mee out among the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, the chiefe profaners of the Sabbath in the burning lake, and vnquenchable fire.</p>
            <p>O Lord, let no wicked temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of sathan, or of my flesh, enter into my minde in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thy Word, to make it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauourie, or bitter vnto my soule, but let it be this day and euer, more sweet vnto my soule, then honey vnto my lips.</p>
            <p>O Lord, let it be in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, my meate and drinke to doe thy will; and graunt that I may this day, learne so much thereof, that I may become wiser then my Teachers, or those that regard not to keepe thy law, graunt all these my requests, most louing Lord, both to mee and all thine, this day and for euermore.</p>

            <head>A Prayer for the worthy receiuing of the Lords Supper.</head>
            <p>OMost louing Sauiour, how great and wonderfull is thy loue to thy Church, that before thou didst leaue this world in thy humanity, didst not onely send vp loud cries and teares vnto thy Father (for them which did, and which after thy departure, should beleeue in thee) but didst also or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a perpetuall commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy death and passion,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21554:106"/>
through the institution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall signes of Bread and Wine, at the last Supper of the Passeouer, in the same night thou wast betrayed, charging, in thy Apostles, thy whole Church vnto the worlds end, to doe it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee, assuring vs that as often as wee did eate that bread, and drinke that wine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy appointment, that thereby wee should shew thy death vntill thou didst come, and so keepe a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thee, not onely in our hearts, but in our eyes, as if wee sawe thee crucified vpon the Crosse.</p>
            <p>O Lord, examining my selfe, of my faith, my repentance, and loue, I finde that my faith is weake, my repentance slacke and dull, and my loue colde, or but luke-warme; so that of my selfe (O most mercifull Lord) I durst not presume to come vnto thy table: but O Lord, for this I iudge
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21554:106"/>
my selfe, that I may not be iudged of thee, the worst and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest of all those that come vnto thy table: For vnto this present, through the multitude of my sinnes, with which I am laden, I haue (like <hi>Iudas)</hi> done nothing but betrayed thee, and pricke thy head, and pierced thy side more cruelly, then the thorns or speare wherewith thou wast crowned and pearced, and so in as much as in mee lieth, I am guilty of the blood shedding, and death of my Lord.</p>
            <p>But (most heauenly Father) as the Israelites stung with the fiery Serpents, looked vnto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>Moses</hi> set vp: so, O Lord, smarting in soule with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of my sinnes, by which I am continually guiltie of thy death, and so againe (like <hi>Iudas)</hi> worthy of eternall death, much more violently to be inflicted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of the sop. Yet doe I looke vnto thy Crosse, on which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21554:107"/>
thou sufferest for me, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching thee, for that obedience by which thou hast satisfied Gods wrath and iustice, to doe away my sinnes (as <hi>Dauids</hi> after his adultery and murther) that I may become a worthy partaker of the body &amp; blood of my Lord, and the Sacramentall Bread and Wine, after which I haue so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly thirsted, may not (like the Israelites Quailes, sticking in their teeth) become neither my bodily nor spirituall death, nor (like the vnworthy Corinthians) for my carelesse and negligent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing by the suddaine hand of sicknesse, be struck vnto death, but as the faithfull Iewes in their constant and conscionable celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their feast of Passeouer by them kept, a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Egyptian deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrnce from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> bondage, were exceedingly edified, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the promises of thy loue, that thou wouldest be their

God, and they should be thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which they sawe fulfilled in their Fathers, and still continued vnto themselues, through the hope of the Messiah, by whom they expected their greatest safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deliuerance. Graunt vnto mee, O heauenly Father, that as the Minister of thy Word and Sacraments, setteth a part the Bread and Wine, so I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the eternall loue, by which in the beginning thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest set a part thy Sonne, through faith in him to be my saluation, promising that whosoeuer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him, should not perish, but haue euerlasting life. And as I see the Wine powred out, and the Bread broken: so I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy patient enduring the breaking of thy body, and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thy blood, whereby thou hast payed the price, and satisfied the punishment that was due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and as the Bread &amp; Wine doe presently comfort and refresh
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21554:108"/>
my body: so most sweet Sauiour, let me feele my soule so comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and edified this day, and so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I shall thinke of thee, and thy mercies hereby promised and assured; yea, graunt that being made one with thee by spirituall vnion, I may liue in thee, and thou in me, in the encrease of a godly life, to the honour of thee my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.

            <head>A Prayer for the calling of the Iewes, and the continuall encrease of Christs Kingdome among all Nations.</head>
            <p>ALmighty &amp; euerliuing God, who after the floud, didst preserue <hi>Noah,</hi> and our Fathers, <hi>Sem, Iapheth, Terah, Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> from the perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waters, and from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued deluge of sinne, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the families of <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Canan,</hi> his wicked posterity: and of thy abundant mercies, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the blind ignorance, in which they had plunged themselues through Idolatrous superstition, and didst seperate our Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and made of him a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, a royall Nation, and chosen generation, that for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more should serue thee. And that they might neuer forget thy great goodnesse, it pleased thee to bring them into Egypt, that after
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21554:126"/>
the fauour of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they should suffer hard and cruell bondage the space of foure hundred yeeres, and then in the power of God, with a mighty hand and out-stretched arme, in the sight of King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> thou wouldest bring them to their Fathers promised inheritance, through the red Sea, and waste Wildernesse, to the mount Syon, the hill of God, where thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest appeare vnto them in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, to renue and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the couenant made vnto their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> that thou wouldest be their God, and the God of their seede for euermore. Wherefore thou diddest out of the midst of the flames of fire so speake vnto them, that they might liue, and know that thou louedst them, as thou hadst done their Fathers, that first came into Egypt, that thou wert the same Lord, and that there was no other God besides thee, in heauen or in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21554:127"/>
earth. Yet for all this great loue, of which the like was neuer heard, thou didst onely require them to keepe thy statutes, thy lawes, and thy commandements, promising it should goe well with them for euermore: but they star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aside like a broken bowe, and cast thy promises, and law behind their backes, and forsooke thee the guide of their youth, and in their olde age, euen when they were growne fat, and full fed, with the abundance of thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, they still spurned &amp; kicked against thee, and though thou didst early and late (in the time of the Iudges and Kings which they so much desired) send them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: yet they cast thee off, and forgot the Lord that made them, and serued other gods of the Heathen, whom their Fathers neuer knew. Yet at last when they had killed thy Prophets and stoned thy seruants, thou in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite loue, sent thy Sonne, saying,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:21554:127"/>
that they would honour him. But O Lord, how much more cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did they behaue themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, calling thee a sinner, and friend of Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Prince of the deuils, and would haue throwne thee the Lord of life (as Sathan did the Heard of Swine) from the Rock into the Sea. And at last, when nothing tooke effect, according to their malicious minds, they came out against thee, as against a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour with clubbs, and staues, and tooke thee, and carried their expected Messiah, before <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and brought false witnesse against thee, and preferred a murtherer before thee, and though indeede thou wert their King, yet in mockage they put vpon thee a purple roabe, and in thy hand a Scepter of reede, &amp; on thy head a crowne of thornes, then buffetted they thee, and spet vpon thy face, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning both thy princely, priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21554:128"/>
and propheticall offices, in which thou wast their perfect Sauiour. Then disroabed they thee, and carried thee without the gates of the Citie, and after an ignominious manner, with two theeues, vnto <hi>Golgotha</hi> the place of common execution, and nayled thee to a woodden Crosse in the middest of them. And after they had wounded thee in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet againe in their malicious and cowardly fury, they pierced thy side with a speare, euen when thou sighedst, groanedst, prayedst vnto thy Father to forgiue them their sinnes, and to accept thy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Yea, all this while they mocked thee, and bid thee come downe from the Crosse, to saue thy life as thou sauest others: and wrote a title ouer thy head vnto all Nations in contempt of thee; and when in the pangues of thy passion thou didst thirst for their pardon, then they ranne and flap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in thy mouth (not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21554:128"/>
thee, but to prolong thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes) an hysope spunge dipt in vinegar: and after thy death (to make them sport) they cast lots for thy garments. O sweet Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, being thus abused by thy once peculiar people, thou hast most righteously, according to their wish, brought vpon them and their children, the reward of thy innocent blood, and done iustly in forsaking the house of thine honour, and put it into the possession of the Gentiles, to bee battered downe, that there might not bee left one stone vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to scatter them into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall captiuity, as at this day we doe behold.</p>

And had they knowne that they had crucified
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21554:129"/>
thy Sonne, the Lord of glory, no doubt they would not haue done it, for in ignorance (as did their Fathers, they haue done it) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O God, for the respect thou bearest to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and for thy seruant <hi>Dauids</hi> sake, as thou hast promised (that a remnant should be saued) euen as many as thou wilt call, and the first fruits being holy, the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches descending thereof should be holy, haue respect vnto them, that with the fulnesse of vs Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, they may come againe into the folde of Christ. O Lord our Sauiour, open their eyes, that they may beleeue the Scriptures, and so come againe, and be grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne Oliue stocke, for thou, O God, art able to graffe them in againe, for thy gifts and calling are without repentance. Wherefore take from them their vnbeliefe, that wee both Iewes &amp; Gentiles may be saued through thy mercy. O sweet Sauiour,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21554:129"/>
haue mercy on them, &amp; call them home againe, that wee and they may make one sheepe-fold, and like good sheep, know thy voice, and follow thee our louing Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, in the sincere obedience of thy Gospell. Heauenly Father, blesse thy Church vniuersall, that it may stand fast in the obedience and faith of Christ: giue thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell a free passage in it, &amp; among all people, that yet know not thee.</p>
            <p>O thou which art the Lord of the haruest, send forth diligent and painefull labourers into thy haruest. Blesse all the reformed Churches in these westerne parts, but especially this church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that it bee an ensample of sound doctrine, and godly life, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all other Churches. And graunt that the Kings, Nobles, and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, may remaine, and succeede nursing Fathers in it for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. O Lord, let not the wilde Boares of the Forrest, the Turke, nor Antichrist, supplant the faith
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21554:130"/>
established among vs, nor roote vp the vine, that thine own right hand hath planted, but continue the light among vs which now liue, or hereafter shall liue, euen as long as the Sun or the Moone shall endure.</p>
            <p>O God, as thou hast promised for thy Elect sake, finish these dayes of sinne, and hasten thy comming vnto glory. And as by all thy workes in generall, so by vs men in speciall, yea by me with the residue of thy holy Church be especially giuen, both now, and for euermore, all honour and glory world without end.</p>

            <p>O Lambe of GOD which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest away the sinnes of the world, haue mercy vpon mee, a most vile and wretched sinner, wounded euen vnto death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; if thou Lord in whom all fulnesse of mercy and compassion doth dwell, doe not relieue and comfort mee. O Lord how am I assaulted by the crafty and subtill temptations of Sathan, that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning serpent, that seeth all my weaknesses, both of soule and body, and neuer ceaseth night nor day, sleeping, waking, eating, drinking, hearing, and reading, mourning and laughing, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes followeth &amp; doggeth me, with fearefull temptations, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mee that I am but an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and that all my repentance hath beene but in words, and not in heart, in outward shew, but not
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21554:138"/>
in trueth: and that my sinnes are greater then God can or will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, that I am none of his Elect, that I haue no true faith, saying, That those that truely beleeue, neuer doubt, that I doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Gods word aright, and that it doth nothing appertaine vnto mee, no more than vnto <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> (who for all hee was an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) yet was reprobated and cast away; and how knowest thou, but that thy faith is presumption, seeing neuer any man but St. <hi>Paul,</hi> had such assurance of faith. Yea, thou doest not delight in Gods word, nor so loue his Ministers as thou shouldest, thou doest not abound in good workes, all thy righteousnes is pharisaicall, thou art a louer of the world more then of God: doest thou not see how thou art continually punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, plagued, and smitten of God, neuer without one crosse or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on thy selfe, thy wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and seruants: on thy cattell,

goods, and aduentures, at home and abroad, and in other busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Yea, in euery thing thou puttest thine hand vnto, thou seest how God is against thee, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide thee: yea, euen in thy Prayers thou mayest feele how the spirit of God hath left thee: therefore deceiue not thy selfe, thou art none of his; if it were otherwise, thou shouldest not be so afflicted in euery thing as thou art. Deceiue not thy selfe, God doth not loue thee, if he did, hee would neuer haue suffered thee to commit so many sinnes, as thou hast done, by lying, by swearing, by drunkennesse, by whoring, by fornication, by adulterie, by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the like, and to haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued so long in them as thou hast done: Yea, what a prophaner of the Sabbath day hast thou beene? what filthy &amp; vncleane thoughts, what scurrilous Songs, and vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie speeches haue issued out of thy heart and mouth, and how
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:21554:139"/>

And how many of Gods good creatures hast thou prophaned in thy belly, on thy backe, on thy neck, to pranke thy Iezabels face, thinking nothing good enough, and fine enough to pamper thy earthly carcasse: And doest thou thinke that God will now in thine olde age, accept thy blinde seruice. Thy repentance comes too late, God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thy sacrifice, but as thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardest not him, when hee called in thy youth; so now he will not regard thee in thine olde age, though thou make many cries vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; yea, there is no sacrifice can cleanse thee from thy sinnes, thou hast cast Gods law behinde thy backe, and committed the sinne against the holy Ghost, so that it is in vaine for thee to hope for mercy, thou canst not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, though with <hi>Esau</hi> thou sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O heauenly Father, look down vpon this my wounded spirit: and (O Lord) driue away Sathan, that he preuaile not in these temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against my soule.

Lord for thy Christ his sake, in whom I onely trust to obtaine thy mercy, doe away my sinnes, and speake peace vnto my soule, against this lying serpent, that thou art and wilt be my saluation: O Lord.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21554:140"/>
create in me a cleane heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in me a right spirit, that I may learne to feare thee according to thy word: deale bountifully with me thy seruant, that I may escape these temptations, and in spight of Sathan, liue to keepe thy word: let not such contempt &amp; reproach come vpon me, but saue mee out of the iawes of hell, and from the power of Sathan, for thy names sake, and for thy mercy sake, and for thy Sonne his sake, O Lord I beseech thee. And though my soule through these temptations, cleaue vnto the dust, yet quicken thou mee according to thy word, and though the sorrowes of death hereby compasse mee in on euery side, and the terrours of hell haue now caught hold on mee, yet O Lord I beseech thee to deliuer my soule. And though Sathan hath compassed me with the multitude of his temptations, yet in thy Name, O Lord, I am confident, that I shall ouercome them. And
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21554:141"/>
though thou hast suffered Sathan for a time to buffet me; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee as thy Sonne Iesus my Sauiour hath taught mee, in this last petition of his holy Prayer; let me be neither further led, nor come into temptation, but as in the wildernesse, after Sathans three-fold temptation of thee, thou by faith in the Word of thy Father, didst resist him, that in the end hee left thee, so that thy Angels ministred comfort to thee: so most sweet Sauiour help me, so by the same skill of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word, that I may resist Sathan, and after the battell be comforted and confirmed in obedience, by the most sweet comfort of thy holy spirit.</p>
            <p>O Lord my Sauiour, how did he tempt thee, to make away thy selfe, but could not preuaile? So (O Lord) strengthen mee by the same power of thy Godhead, and a true liuely faith, by which I am ingrafted into thee, that I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21554:141"/>
by Sathans power, be forced against, nor with my will, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the wickednesses wherewith hee tempteth mee. O Lord, hee could not enter into the Heard of Swine, vntill thou gauest him leaue: wherefore by thy vnlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power, curbe and restraine him, that hee enter not into mee, much lesse worke his will of mee, as he did of them. He faine would haue killed thy seruant <hi>Iob,</hi> as hee had done his children, seruants, and cattell, but thou wouldst not giue him leaue: So (O Lord) he hath striuen to doe with me, but thou hast kept mee, and resisted, and rebuked him in my behalfe: he striueth like a roaring Lyon, to make mee his prey, and beateth hard to enter into my heart, which thou hast swept and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, to be a receptacle for thy selfe; wherefore (O Lord) let that stronger man, euen thy holy Spirit, keepe sure my soule vnto thee, that I be not ouercome with
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21554:142"/>
his furious assaults, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to let goe my hope in thy mercies: thou delightest not in the death of a sinner, but rather to shew mercy, that hee may be saued: Lord for thy mercy sake, saue mee, and helpe mee, for thy Sonnes sake keepe mee, from the rage and fury of this my great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressour. O God, he would fame play the lying spirit vnto my soule, that he might plunge me in thy great displeasure: but (O Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus I beseech thee) saue mee, and driue Sathan away from me, that hee neuer come at mee more.

            <p>O Almighty God, the Author and giuer of all things, of grace especially, vnto thee, a most vile &amp; wretched sinner, and chiefe of sinners, doe I prostrate my selfe, and confesse, that my heart is so hardned in euill custome of sinne, that when it commeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, by the motion of thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to desire to doe good, I finde no meanes in my selfe, to doe any thing that is good, neither for the vertue it selfe, nor as it is thy commandement; so that thou mightest most worthily cast mee off, as thou didst that vnmercifull seruant, into bonds of death, and imprisonment of hell for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.

O let mee loue thee and my neighbour out of a sincere faith, and loue vnfained, and at all times as thou hast forgiuen mee, my debts, offences, and trespasses: So (O Lord) make me ioyfull and willing to forgiue, as I desire of thee to be forgiuen.
