            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all the dismal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that fatal day wherein the <hi>Honour</hi> of our Nation suffered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our <hi>Martyr'd Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> there is none which in this Place we ought to be more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, than the <hi>Dishonour</hi> which was done to <hi>Religion</hi> by it. For if those things which were then acted among us, had been done among the most rude and barbarous Nations, though that had been enough to have made them for ever thought so; yet they might have been imputed to their ignorance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Civility and <hi>Religion:</hi> but when they were committed not only by men who were called <hi>Christians,</hi> but under a pretence of a mighty zeal for their <hi>Religion</hi> too, men will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101596:3"/>
either think that <hi>Religion</hi> bad which did give encouragement to such actions, or those persons extremely wicked, who could make use of a pretence of it for things so contrary to its nature and design. And on which of these two the blame will fall, may be soon disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, when we consider that the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> above all others, hath taken care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Rights of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> by <hi>giving unto Caesar the things that are Caesars,</hi> and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.</note> unlawful by declaring <hi>that those who are <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 2.</note> guilty of it shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi> But as though bare resistance had been too mean and low a thing for them (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> had said) to shew themselves to be <hi>Christians</hi> of a higher rank than others; they imbrue their hands in the blood of their <hi>Soveraign</hi> for a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Piety,</hi> by the same figure by which they had destroyed mens <hi>Rights</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their <hi>Liberties,</hi> and fought against the <hi>King</hi> for preservation of his <hi>Person.</hi> But the actions of such men could not have been so bad as they were; unless their pretences had been so great, for there can be no higher ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of a wicked action, than for men to seem to be Religious in the doing of it. If the <hi>Devil</hi> himself were to preach sedition to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101596:3"/>
the world, he would never appear otherwise than as an <hi>Angel of Light:</hi> his pretence would be Unity, when he designed the greatest Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and the preservation of Authority, when he laid the seeds of Rebellion. But we might as well imagine that <hi>the God of this world</hi> (as the <hi>Devil</hi> is sometime called) should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance nothing but Peace and Holiness in it, as that <hi>Christianity</hi> should give the least counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to what is contrary to either of them. Yet the wickedness of men hath been so great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, as to call down Heaven it self to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their impieties; and when they have found themselves unable to bear the burden of them, they would fain make <hi>Religion</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>Such as these we have a description of in this short, but smart Epistle, <hi>viz.</hi> men who pretended inspirations and impulses for the greatest villanies; who believed it a part of their Saintship to <hi>despise Dominions, and speak evil of Dignities;</hi> who thought the <hi>Grace of God</hi> signified very little, unless it served to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their most wicked actions. These in all probability were the followers of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> the <hi>Leviathan</hi> of the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi>

Where we shall find that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the design was the sharing of the Government among themselves, which it was impossible for them to hope for, as long as <hi>Moses</hi> continued as <hi>a King in Jesurun,</hi> for so he is called, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 5. Him therefore they intend to lay aside, but this they knew to be a very difficult task, considering what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>God</hi> had wrought by him in their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what wisdom he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto shewed in the conduct of them, what care for their preservation, what integrity in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101596:6"/>
the management of his power, what reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the people did bear towards him, and what solemn vows and promises they had made of obedience to him. But ambitious and factious men are never discouraged by such an appearance of difficulties; for they know they must address themselves to the people, and in the first place perswade them that they manage their interest against the usurpation of their Governours. For by that means they gain upon the peoples affections, who are ready to cry them up presently as the true <hi>Patriots</hi> and defenders of their <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> against the encroachment of <hi>Princes:</hi> and when they have thus insinuated themselves into the good opinion of the people; ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less suspicions, and unreasonable fears and jealousies will pass for arguments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations. Then they who can invent the most popular lyes against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are accounted the men of integrity, and they who most diligently spread the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous reports, are the men of honesty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are farthest from being <hi>Flatterers</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi> The people take a strange pride, as well as pleasure, in hearing and telling all the faults of their <hi>Governours</hi> for in doing so they flatter themselves in thinking they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101596:6"/>
to rule much better than those which do it. And the willingness they have to think so of themselves, makes them miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue all the actions of their <hi>Superiours</hi> to the worse sense, and then they find out plots in every thing, upon the people. What ever is done for the necessary maintenance of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is suspected to be a design meerly to exhaust the people to make them more unable to resist. If good Laws be made, these are said by factious men to be only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for snares for the good people, but others may break them and go unpunished. If Government be strict and severe, then it is cruel and tyrannical, if mild and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, then it is remiss and negligent. If <hi>Laws</hi> be executed, then the peoples Liberties be oppressed; if not, then it were better not to make <hi>Laws,</hi> than not to see them executed. If there be Wars, the people are undone by Taxes; if there be Peace, they are undone by Plenty. If extraordinary Judgements befall them, then they lament the sins of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and of the Times, and scarce think of their own. If miscarriages happen (as it is impossible alwaies to prevent them) they charge the form of Government with them, which all sorts are subject to. Nay, it is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101596:7"/>
that Governours escape with their own faults, the peoples are often laid upon them too. So here, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>Moses</hi> is charged with not carrying them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when it was their own sins which kept them thence. Yea, so partial have the people generally been against their <hi>Rulers,</hi> when swayed by the power of Faction, that this hath made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment very difficult and unpleasing; for what ever the actions of <hi>Princes</hi> are, they are liable to the censures of the people. Their bad actions being more publick, and their good therefore suspected of design; and the wiser Governours are, the more jealous the people are of them. For alwaies the weakest part of mankind are the most suspicious; the less they understand things, the more designs they imagine are laid for them, and the best counsels are the soonest rejected by them. So that the wisest <hi>Government</hi> can never be secure from the jealousies of the people, and they that will raise a faction against it will never want a party to side with them. For when could we ever have imagined a Government more likely to be free from this, than that which <hi>Moses</hi> had over the people of <hi>Israel?</hi> He being an extraordinary person for all the abilities of <hi>Government;</hi> one bred up in the

Spiritual; we only seek to retrench the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances of power, and some late innovations which have been among us; if you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lay aside your power which is so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and offensive to <hi>Gods holy people,</hi> we shall then sit down in quietness; for alas it is not for our selves that we seek these things (what are we?) but the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Gods people</hi> is dearer to us than our lives, and we shall willingly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice them in so good a <hi>Cause.</hi> And when <hi>Moses</hi> afterwards sends for the Sons of <hi>Eliab</hi> to come to him, they peremptorily refuse all <hi>Messages</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and with their <hi>men of the sword</hi> mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 2. They make votes of <note place="margin">V. 12, 13.</note>

So that now by the ill management of his <hi>Trust,</hi> the power was again devolved into the

hands of the people, and they ought to take account of his actions. By which we see the design was under very fair and popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to devest <hi>Moses</hi> of his <hi>Government,</hi> and then they doubted not but such zealous <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots</hi> as they had shewed themselves, should come to have the greatest share in it; but this which they most aimed at, must appear least in view, and only <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> must seem to cast that upon them, which was the first true motive they had to rebel against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>

               </gap>, he would seem to regard nothing but the publick good. If fair pretences, and glorious titles will serve to cheat the people into their own miseries, and the sad effects of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; they shall never want those who will <hi>enslave</hi> them for the sake of <hi>Liberty, undo</hi> them for the publick <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi> them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of <hi>Reformation.</hi> For nothing is more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular than <hi>Rebellion</hi> in the beginning; nothing less in the issue of it. And the only true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that it is ever so, is from the want of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101596:9"/>
and judgement in the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who seldom see to the end of things, and hardly distinguish between the names and nature of them, till their own dear bought experience hath taught them the difference. Sedition is of the nature, and hath the inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable properties of <hi>Sin;</hi> for it is conceived with pleasure, brought forth with pain, and ends in death and misery. Nothing enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stage with a braver shew and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but however prosperous for a time it may continue, it commonly meets with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal end. But it is with this sin as to this world, as it is with others as to the next; men when they are betrayed into them, are carried away and transported with the pleasing temptations, not considering the unspeakable misery that follows after them. So that what the <hi>Devils</hi> advantage is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ruine of mens souls, is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of seditious persons over the less understanding people; they both tempt with an appearance of good, and equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them which hearken to them. But as we still find, that notwithstanding all the grave admonitions, the sober counsels, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional discourses, the perswasive arguments which are used to deter men from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101596:10"/>
of sin, they will still be such <hi>Fools</hi> to yield to the <hi>Devils</hi> temptations against their own <hi>welfare:</hi> So, neither the blessings of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Peace,</hi> nor the miseries of an intestine <hi>War,</hi> neither the security of a settled <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> nor the constant danger of <hi>Innovations</hi> will hinder men of fiery and restless spirits from raising combustions in a Nation, though themselves perish in the <hi>Flames</hi> of them. This we find here was the case of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company; they had forgotten the groans of their captivity in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the miracles of their deliverance out of it, and all the faithful services of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> they considered not the difficulties of <hi>Government,</hi> nor the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of satisfying the ambitious desires of all pretenders; they regarded not that <hi>God</hi> from whom their power was derived, nor the account they must give to him for their resistance of it: nothing but a full <hi>Revenge</hi> upon the Government can satisfie them, by leaving no means unattempted for its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, though themselves be consumed by the fall of it. It were happy for <hi>Government</hi> if these turbulent spirits could be singled out from the rest in their first attempts; but that is the usual subtilty of such men, when they find themselves aimed at, they run into the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101596:10"/>
common herd, and perswade the people that they are equally concerned with themfelves in the present danger, that though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be only against faction and sedition, the design is the slavery and oppression of the <hi>People.</hi> This they manage at first by grave nods, and secret whispers, by deep sighs, and <hi>extatick</hi> motions, by far fetched discourses, and <hi>Tragical</hi> stories, till they find the people capable of receiving their impressions, and then seem most unwilling to mention that which it was at first their design to discover. By such arts as these <hi>Corah</hi> had prepared, as <note place="margin">

Interest should be discovered and punished; lest if they be let alone in their Usurpations of Power, they declare themselves open enemies when it will be too late to oppose them.</hi> There were then two great Principles among them by which they thought to defend themselves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Liberty</hi> and a <hi>right to Power</hi> is so inherent in the <hi>People,</hi> that it cannot be taken from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in case of <hi>Usurpation</hi> upon that <hi>Liberty</hi> of the people, they may resume the exercise of <hi>Power,</hi> by punishing those who are guilty of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Liberty,</hi> and a <hi>right to Power,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from the people; <hi>libertatis patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium suscipiunt,</hi> saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon <hi>Corah</hi> and his company; and I believe they will be found to be the first assertors of this kind of <hi>Liberty</hi> that ever were in the world.

It was only the <hi>Liberty</hi> of destroying themselves, which all the power he had could
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101596:13"/>
hardly keep them from. Could there be any greater <hi>Liberty</hi> than delivering them out of the house of bondage? and was not <hi>Moses</hi> the great Instrument in effecting it? Could there be greater <hi>Liberty</hi> than for their whole Nation to be preserved from all the designs of their enemies, to enjoy their own <hi>Laws,</hi> and matters of <hi>Justice</hi> to be duly administred among them? and had they not all these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of <hi>Moses?</hi> What means then this out-cry for <hi>Liberty?</hi> Is it that they would have had no <hi>Government</hi> at all among them, but that every one might have done what he pleased himself? This indeed were a desirable <hi>Liberty,</hi> if a man could have it alone: but when every one thinks that he is but one, though he be free; and every one else is as free as he, but though their <hi>freedom</hi> be equal to his, his <hi>Power</hi> is not equal to theirs; and therefore to bring things to a more just proportion, every one must part with some power for a great deal of security. If any man can imagine himself in such a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>confusion,</hi> which some improperly call a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> let him consider, whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment he could take in his own liberty and power to defend himself, would ballance the fears he would have of the injury which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101596:13"/>
others in the same state might be able to do him. Not that I think meer <hi>fear</hi> made men at first enter into Societies, for there is a natural inclination in mankind to it, and one of the greatest pleasures of humane life lyes in the enjoyment of it. But what other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions incline men to, fear makes reasonable, though men part with some supposed liberty for the enjoyment of it. So that the utmost liberty is destroyed by the very nature of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermment,</hi> and nothing can be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable than for men to quarrel with <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for that, which they cannot enjoy and the preservation of themselves together. Which alone makes the desire of <hi>Power</hi> reasonable, and if the preservation of our selves in our rights and properties may be had without it, all that the want of <hi>Liberty</hi> signifies, is, that men have all the conveniences of <hi>Power</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trouble and the cares of it. And if this be not a more desirable <hi>Liberty</hi> than the other, let any rational man judge. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Liberty</hi> then in this sense against <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is, that men are <hi>Fools</hi> in taking the best care to preserve themselves, that <hi>Laws</hi> are but instruments of <hi>Slavery,</hi> and every single man is better able to defend himself, than the united strength of a people in <hi>Society</hi> is to defend him. And this kind of <hi>Liberty</hi> we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101596:14"/>
may justly think will be desired by none but mad-men, and beasts of prey. It follows then, that what <hi>Liberty</hi> is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with all <hi>Government,</hi> must never be pleaded against any one sort of it. But is there then so great a degree of <hi>Liberty</hi> in one mode of <hi>Government</hi> more than another, that it should be thought reasonable to disturb <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> meerly to alter the form of it? Would it have been so much better for the people of <hi>Israel</hi> to have been governed by the 250 men here mentioned, than by <hi>Moses?</hi> Would not they have required the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience to themselves, though their commands had been much more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable than his? What security can there be that every one of these shall not be worse in all respects than him whom they were so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lay aside; and if one be thought trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, what <hi>Liberty</hi> and ease is there when their name is <hi>Legion?</hi> So that the folly of these popular pretences is as great as the sin in being perswaded by them.</p>
            <p>And it may be they have not thought amiss who have attributed a great part of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the Peace of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> under a pretence of popular <hi>Government,</hi> to an unjust admiration of those <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, who have unreasonably set up <hi>Liberty</hi> in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101596:14"/>
opposition to <hi>Monarchy.</hi> But some of the wisest of them have given us a truer account of these things, and have told us, that it was impossible the <hi>Roman</hi> State could have been preserved longer, unless it had submitted to an <hi>Imperial Power;</hi> For the popular heats and <note place="margin">

               <hi>of Monarchy are far greater; it being much easier to find one good than many; and though one be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted difficult, the other is almost impossible.</hi> And as he elsewhere well observes, <hi>the flourishing of a Common-wealth depends upon its poverty;</hi> that being alone able to unite the minds of the <hi>Governours,</hi> who in a plentiful state, not set about with enemies, will be grasping at their own private interests, and fall naturally from thence into divisions and animosities; but <hi>the flourishing of the Monarchy lyes in the riches of it,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> having the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and being rich or poor together. So that we see the notion of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and exercise of power in <hi>Government,</hi> is so far from being an inseparable property of the people, that the proper notion of it is inconsistent with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and that which lyes in the <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Rights and Properties,</hi> is so far from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101596:15"/>
being inconsistent with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that they are more advanced by that, than by any other way of Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another principle which tends to the subverting Government under a pretence of <hi>Liberty,</hi> is, that in case of <hi>Usurpation</hi> upon the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> they may resume the exercise of <hi>Power,</hi> and punish the <hi>Supreme Magistrate</hi> himself, if he be guilty of it. Then which there can be no principle ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more destructive to civil <hi>Societies,</hi> and repugnant to the very nature of <hi>Government.</hi> For it destroys all the obligations of Oaths and Compacts, it makes the solemnest bonds of obedience signifie nothing, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall think fit to declare it: it makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prosperous <hi>Rebellion</hi> just; for no doubt when the power is in the <hi>Rebels</hi> hands, they will justifie themselves, and condemn their Soveraign. (And if <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> had succeeded in their Rebellion against <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> no doubt they would have been called the <hi>Keepers</hi> of the <hi>Liherties</hi> of <hi>Israel.)</hi> It makes all Government dangerous to the persons in whom it is, considering the unavoidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of it, and the readiness of people to misconstrue the actions of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and their incapacity to judge of them; it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit that the reasons of all counsels of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101596:15"/>
Princes should be divulged by <hi>Proclamations.</hi> So that there can be nothing wanting to make <hi>Princes</hi> miserable, but that the people want <hi>Power</hi> to make them so. And the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this principle will unavoidably keep up a constant jealousie between the <hi>Prince</hi> and his people: for if he knows their minds, he will think it reasonable to secure himself by all means against their <hi>Power,</hi> and endeavour to keep them as unable to resist as may be: whereby all mutual confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Prince</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> will be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and there can be no such way to bring in an arbitrary <hi>Government</hi> into a <hi>Nation,</hi> as that which such men pretend, to be the only means to keep it out. Besides, this must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily engage a Nation in endless disputes about the forfeiture of Power into whose hands it falls: whether into the people in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or some persons particularly chosen by the people for that purpose: for in an establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Government</hi> according to their principles, the King himself is the true representative of the people; others may be chosen for some particular purposes, as proposing Laws, &amp;c. but these cannot pretend by vertue of that choice, to have the full power of the people; and withall, whatever they do against the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101596:16"/>
consent of the people is unlawful; and their power is forfeited by attempting it.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, what mighty danger can there be in supposing the persons of <hi>Princes</hi> to be so <hi>sacred,</hi> that no sons of violence ought to come near to hurt them? Have not all the ancient <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> of the world flourished under the supposition of an unaccountable power in <hi>Princes?</hi> That hath been thought by those who did not own a derivation of their power from <hi>God,</hi> but a just security to their persons, considering the hazards, and the care of Government which they undergo? Have not the people who have been most jealous of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> been fain to have recourse to an unaccountable power, as their last refuge in case of their greatest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities? I mean the <hi>Romans</hi> in their <hi>Dictators.</hi> And if it were thought not only reasonable, but necessary then, ought it not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served inviolable, where the same <hi>Laws</hi> do give it by which men have any right to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any power at all? Neither doth this <hi>give Princes the liberty to do what they list;</hi> for the <hi>Laws</hi> by which they <hi>Govern,</hi> do fence in the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>properties</hi> of men; and <hi>Princes</hi> do find so great conveniency ease and security in their <hi>Government</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> that the sense of that will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101596:16"/>
keep them far better within the compass of <hi>Laws,</hi> than the <hi>Peoples</hi> holding a Rod over them, which the best <hi>Princes</hi> are like to suffer the most by, and bad will but grow despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by it. Good <hi>Princes</hi> will never need such a curb, because their oaths and promises, their love and tenderness towards their people, the sense they have of a <hi>Power</hi> infinitely greater than theirs, to which they must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all their actions, will make them govern as the <hi>Fathers</hi> of their Countrey; and bad <hi>Princes</hi> will never value it, but will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by all possible means to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against it. So that no inconveniency can be possibly so great on the supposition of this unaccountable <hi>Power</hi> in Soveraign <hi>Princes,</hi> taking it in the general, and meerly on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of reason, as the unavoidable mischiefs of that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which places all power ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the people, and notwithstanding all <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>bonds</hi> whatsoever to obedience gives them the liberty to resume it when they please: which will alwaies be when that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> shall prevail among them, which ruled here in <hi>Corah</hi> and his company.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another pretence for this Rebellion of <hi>Corah,</hi> was, <hi>the freeing themselves from the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101596:17"/>
encroachments upon their spiritual priviledges which were made by the usurpations of</hi> Aaron <hi>and the Priesthood.</hi> This served for a very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular pretence, for they knew no reason that one <hi>Tribe</hi> should engross so much of the wealth of the Nation to themselves, and have nothing to do but to attend the service of God for it. What, say they, <hi>are not all the Lords people holy?</hi> Why may not then all they <hi>offer up incense to the Lord,</hi> as well as the Sons of <hi>Aaron?</hi> How many <hi>publick uses</hi> might those <hi>Revenues</hi> serve for, which are now to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Aaron,</hi> and all the sons of <hi>Levi?</hi> But if there must be some to attend the service of God, why may not the <hi>meanest</hi> of the people serve for that purpose, those who can be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for nothing else? Why must there be an order of <hi>Priesthood</hi> distinct from that of <hi>Levites?</hi> why a <hi>High-Priest</hi> above all the <hi>Priests?</hi> what is there in all their office which one of the common people may not do as well as they? cannot they slay the sacrifices, and offer incense, and do all other parts of the <hi>Priestly office?</hi> So that at last they make all this to be a Politick design of <hi>Moses</hi> only to advance his own <hi>Family</hi> by making his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther High-Priest,</hi> and to have all the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> at his devotion, to keep the people
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101596:17"/>
the better in awe. This hath alwaies been the quarrel at <hi>Religion,</hi> by those who seldom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, but with a design to destroy it. For who would ever have minded the constant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at the <hi>Temple,</hi> if no encouragements had been given to those who were imployed in it? Or is not <hi>Religion</hi> apt enough to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised of it self, by men of prophane minds, unless it be rendred more <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> by the <hi>Poverty</hi> of those who are devoted to it? Shall not <hi>God</hi> be allowed the priviledge of every <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Family,</hi> to appoint the ranks and orders of his own servants, and to take care they be provided for, as becomes those who wait upon him? What a dishonour had this been to the <hi>true God,</hi> when those who worshipped <hi>false Gods</hi> thought nothing too great for those who were imployed in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of them? But never any yet cryed, but he that had a mind to betray his <hi>Master, to what purpose is all this waste?</hi> Let <hi>God</hi> be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he ought to be, let <hi>Religion</hi> come in for its share among all the things which deserve encouragement, and those who are imployed in the offices of it, enjoy but what <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of their <hi>Countrey</hi> give them, and then we shall see it was nothing, but the <hi>discontent</hi> and <hi>saction</hi> of <hi>Corah</hi> and his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101596:18"/>
company which made any encroachment of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> any pretence for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
            <p>But all these pretences would not serve to make them escape the severe hand of divine <hi>justice;</hi> for in an extraordinary and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner he made them suffer the just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of their sin, for <hi>they perished in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</hi> which is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Judgement</hi> which was inflicted upon them for it. They had provoked <hi>Heaven</hi> by their sin, and disturbed the <hi>earth</hi> by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and the <hi>earth,</hi> as if it were moved with indignation against them, trembled and <hi>shook,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> saith, like waves that are tossed with a mighty wind, and then with a horrid noise it rends asunder, and opens its mouth to swallow those in its bowels who were unfit to live upon the face of it. They had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the people, and the earth to their amazement and ruine divides it self under their feet, as though it had been designed on purpose, that in their punishment themselves might feel, and others see the mischief of their sin. Their seditious principles seemed to have infected the ground they stood upon; the earth of a sudden proves as unquiet and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101596:18"/>
as they; but to rebuke their madness, it was only in obedience to him who made it the executioner of his wrath against them; and when it had done its office, it is said, <hi>that the</hi>

               <hi>earth closed upon them; and they perished from among the Congregation.</hi> Thus the <hi>earth</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenged it self against the disturbers of its peace, <hi>Heaven</hi> presently appears with a <hi>flaming fire,</hi> taking vengeance upon the 250 men, who in opposition to <hi>Aaron, had usurped the Priestly office, in offering incense before the Lord.</hi> Such a <hi>Fire,</hi> if we believe the same Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, <note place="margin">V. 3<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Thus Heaven and Earth agree in the punishment of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable judgement upon them hath left it upon record to all ages, that all the world may be convinced how displeasing to him the sin of saction and sedition is. For <hi>God,</hi> takes all this that was done against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as done against himself. For they are said <hi>to be gathered together against the Lord,</hi> v. 11. <hi>to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101596:19"/>
provoke the Lord,</hi> v. 30. And <hi>the fire is said to come out from the Lord:</hi> v. 35. And afterwards it is said of them; <hi>This is that Dathan and Abiram, who strove against Moses and against</hi>

               <hi>Aaron in the company of Corah, when they strove against the Lord.</hi> By which we see <hi>God</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets striving against the Authority appointed by him, to be a striving against himself. <hi>God</hi> looks upon himself as immediately concerned in the Government of the world; for <hi>by him Princes raign,</hi> and they are his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; and they who <hi>resist,</hi> resist not a meer appointment of the people, but <hi>an Ordinance of God;</hi> and they who do so shall in the mildest sense receive a <hi>severe punishment</hi> from <note place="margin">Rom 13. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </note> him. Let the pretences be never so popular, the persons never so great and famous; nay, though they were of the great Council of the <hi>Nation,</hi> yet we see <hi>God</hi> doth not abate of his severity upon any of these considerations.</p>
            <p>This was the first formed sedition that we read of against <hi>Moses,</hi> the people had been murmuring before, but they wanted heads to manage them: Now all things concur to a most dangerous Rebellion upon the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular pretences of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> and now <hi>God</hi> takes the first opportunity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his hatred of such actions; <hi>that others might hear, and fear, and do no more so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously.</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101596:19"/>
This hath been the usual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of divine Judgements; the first of the kind hath been most remarkably punished in this life, that by it they may see how hateful such things are to <hi>God;</hi> but if men will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon them not withstanding, <hi>God</hi> doth not alwaies punish them so much in this world, (though he sometimes doth) but reserves them, without repentance, to his Justice in the world to come. The first man that sinned was made an example of <hi>Gods</hi> Justice; The first world; the first publick attempt against Heaven at <hi>Babel</hi> after the plantation of the world again; the first Cities which were so generally corrupted after the flood; the first breaker of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> after the <hi>Law;</hi> the first offerers with strange fire; the first lookers into the <hi>Ark,</hi> and here the first popular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Usurpers of the office of <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. God</hi> doth hereby intend to preserve the honour of his <hi>Laws;</hi> he gives men warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough by one exemplary punishment, and if not withstanding that, they will commit the same sin, they may thank themselves if they suffer for it, if not in this life, yet in that to come. And that good effect this Judgement had upon that people, that although the next day 14000 suffered for murmuring at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of these men, yet we do not find that

            <p>And happy had it been for us if this Doctrine had been more sincerely preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and duly practised in this Nation; for we should then never have seen those sad times, which we can now no otherwise think of, than of the devouring <hi>Fire,</hi> and raging <hi>Pestilence, i. e.</hi> of such dreadfull judgements which we have smarted so much by, that we heartily pray we may never feel them again: For then <hi>fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies</hi> began our miseries, and the <hi>curse</hi> so often denounced <hi>against Meroz,</hi> fell upon the whole Nation; When the Sons of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> managed their own ambitious designs against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Church)</hi> under the same pretences of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi> And when the pretence of <hi>Religion</hi> was broken into <hi>Schisms,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> into oppression of the <hi>people,</hi> it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>God</hi> out of his secret and unsearchable judgements to suffer the Sons of Violence to prevail against the Lords <hi>Anointed;</hi> and

then they would know no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his being conquered and guilty. They could find no way to justifie their former wickedness, but by adding more: The consciousness of their own guilt, and the fears of the punishment due to it, made them unquiet and thoughtfull; as long as his life and presence did upbraid them with the one, and made them fearfull of the other. And when they found the greatness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of his mind, the firmness of his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the zeal he had for the true interest of the people, would not suffer him to betray his <hi>Trust</hi> for the saving of his life; they charge him with their own guilt, and make him suffer because they had deserved to do it. And as if it had not been enough to have abused the names of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> before, they resolve to make the very name of <hi>Justice</hi> to suffer together with their <hi>King:</hi> by calling that infamous company who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their <hi>Soveraign, A High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> which trampled under foot the <hi>Laws</hi> both of God and men. But lest the world should imagine they had any shame left in their sins, they make the people witnesses of his <hi>Murther;</hi> and pretend the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> for doing that, which they did detest and abhor.

And as <hi>God gave once</hi> to the people of the <hi>Jews a King in his Anger,</hi> being provoked to it by their sins, we have cause to say, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same account <hi>he took</hi> away one of the best of <hi>Kings from us in his wrath.</hi> But blessed be that <hi>God,</hi> who in the midst of judgement was pleased to remember mercy, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous preservation, and glorious restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Gracious Soveraign; let us have a care then of abusing the mercies of so great a deliverance to quite other ends than <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it for, lest he be provoked to say to us, as he did of old to the <hi>Jews, But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your</hi>
