            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Upon a Paper, Entituled, The
SPEECH
OF THE LATE
Lord RUSSEL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE words of Dying Perſons are apt to give the deepeſt impreſſions
upon the Minds of the Living; and though poſſibly there is no
point in which I am more tender, than in treading upon the
memory of ſuch, who are out of the capacity of making their own
Defence; yet reſolving to comport my ſelf with all decency, which
I would do if the perſon were living, I think it a neceſſary duty to
endeavour to hinder the ſpreading of that Contagion, which has proved ſo fatal to
the pretended Author of this Speech, and I fear will prove ſo t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs, if they be
not charitably undeceived; and truly, if the Diſſenters, who do ſo g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>edily ſwallow
down all that is ſaid in that Paper, as if the ſuppoſed Author were a Martyr, and the
words as true as Goſpel, do not open their Eyes to ſee the wondrous Contradictions,
which Providence has ſo viſibly oppoſed to thoſe Inſinuations, my fears for them are
extraordinary, that they are hardened to their own deſtruction; and let them be
never ſo angry, I will do all I can to prevent the miſchief they will certainly pull
upon their own heads, whilſt they prepare it for others.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I have the utmoſt difficulty to believe this Speech to be the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s,
and cannot but ſuſpect the finger of <hi>Job</hi> to be in it; and my reaſon is, becauſe there
is ſo much Panegyrick, as is not at all conſiſtent, either with the modeſty or humility
of a Perſon <hi>born of worthy good Parents, and who has had the advantages of a Religious
Education,</hi> as it is there expreſſed, for he could not then miſs of the Divine Precept
of the wiſeſt of mere mortal Men, <hi>Let another Man praiſe thee, and not thine own Lips.</hi>
The office of making Inventories, of the Virtues as well as Goods of the deceaſed,
and the care of embalming their Memories as well as Bodies, has ever been committed
to the diſcretion of their Friends, who may without Vanity or Oſtentation ſay thoſe
things, which would no ways become themſelves. And ſince that unfortunate Lord
tells us, He could never conſent to do a baſe thing, I think it is a ſervice to vindicate him
from the moſt indecent and abject of all Follies, the blazoning himſelf, and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his own Praiſes, which is at the leaſt one third part of that ſheet of Paper.</p>
            <p>But to let paſs the Panegyricks as the moſt innocent, though not moſt wiſe, I ſhall
only give them this Remark: That whoever was the Penman of that Paper, has not
done it without a moſt injurious deſign, of inſinuating into the heads of the intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Rabble ſuch a Poyſon as may turn them round, ſince the natural and eaſie infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from thence is, That this Gentleman being a perſon of thoſe Excellencies, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50751:2"/>
innocent as he averrs of the Crimes for which he dies, the Loſs is the greater, his
Caſe the harder, and the Injuſtice done him ſo much the worſe. And we are not
unacquainted how far ill Men carry on their Reflections, to the diſparagement of
the Juſtice both of God and Man, and to run the wild <hi>Mobile</hi> into the utmoſt Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies
of Extravagance againſt, and deteſtation of the Government and their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon ſome Expreſſions, which ſeem next to Equivocation, as, <hi>his
living and dying of the Reformed Religion, a true and ſincere Proteſtant, and in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church of</hi> England, and many ſuch-like; words ſo ambiguous, that all
the ſeveral Sects will pretend to an intereſt in him; and though the ſcandal of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for High-Treaſon be not very reputable for any ſort of Men, yet I am glad for
the ſake of the Loyal Church of <hi>England,</hi> that he does not ſay he is of the Reformed
Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed, which teaches all her true Children not
only not to conſpire or act Treaſon upon any pretence whatſoever, but not ſo much
as to Curſe the King in a thought in their ſafeſt Retirement from diſcovery or danger,
even in their Bed-chamber.</p>
            <p>That which I would chiefly lay my ſtreſs upon, is the obviating ſome things which
are of malicious and dangerous conſequence, not only to the Government, but to the
Diſſenters from it, who, I fear, may for want of his giving Glory to God as he
ought, become more obſtinate, in perſiſting in the belief of their miſtakes, which,
without Repentance, will certainly prove fatal to them poſſibly in this World, but
certainly in the next.</p>
            <p>And firſt I obſerve that the great ſcope and drift of the Speech is to perſwade foolish
people that they are in the utmoſt danger of Popery, as particularly <hi>P. 2. I did believe
and do ſtill</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Popery is breaking in upon the Nation.</hi> This very Topique
has already coſt this Nation 40 Millions of Treaſure, and 100000 lives, and one which
was more valuable than them all, that of our late Martyred Soveraign King
<hi>CHARLES</hi> the firſt, for whoſe innocent blood, I fear divine Vengeance is now
calling the Diſſenters to an account, and making inquiſition for blood. With this
fear of Popery it is that the people have been ſo far miſlead, as to give the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
hopes to be aſſiſted by them, even by the confeſſion of this Speech <hi>to undo us
all,</hi> to Murder the beſt and moſt Gracious of Princes, and ſubvert the eaſieſt of all
Governments. And now let all the world judge who knows beſt, or is moſt likely to
prevent the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in of Popery, the King, who upon all occaſions has condeſcended
ſo far as to avow to his people, that he will do all that lyes in his power to keep out
Popery, or my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Speech, which affirms to the contrary; it is not only good
manners to believe the King, who is as an Angel of God, rather than all the malicious
Speeches of men to the contrary, but I do aver, that whoever gives credit to this
Calumny, againſt the Kings avowed Declaration, the known rule and practice of the
Law to ſuppreſs Popery, is not only an uncharitable and ill Chriſtian, but a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
Subject, ſince it is notorious, that this old <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s cloak of fear of Popery,
is the very mantle of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the innocence of this Gentleman, which is very poſitively a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
in the ſpoken Speech, where 'tis ſaid, <hi>in the words of a dying man, I profeſs I know
of no Plot either againſt the Kings life or the Government.</hi> What? know of no Plot? I
profeſs it is boldly ſaid, and I doubt not but will be readily believed by the whole Party.
But it were well for them if it had been as plainly proved, and truly had the Speech
ſtopt here without the following comment upon the Text, it would have been ſome
difficulty to have expounded it, and others may do what they pleaſe, but I cannot
chufe but attribute the Printing and induſtrious diſperſing of this Speech to a ſuperiour
hand, which has appeared ſo marvellouſly viſible in the diſcovery of this helliſh Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
What ſo many diſcourſes as are confeſſed, <hi>of the feazibleneſs of ſeizing the Kings
Guards,</hi> p. 3. my Lord <hi>exclaiming againſt it, and asking if the thing ſucceeded what muſt
be done next,</hi> &amp;c. the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> tells him, <hi>my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>and ſome hot men
would undoe us all,</hi> and asks him at another time, <hi>Did you ever hear ſuch a horrid thing?</hi>
and yet to ſay he dyes innocent, or knows of no Plot againſt the King's life or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I proteſt I ſtand amazed at the contradiction; for the Evaſions are too ſilly
and thin, to think that the horrid thing was only killing the Guards, or that which
would undo us all, was ſome diſorderly thing or other which the hot men would do,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50751:2"/>
if great care were not taken. Alas! that any man ſhould be ſo weak himſelf as to
think to impoſe upon others ſuch fooliſh inconſiſtencies. No certainly the horrid
thing, ſuch as was never heard of, that would undo us all, muſt be Crimes of
another nature than this palliating Speech inſinuates, and can be of no other
import than Treaſons of the blackeſt complexion. And after the knowledge of ſuch
things, to ſay a man knows no Plot, and that he dyes innocent, cannot be ſaid unleſs
Plotting and knowing of it be no Treaſon, and that the ſame perſon may be the
greateſt Criminal, and the moſt innocent at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>I would fain be Anſwered one Queſtion: And that is, What ſhould this diſcourſe
about ſeizing the Guards be ſo often debated, and to what purpoſe can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be done? He muſt be ſtupid that does not ſee it carry Treaſon in the face
of it; either in Seizing or Aſſaſſinating the Kings Perſon, or both ſucceſſively, but
ſtill the knowing of this muſt be miſpriſion of Treaſon. It was well my Lords
Council knew better things, when they adviſed him <hi>not to confeſs matter of Fact
plainly,</hi> for if he had confeſſed as much as this Speech does, he would have ſaved
the Witneſſes a labour, and the <hi>eaſie and willing Jury,</hi> as the Speech calls them,
would not have had occaſion to withdraw from the Bar for their Verdict: The Law
ſays, there are no acceſſaries but all are principals in Treaſons. He confeſſes, <hi>he
was preſſed with this, that he was acquainted with theſe heats and ill deſigns and did not
diſcover them,</hi> page 3. and infers <hi>this is but miſpriſion of Treaſon at moſt;</hi> but his
Lawyers knew better; and though it can do him no ſervice, yet becauſe it may
do others who think not revealing Treaſon no Crime, or that the bare difcourſing
it is ſo little a thing, I will give the opinion of one of the Oracles of their Party
Mr. St. <hi>Johns</hi> in his Argument concerning the attainder of the E. of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as I
find it in Dr. <hi>Nalſons 2d</hi> Vol. of Collections publiſhed the other day, folio 196<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where he proves, that bare Machination to raiſe War, is Treaſon: He gives ſeveral
inſtances, and one moſt remarkable as follows. In the <hi>3d</hi> year of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV,
one <hi>Balſhal</hi> coming from <hi>London,</hi> found one <hi>Bernard</hi> at plough in the Pariſh of <hi>Ofley</hi>
in the County of <hi>Hertford: Bernard</hi> asked <hi>Balſhal,</hi> What news? he told
him, that the news was, that <hi>Richard</hi> II. was alive in <hi>Scotland</hi> (which was falſe
for he was dead) and that by <hi>Midſummer</hi> next, he would come into <hi>England: Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
asked him, What were beſt to be done? <hi>Balſhal</hi> Anſwered, get men and go
to King <hi>Richard.</hi> In <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, in the <hi>3d.</hi> year of <hi>Hen. 4th.</hi> in the Kings
Bench, Rot. 4. This advice adjudged Treaſon.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Story</hi> in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> time practiſed to Levy War, nothing done in purſuance
of a practiſe, the intent adjudged Treaſon, and he Executed upon it, even before
the Act of the XIII. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which made intention Treaſon during Her Life: For
this Caſe was adjudged in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, the Parliament begun not 'till the <hi>April</hi>
following.</p>
            <p>Now let us infer, if Seizing the Kings Guards and making them Priſoners,
which cannot be done without Arms, be Levying War, and Levying War be
Treaſon, and the debating this matter be alſo Treaſon, and there can be no
acceſſories but all Principals in Treaſon, and my L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was at many of theſe
debates, and acquainted with theſe ill deſigns, What becomes of his innocence?
moſt aſſuredly in the ſight of God and Man he is Guilty.</p>
            <p>Nor is he ſo innocent neither in that commonly call'd Gentile Quality, which
he ſeems next to his pretended innocence ſo much to value himſelf upon, that, he
ſaith, <hi>he hopes no body will imagine that ſo mean a thought ſhould enter into me as to go
about to ſave my ſelf, by accuſing others.</hi> It ſeems he could then, if he had not thought
it baſe and mean; but truly if he had too much gallantry to ſave his Body, he ought
to have had enough Religion to ſave his Soul. And I tremble to think that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who ſhould have done otherwiſe, have dealt ſo unfaithfully with him, as to
let him dye glorying, and impenitent of two moſt horrible ſins.</p>
            <p>For firſt, here is a moſt manifeſt Perjury, which by this not accuſing all he knew
guilty of theſe heats and ill deſigns, he ſtands manifeſtly <hi>in Articulo Mortis,</hi> convict
of, by his own Confeſſion. For as a Member of the Commons Houſe, how often,
as well as in other capacities, he hath fworn by the Omnipotent God, upon the
Holy Evangeliſts, the Oath of Allegiance, of <hi>3 Jac. To do his beſt endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
and make known to His Majeſty his Heirs and Succeſſors, all Treaſons, and Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50751:3"/>
Conſpiracies, which he ſhall know or hear of to be againſt him or any of them:</hi> And
yet out of a piece of Gallantry, it is too mean a thing to accuſe others. So brave
a thing it is to break the Oath of God, and without infinite Mercy, to leap headlong
into Damnation, and excuſe it as a piece of Bravery. O! wretched Conductors
of this poor Gentlemans Soul, to let him paſs into Eternity with that dreadful
Imprecation annexed to this Oath, of So help me God, unthought of and unrepent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of! <hi>There were ſome things ſaid at</hi> Shepheard'<hi>s by ſome,</hi> the Speech tells us, <hi>with
more heat than Judgment.</hi> Theſe things ought, by the force of this Oath, to have
been revealed, upon the, no leſs, danger than renouncing all help from God, and
all hopes of happineſs, and it will be a poor plea for a ſhivering ſoul before the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tribunal of infinite Juſtice, to ſay as the Speech does, <hi>that he did then ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve
them;</hi> when he was under the indiſpenſible obligation of a moſt ſolemn and
ſacred Oath, and of the forfeiture of mercy and Heaven bound to diſcloſe and reveal
them to the King.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a little ſin, whatever men may think, not to give Glory to God, by a public
acknowledgment and repentance for that Guilt and thoſe Crimes, for which his
juſtice has brought any perſon to ſuch publique and exemplary puniſhment. For beſides
the injuſtice which is done to the Righteous Judge of all men, in not vindicating his
Glory by a clear and ingenuous confeſſion; it hath this dangerous influence upon
others, that thereby they are hardned in their impenitency, and even after death a
perſon may become criminal and acceſſary to all the ill and dangerous conſequences
which may be the effects of this ſupreſſing of truth.</p>
            <p>I pray God ſome people be not ſenſible of this, to their utter Ruins: For I cannot
without ſtrange apprehenſions ſee the people ſwallow this deadly draught of Poyſon,
and endeavour to ſtifle the moſt horrid and barbarous Conſpiracy, the moſt clearly
proved, and moſt miraculouſly both detected and diſappointed, that any Age or Story
can parallel. A Conſpiracy which would have laid theſe Nations weltering in Blood,
and would have made our Poſterity the moſt abſolute Slaves to Tyranny and Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any in the Chriſtian World. And it amazes me to hear people talk, That
what theſe Conſpirators did, was only for preſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion,
and not againſt the King's Life, when the Sun is not more clear than this diſcovery,
that nothing could ſo entirely have ruined the Government and the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as this Conſpiracy, had it taken effect, was deſigned to have done.</p>
            <p>There are a Thouſand other things might be ſaid, and very neceſſarily, but <hi>I</hi>
thought it more proper, though with too ſwift a hand, to do ſomething towards the
ſtemming of the Tide, than to let it overrun all the Banks for want of a little early
care to ſtop the firſt breaches, and I doubt not but ſome others will give this Speech
a more deliberate Anſwer, than can be expected from theſe haſty lines, which are the
effect of a perfect duty and Loyalty to my King, zeal to the Glory of God, and the
good of all my fellow Subjects, excuſes I hope ſufficient to procure a Pardon for a
Paper writ, it may be, with more affection than any other Ingredients which might
have rendred the compoſure proportionate and exact.</p>
            <p>God preſerve his ſacred Majeſties perſon, the whole Royal Family, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
our Religion, Lives, Laws, and Liberties, from the Conſpiracies of ſuch men as
think Treaſon Innocence, and concealing it a Glory, and may all the yet ſecret Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations
of wicked <hi>Achitophels</hi> and Rebellious <hi>Abſaloms</hi> be for ever defeated and
diſcovered.</p>
