            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We broke up <hi>Boden,</hi> as we might be served to quarter that night at <hi>Drumbo,</hi> having directed from <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> one of the Kings ships towards <hi>Carlingford</hi> with some provision of Meal, Chiese and Ammunition, for which we had no transport by land, giving him order to secure the water mouth at <hi>Carlingford,</hi> being the water passes to the <hi>Newrie.</hi> The other ship I directed towards <hi>Colraine</hi> and <hi>London-Derry,</hi> with some reliefe to them both, and to bring intelligence from thence against our returne. The twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ninth we marched towards <hi>Lessnagarvie,</hi> where we joyned with eight hundred foot and two troopes of horse of my Lord <hi>Clanne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowies,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ards,</hi> commanded by Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Montgomrie,</hi> and Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Hamilton;</hi> and being in all about three thousand foure hundred foot, in two divisions, <hi>viz.

We had also with us three troopes Dragooners at fifty

In this skirmish Sir <hi>Rorie Mackginnische</hi> and <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kartans,</hi> two active men, brothers were killed with one hun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Saturdy the last of <hi>April,</hi> we marched in the former order through the woods, towards <hi>Lochbricklane,</hi> where being come on the plaine, our horsemen on the wings killed divers of them retiring, and some taken prisoners were hanged thereafter. And being come late to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar we could not ingage that night with the intaking of the <hi>Iland,</hi> where there lay a wicked Garison in a fast place environed within a loch, being a refuge in safety, and their Boat d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And leaving a Serjeant and twelue Muskateers there, we marched towards the <hi>Newrie;</hi> and having summoned the Town and Castle to come in to our mercy or no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Towne gave over, the Castle held out, alledging He was able to keepe it seven yeers. In the meane time we granted a time to the next morning to Him to advise; during which time I fully recognish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the house and perceived that I could take it in by pittard or by fire. On Munday the second of <hi>May,</hi> prepared our fagots, and made ready our batteries, before tuesday at mid-day, resolving to take it in rather by terrour of our Canons then by fire or pittard, which would make the place unprofitable for us; next if it were taken so Sir <hi>Edward Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> a man of good account, being there Prisoner, had died also by them or with them; so having all things in readinesse quainted them againe there was no quarter for them but he and his Garison to march forth without Armes with white sticks in their hands, and he should have a free Convoy, and their lives spared. These of the town should have no other quarter then to come forth in our reverence.

            <p>Friday the sixt of <hi>May</hi> having setled the Garison, I resolved to march towards the enemy to <hi>Ardmach:</hi> and having sent forth one strong par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Horse and Dragoneers towards their Army, they thinking the whole Army was marching; retired back on <hi>Ardmach</hi> and burnt the town, puttingall the <hi>Brittish</hi> to the sword and retired to the straits of <hi>Tyron;</hi> whereupon we being scarce of victuals and our body weakned, our souldiers burthened with unnecessary trash of baggage. I resolved to returne with the Army home, marching through my Lord <hi>Evankes</hi> Countrey, <hi>Mackartan</hi> and <hi>Slawtneils,</hi> being onely the considerable Enemy in the Countrey of <hi>Doun.</hi> And in our March I resolved my selfe with 800. Musketeers to put them from their strengths in the Mountains of <hi>Monrue,</hi> and to rob them of their cattell, which we did. I marching through the Mountains, on the right hand, and the Army, Horse and foot and Artillary marching through the Valley on the left hand, where we joyned together. On Sunday the eight at night, foure miles from the Passe of <hi>Durdrum,</hi> bordering betwixt my Lord <hi>Evanks</hi> Lands &amp; <hi>Mackartans.</hi> Munday the ninth, we divided our Army in three, Colonel <hi>Home</hi> with 500. commanded Musketeers two troops of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goneers, and one troope of Horse; to <hi>Connoway</hi> the Artillary cattell and baggage safest way towards <hi>Mackartanes</hi> owne house; the rest of the Horse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wednesday the 11. hearing the Enemy was resolved to fight with us in the wood, we marched with our Artillery and commanded men in the Van-guard; our two divisions marching after with comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men in the flanks, we were forced to make severall stopt to cleere the passages they had stopped with wood to keepe us up; our cattell marched next to the Army, being guarded with Pike-men and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kateers on all quarters; our baggage next to them, our horsemen and Dragonee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WEE of this Citie of <hi>London-Derry</hi> and other parts, have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bin forgotten, or given over for losse, as we conceive; for al other parts of the Kingdome are plentifully supplied, and yet thogh we have made our wants and miseries knowne divers times to <hi>Dublin</hi> and to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet no reliefe ever came to us, but onely thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty barrels of powder brought by Captaine <hi>Bolline</hi> from <hi>Dublin,</hi> long before Christmas, which was partly upon the arrival thereof disposed to all needfull parts; and want of powder and arms here hath bin our ruine. It is the great providence and goodnesse of God that we are hitherto preserved, having bin so ill armed and provided for; all the arms within his Majesties store here were shipt to <hi>Dublin</hi> the last summer, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left here but old decaid Calivers, which we have hitherto made a shift with, and trimmed them up to our great charges.</p>
            <p>We have raised seven hundred men for the defence of this Citie and keepe them hitherto at our owne charges, in expectation of mony and other supplies, but there is not one hundred good swords amongst them and their armes but meane. Sir <hi>William Steward,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Steward,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Gore</hi> had Commissions from his Majesty out of <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>November</hi> for raising their Regiments, and two horse troops, they lye in the County of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and thereabout, and so have done all this winter, to oppose the enemy, but being unprovided for, and not one penny to pay them, they could never attempt any great service. It is much that they keepe the enemies from our wals to this houre, now our powder is gone, our victuals is beginning to faile, and these three Regiments had bin starved long since, if we of this Citie had not relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them with Biefe, Butter, Heri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And if a Ship of <hi>Bristow</hi> had not arived here with some Peas, Meale and Wheat, we could not have shifted longer, and all that will not last the Regiments fourteene dayes;

            <p>We also pray that you will restore the Captaine the six barrels of Powder we have borrowed of him; and if there be any Bisket, Cheese or any other victuals to be spared to send us some good proportion thereof.

And I am very confident to receive a return from you accordingly.</p>

I shall not go attended in the posture of a Souldier, but in my accustomed manner, that the lookers on may take notice of our familiar meeting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to each other. And I hope we shall agree in the maine point for his Majesties service and the quieting of my Countrey; and I shall strive to relieve <hi>Coleraine</hi> with victuals very shortly.</p>
            <p>I am sorry that in my absence my people were so unfortunate as to doe any hostile act, though in their owne defence, being compelled to it for safety of their lives, which they say they can make appeare in a convenient time: and the relation of the manner of the one and the other, I must refer to our meeting, and then I shall be better able to tell your honour how much I am</p>
