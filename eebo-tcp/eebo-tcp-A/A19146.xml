            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And furthermore, to thentent that
all the world may know how he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himſelf towarde the ſayd Duke of

that before theſe laſt tumults, he knew
ſome that were determined to kyll the
ſayd Duke of Guyſe becauſe thei were
diſpleaſed with him. But ſo farre of is
it that he inticed them thervnto or allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
it, that rather contrariwiſe he did
diſuade and tourne them from their
wicked purpoſes, as madame de
Guyſe her ſelfe knoweth whome he
ſufficiently aduertiſed thereof in tyme

purſued them as publyke enemyes of
God, of the kyng, &amp; of the reſt &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this realme. But vppon hys
lyfe &amp; hys honour, it ſhall neuer be
founde that he allowed that anye man
ſhoulde attempt on this ſort vppon the

was certainelye aduertiſed that the

he acknowledgeth it to be true, that at

declared vnto Monſieur de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,

            <p>MAdame two daies ſince I ſaw
an examination whiche was

himſelf the lord of Merey, the 21.
day of the laſt moneth: who confeſſeth
<pb facs="tcp:5293:24"/>
to haue hurt the duke of Guiſe, by the
which alſo he chargeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure
him or rather forced hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do that
he hath done: &amp; becauſe it is the thing
that I moſte feare in this worlde leaſt
the ſaid Poltrot ſhold be put to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before the truth of this matter be
knowen, I moſt humbly beſeche your
maieſtie to commaund that he may be
well kepte. And in the meane tyme I
haue ſet forth certaine articles vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of his, which me thinketh de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerue
an aunſwer, the whiche I ſende
vnto your maieſtye by this trompet:
whereby all men of good iudgement
may almoſt be certified of the matter.
And more ouer I ſaye, that it ſhal not
be found that euer I ſought that man
nor any other to do ſuch a deede. But
rather contrarywyſe I haue alwayes
ſtopte and not ſuffered aſmuch as laye
in me, that ſuche enterpriſes ſhoulde
bee <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

haue I often tymes talked wyth the

whome it maye pleaſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred

howe contrary I haue bene
thereunto, ſauyng within this fyue or

ben againſt thoſe which ſhewed them

hathe bene ſynce there came certayne
perſonnes whiche I wyll name when

were procured to come to kyll me, as
