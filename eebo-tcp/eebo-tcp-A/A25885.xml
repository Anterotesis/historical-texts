         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>And none ſalute Him? None in Print appear?</l>
               <l>Ungrateful Age! I doubt we do inherit,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Bayes,</hi> too much of the Red-Letter'd Spirit,</l>
               <l>I'le venture out, though late, what'ere comes on't,</l>
               <l>Without regard to malice, or affront:</l>
               <l>WALKER's Arrival, ſhall with me prevail,</l>
               <l>And I'me reſolv'd to pay him, his firſt Hail.</l>
               <l>Hail mighty Man, to King and Kingdom true,</l>
               <l>Great Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> and of <hi>Minerva</hi> too.</l>
               <l>Thou Man of double ſtrength, of tongue, and hand,</l>
               <l>Can'ſt Preach with one, with th'other can'ſt Command.</l>
               <l>Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keyes, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s two edg'd Sword,</l>
               <l>Did never better in one Soul accord.</l>
               <l>Doctor, or Hero, oh! What ſhall I call</l>
               <l>This Divine Man, who is both theſe, and all.</l>
               <l>Welcome, thrice welcome to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhoar,</l>
               <l>Surely our Ships did make their Cannons roar,</l>
               <l>For joy they brought ſo great a Cargo'ore.</l>
               <l>Welcome once more unto the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coaſt,</l>
               <l>Thou who ſo bravely did'ſt defend thy Poſt.</l>
               <l>And do the work of the great Lord of <hi>Hoaſt.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Our Bells ſhould buſy be, with their loud voice,</l>
               <l>And flames in ſtreets, to make us all rejoyce,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Te Deum</hi>'s in our Churches ſhould be ſung,</l>

               <l>But amidſt all the Conſort, 'tis the heart,</l>
               <l>Should bear the largeſt, and the longeſt part.</l>
               <l>Thus Voices, Arts, and Hearts, ſhould we advance,</l>
               <l>To praiſe our God for thy Deliverance,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Since WALKER's work in <hi>Derry</hi>'s brave Defence,</l>
               <l>Was <hi>Scotland</hi>'s Rampart, and was <hi>England</hi>'s Fence.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What was more great? What could be yet more brave?</l>
               <l>Then by one Act, three Kingdoms thus to ſave?</l>
               <l>Ceaſe, <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> your Worthyes then to boaſt,</l>
               <l>Should we Compare, yours would be wholly loſt;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Candia</hi> of her long Seige muſt ſilent be,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Stetin</hi> too beares not the bell from Thee.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Buda,</hi> that baffled one Campagne muſt yeild,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Belgrade</hi> likewiſe will reſign her ſheild;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Theſe fought, and bravely too, but yet did fall,</l>
               <l>WALKER kept <hi>Derry,</hi> and out did them all,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And yet their Greifs, were mounted to our price,</l>
               <l>To be reduc'd to Catts, and Ratts, and Mice;</l>
               <l>Dog's head in Porridge pott, made us good Broth,</l>
               <l>And was no empty Sign, but reall Troth;</l>
               <l>We thought, like <hi>Tartars,</hi> Horſes very good,</l>
               <l>Scarce potted Ven'ſon, to be better food;</l>
               <l>By which extrems, we were ſo ſharply try'd,</l>
               <l>That, to ſpeak truth, We neither liv'd, nor dy'd;</l>
               <l>Yet, as in ſleep, we ſee grim Death, and live,</l>
               <l>So were our miſeries, Death's Perſpective;</l>
               <l>So once the Mighty Prophet in the Den,</l>
               <l>So the three Children dy'd, and liv'd agen;</l>
               <l>And ſo did we, when ev'ry diſmal hour,</l>
               <l>Some of us Death did kindly too devour;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here ſome lay ſtarv'd, others the're happyer ſhot;</l>
               <l>Such were our Objects, ſtill upon the ſpot.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And yet we fought, and rais'd our ſpirits ſo,</l>
               <l>That we deſpis'd, repell'd, and ſlay'd the Fo;</l>
               <l>So little were our Strengths, our Numbers leſs,</l>
               <l>We ſometimes bluſh'd at our own great Succeſs,</l>
               <l>Which we near fear'd, the Cauſe had ſuch ſtrange odds,</l>
               <l>Their's was all empty Idol, our's all God's.</l>
               <l>Then Peere theſe acts, amongſt all ancient ſtory,</l>
               <l>And ſhew the Man, that deſerves greater glory.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Tis WALKER then, who <hi>Ireland</hi> has preſerv'd,</l>
               <l>And the great Miter there for this deſerv'd,</l>
               <l>And for whom Heav'nly treaſures are reſerv'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, that our WALKER is gon off the Stage,</l>
               <l>Enter Great SCHOMBERG, I error of the Age,</l>
               <l>March Thundering Marſhal, with thy conqu'ring Arms,</l>
               <l>Thy Name's a Spell, and give's thy Army Charms.</l>
               <l>The Holy War like WALKER led the van,</l>
               <l>May Thou as proſperous end, as he began;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We know, fear is all ſtranger unto Thee,</l>
               <l>Thou know'ſt not, whether ſuch a Paſſion be;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Or if there be, Thou leav'ſt it to thy Foes,</l>
               <l>And ſuch dull heads, as dare thy Arms oppoſe.</l>
               <l>Vict'ries thy Conduct always did attend,</l>
               <l>Triumphs ought now to Crown its latter end;</l>
               <l>This Work's beneath thee, <hi>Ireland</hi> will not bleed,</l>
               <l>Thy very word, almoſt, will do the Deed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Hunt them to Death, for to do <hi>Dear-Joyes</hi> right,</l>
               <l>They know, what 'tis to fly, not what to fight.</l>
               <l>Then Chat no more, <hi>Ireland</hi>'s already wone.</l>
               <l>SCHOMBERG has conquer'd, <hi>Talbot</hi>'s work's undone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus make Diſpatch, That heigthen'd <hi>France</hi> may feel,</l>
               <l>The ſharpen'd Edge of thy Victorious Steel,</l>
