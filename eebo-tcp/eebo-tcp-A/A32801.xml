         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and every one presumed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>The Devil hath set good men at variance
about saeculal affaires, Private interests and
publique rights, and in the mean time robs or
cheates us of what is spirituall and glorious,
the purity of truth, the power and beauty of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
We live in sad times, in which Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme

Sir, <hi>you are what you are, you are God!
Henry Nicholas,</hi> the Father of the Family
of Love, said of himself, <hi>I am God.</hi> A man
would think that our <hi>Familists</hi> had met with
some <hi>Mahumetans</hi> at <hi>Poland,</hi> or <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and some of the worst of them also.
For <hi>Al Gazalius</hi> a precise and learned <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102750:11"/>
would teach them better langnage and
behaviour also; He saith <hi>that cleanlynesse
is a part of Faith, and the Key of Prayer,
that we must have pure mindes, clean hearts
and hands.</hi> But enough of that.</p>
            <p>Sir, Being encouraged by the Committee,
for regulating this Vniversity, to undertake a
service which I even tremble to repeat, and
you being Chaireman of that Committee, I
conceived my self obliged to present you with
this Treatise. When the Vniversity was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to elect me the L. <hi>Margarets</hi> Professour
of Divinity, the revenue due to that Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
by a grant made under the great Seale of
<hi>England 3<hi rend="sup">io</hi>. Caroli,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apr. 20. 1649. This Act shall not extend to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of any publik pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor or reader in either of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities. <hi>Ad lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norem san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctae &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuae Trinitatis, ac Fidei &amp; Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> was setled by speciall
Act. And the Vniversity did purchase the
lease of the House and Meadowes in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
which belong to the said Professour,
and would (if they might have had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
priviledge of leaseholders) have bought
the inheritance of the premises outright for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
but the Vniversity is denyed the benefit of
the lease and the common priviledge aforesaid.
The House and Meadowes are sold to others,
and no revenue payed to the Professour. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that the Vniversity may be righted, and
that my successour may not suffer as I have
done. Sir, notwithstanding these discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I conceived it my duty either to read or
write <hi>for the propagation of the Christian
Faith, and honour of the blessed Trinity</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the first <hi>Grant.</hi> I consulted the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity
<pb facs="tcp:102750:11"/>
and your self, and you both concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that <hi>rebus sic stantibus,</hi> it was better to
write then read, and that it did most conduce
to the propagation of the Christian Faith; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
that it was most requisite that I should
write in English, because since the beginning
of the year 1645.<note place="margin">1645</note> there have been many blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
bookes to the great dishonour of the
blessed Trinity printed in <hi>England.</hi> But I
have found the task far more difficult, because
<hi>there are many Socinian subtiltyes which
will hardly bear English,</hi> and I could not
but take some notice of them, either by a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
answer, or else by a confirmation of that
deep truth which they do with no lesse blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
then subtilty reject, deny. I have been
forced sometimes to expresse my minde in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
in the margine, merely upon that accompt;
but the plainest reader may if he please to read
the 4. 5. 8. and 9. Chapters, understand as
much of this mystery as is necessary to bee
known; and I am confident that the happy
union between the Mystery of Faith, and the
practicall Mystery of godlinesse is as plainly
represented in this little Treatise, as in any of
the ancient or moderne Divines; for I have
faithfully endeavoured to give you the strength
and Quintessence of both in a familiar way
with many experimentall observations of
mine own, which I shall now reveiw and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
in my most retired condition. But before
I retire, give me leave to speak a word for my
<pb facs="tcp:102750:12"/>
Brethren who are eminent for all manner of
learning, sound in the Faith, holy in their life,
and peaceable in their conversation; if men
of such qualifications know not how to rest in
the present unsetlednesse of publike affaires, and
yet are ready to performe all lawfull things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them for the defence and preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the true Religion and publique Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
why may not such be still employed for the
promoting of such a just Accommodation &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
as may effectually advance the grand
publike interest, the power, purity and growth
of Religion in this land? you cannot look upon
these men as enemies, and dare not deale with
them as the worst of Infidels (whom Christian

Now which is the more tolerable penalty, to be
out-lawed or banished, is not hard to determine.
If you look upon them as <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> it is
no dishonour to them to be true to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

they were never friends to the Fortune of

them if they know not how to pursue a new

and others endeavor to remove all things just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in purity) <hi>are true Churches of

these Parochicall Churches by baptizing their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:102750:13"/>
Children, and receiving the Lords Supper
there, as occasion serves. <hi>And if occasionall
Communion with us be lawfull, constant
Communion with us would not be sinfull.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. They receive the members of such parishes
as aforesaid unto Communion with themselves
in their own Congregations also occasionally.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. They professe that they are ready to give
an account to such Parochiall Congregations,
<hi>as to Sister-Churches,</hi> whensoever they are
offended at any irregular administrations in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Independent Churches. 5. They esteem a
sentence of Non-Communion passed by such
Parochicall Congregations, is Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, upon any scandall wherein they
are unsatisfied, <hi>as a means to humble them,
and as an ordinance of God to reduce them.</hi>
Much more might be added: But it is clear
from these premises, that prudent and godly
Independents cannot conceive themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</p>

of the same things, and those the most

as doth appeare by those few tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions

2. Nor can they say, that they are enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to gather new Churches out of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches; for a circumstantiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
cannot be a sufficient ground for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of all ordinary Communion with true

of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
that I may open this Mystery of the single
Godhead in three distinct Subsistences, with
faith and prudence, perspicuity and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
I consider that the Godhead is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,

carnal expressions in a Treatise of this
nature.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102750:26"/>
of the Eternal Power and Godhead
is in part discovered by the works of God,
as hath been shewen in the first chapter;
but the Relative knowledge of God (I
speak of inward relations between the
three Subsistences) is not, nay cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

followes, that though Christ be a distinct
person, yet he is not a distinct God from
his Father, but one and the same God with
him, God blessed for ever. Much more
might be produced upon this argument:
That which hath been said, is abundantly
sufficient, if God set it home upon our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
by his own Spirit: but if men will not
be perswaded by these Scriptures, neither
would they be perswaded though one
should rise from the dead. In the next

Worship of the Holy Ghost.</p>

subsist in the Holy Ghost, who is God

ground to abstract a Divine Person from
the Divine Substance or Essence, because a

the Divine nature; as the humane nature
may be from an humane person; and
though a <hi>Praecisive abstraction</hi> doth not lay
any ground either for a <hi>Rational negation,</hi>

Persons, because it is spoken without any

particular person, as <hi>Iohn 4. 24. God is a
Spirit,</hi> Mat. 4. 10. Mat. 19. 17. <hi>There is
none good but God.</hi> These places must needs
be interpreted of <hi>all three Persons;</hi> for it is
certain, that <hi>Christ did not by these speeches
exclude himself or the Holy Spirit from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good, or being worshipped.</hi> And when
the Name of God is taken <hi>personally or
singularly</hi> in Scripture, we say <hi>it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of one Person by a Synechdoche, because
though the other Persons may be excluded
from what is proper and peculiar to any one
Person, because it is personal, and therefore
incommunicable, yet they cannot be excluded
from any thing that is essential, because the
same Divine essence is common to all.</hi> Now
the Title of God is essentiall; and what
hath been said of that, is true of all <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Titles</hi> and <hi>Attributes:</hi> but <hi>Personal
relations, properties, and actions, are all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar,</hi>
as we shall shew at large in the next
Chapter.</p>
            <p>All that I need inferre from hence for

from the three Persons; and when we describe
a Divine Person,</hi>

saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. that thanks shall be given
by <hi>many persons,</hi> he doth not mean many
<hi>personalities,</hi> but many humane singular
substances; thanks should be given by <hi>a

               <hi>Heb.

            <p>Jesus Christ hath two natures in one

we are prompted by the Spirit speaking in

<hi>The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three

               </note> and a Divine
Person, it is to be considered that I have
most studiously declined the describing of
a Divine Person <hi>in abstracto</hi> for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
mentioned above, and I might add
many others; but it is enough to say that

of God from the personalities, men are

neither Father, Son nor holy Ghost, and
so to create a new God, or to conceive that

            </p>
            <p>2. They who denie the Trinitie, must if
they be not worse then <hi>Turkes</hi> or <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
acknowledge,<note place="margin">The <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to state the point in question.</note> that <hi>God the Father
doth subsist,</hi> and therefore they are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to shew the difference between the
Essence and Subsistence of the Father, as
well as we are, who believe the Trinitie.
But there is no greater a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Person of the Father, and the
Nature of the holy Ghost, then there is
between the Person of the Father, and the
Nature of the Father; for the Nature of
the Father and the holy Ghost is <hi>one,</hi> and
the same Divine Nature, which is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be <hi>divided,</hi> or <hi>multiplied</hi> in <hi>two</hi>
or <hi>three</hi> Persons, as it is in <hi>one</hi> single and
undivided person, because the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is <hi>single</hi> and <hi>infinite,</hi> and the Divine
Persons do <hi>mutually</hi> subsist <hi>in one another,</hi>
and all three Persons subsist in this single

immultiplicable and most purely and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
one and the same infinite perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in all three Persons, and there can be
but one most single absolute and infinite
Perfection.</p>
            <p>3. The Divine Nature is subsistent, <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily</hi>
and <hi>perfectly</hi> subsistent; the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

4. The Divine Nature is not indifferent
to subsist <hi>in</hi> the Father,<note place="margin">Divina na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura salvâ omnimodâ perfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Dei non potest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quâ perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinarum.</note> Son and holy

<hi>infinite</hi> Perfection and <hi>actualitie</hi> it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
subsist <hi>without,</hi> or <hi>otherwise</hi> then <hi>in</hi> the
Father, Son and holy Ghost; because the
Divine Nature cannot subsist without all,
or any of that Relative perfection, which
shines in these three glorious persons, who
do all subsist in the same Divine Nature,
and yet mutually subsist in one another
with all Relative Perfection. The reason
is most clear, because the Divine Nature
being infinite in perfection must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and comprehend all Relative as well
as all absolute Perfection.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>God is not compounded</hi> (as Angels are)
<hi>of Nature and Subsistence;</hi> for whatsoever
doth belong to the Perfection of God,
doth belong to the Nature of God, and
therefore God doth not <hi>subsist</hi> by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradding
of any thing or <hi>manner of a
thing,</hi> any. <hi>Modus</hi> that is (as the Schooles
speak) <hi>Extraessential,</hi> or really distinct,
and separable from the Essence and Nature
of God. And we have formerly shewen,
that the Essence of God is <hi>intrinsecally

incomprehensible Mysterie, yet we may set
satisfactorie bounds to our thoughts and
discourses by the Analogy of faith; for the
Scripture saith that <hi>the Father and the Son
are one,</hi> and that <hi>all three Persons are one,</hi>
and therefore we do conclude that as the
<hi>infinite</hi> Perfection and <hi>Actualitie</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature doth require three Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences,
because this infinite Perfection
doth contain all Relative, as well as all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Perfection, so doth the <hi>single</hi> and
most singular Nature of God, require that
these <hi>three</hi> glorious Persons subsist in the
<hi>Vnitie</hi> of the Godhead. Now we are sure
that the <hi>One-nesse,</hi> or <hi>singlenesse</hi> of Gods
Nature doth well agree with the <hi>infinitness</hi>
of his Nature, because there can be no mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of that which is infinites; <hi>there
cannot be two or three infinites,</hi> and therfore
we must needs conclude, that these three
<hi>Subsistents</hi> are one infinite God <hi>subsisting</hi>
with all <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>Relative</hi> Perfection.
This is the Sum and Substance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all that
can be said <hi>a parte rei</hi> as we use to speak;
but because we are not able distinctly to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102750:69"/>
apprehend the absolute and Relative Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fefection
of God, God doth make himself
known to us in a way most suitable to our
weak apprehensions in representing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be an eternal Father, and then we
are ready to enquire after and willing to
heare of an eternal Son; Now according
to our weak manner of conceiving we
must needs apprehend that there is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Relation between the eternal Father
and his coeternal Son, and conclude that
these two are <hi>distinguished</hi> from, and in a
well qualified Sense <hi>opposed</hi> to, one another
<hi>with a mere Relative Opposition,</hi> for there
can be no <hi>contrarie Opposition</hi> between the
Persons; but this <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>friendly Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
assures us, that the Father is not the
Son, and that the Father did not beget
himself, but did beget his Son; But then
we consider again, that this Son is an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Son, and therefore is God, and we are
sure <hi>God did not beget another God,</hi> for the
<hi>Power of God</hi> is not nay cannot be exercised
about any thing repugnant to the <hi>Nature
of God,</hi> and nothing is more repugnant to
the Godhead then a Pluralitie of Gods;
and therefore we must conclude, that the
Father and Son are one, and the same
God; Now we are come to the Mysterie
which faith must receive, and reason ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
            <p>7. We may best resemble all that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102750:69"/>
which is between the Essence of God
and the Divine Subsistences, by considering
the <hi>transcendent Affections</hi> of <hi>Ens simpliciter</hi>
and the <hi>Attributes of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> who doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
transcend not only a Praedicamental
Substance, but a Metaphysical Entity, as
the most Metaphysical men who are sound
in the Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do honestly confesse.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning the <hi>transcendent Affections</hi>
of <hi>Ens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent affections of <hi>Ens.</hi>
               </note> which are <hi>unum, verum,</hi> &amp; <hi>bonum;</hi>
we say, these three affections, and <hi>Ens in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine,</hi>
do not make foure things really
distinct; and yet we say they are <hi>reall</hi> and
<hi>positive</hi> affections; for our Metaphysical
science hath too much serious Majesty, to
be pleased with the pretty fictions of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when our understanding hath got leave
to play, and recreate it self with its own
artificial inventions. The thing is most
cleare and evident to all at the very first
proposal, because the things which God
hath made, are not beholding to God only
for their Entity, and to us for their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
for the things do not cease to be
good, when our understanding ceaseth to
work; but the things are truly and really
good, whether we think them to be so,
or no.</p>
            <p>Moreover we say, that these Positive
and reall affections of <hi>Ens</hi> do not make
any composition at all in <hi>Ens</hi> transcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered, because then the most simple
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102750:70"/>
and uncompounded Being would lose its
Being. For <hi>Simplicity would be repugnant
to Entity, if that Entity it self did involve
any Composition.</hi> And therefore it is agreed
on all sides, that this proposition, <hi>Ens sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
est Ens,</hi> is a true proposition. Finally,
from what hath been said it is reasonably
and commonly inferred, That Entity,
Truth, Goodnesse, and Unity, make but
<hi>one</hi> Real thing, though they do all <hi>foure</hi>
differ <hi>quoad modum significandi;</hi> Because
the thing <hi>adaequately signified</hi> by all those
foure words is but one Real Thing, namely
the very Entity of <hi>Ens</hi> transcendently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
For when I say, <hi>Ens est unum,</hi>
this Praedicate <hi>Vnum</hi> doth not superadde
any new Entity, but doth imply and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
the very Entity of <hi>Ens.</hi> Nay more,
if you ask these Metaphysical men, what
this transcendent Unity is; they will not
answer, that <hi>Vnity is Indivision,</hi> but Unity
is the very undivided Entity it self; not
that Unity alone doth signifie simply and
adaequately the same that <hi>Ens</hi> doth <hi>in tota
latitudine,</hi> as <hi>Res</hi> or <hi>Aliquid</hi> do; for Unity
doth not signifie Truth and Goodnesse,
which are the two other transcendent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of <hi>Ens,</hi> but <hi>Ens</hi> in its complete
compasse and adaequate signification doth
import Entity, Truth, Unity, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
also. Truth is a single affection of
<hi>Ens,</hi> and therefore it doth signifie or rather
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102750:70"/>
connote Entity under an inadaequate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
or notion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it doth represent <hi>Ens</hi>
not in its full latitude, but as considered
with respect to the understanding. If we
may now make so bold as to compare the
<hi>Essence of Essences</hi> with these Metaphysical
notions, we may in some weak measure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
that difference which is between the
Essence of God and Divine Subsistences,
at least in some few particulars: For if
when we compare creatures with creatures,
there appear to be some dissimilitude even
in the most apt similitude, and <hi>no similitude
runs</hi> (as we say) <hi>upon four feet;</hi> it is not to
be wondered at, if this comparison be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>resemblance,</hi> then an <hi>illustration.</hi>
When Divine revelation hath gone before,<note place="margin">Rationes praeceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentes augent fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note>
and we have built upon that as the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
and foundation by a serious faith,
these Metaphysical notions may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
helps in a subordinate way.</p>
            <p>1. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
do all Three <hi>really, positively, truly</hi> subsist
in the Divine Essence; and yet these three
Subsistences, and the Divine Essence, do
not make <hi>four,</hi> no nor two <hi>things really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;</hi>
even as Entity, Truth, Goodnesse,
and Unity, do not make four things really
distinct, as you heard but now, but are one
reall thing and no more.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ens</hi> is not compounded of Entity,
and its three Affections; nor is God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102750:71"/>
of the Godhead and three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences;
nor is any one Person compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Divine Nature and Subsistence.</p>
            <p>3. As Truth is not Goodnesse, nor Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
Truth, nor either of them Unity, and
yet all three are Entity; so the Father is
not the Son, nor is the Son the Father, nor
is either of them the Holy Ghost, and yet
all three are God, for <hi>they are all three but
one God subsisting with all absolute and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
perfection,</hi> as hath been shewen.</p>
            <p>4. Every one of the three Affections of
<hi>Ens,</hi> doth connote Entity: Every one of
the three Subsistences doth connote the
Godhead, the Divine nature, as hath been
proved at large.</p>
            <p>5. Not any one of the three Affections
of <hi>Ens</hi> doth, nor do all three together su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-adde
a new Entity; not any one of
the three subsistences doth, nor do all three
together super-adde a new Deity, a new
Divine nature, or Godhead: For <hi>Ens</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ens est unum, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. Ens est essentiâ unicum, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem trinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, trinum &amp; unum, Ens trinunum.

et unum Ens trinunum: Deus est tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
non triplex, trinus et unus, Deus trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unus;</hi>
This instance doth in some measure
resemble the mystery of the Trinunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:102750:71"/>
6. No affection of <hi>Ens</hi> can be really se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from <hi>Ens:</hi> Nor can one of the
Divine Persons be separated from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, or the Divine Nature from
any one of the Divine Persons, or any one of
the Persons from either of the other two.</p>
            <p>7. All the Affections of <hi>Ens</hi> are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
but none divided: all the three
Subsistences are <hi>distinguished,</hi> but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>divided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Truth and Goodnesse which are two
of the Affections of <hi>Ens,</hi> are distinguished
by their severall and peculiar relations;
Truth hath relation to the understanding,
and Goodnesse to the will: The Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost are <hi>known</hi> to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by their severall and peculiar
relations; and if it be not unreasonable to
say that there is in Entity three affections,
and two relations <hi>in ente simplicissimo,</hi>
without any Composition in, or Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Entity, why should it seem
unreasonable, or at least why should it
seem incredible <hi>that there are three subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences
and severall relations in the Godhead,
without any composition in, or multiplication
of the Godhead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. One affection, nay all the affections
<hi>in abstracto,</hi> do but inadaequately represent
<hi>Ens,</hi> unlesse you take notice of the Entity
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102750:72"/>
it self, as well as the three Affections. One
single Subsistence, nay all three Subsistences
<hi>in abstracto,</hi> do but inadaequately represent
God, unlesse you take notice of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in which they subsist; and therefore
this <hi>praecisive abstraction of the Subsistences
from the Divine nature, is but an inadaequate
conceit of God,</hi> as hath been demonstrated

especially in English, but indeed the most
rich and copious languages are onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in the confession of their penury when
we come to treat of this argument,
because the mystery of the Godhead doth
transcend all our eloquence, and teaches
us to admire and adore with silence what
we cannot expresse without a manifest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of our ignorance.</p>
            <p>2. The imperfect manner of signifying is
easie to be observed in our most significant
words, and therefore we must confesse
that the Excellency of God doth transcend
the significancy of the most significant
words in the most rich and copious
tongues.</p>
            <p>3 The imperfection of our own<note n="i" place="margin">Paucae lectionis, nullius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis mancipia, intellectione satis mutilâ perfecton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

If any man desire to know

these divine Mysteries, let him consider the

if by Attributal Perfections you mean the

these Signs do indeed signifie the Divine
Essence, but the Signs themselves are so far
from being the Essence of God, that they
do not all of them <hi>signifie</hi> the <hi>same</hi> Divine

               </note> all the Attributes of God
are at least implicitely included within the
abstract Consideration of Divine Justice;
for Divine Justice is Essential Justice,
infinite Justice; God is just by his Essence,
not by any Virtue, or good qualitie; and
<hi>he that is just by his Essence, is perfectly just,
infinitely just;</hi> you see that infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is implyed, and <hi>infinite Perfection is
Essentially all Perfection,</hi> and therefore all
the other Attributes of God are implyed,
when I do consider one single Attribute
within an <hi>Abstraction purely praecisive;</hi> for
there is the same reason of all other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God; because God is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially

just.</p>
            <p>8. The Attributes which are called
<hi>Communicable Attributes,</hi> are as truly the
single and undivided Essence of God, as
those Attributes, which we call incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable;
for if we speak properly and
strictly, no attribute of God can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to a Creature, any more then

the Divine Essence it self, <hi>Isa. 42. 8.
Matth. 19. 17. 1. Tim.</hi> 1. 17. For all the
Attributes of God are his Name, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
his Glorie, his Essence, his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
and if any of the Attributes were
communicated, the Essence of God must
be multiplied, divided, or distracted from
it self; The communicable Attributes are
infinite, and there cannot be more infinites
then one, and therefore they must all si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
one single and infinite Perfection.
For if any of the Attributal Perfections
were finite, then the Perfection of God
would be made up of many<note n="b" place="margin">Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finita non est ex multis &amp; finitis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flata.</note> finite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;

one single infinite perfection, because the
Scripture speaks distinctly of God, and of
his several Attributes, only to teach us to
apprehend the <hi>impartible</hi> perfection of
God by <hi>degrees</hi> rather then <hi>parts,</hi> because
we cannot apprehend it altogether. <hi>Our

say that their meaning is that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
<hi>Formally,</hi> not <hi>Actually,</hi> but
<hi>Virtually</hi> and <hi>Eminently,</hi> and therefore
we meane the same thing. For the divine

            <p>But it will be said that the Attributes of
God have to our apprehension not only
<hi>different,</hi> but <hi>contrary</hi> effects: the Justice
of God doth <hi>punish,</hi> and the mercy of God
doth <hi>spare.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:102750:80"/>
The answer is easie:<note place="margin">The justice of God is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the mercy of God.</note> the Effects are to
our apprehension contrary, nay they are
contrary in themselves, but the Attributes
are not contrary; for the Attributes do
<hi>both</hi> belong to the same God, nay they are
the same God; and <hi>these Attributes do
not overthrow, but preserve one another.</hi> Now
we readily grant that the Effects are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different, nay contrary; but we deny
that the Attributes of Justice and Mercy
are really different, or contrary in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Finally, we grant, that according to our

yet if you take the termes <hi>in sensu i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentico,</hi>
the thing is true, because Mercy
and Justice are the same thing, the same
Essence. We may say that <hi>the same God,
the same Essence, which is mercy it selfe,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102750:81"/>
doth punish;</hi> but it is very improper and
absurd to say that <hi>God doth forgive by his

<hi>distinctly</hi> of his own: Attributes in his

will not give us leave to speak so
<hi>confusedly</hi> of his glorious Attributes, as to

and I might discourse in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
concerning <hi>the understanding and will</hi>
of God, concerning the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi>
of God, and enquire <hi>whether they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Essence of God?</hi> that so we
may the better understand the distinction
which is between the Divine Subsistences
and the Divine Essence, <hi>by comparing the
Divine Attributes, Acts, Decrees, Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences

Posse &amp; Operari,</hi> The Decrees and Acts of
God, his knowing, willing, &amp;c. are not
many in their owne <hi>Absolute nature,</hi> for
they are the Nature of God considered as
a pure and Vital Act; and hence it is that
we say <hi>the Decrees of God</hi> (in their Absolute
Nature, or as they are considered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Gods owne uncreated truth and

cease to be; <hi>God did not begin to know or

            <p>The Decrees of God upon this account,

            <p>It is evident by what hath been said
that <hi>the eminent Virtue of God</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
its several Objects, Egresses,
Terminations, Relations, Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Perfection.</hi> This will be the constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
and Conclusion of all sober debates,
and Christian discussions. For if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of God be not single, then it must
be compounded: but it cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
either of things that are finite, or
of things that are infinite; the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God cannot be compounded of
finite things, because it is infinite; for
<hi>many nay all finite things cannot make up
one infinite;</hi> and God cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of many infinite things, because
<hi>there can be but one thing thats infinite, and
that is God.</hi> And therefore since Gods
Perfection is his Essence, and his Essence
is single, uncompounded, undivided, indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
it must needs follow that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is in God, is God,</hi> and <hi>God is</hi> (as hath

            </p>
            <p>1. In respect of predication; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence is predicated of every Person,
because every one of the three Subsistences
is God, nay is the Divine Nature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with this or that Personal Propriety

is not predicated of another, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not the Son, nor is the Son the
Father, or the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>2. In respect of Communication, the
Divine Nature is not onely communicable
but communicated to all three Persons;
but it is of the Formal Reason of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be incommunicable.</p>
            <p>3. In respect of Relation. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature doth indeed <hi>eminently</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
all absolute and relative Perfection;
but the <hi>Formal</hi>

the Essence and Nature is. Peculiar and

            <p>4. In respect of Generation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession;
the Divine Essence doth not beget,
nor is it be gotten, it doth not proceed;
and yet the Father doth beget, the Son is
begotten, and the holy Ghost doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
the Person of Christ is begotten,
but his Divine Nature unbegotten.</p>
            <p>5, In respect of number; the Persons are
three, the Divine Nature most simply sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and singularly one.</p>
            <p>6. In respect of Order; there is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be observed amongst the Divine
Persons; the Father is the first Personal
Principle, the Son the second, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost who is breathed forth by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Son, is the third; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
saith there are three, and doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
reckon them in that Order; and
we have no ground to reckon the holy
Ghost before the Son because he proceeds
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102750:85"/>
from the Son; but the Divine Nature
being a <hi>single Vnitie, and the first Vnitie,
is as uncapable of Order as it is of Number.</hi>

singularly considered: for a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

in any other or any fewer then these

God; And therefore the Divine Nature
doth not differ really from the Persons,

God must be agreeable to that Divine
<hi>Revelation,</hi> which God hath vouchsafed
us of himself in Scripture. Now it is
most clear and evident, by what hath been

Scriptures teach us to conceive distinctly
of some things in God, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
distinguished in him.</hi> And therefore
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fry</hi> may do well to consider, and
retract that rash Censure which he passes
upon this Doctrine of God, when he saith
that <hi>the Doctrine of three distinct Persons
or Subsistences in the Godhead is a chaffie,
grosse, Carnal and absurd Opinion,</hi> in the
Title and 22. page of his blasphemous
book; For this distinction is not onely

            <p>XIII. The Distinction between the
Divine Nature and Persons is an <hi>Eminent
distinction;</hi> I have told you above, what we
mean by that expression. The Persons are
the Essence of God, and not any thing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
or divided from it; every one of
the three Persons is a Person of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
nay every one of the three Persons
is the Godhead considered with some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
property and relation; and the
Godhead being absolutely single, we must
conclude that the Divine Nature and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Person is <hi>the same Essentiall Reall
thing,</hi> though they are <hi>Eminently</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by sundry considerations, as hath
been shewen.</p>
            <p>But it is objected that every one of the
three Persons is a Substance,<note place="margin">The grand objection.</note> and if there be
three substances subsisting in the Godhead
under sundry Formal considerations, then
there will be three Divine Substances, three
Substantial Relations and Properties, and
therefore the Godhead will be <hi>compounded</hi>
by these three Substances, substantial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
and relations, or else there will be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102750:87"/>
               <hi>three substantiall and formall Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this grand objection, I make these
few returns by way of answer.</p>
            <p>1. Every one of the three Persons is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
a Divine Substance,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> but they are the
same <hi>Divine Substance,</hi> because they are
the same God: <hi>these three are one,</hi> they are
<hi>unum,</hi> one divine substance, one God; they
are all three divine Persons, but they are
<hi>Coessentiall</hi> Persons, and<note n="u" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Inessentiall</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the same Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. <hi>The peculiar relations do distinguish,
but they do not compound,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peculiar Relations do destin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</note> 
               <hi>for they do not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
add any new Entity, much lesse any new
Godhead,</hi> because all these relations are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
eternal, and therefore they are God;
Absolute and Relative perfection in God,
are but one single perfection.</p>
            <p>1. The parts or extremes wherewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing is compounded must be <hi>really,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Compositiô described by its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites.</note> or
at least <hi>Modally and Separably</hi> distinct; for
all created Natures and Persons being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
are not only Modally, but sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
distinct.</p>
            <p>2. The parts compounding must be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some<note n="x" place="margin">Quae actuex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ rei di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguuntur, non possunt inter se uniri nisi per actionem causae efficientis: nulla autem causa essiciens prior Deo est; ergo.</note> efficient cause, and one of
the parts must be a <hi>meere</hi> power or passive
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102750:87"/>
potentiality, that is capable of farther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and the other an Act to make

            <p>3. There must be by vertue of this union
and perfection some dependance, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and change. Now it is clear that
the nature of God in which the persons
subsist is not capable of these imperfections;
for,</p>
            <p>1. There are no compounding parts in

VI. This Argument will be best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by shewing the vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
created and uncreated persons, and
I have with a great deale of patience wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
through all these perplex disputes, that
I might make way for the clearing of this
grand Mystery, and glad I am that I am
now got within sight of it, though <hi>I have
had as hard a passage as</hi> Hanibal <hi>had over or

            <p>II. Concerning the difference between
created and uncreated persons,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and uncreated Persons.</note> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that</p>
            <p>1. All created persons have a finite and
dependent Nature.</p>
            <p>2. They have a Compounded Nature.</p>
            <p>3. They have a different Nature.<note place="margin">7. Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4. They have a different understanding,
will, power.</p>
            <p>5. They have a different place and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>6. They have different Accidents, and
are distinguished by an heap of Accidents.</p>
            <p>7. Humane Persons with whom we are
best acquainted, may differ in time also;
one humane person may subsist a long time
after another is dissolved.</p>
            <p>Having laid down these Positions, let us
now make the comparison, and observe
the difference between created and uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:102750:90"/>
1. All created persons have a finite and
dependent Nature,<note place="margin">1. The infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite Nature of uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Persons.</note> but the nature of all
uncreated persons is Independent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
<hi>this one difference is an infinite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and uncreated Persons is Infinite.</note>
and surely if there were no other
difference, that wonld suffice to discover
and overthrow all the Arguments of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians
and Familists. I do often admire
that the acute Socinians who pretend to be
wholly ruled by reason, should have no
more reason in them then to argue after
this absurd manner. Three humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are thus and thus distinguished, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
if there be three divine persons, they
must be thus and thus distinguished also,
even just as humane persons are. Is not
this a grosse fallacy<note n="k" place="margin">Vide <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian,</hi> orat. de Spiritu Sancto. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>masc.</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. sid. lib. 3. c. 5. <hi>Athanas.

and infinite<note n="l" place="margin">Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est personas coessentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les &amp; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas ad creatarum quae finitae &amp; diversae essentiae sunt modulum redigere.</note> inaequality? <hi>if the divine
persons must be called into question, let them
be tryed by their Peeres.</hi> They say they
cannot comprehend this Mystery; I say
the reason is because it is a Mystery; and
if they cannot comprehend it, they may
the better beleeve it to be incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The single Nature of these three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
is infinite, and <hi>if men wonder that they
cannot comprehend what is infinite, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not consider that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are finite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The nature of these three glorious
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102750:91"/>
subsistences is Independent; the nature of
all created subsistences is dependent<note n="m" place="margin">Natura creata est depende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; persona creata est Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, quia non est in alio per de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pendenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ab illo tanquam susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante.</note>, and
therefore it is no wonder if a dependent
nature do subsist in its proper person, and
depend upon its proper person for susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
but <hi>the divine Nature doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the three subsistences for its susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or subsistence;</hi> but all three persons
do subsist in this Independent and infinite
Nature. <hi>Philip. 2. 6. subsisting in the Nature
of God;</hi> so the Scripture expresses it, and
we must apprehend and beleeve these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mysteries according to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
because no man hath seene God, and
<hi>God is the only all-sufficient Witnesse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his owne essence and subsistence,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe; and therefore we must not
think or speak otherwise of God then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures of truth, in
which God hath sufficiently and graciously
revealed himself, <hi>Iohn 1. 18. Matth. 16. 17.
Matth.</hi> 11. 26, 27. The Scriptures direct
us how to distinguish uncreated persons
from created persons. <hi>Our finite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Nature doth subsist in a created per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but uncreated persons do subsist in an
Infinite and Independent Nature;</hi> there is
a manifest difference. Our nature indeed
doth subsist in the divine and uncreated
person of the Son of God, but that is not
according to the common course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there is a peculiar reason and another
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102750:91"/>
Mystery in that wonderful subsistence; And
yet even in that wonderfull Mystery <hi>our
dependent Nature doth subsist in a person,</hi>

is more satisfied and quieted by subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
in a divine, then in an humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because it hath a more glorious susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and is more powerfully upheld by
that divine and uncreated person. <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
person of Christ doth subsist in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, and the humane Nature of
Christ doth subsist in his divine and onely
person.</hi>

            <p>III. All created persons have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and divisible nature,<note place="margin">The third difference.</note> but uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
persons have a single undivided and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible
nature. The <hi>Socinians, Arminians</hi>
and <hi>Vorstians</hi> of this age do not love to
hear any discourse of the single Nature of
God, in Father, Son and Holy Ghost; this
Doctrine, they say, is Philosophical, Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastical,
Metaphysical, and therefore there
is nothing which concernes Faith, Piety,
or manners in it.</p>
            <p>But it is most clear and evident that all
the glorious Attributes of God are united
by an Eternal bond which cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and we have invincibly proved,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102750:92"/>
that they do all signifie but one single and
infinite perfection. <hi>If you take away the
singlenesse of Gods being, you take away his

it is impossible, say they, that these three

Son <hi>as he is God the Father,</hi> as he is the
first personall principle, and not simply
and absolutely <hi>as he is God;</hi> But <hi>the Son hath
not power to beget himselfe, or to beget a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi>
Son, because there can be but three
divine Persons, and there is but one of the
three called a Son in Scripture. Moreover,
the Son is begotten, and therfore his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is rather a Passive then an Active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
But the power of the Father whereby
he did beget his Son is an Active power.
Nor did the Holy Ghost breath forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by his owne power, for he did not
proceed from himselfe, but from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son; and therefore though
there be but <hi>one Essentiall power,</hi> it should

            <p>1. We do not equivocate in this or any

that God the Father doth beget a Son <hi>as

many Reverend Doctours of the Church
conclude, that Angels are eternall only <hi>à

not by their <hi>own nature,</hi> but by the <hi>free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>

there is an infinite difference between
the duration of these three uncreated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the duration of the most glorious
Angels in Heaven. Angels are<note n="y" place="margin">Unum est pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, alia dependent igitur.

<hi>God is free Agent both in respect of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in respect of preservation;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and Angels are not Coeternall
as the Peripateticks dreamt. God did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
engage himself to create and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Angels by his own Decree; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that subordinate aeternity which they

by the free and undeserved favour of God.

<hi>there are many actions of the soule of man,

            <p>The nine differences which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on are all considerable. And from
them all we may safely conclude that the
word <hi>Subsistence</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> cannot be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
after the same maner to God, Angels
and men. A divine Person is a Spirituall
and Infinite Subsistent, which must not be
considered as abstracted from, but as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in the Divine Nature, and as related
to those other Coessentiall persons, from
which he is sufficiently distinguished by
some Personall and Incommunicable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;
And therefore Subsistence is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to God after the most excellent and
glorious manner. A <hi>Person</hi> signifies the
most excellent kind of Subsistent, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
subsistent, as hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en;
but then an uncreated person, a divine
person doth infinitely excell and transcend
the person of the most glorious Angel in
Heaven; and therefore we must remove all
those imperfections from our thoughts,
which are in created persons, when we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
or discouse of these divine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
persons, that we may think and

The Scripture saith there is but one

is between these three divine and uncreated
Persons.</p>
            <p>1. These divine and uncreated Persons

            <p>2. These uncreated Persons were truly
distinguished from one another before
there was any Scripture, any world; for
the Coexistencie and distinction of these

this distinction cannot be grounded upon
the mere phrase of Scripture; it is the true
intent of God in severall plain expressions
of Scripture, to declare unto us the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

can there be more expresse or cleare? The
Scripture teaches us to reckon right, and
we see the divine Persons are reckoned
three in Number: <hi>One Person is not another,</hi>
there are diverse Persons, there are three
Persons, the <hi>number numbred,</hi> the Persons
numbred are named by their distinct and
proper names, the <hi>number numbring</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
set down in sacred Records. We
are not more exact in any accounts then
we are in reckoning of witnesses, whose
testimony is produced in a businesse of
great consequence, and high concernment.</p>
            <p>Now in the great question about the
Messiah, witnesses are produced to assure
us, that <hi>Iesus Christ the Son of the Virgin,
and the only begotten Son of God, is the true
Messiah, the only all-sufficient Saviour of
his people from their sins.</hi> And there are
three Witnesses named and produced for
the proof of this weighty point.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>one Person that hath three names,</hi>
or <hi>two Persons, and an Attribute</hi> of one or
both Persons cannot passe for <hi>three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
in any fair and reasonable account;
<hi>we are sure God reckons right,</hi> and he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Father, Son and Holy Ghost for three
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102750:111"/>
Witnesses, and he doth not reckon these
three and the Godhead for foure (as they
do who dream of a <hi>Quaternity)</hi> because
these three are one and the same God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for ever. Let us then be exact in <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,</hi>
since the Holy Ghost is so exact in
<hi>making</hi> of the account. In the eighth of
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Pharisees object that our Saviour
did bear record of himself, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from thence that therefore his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
was not true,<note place="margin">John 8. 13</note> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 13. Our Saviour
answers in the next verse.<note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> 
               <hi>Though I beare

It is most clear and evident by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
that our blessed Lord did make a
fair legall just account; for he cites the
Law concerning the validity of a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
given in by two witnesses; and then
he reckons his Father for one witnesse, and
himself for another. I am one saith he,
and my Father is <hi>Another;</hi> I and my Father
make two sufficient Witnesses in a just and
legall account. There is <hi>Another</hi> (saith
he) that beareth witnesse of me,<note place="margin">John 5. 32</note> and I

Iohn</hi> 10. 30. Christ and his Father are one
God, but Christ and his Father are two
distinct Persons, for they are reckoned as
two distinct witnesses; and one Person must
not be reckoned for two witnesses. There
is <hi>Another</hi> that bears witnesse,<note place="margin">John 5. 32. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 32.
and the Father <hi>himself, v.</hi> 37. bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of me. Well then, Christ is one
witness, the Father is another, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost is a third witness, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 7. we
see <hi>the Holy Ghost speaks as plainly in this
point as we do when we teach a child to tell
one, two, and three.</hi> For there are <hi>three</hi> that
bear record in Heaven, <hi>the Father, the
Word and the Holy Ghost:</hi> and these <hi>three</hi>
are one. If we peruse the Scriptures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
as we ought, we shall finde that
these Witnesses are three Persons, who are
one and the same blessed God. They are
one in nature, though three in subsistence,
to shew that these three Persons are not to
be reckoned as three men are, who have
three distinct singular natures really divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and separated; for these three glorious
Persons subsist in one another, and have
one and the same single undivided and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible

communicated to him, as shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>the name of Son is not an empty Title, he hath
the divine nature of his Father in him.</hi> Now
that he is the Son of God, is testifyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and again, saith the Apostle, <hi>verse</hi> 5.
And he begins the sixth verse thus, And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
&amp;c. You see how he doth inculcate
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102750:114"/>
this point, how he beates upon it again
and againe; and the reason is, because
<hi>this truth is Fundamentall both of Faith and
Worship,</hi> as is most evident in the sixth verse
of that chapter. <hi>And again when he brings
in the first-begotten into the world, he saith,
And let all the Angels of God worship him,</hi>
Hebr. 1. 6.</p>
               <p>You see this Mystery of the unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Father, and the only begotten Son is
held forth to men and Angels in order to
worship that their worship may be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Jesus Christ <hi>as the Son of the living God,</hi>
and to God the Father, <hi>as the Father of our
Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> God declared this
truth after a glorious manner from heaven,
that it might be more diligently consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 17.</note>

but <hi>declarative,</hi> and <hi>demonstrative</hi>
in that place, for it doth declare to us that
the glory of Christ is agreeable to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, he being the only naturall Son
of God, because he is the only begotten
Son of God; just as if when we see a King
sitting in his Royall robes on his Throne,
with a Crowne on his head and a Scepter
in his hand, we should say now we see him
as a King, that is, now he is like himselfe.
<hi>his state is agreeable to his Majesty;</hi> even
so was the glory of Christ which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
beheld agreeable to the majesty of
the only begotten Son of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14.
and therfore the word [As] was not insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the glory of the only begoten Son of God;
for the word [As] is left out in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.

with several expressions to the same
purpose. But we are specially to observe
that <hi>the only begotten Son of God is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us as the object of saving Faith,</hi> and
therefore this point ought to be diligently

the first begotten, and the only begotten
Son of God, the naturall and proper Son
of God; for he is as the Father is, God by
<hi>nature, Gal.</hi> 4. 8. and therefore <hi>naturally,
necessarily,</hi> eternally begotten of the Father
in the unity of the Godhead; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is more then a <hi>graduall,</hi> nay
more then a <hi>specificall</hi> or <hi>genericall</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between this and all other sonnes of
God; we see by all these various expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and by those divine and glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
which are ascribed to Christ in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that God hath wonderfully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his love to us in sending his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to redeeme us according to that
of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 9. In this was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the love of God towards us, because
that God sent his only begotten Son into the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102750:119"/>
world that we might live through him.</hi> When
our Saviour called God his Father, the
Iewes did very well understand that he
meant it in a <hi>proper</hi> and peculiar sense,
and therefore told him that he did make
himself <hi>equall with God,</hi> Iohn 5. 17. 18. and
that being but a man <hi>he made himself God,
Iohn</hi> 10. 33. And though the Jewes accused
him of blasphemy, and endeavoured to
stone him as they pretended for his
blasphemy, yet our Saviour doth not
excuse his speech, or say he meant it in
a <hi>Metaphoricall sense,</hi> but doth defend it
by many arguments both in the fifth and
in the tenth chapters of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> though
he did thereby endanger his life; he saith he
is <hi>equall</hi> to the Father, nay <hi>one</hi> with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Iohn 5. 18. Iohn</hi> 10. 30. and when the
High Priest asked him whether he was <hi>the
Son of the blessed,</hi> Mark 14. 61. our Saviour
answers; I <hi>am:</hi> there's a punctuall and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
affirmation of it, <hi>v.</hi> 62, 63. and you
may easily know in what sense the High
Priest meant it, by his renting of his
clothes, and condemning our Saviour to
death for blasphemy, <hi>v.</hi> 64. And yet our
Saviour did not endeavour to allay their
heat and rage with any retractation; he
would not say that he spake Metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for he spake properly, he meant that he
was the proper and naturall Son of God,
who had the same nature and power with
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102750:119"/>
the Father, and therefore was able to do,
and actually did the same works with his
Father. And the Iewes did understand him
so, and therefore urged the Law against
him, and condemned him to death for
blasphemy, <hi>Iohn 19. 7. The Iews answered
him, We have a Law, and by our Law he
ought to die, because he made himself the Son
of God.</hi> Mark the reason, <hi>because he made
himself the Son of God;</hi> If our Saviour had
not meant that he was the proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Son of God, a Son equall to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; one God with the Father, the Iews
would not have accused him of blasphemy.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Iewes do generally hold
that those words of the second Psalme,<note place="margin">Magistri nostri quicquid hoc Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo canitur de rege Messia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretati sunt: sed secundum verborum sonum, &amp; ob refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem <hi>hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticorum</hi> convenit, ut eum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murde ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Davide, Heb. bib. mag. cum com.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102750:120"/>
is (as they conceive) the Conception
of Christ by the Holy Ghost, whereby
(say they) Christ is said to be begotten of
God in an excellent and peculiar way; and
they urge that testimony of the Angel,
which stands upon Record, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35,
to make good their conceit; <hi>And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
answered, and said unto her: The holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
also that holy thing which shall be borne of
thee shall be called the Son of God.</hi> These
words of the Angel have reference to the
prophesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> mentioned in the 31.
verse of this first of <hi>Luke.</hi> The words of
<hi>Isaiah</hi> are, <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive
and beare a Son, and shall call his name Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
Isaiah 7. 14. they shall call his name <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
Matth. 1. 21. he shall be called the <hi>Son
of the highest,</hi> the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. You
see the words are different, and therefore
we must have speciall respect to the thing
signified. Observe then</p>
               <p>1. That the Prophet did foretell two
particulars.</p>
               <p>First, that a Virgin should bear a Son.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Son born of her
should be called the Son of God. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
doubts of the first particular, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
how that could be without the
knowledge of a man? The Angel informs
her, that she should conceive after a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102750:121"/>
and admirable manner by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowing
of the Holy Ghost; and from
thence infers the second particular, that
she should bring forth a Son, who was to
be called the Son of God; and he gives
the very same reason which was given by
Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> because it was so foretold
by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Matth, 1. 20, 21, 22.
for the particle [Therefore] <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. is
not to be referred to the conception of
Christ <hi>as the Cause of this divine sonship,</hi>
but to the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> recorded
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 31. for <hi>all this was done that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet</hi>
Matth. 1. 22.</p>
               <p>2. They shall call his name <hi>Immanuel,
God with us,</hi> and therefore <hi>he,</hi> the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
shall be called the Son of God; this is
an higher reason then that which the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
alleage.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Socinians</hi> put a Fallacy upon us
by assigning that to be the Cause which is
not the <hi>true</hi> Cause,<note place="margin">Fallacia non causae, quum non causa pro causâ po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur.</note> [he shall be called] that
is <hi>declared</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> to be the Son
of God. This Declaration or <hi>manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the Son of God in the flesh was <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,</hi>
1 Tim. 3. 16. but his <hi>generation</hi> was
<hi>eternall,</hi> Micah 5. 2. The Son of God was
sent, manifested, incarnate, <hi>in the fulnesse of
time,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. but he was the Son of God
before his Incarnation, and therefore his
Incarnation is not the cause of his <hi>divine</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:102750:121"/>
sonship, the effect cannot be before the
cause, but the <hi>divine</hi> sonship of Christ was
before the world was. The Holy Ghost
is never called the Father of Christ, and he
could not be the <hi>principle</hi> of the subsistence
or the <hi>Word,</hi> and therefore not the Cause
of this <hi>divine</hi> sonship. The Apostle states
the point, and puts it past all dispute, <hi>Rom.
1. 3, 4. Christ was made of the seed of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<hi>according to the flesh, but determined
and declared to be the Son of God with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
according to the spirit of holinesse by the

it followes directly that Christ is not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
the Son of God according to the flesh,
but is in that consideration rather to be
called the Son of <hi>David</hi> as we observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
because Christ came of <hi>David as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the flesh;</hi> but <hi>the eternall Son of God,

the Jewes said that our Saviour blasphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

be no blasphemy for me to say that I am the
Son of God, it is no blasphemy at all to say
that I am God, because the divine nature is

Christ is called the Son of God, because
the divine nature was communicated to

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. The second cause assigned by the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
why Christ is called the Son of God,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond false cause. John 10. 35. 36. explained and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note>
is the <hi>sanctification</hi> of Christ, for which

an <hi>excellent</hi> portion of the Spirit,
he is sanctified and sent with <hi>a divine</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
into the world to save mankind.</p>
               <p>To which we answer, that here is the
same fallacy obtruded again, because
1. Christ was the Son of God before he
was sent into the world. 2. God did not
give the spirit by measure to him, <hi>Iohn 3.
34.</hi> 3. Christ proves in that tenth chapter
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he is <hi>one</hi> with his Father in
<hi>power,</hi> and therefore <hi>in nature,</hi> as appears</p>
               <p>1. Because he doth the same works that

in regard of their Commission and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
much more might he call himself

satisfie the justice of God, and save the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of God, <hi>which he could not have done
if he had not had the Nature of God, and
been thereby fully enabled to perfect this
work of God.</hi> The Argument is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the infinite distance, and imparity
between <hi>the office of a Mediatour,</hi> and the
office of a Magistrate; between the only

men who are but the Deputies of God.</p>

eyes did discern it, <hi>Iohn 1. 14. we
have</hi> seen, and <hi>beheld the glory of the only

that the Apostle endeavours to
make the mystery of Christs divine son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
manifest in the thirteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
not simply by his Resurrection, but by the
<hi>manner</hi> of his Resurrection, and the <hi>state</hi>
whereunto he was raised.</p>
               <p>1. For the manner, he was raised by his
own Almighty and most glorious power
in an irresistible way; he did offer violence
to all the forces of death and powers of
the grave, because <hi>it was not possible that
he should be holden of them,</hi> Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 24.
when he came to declare himself to be the
Son of God <hi>with power,</hi> Rom. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>2 For the state whereunto he was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he did not rise to return to the grave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, but he raised himself
to an immortall life. And as concerning
that he raised him up from the dead, now
no more to return to corruption, <hi>Acts 13.
34. Rom.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p>Now, God by raising Christ after such
a manner, to such a state, did declare him
to be his only begotten Son, of whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
speaks in the second Psalm, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was evident by the Resurrection of
Christ, that God had fulfilled his promise
by sending his only begotten Son to be a
Saviour unto <hi>Israel,</hi> that we might have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102750:124"/>
forgivenesse of sins and <hi>all sure mercies</hi>
by him who died for our sins, and <hi>rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for our justification;</hi> this is the scope
of the Apostles discourse in the thirteenth
of the <hi>Acts</hi> from the 23 verse to the 39·
The second Psalm is cited here by <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation</hi>
to make good a remote and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
consequence; as those words, <hi>I am
the God of Abraham, Isaac, &amp;c.</hi> are cited
to prove a resurrection by an Implicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 31, 32. Thou art my
Son, <hi>mine owne</hi> proper Son, whom I own
for my only begotten Son by raising thee
to a never dying life.</p>
               <p>The fifth Cause which they assigne,<note place="margin">The fifth false cause.</note> is
the Exaltation of our Lord and Saviour to
glory, and the conferring of a Name
and Power upon him above all creatures;
for the Apostle, as they conceive, speaks
of this sonship, <hi>Hebr. 5. 5. So also Christ
glorified not himself to be made an High
Priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art
my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but admire that the acute Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
should cite every place where the
second Psalm is named, to prove that there
are so many severall causes of the <hi>divine</hi>
sonship of Christ; but I do more admire
that they should cite this Text of all the
rest; for if their fifth argument have any
force in it, doth overthrow and disprove
their four first arguments. If Christ was
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102750:124"/>
not begotten before his exaltation to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
then he was not the Son of God before
his exaltation; for surely these men of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
will easily grant <hi>that the effect cannot
be before its proper and complete cause was in
its causall actuality, or actuall causality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of God in the second Psalm
are so often repeated, to teach us to keep
our eye constantly fixed upon the divine
sonship of Christ when ever we discourse
of his conception, birth, resurrection, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration,
exaltation to glory, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that <hi>the self-same person who was
begotten of God from the dayes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
took our flesh, dyed for our sins, and
rose for our justification;</hi> for this is that
great and fundamentall truth which
runs quite thorow the Gospel, <hi>That the
Son of Mary who did and suffered all for
us, is the proper, the naturall Son of God,
the only and All-sufficient Saviour of his
people from their sins.</hi> We must not part
with this truth, for <hi>this is all our salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was very proper for the Apostle to
speak of his <hi>divine</hi> sonship when ever he
spake of him as a Mediatour, as a Priest, &amp;c.
because <hi>he could not have undertaken or gone
thorow with any such office unlesse he had
been the Naturall and Proper Son of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to God;</hi> and therefore we do readily
grant, that <hi>the divine offices of Christ do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and make manifest the divine sonship,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102750:125"/>
and nature of Iesus Christ,</hi> and this truth is
most evident from the connexion of the
seven and eight verses of the second Psalm.</p>
               <p>I have with the more patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
waded thorow this large and deep
sea that I might come to the haven, where
we desire to be; That we might come to
take harbour and sanctuary in the merit
and satisfaction of Jesus Christ, who is the
naturall and proper Son of God.</p>
               <p>In the next place I am to prove the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
procession of the Holy Ghost,
whereby I shall make the distinction of the
Persons more cleare and evident, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hasten to the discussing of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious,

<hi>necessarily,</hi> because eternally there was a

both,</hi> and yet <hi>in both;</hi> for one divine person
cannot subsist out of another, but all three
subsist in the same undivided and infinite
nature.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us that the Holy
Ghost is nothing else but the power and
vertue of God the Father.<note place="margin">In what sense the <hi>H. Ghost</hi> is the vertue and power of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>To which we answer. That the Spirit
is the natural vertue of the Father no more
then he is the naturall vertue of the Son, or
of himself; for the vertue of God is the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God; the Holy Ghost is his own
essence, and all three persons have one and
the same essence; The Holy Ghost who
proceedeth from the Father, is called the
Power of the Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. because
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102750:126"/>
                  <hi>the spirit works as he proceeds in order; the
Father works in the Son and by the Spirit.</hi>
But the Spirit who proceeds from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is distinguished from the Father; the
Spirit did not breath forth himself, or
proceed from himself. The H. Ghost doth
not speak <hi>of himself,</hi> John 16. 13. but the
Father speaks of himself, because he is
of himself, he is begotten of none, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from none of the divine persons, is
sent by none of them. The holy Ghost
doth receive of Christ, is sent by Christ;
therefore the Holy Ghost is not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Jesus Christ is called the Power of God,

of God, <hi>Luke 1. 35, Luke</hi> 24, 49. The

and <hi>the Holy Ghost is</hi> as the Ancients used

of the Father proceeding from the Father, by
whom he doth declare and put forth his
power;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> and therefore the Spirit is said to
work and distrioute all gifts and graces as
he will; Father, Son and Holy Ghost have

one and the same Will and Power; still
we must bottome upon that truth, <hi>These
three are one,</hi> 1 John 5. 7. That this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Holy Ghost is mysterious,
and for the manner of it unsearchable we
do readily grant; and therefore I shall not
presume to define after what manner the
Holy Ghost is breathed forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son; but we are sure that it
cannot be any corporeall procession. The
Ancients did constantly distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Procession and Generation; but the

The more perfect and spirituall this
procession is, the more evident it is that
the Spirit was breathed forth in the unity
of the Godhead. They who say the Son
doth proceed from the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> use that

2. They say the Son did proceed from the
Father alone,<note place="margin">2. The Principle.</note> and therefore is aid to be

sent by the Son as well as the Father, <hi>Luke

                  <hi>If you oppose the will of
God to the nature of God,</hi> we cannot say that
the Spirit doth proceed from the Father
and the Son <hi>by their will</hi> but by <hi>their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
because the Father, Son and Spirit
are Coessentiall; for <hi>as the Father did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his Naturall Son by his Nature, so do
the Father and the Son breath forth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essentiall
Spirit by their nature;</hi> nor is it safe
to say, saith <hi>Iunius,</hi> that the nature of the
Father doth breath forth the Spirit <hi>by an
action of his will,</hi> but rather according to
that manner (the infinite distance being
observed between what is humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine)
after which the will doth proceed in
man: and this saith he is but a weak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102750:129"/>
of the Schools, which we are
not bound to defend. For the Nature of
God is pure, single, infinite, and therefore
we must not follow those resemblances
too farre which are grounded upon the
distinction of the understanding and the
will in creatures, because even that point
is very disputable, and the most single and
perfect nature of God doth infinitely
transcend the perfection of Angels. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
you are, as I am, willing to get out
of the dark. But enough of that, for we
read that the Saints are begotten by the
will of God, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 18. But we must not
conceive that Christ is begotten, or the
Spirit breathed forth after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as we are regenerated: the Spirit is
breathed forth in a <hi>Connaturall</hi> and <hi>Coes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall</hi>
way in the unity of the single and
entire Godhead; but we are regenerated
by the graces of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The spirit doth proceed equally from the
Father and the Son;</hi> for the unity of the
divine nature, and equality of divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
cannot be maintained if that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be denyed. <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
did mince the point with a very
dangerous distinction: that the Spirit doth
proceed <hi>principally</hi> from the Father, and
lesse principally from the Son. But it is
clear &amp; evident that the Holy Ghost being
a Coessential person hath the self-same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102750:130"/>
nature and essence entirely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
unto him which is in the Father
and the Son, without any <hi>Alienation</hi> of it
from them, or <hi>Multiplication</hi> of it in him;
and therefore the Spirit doth not proceed
from the Father and Son as they stand in
<hi>Relative opposition,</hi> but as they are essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and <hi>naturally one;</hi> and therefore the
Spirit did proceed from both equally, <hi>aequè
primò ac per se,</hi> as we use to say. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
doth receive from Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 14,
15. but the Spirit being God could not
receive any thing but <hi>subsistence</hi> from the
Father or the Son. The Spirit doth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the Son, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 14. no otherwise
then the Son <hi>as God</hi> doth glorifie the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
because the Son did receive his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
from the Father as the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
his subsistence from the Father and
the Son.</p>
               <p>We must carefully distinguish 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the generation of the Son, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the holy Spirit, though as we
have shewen above, the Son doth proceed,
if you take that word in a <hi>general</hi> notion.
The most exact Criticks wil not take upon
them to distinguish between <gap reason="foreign">

<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Yet because we want words
to expresse our selves, the reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church thought fit to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
Procession to the Holy Ghost for
distinction sake; and the Scripture saith
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102750:130"/>
that Christ is the only begotten Son of
God; God the Father is never called the
Father of the H. Ghost; nor is the H. Ghost
called the Son of God. Moreover, the
Schoolmen have given advantage to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Trinity by discoursing of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Processions at large in a generall noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and for these reasons I did endeavorto
distinguish the Procession of the Son from
the Spirit in this Chapter, in respect of the
Manner, Principle, and order of Procession.</p>
               <p>2. We must carefully distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Eternall Procession of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the Temporal Mission of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
but the Natural and Eternal Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Spirit may be evinced by the
Temporal Mission of the Spirit. The Greek
Church doth acknowledge, 1. that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost is God; and 2. that he is one
and the same God with the Father and the
Son; and from hence we infer,</p>
               <p>1. That the Son did not send the Spirit
by way of Command as if he were greater
then the Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. That the Son did not send the Spirit
by way of Counsel and Advice, as if he
were wiser then the Spirit; and therefore
the only reason why he did Temporally
send him, is, because the Spirit did Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and Eternally proceed from him, and
receive his glorious subsistence of him. I
might discourse more largely upon this

the Spirit did proceed <hi>eternally, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
unspeakably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those places of Scripture which are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of God in the Old Testament are
said to be spoken of the Son, and the Spirit
in the New Testament, and therefore do
by consent of both Testaments, declare
that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are
one and the same God; for instance, The
sixth of <hi>Isaiah</hi> is spoken of Jehovah, the
God of Israel, whom the Mahumetans, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians
and Arrians do acknowledge to be
the true God, but this is spoken of Christ
saith Saint <hi>Iohn, chap.</hi> 12. 41. These things

I will not take upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

though there be something hinted
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102750:133"/>
which may amount to a <hi>videtur quod sic</hi>
in the behalf of the lesse common opinion
in the 142<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>age</hi> of this book: and it is clear
that all three Persons are nothing else but
the Godhead considered with all abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and Relative perfection, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it safest to wave that point, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with that learned divine, <hi>Nos fidelem
ignorantiae professionem temerariae assertio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
praeferendam judicamus.</hi> Whether then
this self-subsistence be Absolute or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
it is enough for our present purpose
to prove that the first Person of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is distinguished by his self-subsistence
from the blessed Son and holy Spirit. The
self-subsistence of the Father is Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable,
<hi>It is proper and peculiar to the first
Person to have subsistence from none but
himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be the first Personal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
which gives subsistence to the other
two coessentiall and coequall persons.</hi> The
Son receives subsistence from the Father,
the Spirit receives subsistence from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, as hath been proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
and therefore this self-subsistence
doth make a very <hi>remarkable,</hi> and <hi>undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
difference between the Father and the
two other uncreated Persons.</p>
               <p>Some learned men have from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
that because the Father alone hath
<hi>subsistence from himselfe,</hi> therefore the
Father alone is <hi>God of himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:102750:133"/>
But the consequence is absurd, for they
do not distinguish between the <hi>Essence</hi> of
God &amp; the peculiar <hi>subsistences,</hi> in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
The Essence of God is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
and is one and the same in all, and
every one of the uncreated Persons: it is (if
I may so speak) a <hi>self-essence</hi> and essence it
selfe a <hi>self-Deity,</hi> because every one of
the Persons is truly, properly, essentially
God, <hi>God himselfe;</hi> and therefore <hi>if the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Father be a self-Deity, so is the
Essence of the Son and Spirit. The Divine
Essence of the Son is not begotten, caused,
produced any more then the Essence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
the subsistence of the Son is <hi>begotten,</hi>
but not <hi>caused;</hi> the Divine Essence is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated</hi>
to the Son, but it is not <hi>begotton</hi>
by the Father; for the Father doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
that selfe same Divine and entire Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
which is in himselfe, by begetting the
personal subsistence of the Son in the Unity
of the Godhead from the dayes of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Christ is not God by <hi>grace,</hi> but by
<hi>nature;</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> of the Father did not
<hi>precede</hi> and <hi>produce</hi> the Godhead in Christ,
but <hi>accompany</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> the <hi>naturall</hi>

even as his Will doth approve his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

And therefore <hi>Genebrardus, Canisius, Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Stapleton, Faber Fevardentius,</hi> and
the rest are extremely mistaken, when they
say that <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> deny <hi>that the
Father did beget his Son in the unity of his
own divine essence;</hi> For the meaning of
<hi>Calvin</hi> was plainly this, The Son hath the
selfe-same divine nature with the Father,
they are Coessential: one and the same
God who is the only true God, <hi>God of
himselfe,</hi> not God by participation, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
but God by nature and essence; for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102750:134"/>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> speaks in opposition to <hi>Valentinus
Gentilis, who denyes the Son and Spirit to be
coessentiall with the Father, but saith the
Father did essentiate the Son with another
manner of essence then his owne divine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
namely <hi>with a created and produced
essence. Gentilis</hi> saith, the Father onely
is truly God, because he only hath an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created</hi>
Godhead, and the Son hath not the
self-same Godhead with the Father.</p>
               <p>I had not said so much on this Argument
but that I find Papists, Arminians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and some bitter Lutherans do all joyn
their forces to abuse <hi>Calvin, Beza, Viret,
Farrell, Simler, Volanus, Gualter, Bullinger,
Lavater,</hi> the Orthodox Helvetians, and
many other reformed Writers upon this
Argument. Some say these reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
are guilty of Heresie, Blasphemy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme,
because they say <hi>Christ is God of
himselfe,</hi> though they clearly mean that
<hi>he is one God with his Father, and that the
Godhead which is communicated to the Son
by generation is an unbegotten Godhead,
a self-Deity.</hi> If any one desire to read

               <p>It is now easie upon the due considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the premisses to state the point right.
It is proper to the Father to have,</p>
               <p>1. The Godhead without any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of it to him from any other uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Person.</p>
               <p>2. To have subsistence from, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
as he is the first Person, and the first
personall Principle of giving subsisting life
unto the other two Coessentiall Persons.
For the first uncreated Person cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
subsistence from any person, because
he is the first person <hi>in order,</hi> though all
three be equall in respect of <hi>dignity and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
there can be no person in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first Person to communicate his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
or give personall subsistence to him
either by generation or spiration,</hi> and this
must needs be a Characteristicall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctive
property which declares the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of the Father to be incommunicable.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102750:136"/>
For though all three uncreated persons do
subsist in the Godhead,<note place="margin">Eadem es<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sentia est in Patre <gap reason="foreign">

is proper to the Father; the Father alone is
the first personall principle of subsisting
life; the Father is distinguished from the
Son, because the Father is unbegotten, and
because he did beget the Son; the Father
is distinguished from the Spirit, because he
did breath forth the Spirit. But I have said
enough of that when I treated above of
the inward and personall actions. I need
not take notice of their nice exception
who say <hi>the Father is not his owne Father,</hi>
and therefore cannot be said to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                  <hi>what kind of distinction</hi> there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, I am now to show, and that
I may be brief and plain in the opening of
this weighty point, I shall lay down the
truth clearly in some few Propositions.</p>
               <p>1. The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> not Essentially distinguished: for <hi>Christ
and his Father are one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Trinitas est. unus solus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensus naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Deus, praeter quem non est alius Deus. Vide Fulgenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um de fide Orthod.</note> John 10. 30. and
all three are Essentially one, 1 John 5. 7.
The Synod of <hi>Calcedon</hi> determined, <hi>that
Christ was Coessentiall with his Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Divinity, and Coessential with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102750:137"/>
us according to his Humanity;</hi> but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Union between us and Christ doth
only prove a specifical unity; but Christ
and his Father have one and the self-same
Divine and undivided Essence. <hi>He must
acknowledge more gods, who holds that the
Son and Spirit have another or different
kind of Godhead from the Father.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Essentiam divinam exinanire ut distincti onem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonarum demonstre mus est impium; essentiam aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ distincti one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plecti ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdum.</note> The
Arrians did divide the Nature of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and the Sabellians did confound their
Persons; but Christians acknowledge and
maintain that there are three Persons, and
but one single divine nature in the blessed
Trinity; only the second person did assume
the nature of man that he might heale our
nature, and save our persons.</p>
               <p>2. These three Divine Persons are
not distinguished <hi>realiter separabiliter:</hi>
That is, they are not so distinguished,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iunius</hi> contra Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosaten.</note> as
that they can be divided or separated one

in the self-same omnipresent nature;
nay, <hi>they do all three subsist in one another,
without any contraction, commixtion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,</hi>
as hath been proved at large in the
161, 162. and the following pages of this
Book. These Coessentiall subsiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be separated, or divided any more then
their indivisible and infinite Essence can
be divided or multiplyed.</p>

3 These three uncreated Persons are
<hi>truly</hi> distinguished; this proposition is fully
proved already in this very chapter:<note place="margin">Fulgentius lib. de fide Orthodox. ad Donatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> I
know it will be expected by some, that I
should say that these three Persons are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
<hi>Really;</hi> but I shall humbly desire
them to consider, that some have by that
expression taken occasion to exercise their
wanton wits in cavelling against this deep
and glorious mystery to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of this weighty truth. If they be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
distinguished, say some, then they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>essentially,</hi> or <hi>tanquam res &amp; res,</hi> then
they may be separated, say others, then
there are three Gods, say a third. It is too
well known what sport Atheists have made
upon this advantage; and truly <hi>it is much
at one whether men do professe themselves
Atheists or Tritheites;</hi> for he who doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that there are three Gods, may when
he pleases, beleeve that there is no God
at all.</p>

<hi>Iohn</hi> 17. saith, That <hi>this is life eternall</hi> to
know the Father the only true God, and
Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.
This Text hath been opened and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at large in this Book already from the
<hi>44. page</hi> to the 54. and therefore I shall
make quick work now, and desire you but
to compare this Text with 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 20.
We are in him that is true, even in his Son
Jesus Christ. <hi>This is</hi> the true God, and
<hi>eternall life;</hi> both texts tell us that it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life for to beleeve that the Father and
<hi>the Son are the only true God,</hi> and therefore
this is a fundamentall point; And the
Scripture speakes expresly that <hi>these three,</hi>

of the ancient and Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church, concerning the words
in question, we shall be able to passe a right
judgement upon the point in hand.</p>
            <p>1. The equality of the Number of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
suites very right, <hi>three</hi> witnesses on
earth, and <hi>three</hi> in heaven.</p>
            <p>2 The opposition between the quality of
the witnesses, witnesses <hi>on earth,</hi> and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<hi>in heaven:</hi> and yet their sweet <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
and agreement in one testimony; <hi>all
six beare witnesse to one and the same truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>diversity</hi> of the very <hi>nature</hi> of
those three who beare witnesse on earth,
and the <hi>unity</hi> of their divine nature who
bear witnesse in heaven, is very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and it is excellently expressed in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of the Phrase, <hi>These three are one,

            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:102750:145"/>
But it is objected that the <hi>Complutensian</hi>
Bible saith of the heavenly witnesses that
these <hi>three agree in one,</hi>

that there is an imprudent addition

should be expunged out of that one

many Copies. Moreover it is cleer by the

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> belong
to the eight verse, and therefore there is
an inexcusable omission, and an imprudent
transposition in that<note n="*" place="margin">Merces satis falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vendit officina <hi>Chr.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102750:147"/>
of the Coessential Trin-Unity of these

by all that were esteemed Orthodox and

            <p>10. These three heavenly witnesses are
one <hi>in Power, nature and Will;</hi> all three bear

is <hi>divine,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 9. And the truth
which they bear witnesse to is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
truth, a saving truth, <hi>that we may beleeve
on the Sonne of God and have eternall life.</hi>
1 Joh. 5. 11, 12, 13. <hi>And if the authority of
any one of these three heavenly witnesses be
called into question, all may be questioned
upon the same grounds, because their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is of equall authority;</hi> their testimony is
<hi>personall</hi> and <hi>divine;</hi> and if the testimony
and authority of these witnesses were not
<hi>divine,</hi> our faith which is built upon their
testimony and authority, would not be a
<hi>divine</hi> Faith. <hi>Quale est testimonium, talis

joyne with one consent and <hi>Will</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
this fundamentall truth, and
therefore <hi>if we do not beleeve and embrace
it, we give the lye to all the three witnesses in
heaven,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10. And if we do beleeve
that Jesus is the naturall Son of God, in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102750:147"/>
and by whom all beleevers have eternall
life, then we must acknowledge that Jesus
Christ is one God with his Father, the true
God and eternall life, 1 Joh. 5. 20. Christ
is God <hi>Attributivè,</hi> Joh. 1. 1. <hi>Subjectivè,</hi>
Act 20. 28. 1 Tim. 3. 16. This one propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>That Iesus Christ is the naturall and
proper Son of God,</hi> is that Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith upon which the Christian
Church is built, <hi>Mat. 16. 16, 17, 18. Thou
art Christ the Son of the living God:</hi> This is
the Rock upon which Christ hath so firmly
built his Church, that the gates of Hell shal
never prevail against it, or this fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
truth. <hi>We are all built upon Christ,
through the Spirit for an habitation of God,</hi>
Eph. 2. 20, 21, 22. Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghost;
all three joyn in laying this foundation, and
all three are one and the self-same great
God, who is the only true God blessed for
ever, as hath been fully proved already in
this book, and therfore I may be the briefer
in the discussion of this weighty point.</p>

               <hi>The Form of Baptism doth contain in it
a short Creed, or Rule of Faith,</hi> Mat. 28.

such high things of the Creed, they understand
it of this short Creed which is part of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Scripture, <hi>and not of that form which
is commonly callled the Apostles Creed. In
like manner when they expound</hi> Eph. 4. 5.
One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, <hi>they say,</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:102750:148"/>

and the rest who have written <hi>de
Symbolo Apostolico,</hi> or of the mystery of
the Trinity. The jugling of the <hi>Arrians</hi>
is so plainly set forth in the most faithfull
writers of Ecclesiasticall story, that I need
not relate how they made use of their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
at Court, and all their carnal policy in
every considerable place to pack Councels,
forge or corrupt Creeds, seduce all sorts of
men, who were led more by interest then
Scripture, and then to evade, or comply
with subtile distinctions, mentall reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
equivocations, and such unworthy
shifts for to save themselves from censure
in a time of Reformation.</p>
            <p>2. The Catechismes of the Ancients hold
forth this doctrine; the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> were
trained up in the knowledge of it. <hi>Lucian</hi>
who lived in <hi>Trajans</hi> time,<note place="margin">Lucian. in Philopat.</note> brings in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Catechising the heathens in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>3. The forme of Baptism strictly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Churches notwithstanding <hi>the
great ignorance and contention in the East,
and the grand Apostacy in the West;</hi> doth
sufficiently prove that this Doctrine of the
Trinity had taken deep root in the minds
of men, and that they were by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and speciall grace of God very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and faithfull in communicating of it
to their posterity from time to time.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Doxology,</hi> or as some call it, the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102750:149"/>
Hymn of glory doth evince the same, and
therefore the <hi>Arrians</hi> endeavoured to
make an alteration in the <hi>Doxology</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of saying, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy-Ghost,</hi> they said,
Glory be to the Father, <hi>By</hi> the Son, and <hi>In</hi>
the Spirit; from whence we may observe
by the way, that if we suffer the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Doctrine of our Faith to be corrupted,
we shall not be able to preserve the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of our worship pure, and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
            <p>5. The Form of Apostolicall Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which stands upon record, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14.
doth cleerly hold forth the Doctrine of
the Trinity to be <hi>a Fundamentall both of
Faith, and Worship;</hi> And all who desire
<hi>the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, the love
of God, the communion of the Holy-Ghost,</hi>
for their everlasting comfort &amp; salvation,
must beleeve and adore <hi>all three</hi> as on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>6. All who beleeve in God are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to beleeve in Christ <hi>as God,</hi> as one and
the same God with the Father. <hi>Ye beleeve
in God, beleeve also in me,</hi> Joh. 14. 1. They
are commanded to <hi>honour the Son as they
honour the Father,</hi> Joh. 5 23. And therfore
the Doctrine of the divine person of Christ
<hi>as Coessential</hi> with his Father is a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
both of Faith and worship.</p>

Doctrines <hi>necessary</hi> to be known, beleeved

for we know the blood of a meere man
cannot give satisfaction to the justice of
God for those grosse affronts, injuries and
abuses which have been offered by man to
the infinite Majesty of God. The Church
of God is purchased with the blood of
God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. And <hi>if Christ hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
the Church with the blood of God,
then the Church is not redeemed; your Faith
and our preaching are both vain,</hi> because you
and we are yet in our sins; for then God
hath not received satisfaction for our sins,
nor a sufficient ransome for our souls. <hi>If the
Son of God did not take flesh, then was not God
manifested in the flesh; then the whole myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of godlinesse which should be without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
great and precious in the eyes of
Christians, will be cheap, and vile, and of no

1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>depends upon the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation

            <p>8. It is not enough to beleeve that the

And the like must be said of our Advocate,
he must be such a one as can plead the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse

            <p>

            <p>1. Our Faith in God. I have spoken of
this grand Mystery of Faith, and shewn
that it is necessary to be known and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the eight Chapter at large; But I
shall now treat of it in a more practicall
way. <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency was bound
for to beleeve in the Father, Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, who are one Almighty God,
Creator, Upholder and Governour of
Heaven and Earth, Self-sufficient and All-sufficient,
blessed in, and of himselfe, the
only cause, and adaequate object of the
blessednesse of his creatures. <hi>Adam</hi> was
created by all three; after the Image of all
three; for God said, Let <hi>us</hi> make man in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102750:155"/>
               <hi>our</hi> Image, after <hi>our</hi> likenesse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26.
and therefore we cannot conceive, but that
all three were revealed to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he
might know and beleeve in all three; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Adam</hi> was better Catechized then
Jews, Turkes and Pagans are in this great
point, and therefore did know, beleeve
and Worship all three. There is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but he entred into Covenant with all
three; and therefore beleeved in all
three; I cannot beleeve that two of the
Divine Persons had no worship or service
from <hi>Adam</hi> their creature before his fall;
And doubtlesse <hi>Adam</hi> knew whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
and whom he worshipped as his
Almighty Creator, and All-sufficient God.
<hi>Adam under the first Covenant was bound to
beleeve in the second Person as God, but not
as God-man,</hi>

received the Honour of Dominion. The
world was made for man, man for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory of Father, Son and Holy
Ghost; <hi>Adams</hi> originall righteousnesse
did incline and enable him to beleeve in all
three; and surely <hi>Adam</hi> understood that
<hi>severe rebuke</hi> which was given him present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after his fall, <hi>Gen. 3. 22. And the Lord God
said, Behold the man is become as one of [us]</hi>

the Covenant runs in the names of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,

And this <hi>is the record that God hath given to

will be effectuall unto life eternal. <hi>And
we know that the Son of God is come, and hath

1.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 5.</note> We must beleeve in Christ as he is the
Naturall and Proper Son of God,<note place="margin">Act. 8. 37.</note> because
this is exactly answerable to that deare and
fatherly relation of God the Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 16</note> of
which we have discoursed so largely in this
chapter.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 22. 23, 24. ver.</note> For as we are encouraged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in God as the Father of Christ, so are
we encouraged to beleeve in Christ as the
naturall Son of God: and therefore I have
purposely insisted on such Scriptures as do
evidently demonstrate this truth, That we
are to beleeve <hi>on the name of the Son of God
and to have life through his name,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 11,
12, 13, 20. Joh. 20. 31. We are to beleeve
in Christ <hi>as a Mediatour,</hi> that our faith and
hope may be setled in God; <hi>Who by him do
beleeve in God, that raised him up from the
dead, that your Faith and hope might be in
God,</hi> 1 Pet, 1. 21. Now the great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to beleeve in Christ as an all-sufficient
Mediator is this, <hi>Iesus Christ is the naturall
Son of God;</hi> and therefore if Christ will but
present us to his Father, <hi>we are confident
that the Son of God, his natural Son, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Son, his only begotten Son will prevaile
with his Father for us;</hi> his relation to God,
and his interest in God doth assure us that
the intercession of our High-Priest will be
irresistible, undenyable. <hi>Christ glorified
not himself to be made an High-Priest, but he

have I begotten thee. As he saith also in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

acknowledge that the world doth look
upon this publique testimony of the Spirit
in the word as a <hi>private testimony,</hi> and are
apt to scoffe at them who receive it, as at
men led by their own <hi>private spirit;</hi> but the
true reason is because this testimony of
the Spirit is not manifest to them who
have not the Spirit. But it is so manifest
to them that have had this <hi>publique testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
sealed up to their consciences,</hi> that they
will hold fast this testimony though it cost
them their lives. <hi>I saw under the Altar
the soules of them that were slaine for the
word of God, and for the testimony which
they held.</hi> Rev. 6. 9. The testimony which
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102750:166"/>
they held is no other then that <hi>publick</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
which the Spirit delivers in the
Word, and had <hi>privately</hi> sealed up to their
Spirits. <hi>They were slaine for the Word of
God, and for the testimony which they held

            <p>I will not insist upon those many convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

whether the true reason (why those

               </note> because
<hi>men do undervalue the testimony of the Holy

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:102750:172"/>
this and all other saving truths to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
and hearts.</p>
            <p>True it is that the law of God is written
in our hearts by nature,<note place="margin">The Law.</note> but our nature is
corrupted, and we are blinded with pride,
passion, prejudice, with selfe conceitednes
and selfe-love, and therefore it is requisite
that the <hi>wrath of God should be revealed
from heaven</hi> against pleasing gainfull sins;
nay, unnaturall sins, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 18. to the end
of the Chapter.<note place="margin">The Gospel.</note> Moreover, it is to be sadly
considered that the Gospell is not written
in our hearts by nature, nor can it be found
out by any artificiall Demonstration, but it
is discovered to us by Divine Revelation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>I know many learned men have used the
testimony of humane Authors in a Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
and subservient way to confirme our
Faith in this point: but it is cleer that we
must rest our Faith upon the <hi>Authority of
God</hi> in this and all other points, or else our
Faith will not be a <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God sweares by himselfe, because he is

It is no shame to adhere to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

it is that God doth so often own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

well call upon him for new miracles.</hi> Nay the
very preservation of the Scriptures in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight

a convincing miracle. In a word, the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

            <p>The Testimony and Efficacy of the Spirit
is that sweet Subject which I am now more
especially engaged to insist upon; the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit to the heart and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

convincing Testimony.</p>
            <p>But it will be said, that this is such an
Argument as none can take notice of and
therefore altogether insufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
other men to beleeve, to whom no

were melted in their bones by this almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
spirit speaking, testifying, working in

sometimes their hearts quake their joynts
tremble, even as <hi>Belshazzars</hi> did at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sight of the hand-writing, when they do
but glance their eye upon some startling
Text. Their consciences do often joyne
with the word and spirit against themselvs
against their wils; for though they be <hi>self-willed,</hi>
yet they are after some <hi>soule-search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Admonition <hi>self-confounded</hi> and <hi>selfe-condemned</hi>
men, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10, 11. And though
the malice of some men bee too strong
for their wit, reason, and conscience;
yet it is not too strong for the spirit in the
Word; all the powers of Hel in them are
over-powred by this good Spirit; all the
strong-holds of Sathan batterd, and they
themselves so confounded, that they seeme
to be even damned already, they thinke
themselves in Hell above-ground, when
they are stung and bitten, they fall into the
passion of the heart, and are taken with
such <hi>Hellish convulsion-sits</hi> that they do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
foam at mouth,<note place="margin">Act. 7. 54.</note> and <hi>gnash with their

vain; for even they are out-witted and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powred,
who are not converted by this
stinging Efficacy of the Almighty Spirit.</p>
            <p>What shall we say to these things? If
Idols have been overthrown, Oracles si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,
Divels convinced by the Majesty of
the Spirit in the holy Scriptures, and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
awed by the Spirit that they have been
forced to confesse, nay beleeve these truths
at which they tremble; then surely <hi>those
bold theists are worse then devils who do not
tremble at the Word because they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Look upon a soule in its Agony and
Pangs, in its Throws and conflicts at its first
conversion, or in its <hi>After-throws upon
some sadrelapse,</hi> and observe how the wit is
captivated, reason conquered, conscience
confounded, heart broken, and will turned,
nay all the powers of corrupt nature over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
and overturned by the word and
spirit of God; And then you must needs
cry out, O the divine Efficacy of Scripture,
which turns a Lyon into a Lamb, a Goat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Saint, and perswades Philosophers and
Courtiers, Emperours and souldiers, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans

               </gap>. This is the power of the
Word: Behold the Efficacy of the Spirit in
the word conquering and triumphing over
the subtilty and obstinacy, the pride and
malignity of carnal men. The promises
of God are better then all the proffers of
Sathan: the divel shewes us the glory of the
world: the Scripture shewes us the vanity
of the world, and the conscience is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by the word and Spirit, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Heaven is infinitly better then
the possessions of earth: all the kingdomes
of the world and glory of them are not
worth one dayes Communion with Jesus
Christ, nay one dayes comfort from the
Gospel and Spirit of Jesus Christ. Good
reason have we then to beleeve the Spirit.
Angels admire, and Divels tremble at the

with great dexterity and circumspection.
<hi>They would not be mistaken as if they did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the two natures of Christ, or remove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the second Person of the Godhead;</hi> and yet
desire you to put a difference between <hi>that
which Christ assumed</hi> by the most free De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God, and grace of Hypostaticall
union, <hi>And that which belongs to him as he is
one God with the Father and the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, they intreat you to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the</hi> Gratious Motives <hi>to
worship Christ, and the</hi> Prime, Formall, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate
Proper ground and reason of <hi>that
worship, as I have done, and professe that
they</hi> worship their whole Mediatour with
one entire worship which is not mixed but
purely Divine, and therefore is not founded
upon any Temporary Office, Service, Benefit,

they constantly urge the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Acontius</hi> in their Apology, and in
their answer to the Reverend Professours
of <hi>Leyden. Acontius</hi> thought fit to lay aside
the ancient Confessions of Faith, and
compose a new Creed, which <hi>Socinians</hi> may
subscribe. <hi>He came into England under a
faire pretence of being banished for Christs
sake; but certainly his greatest danger was
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:102750:246"/>
of being called into question for his intimate
confederacy with such as were no great friends
to Iesus Christ. Iudicious</hi> Pareus <hi>looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as a sneaking Solicitour for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,
and as fast a friend to them as</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finius
<hi>himself. The Learned Professours of</hi>

in the yeare 1616, I find that he
himself was living in the yeare 1613. In
the yeare 1631. his Book was printed here
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but generally condemned by
such as were learned and Orthodox at
that time in this University; they thought
it more fit for the fire, then the Press.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>March</hi> 1647.<note place="margin">

there was some part of his Stratagems
(translated into English) published in Print
at <hi>London;</hi> I confess I was amazed at it,
but could not learne who was the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour

to look after all books that were pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

the reverend <hi>Assembly</hi> sitting at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
that there was such a Book lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,

            <p>Moreover, the Translatour in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

that Mr <hi>Dury</hi> might be added to that

him, and assured us that he would be ready
to make his <hi>Retractation</hi> as publike, as his

they practised upon his passionate love of

               <p>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:102750:253"/>
The promises being humbly presented, we
leave it to the judgement of this Reverend
Assembly,</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Acontius</hi> his <hi>Stratagems</hi> was a
Book fit to be translated into English, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to the Parliament, Army, and
City to direct them how to distinguish truth
from errour in this juncture of time?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:102750:253"/>
Upon these few heads of the Report I
discoursed somewhat affectiontely, and
freely, according to the weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Point in Question. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the reverend Assembly did unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
desire the <hi>Prolocutor</hi> to perswade
me to print something about that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as soone as the heat of our employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Oxford</hi> was over for the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kingdom. I am very willing to
obey the Commands of that Assembly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for learning and piety, even to the
admiration of those great Schollers, whose
hearts were once espoused to another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
If the debates of that <hi>Reverend
Assembly</hi> upon severall Articles of Faith
were printed and published to the world,
all ingenuous enemies of piety would blush
at the remembrance of those bitter cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which have been passed upon men of
whom this Age is unworthy. But I must
hasten, for my Book begins to swell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
its just proportion, and I am called
away to another service, which cannot be
performed at any other time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acontius</hi> hath invented very pretty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
instead of Excuses to abate our
zeale against the most dangerous errours;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acontius</hi> his thîrd Book of Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems.</note> he
saith, that Hereticks do not intend to make
Christ a lyar; <hi>the controversie between them
and us is not concerning the truth, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the meaning of the words of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:102750:254"/>
To which I answer, that <hi>he who beleeves
the words of Christ in the sense of Antichrist,
and rejects the sense of Christ, and his Spirit,
is not a Christian, but is indeed and truth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian.</hi>

The sense of Scripture is the

in these great and weighty Articles
to impose a new sense upon the Church of
Christ, they do clearely impose a new
Creed, a new Gospell upon us, and deserve

I now againe, if any man preach any other

I shall point at some unquestionable truths
for the ending of that unhappy and fatall
Controversie in the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>1. There is no warrant given in the
Word to any Minister of the State, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
of the Church to molest, oppresse, or
persecute any man for Righteousnesse sake; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
he who doth persecute a man for following
his conscience when rightly informed by
the Word and Spirit of the Lord Jesus,<note place="margin">No man is to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed till he is unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.</note> doth
certainely persecute the Lord Jesus Christ.

                  <hi>Saul, why persecutest thou me? I am
Iesus whom thou persecutest;</hi> it is a fit Text
to be preached on this twenty second of
<hi>February</hi> 1649. But I am now learning
another Lesson, which is to suffer persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
patiently for righteousnesse sake, and
pray for such Benefactours, who do besides
their intention, and against their will, make
Christians happy by endeavouring to make
them miserable in their outward man by an
unexpected persecution. Yet I could not
but take notice of the seasonablenesse of
this truth, and put down the day, the
moneth, and the yeare, as the Prophet did.
<hi>Ezek. 8. 1. And it came to passe in the sixth
yeare, in the sixth moneth, in the fifth day of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:102750:255"/>
the moneth, as I sate in mine house, and the
Elders of Iudah (the Princes of the people)
sate before me, &amp;c.</hi> The great Statesmen
were at leasure now in the time of the
Captivity to hear the Prophet; if they
would have heard, beleeved, obeyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they had never gone into Captivity;
for the misusing of the Prophets, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
of their message was <hi>the sin against</hi>
the most Soveraigne remedy;<note place="margin">The High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Captivity.</note> and when
there was no other remedy, then God sent
them away Captive, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 16, 17.
Let all such consider this, who are poasting
on in the high-way to Captivity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. No man ought to be punished for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
following his mis-informed conscience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

No Christian Magisrate ought to aime
lower in any Nation, unto which the means
of Grace hath been offered by the special
providence and favour of God; Put all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and you have the Adaequate end of
the Civill power of Christian Magistrates
over all in their Dominions, who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up their names to Jesus Christ. The
Apostles themselves, and the Churches
planted by them, begged this favour of
God for Kings in their time (when you
know who they were that Governed the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:102750:258"/>
World) that God would so far over-rule
their Rulers,<note place="margin">See Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Master <hi>Whites</hi> way to the Tree of life concerning Humane Authority. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tenent washed white. <hi>cap.</hi> 70.</note> that the Christians might
lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and honesty. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. But it is
readily acknowledged that there are some
Magistrates who are ignorant of truth and
godlinesse, and therefore are not able to
performe the whole duty of Magistrates:
But our next conclusion is;</p>
               <p>VII. All Magistrates ought to study the
truth and worship of Jesus Christ, that they
may be instructed in the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and made wise enough to discern
between fundamental Truths,<note place="margin">Magistrates must study Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Truths.</note> and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
errors, that they may not by following
their own blind and erroneous consciences
countenance Heresie and Apostacy, and
Persecute <hi>truth and fidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be wise therefore O ye Kings; be instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ye Iudges of the earth; serve the Lord
with feare, and rejoyce with trembling; kiss
the Son least he be angry and ye perish from
the way, &amp;c. Psal. 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>compared
with</hi> Deut. 17. 17, 18, 19, 20. and 1 Tim. 2. 2.</p>
               <p>And surely it is then no great task for
any Magistrate who hath given up his name
to Christ, to learne the Principles of the
Christian Religion, whereby he hopes for
to be saved, that he may be able to judge
and punish such Blasphemous and seducing
Hereticks as endeavour to subvert the
Christian faith.</p>
               <p>

VIII. God doth freely reveale and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
himself to all true-hearted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
who seek unto him in his own way
for direction and instruction in those
weighty points which they are bound to
know both as servants, (and as Civill Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters)
of God for their own,<note place="margin">Godly M<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistrates a instructed by God in all necessary Truths.</note> and their
Subjects everlasting good. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did
prevent the Priests and Levites, and for
ought we read, the whole Church also, in
discovering the right way of Reformation
in matters of Religion after that general
Apostacy in the days of <hi>Ahaz;</hi> read 2 <hi>Chr.
29.</hi> from verse 4. to verse 12. And it is
generally conceived, that <hi>David</hi> was the
first that did discover that great disorder
in carrying the Arke of God in a Cart: read
the fifteen first verses of <hi>I Chron.</hi> 15, and
take special notice of the 2, 12, 13, 15. verses.
<hi>None ought to carry the Arke of God but the
Levites, for them hath the Lord chosen to
carry the Arke of God: and to minister to
him for ever, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. Christian Magistrates have no other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
Rule of Civil Righteousness prescribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them by God, then that which God
gave by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The rule of all Christian Magistrates</note> and such as have expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Moses</hi> in the Scriptures of truth. This
one Proposition fully explained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
would put an end to this unhappy
controversie between all judicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
men. We cannot in equity extend
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:102750:259"/>
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to such as never entred
into any Covenant with God, nor to any
that are led away in their simplicity before
they have been better instructed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
once and again; nor to such as
do in a Christian and Peaceable way dissent
from their brethren in points of lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
But <hi>we extend the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>to seducing Apostates, blasphemous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and Idolatours, who are obstinate
against light and admonition, and poyson
others, or endeavour to poyson them with
Doctrines which do subvert faith and holiness

                  <hi>that they may be punished

               </p>
               <p>I need not say any thing of such distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
of the Civil peace as tend to the
destruction of the lives or soules of men.<note place="margin">Arius in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driâ una scintilla fuit, sed quia non statim op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressa est, totu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which devoured almost the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

Church had done their part against him,
for he was twice excommunicated out of
the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as <hi>Socrates,

Writers relate. And therefore when spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Instructions, admonitions, Censures,
will do no good upon these self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Censures. When the Wolves come into

the Magistrate is a Civil Shepheard,

the Sheep.</p>

               </p>
               <p>1. In Faith; for the Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
doth not act like himself, if he doth
not performe acts of Civill-justice in Faith.
And it is cleare that if there be no morall
equity in any of the judiciall Lawes in
the Old Testament, and there are none at
all extant in the New: the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
cannot performe any act of Civill-justice
in Faith, But it is indeed too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to be denyed,<note place="margin">What Lawes are of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that</p>
               <p>All divine lawes which concern the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Morall transgressions, are of
perpetuall obligation,<note place="margin">Vide Pisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. in Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> and therefore still
remaine in force according to their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:102750:262"/>
and generall equity, abstracted from
speciall circumstances, Typicall Accessories,
and the old formes of <hi>Mosaicall Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
For</p>
               <p>1. These divine Lawes are not expired
in their own nature.</p>
               <p>2. They are not repealed by God.</p>
               <p>3. The authority of the Law-giver is the
same under both Administrations, old and
new; the consciences of Christians aswell
as Jewes, are subject to his soveraigne
and perpetuall jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>4. The matter of the Lawes is Morall,
and very agreeable to the Dictates of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as doth appeare by the severall
Lawes and Decrees of Heathens. <hi>Dan. 3.
29. Ezra. 7. 23. 25, 26, 27. Ezra.</hi> 10. 3.
5. 8. compared with <hi>Numb. 15. 30, 31.
Levit. 24. 15, 16. Deut. 13. 8, 9. Zach. 13.
3, 6. Seducing, poysoning, slaying of Soules
is by the law of Nature and Nations the worst
of injuries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>The reason of these divine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Master <hi>Palmer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey</hi> of the Sabbath. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Lawes is
immutable, and that reason is sometimes
expressed and declared: But</hi> it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that there should be any expresse rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of every Morall Law in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
which is plainly delivered in the Old.</p>
               <p>6. These divine Lawes are Independent
on the will of Man, and therefore indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable
mans authority.</p>
               <p>II. The Magistrate is to act in Christian
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:102750:262"/>
                  <hi>Love</hi> and charity against these dangerous
men. It is mercy to drive away the wolfe,
and cruelty to spare him: there must be so
much Fatherly love shewen to the souls of
Christians to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ttle flock, as to preserve
them from Wolves and Foxes. Hee who
loves Christ, the Christian religion, the souls
and peace of Christians, will not beare the
sword in vaine; his head, heart, hand, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
will keep time in working according to
the written Rule.</p>
               <p>XIV. The Happinesse of Civill societies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>
aswell as Church Assemblies doth much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the punishing of Antichristian
Heretikes, seducing Apostates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature and measure of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
In all Civil States whose Acts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in sacred or profane stories, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
were to have a care not only of
Justice &amp; Honesty, but of that Religion also
which they estemed divine for the good &amp;
happinesse of their Civil state, though it
is no wonder if the Heathens did misapply
this zealous instinct of nature, to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Superstition and Idolatry, of a
false Religion and false Gods. <hi>Socrates,
Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Protagoras,</hi> famous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
were all three condemned at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
by the Law against Irreligion. But
let us look into Christian states.</p>
               <p>When the means of Instruction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
have been vouchsafed to a people
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:102750:263"/>
that are in Covenant with God, and they
corrupt the truth and worship of God; the
Lord doeth not onely punish degenerate
Churches, but even Civill states, Princes
and People for this Spiritual Pollution. The
<hi>Turke</hi> was let loose from the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi>
to punish the worshippers of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 14. 20. The flourishing
of Religion, is the flourishing of the Civill
state; and the decay of Religion, the decay
and ruine of the Civil state according to
the ordinary dispensations of God. When
Christ had rode through the Roman state
on the white horse of his Gospel of grace,
and was rejected, then followed the Red
horse of Warre, the black horse of Famine,
and the pale horse of Pestilence and other
deadly plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. from the 2. to the
8 <hi>vers.</hi> Can any Christian state hope upon
Scripture grounds, that it shall enjoy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
health, riches, peace, safety, settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if Faith and Piety be overthrowen
by the indulgence of that state, if Seducers
bee permitted to poyson soules, to teach
damnable Doctrines, and perswade men to
deny the Lord that bought them, to deny
his divine nature and subsistence, his Offices
and the efficacy of them; nay, his very
Redemption by way of purchase, by way of
proper and alsufficient satisfaction as the
<hi>Socimans</hi> do? The patience and bounty of
God acting as it were by Praerogative is
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:102750:263"/>
gloriously manifested in our dayes, but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no Christian state can be secured by a
councell or an army which permits men to
live without Christ, without God in the
world, without any spirituall communion
with God in his Coeternall Son by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essentiall
Spirit. Woe be to us if we neglect
so great Salvation as is yet offered to us
in this day of Grace.</p>
               <p>XV. The Church as a Church hath no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
sword; it doth therefore belong to the
Magistrate to smite with the sword, but the
Church may exhort the Magistrate to doe
his duty. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 40.</p>
               <p>XVI. We must distinguish between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/>
                  <hi>Forbearance,</hi> vouchsafed to weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that they may live quietly in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and honesty: and Antichristian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
extended to blasphemous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
and seducing Apostates, that they may
live quietly in all ungodlinesse and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
to the infection and seduction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The Kings shall bee rewarded for
burning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God praised for judging the
seducing whore. But judicious Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi>
is afraid <hi>that the Antichristian Whore will
steale in at the Back-doore of a Toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XVII. <hi>Gospel-dispensations are as spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/>
for the conversion of Sorcerers, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
Murtherers, as for recovery of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Heretiks and seducing Apostates,
and therefore</hi> they who plead for the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:102750:264"/>
of these obstinate persons in hope of their
conversion, doe indeed proclaime a generall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> pardon for all malefactours, save such only as
sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>XVIII. They who permit men to deny
supernaturall Principles, do permit them
to overthrow the Gospel, which is not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in our hearts by nature as the Law is.
And yet it should be considered that <hi>they
who deny the Gospel, do consequently sin against
the light of nature, because they make God
a liar by rejecting the testimony of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Son. 1. Ioh.</hi> 5. 10. They who did
seduce men from the beliefe and worship of
God <hi>as revealed in the Old Testament,</hi> were
to die the death; and yet the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is as divine and supernaturall a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
as the New Testament it self. And
it is cleare that <hi>God did reveale himselfe in
Christ, even in the Old Testament,</hi> for there
is much Gospell in the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;<note place="margin">An Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to such as deny su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall principles, permits men to be Anti-Scripturists.</note>
because all the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
bare witnesse of Christ, and <hi>Moses</hi>
(saith our Saviour) <hi>wrote of me.</hi> If then
there be an indulgence granted to such as
deny supernaturall truths, men may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
both the Old and New Testament,
and be Antiscripturists without controule:
nay it wil if this absurdity be granted, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, <hi>that the Magistrate may punish
such severely who deny the truths which are
wrote in Aristotle, but must not touch them
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:102750:264"/>
who deny all the supernaturall mysteries of
Faith Written in the Book of God;</hi> Blush ye
Heavens, and be ashamed O Earth at the
Atheisticall libertinisme of this licentious
age. Seducers who did thrust men out of
the way which the Lord commanded them
by his written word to walk in,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughes</hi> Heart-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. <hi>pag.</hi> 35.</note> were put
to death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 5, 10. though they were
directed by a supernaturall Revelation, to
walk in that way Reverend Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>
doeth often acknowledge in his <hi>Irenicum,</hi>
that such as professe Christianity, are justly
punished for sinning against the common light
of Christianity, For it is not conscience, but
the Devil in the conscience which moves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to maintaine errours against the light of
Christianity, errours that are destructive
to the Christian Religion; and if any man hath
a minde to be an Advocate for the Devil, I
<hi>dare not be an Advocate for him;</hi> only I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to beware how he hearkens to the
Divell in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle, and beseech him
to cry mightily to him who alone can cast
out Devills, to cast the Devil out of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/>

               <p>XIX. He that by seducing seeks to thrust
men away from the beleife and worship of
the only true God, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, doth deserve to be punished for his
very attempt and endeavour to subvert

one soule to depart from God. Because he

attempt of killing a soule by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
an Ordinance of God, corrupting of
Religion, telling lyes in the name of the

then the Jewes were, if men may seduce our
wives and children into such opinions and
practices as will certainly undoe their souls
to all eternity, and wee must onely intreat
them not to seduce our friends to Hell, and
the Christian Magistrate hath no power to
punish these Soule murthering seducers.
