         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of their offence (tending wholie to ſedition) they haue
woorthily deſerued death, yet the ſubſtance of their Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets

                  <p>For want whereof ſome as euill affected as themſelues, to

and feare of Authoritie.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt others, whoſe Honors theſe intemperate railors
haue ſought to ſcandalize, none haue more vildly bin ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
than the late deceaſed Earle, the godly, loiall, wiſe, and
graue Earle of Leiceſter: Againſt whom (void of all iuſt touch
<pb facs="tcp:2072:6"/>
of diſhonor) they forged millions of impieties, abuſing the
people by their diueliſh fictions, and wicked wreſting of his
actions, all to bring his vertues &amp; perſon in popular hatred.</p>
                  <p>Which though he during his life meekely bare as a man
vntouched, without publiſhing defence of his innocencie.
Yet becauſe the toongs of men irritated to enuie by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments

ſith his death are become ouer ſcandalous and at too

                  <p>And for as much as I perceiue the greateſt and moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
obiection they haue to blemiſh his honor, is but an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his ambition and aſpiring minde, wherewith the
capitall and cardinall Libellor of them all hath cunninglie
infected the ignorant that knew not the ſtate of his honors:
Let vs ſee how he may iuſtly be touched.</p>
                  <p>Did he euer aſſume vnto himſelfe anie vaine or vnlawfull
tytle, or was vnſatiate of rule? Did he purchaſe his honors
otherwiſe than by his vertues, or were they ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as nowe or in times paſt they haue not beene equaled in
others inferior vnto him in condition of birth, and more in
deſart? If not? I maruell the father of this peſtilent inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bluſh not as red as his cap, and his children be not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of his falſehood.</p>
                  <p>Admit this woorthie Earles and our moſt gratious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
who wiſely iudged of his vertues, and worthily rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his loialtie and paines, did honor him with titles aboue
others of his time: (in humble and ſeemely ſort, I ſpeake it
without compariſon) who euery way was more fit for the
dignitie he bare, and more complet to accompliſh them:
whereof the Libellor could not be ignoraunt, but that too
much yeelding to his malice, he ſought to ſlaunder this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
teſtimonie of his Excellencie.</p>
                  <p>Such rather woulde I iudge ambitious, as for promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whether Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall, hauing once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
a hope of greatneſſe, without regard of conſcience or
Countrie, with voluntarie hazarde of all things purſue the
<pb facs="tcp:2072:6"/>
ſame, by ſhamefull, traiterous, and vngodlie meanes, exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
their naturall Prince and ſuperiour Magiſtrates by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
and ſeditious Libels. Theſe be the true tokens of an
aſpiring minde, whoſe nature is to hinder by malice, where it
can not hurt by power.</p>
                  <p>But leauing further purſute of their malice, I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this Earles woorthineſſe. For the firſt and principall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his vertues, his Religion, it ſhall be needleſſe to ſpeake
much, ſith all Chriſtendome knows he profeſſed one Faith,
and worſhipped one onely God, whom he ſerued in vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of life, and defended with hazard thereof in armes and
action againſt his enimies. How he ſuccoured and relieued
diſtreſſed members of the Church, I leaue to thoſe that haue
made proofe, who ought in dutie to make relation thereof.</p>
                  <p>Next I thinke there is none that will, dare, or can impeach
his loialtie, either in fact or faith, ſufficiently teſtified by hir
Maieſties gratious loue to whom that belonged, as alſo by
his dutifull and carefull ſeruice vnto hir. So as further narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof ſhall not neede.</p>
                  <p>His wiſedome by the grauitie of his place, the cauſes he
managed, and the cariage of his perſon, is approoued not
onely vnto vs, but to moſt nations of the world.</p>
                  <p>Laſtlie of his valour and affection to his Countries peace,
no honeſt minde but is ſatisfied: whereof what greater teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
can we require than the trauels his aged bodie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke,
and dangers the ſame was ſubiect vnto in the warres
of the Low Countries, where he voluntarily offered his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in combate againſt the deuoted enimies of this ſtate and
hir Maieſtie. Leauing his Wife, poſſeſſions, and home, not
regarding his ſafetie, riches, and eaſe, in reſpect of the godly,
honourable, and louing care he bare the common quiet.</p>
                  <p>All which the vngratefull Malecontents of this time, on
whome any thing is ill beſtowed (much more the trauels of
ſo memorable a Noble) ſpared not to reproch: Hyring the
toongs of runawaies and roges, ſuch as neither feare God
nor the diuell, or are woorth a home, to proclaime hatefull
and enuious lies againſt him, in alehouſes, faires, markets,
<pb facs="tcp:2072:7"/>
and ſuch aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>At whoſe returne when his dealings were truely diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and truth ouercame their ſlanders, this was the refuge of
their whiſpering malice: His greatneſſe and ſmooth toong
(ſaie they) beares it awaie: as if Honor once loſt in act, could
be hidden by greatnes, or recouered by grace and eloquence
of ſpeech. Both which taken away by his happie death, and
our vnhappie loſſe, he is ſithence more cleared than before.</p>
                  <p>Maruell not then at their enuie, ſith, <hi>Virtutis comes inuidia,</hi>
but deteſt the enuious, that thus blaſpheme vertues, whom
(for mine owne part) as I ſee meaſure their rage, ſo will I
iudge of their affection to the ſtate: for vndoubtedly none
but the diſcontented with the time, or ſuch as he hath iuſtlie
puniſhed for their lewdneſſe, will thus calumniouſlie inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
his proceedings.</p>
