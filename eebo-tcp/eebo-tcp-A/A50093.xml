            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <l>Of those atchievements which my love and youth</l>

                           <l>Must sadly answer. What I did, she gave me</l>

                           <l>I fainted like a coward; I made a vow too</l>
                           <l>(And it is registred) ne'r to presume</l>
                           <l>To come into her presence, if I brought not</l>
                           <l>Her fears and dangers bound in fetters to her,</l>
                           <l>Which now's impossible. — Hark, the enemy</l>
                           <l>Makes his approaches: save your selves, this only</l>
                           <l>Deliver to her Sweetness; I have done</l>
                           <l>My poor endeavours, and pray her not repent</l>
                           <l>Her goodness to me: May you live to serve her,</l>
                           <l>This loss recover'd, with a happier fate,</l>
                           <l>And make use of this sword: Arms I abjure,</l>

                     <l>A strange old Fellow! yet this sullen mood</l>
                     <l>Would quickly leave him, might it be understood</l>
                     <l>You part not hence displeas'd. I am design'd</l>
                     <l>To give him certain notice: If you find</l>
                     <l>Things worth your liking, shew it. Hope and Fear,</l>

                     <l>AFter twice putting forth to Sea, his Fame</l>
                     <l>Shipwrack'd in either, and his once known Name</l>
                     <l>In two years silence buried, perhaps lost</l>
                     <l>I'the general opinion; at our cost</l>
                     <l>(A zealous sacrifice to <hi>Neptune</hi> made</l>
                     <l>For good success in his uncertain trade)</l>
                     <l>Our Author weighs up anchors, and once more</l>
                     <l>Forsaking the security of the shore,</l>
                     <l>Resolves to prove his fortune: What 'twill be,</l>
                     <l>Is not in him, or us to prophesie;</l>
                     <l>You only can assure us. Yet he pray'd</l>
                     <l>This little in his absence might be said,</l>
                     <l>Designing me his Orator. He submits</l>
                     <l>To the grave censure of those abler Wits</l>
                     <l>His weakness; nor dares he profess that when</l>
                     <l>The Critiques laugh, he'l laugh at them agen.</l>
                     <l>(Strange self-love in a writer!) He would know</l>

                     <l>His future, studies to reform from this</l>
                     <l>What in another might be judg'd amiss.</l>
                     <l>And yet despair not, Gentlemen; though he fear</l>
                     <l>His strengths to please, we hope that you shall hear</l>
                     <l>Some things so writ, as you may truly say</l>
                     <l>He hath not quite forgot to make a Play,</l>
                     <l>As 'tis with malice rumour'd: His intents</l>
                     <l>Are fair; and though he want the complements</l>
                     <l>Of wide-mouth'd Promisers, who still engage</l>
                     <l>(Before their Works are brought upon the Stage)</l>
                     <l>Their parasites to proclaim 'em: This last birth</l>
                     <l>Deliver'd without noise, may yield such mirth,</l>
                     <l>As ballanc'd equally, will cry down the boast</l>
