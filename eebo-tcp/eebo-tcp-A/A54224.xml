            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have at laſt, with ſome Difficulty obtained a ſmall Reſpit,
from more ſerious Affairs, to the Examination of a late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
intituled, <hi>The Spirit of the</hi> Quakers <hi>tryed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Diſcovery it hath made of it ſelf in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great Prophet and Patriarch,</hi> George Fox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whilſt
I was willing to inform my ſelf of the Deſign and Temper of the
Author, by a very careful peruſal of his Book (at leaſt, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomething that might pretend to claim a Reputation in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
excelling all other of our Adverſaries (who never ſtruck
higher then at our Doctrines) <hi>whilſt this man ventures to tell
the World what Spirits we are of</hi>) I find him in reallity filled
with nothing, but <hi>diſingenious Reflection, empty Stories,</hi>
and <hi>unprofitable Cavils,</hi> about a few Scriptures, he moſtly
confeſſeth, that but one of us hath miſ-cited, either in reference to a
diſorderly Quotation of the words, or an unſuitable Application
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Judgment I then made of the Man, and ſtill continue in,
is this,</hi> Had he not wonderfully lov'd being ſome body in
Print, he needed not to have given himſelf or other People
the trouble of ſo many unſerviceable Sheets; nor a ſmall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60238:3"/>
trifling Solicitor for their kind reception in the World,
the toil of ſo much Inſinuation, even to Nautiating. <hi>But
I deſign not to be long, and thereſore ſhall briefly contract my Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt the Author, to the Reader, into theſe four Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then, He hath behaved himſelf the moſt unjuſt of any that
ever yet undertook to write againſt us; which ſo ill becomes a man
that would reform others, that it rather inſenſeth all worthy minds,
and is Reaſon enough to beget a Jealouſie, both of the Truth of
his Cauſe, and his own Honeſty: For who (truly Juſt) would
draw a general Charge from a particular Failing (in caſe it were
ſo?) And what good Chriſtian would ſtigmatize an entire Body
for the Defects of any individual Member?</p>
            <p>He finds fault with <hi>George Fox,</hi> and to be revenged of him,
<hi>beſpatters a whole Society;</hi> ſo that if I ſhould grant him all
he would have againſt that Perſon (<hi>whom I doubt not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
from his baſe Abuſe</hi>) yet why he ſhould place his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
(ſuppoſe them ſuch) to our account, cannot be reſolv'd me by any
that is not willing to ſuffer for other mens Faults.</p>
            <p>George Fox <hi>he thinks has miſ-cited a Scripture, Ergo</hi>—
He is an Impoſter, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> a pack of Hereticks:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is after this lofty manner of Diſputing, he undertakes our
Overthrow; but if this be good arguing,</hi> the man is Orthodox
with a witneſs, and deſerves the Chair, Nemine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente.</p>
            <p>2. My ſecond Exception is, That if he had been provock't to
any hard Thoughts againſt <hi>George Fox,</hi> from the peruſal of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60238:3"/>
Book, it had been handſome, and well-becoming a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
to have viſited that ſo much miſtaken Perſon (in his account) and
have endeavoured, either a better underſtanding of him, or his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Information in the Scripture; and not (at a juncture, when
he might underſtand him to be at ſo great a diſtance as <hi>America</hi>)
to exhibit an angry Charge againſt him in <hi>England.</hi> But his
generoſity here, is much like to his Reaſon elſewhere.</p>
            <p>3. But why, above all times of the World, does the man chuſe
the preſent ſeaſon, to ſhower down his Diſpleaſure againſt us; juſt
when we ſhould make the beſt of an unexpected Tolleration, <hi>to the
Refreſhment of our afflicted Minds and Bodies, by the
late Perſecutions that have been?</hi> What! Is he angry that we
have Liberty, or does he think that none deſerve it but himſelf?
I wonder what Teſtimony there had been, or how few to have receiv'd
a Liberty of Conſcience, <hi>if the</hi> Quakers <hi>had ſquar'd their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in the Storm, according to his ſorded creeping into
Holes and Corners, or elſe, to publick places of Protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if he tells us, that he had no mind to add to our Troubles,
he deals deceitfully: for as it is almoſt impoſſible for him to write
againſt us, but he muſt expreſly or implicitly contradict the avow'd
Principles of the Church, <hi>by his ſcattered Seeds of Socinianiſm,</hi>
ſo knowing the Danger that would enſue ſuch undertakings, as well
as the difficulty of Printing, his Self-ſafety, and not Charity to us,
was the Hindrance.</p>
            <p>4. And Laſtly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> why was he aſhamed of his Name? (I
cannot but make his own words good by ſuch an Inquiry (<hi>without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60238:4"/>
concluding him a Prophet</hi>) and great Reaſon there is that we
ſhould ask him a Reaſon for it, if we may lawfully ask that which
his whole Diſcourſe ſeems to character him a Stranger to; for ſince
he tells us, That he declines all wayes of Controverſie with us, but
that of matter of Fact; however able we may be to clear our ſelves
from ſuch <hi>Indictments,</hi> yet our ignorance of his Name <hi>deprives
us of that ſcope we might otherwiſe have, for producing
(perhaps) as large a Catalogue of Doctrinal Miſtakes, in
what he himſelf, or thoſe to whom he adheres have writ,</hi> as
he hath of Verbal ones out of any Writings belonging to the People
called <hi>Quakers.</hi> And though he ſeems to excuſe the abſence of his
Name, by that Occaſion he pretends we take to abuſe our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
Yet the trueſt Reaſon is a Conſciouſneſs of a diſingenious and
unjuſtifiable Practice in himſelf; perhaps he alſo was afraid of ſuch
Truth as may be ſeaſonably told of him, to the diſcrediting of his
Enterprize: But till he had been ſo ſerved by us, it had become
him not to have reproach't us, <hi>in the vindication of other men,
in whoſe Opinions he will by no means allow himſelf to be
concern'd otherwiſe then to explode them for Heretical:</hi>
Thus the Man's for any Game; he cares not whom he defends,
if he can but have his End upon the Party he deſigns to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
<hi>ſometimes he will be a Church-man, againſt a
Non-conformiſt,</hi> and back again; <hi>ſometimes either,
againſt a Quaker; then for him, againſt them both;</hi>
and laſtly, <hi>a Socinian againſt them all:</hi> His ſeeming Labours
againſt us for common Principles, being but a plowing our Backs
with their Heifers, <hi>for the promotion of his Biddlean or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian
Cauſe;</hi> which Owl-light way of ſtabbing men, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60238:4"/>
People under the Livery of every Perſwaſion (whilſt for
none of them) is very remote from being either Chriſtian or
Manly; <hi>nor will the Righteous God of Heaven and Earth
bleſs or proſper ſuch ignoble, clandeſtine Projects, and
maskt Attempts, as what our Adverſary, and his ſmall
Cabal are plentifully guilty of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, I cannot ſay all are equally concealed in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
againſt us; for when the man has writ and printed
his Book, there is a ſmall Cryer of his, that like an Eager of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious
Broaker, runs too and fro to diſperſe it, <hi>moſt commonly
known by ſmelling;</hi> his Breath ſtinking of ſuch foul Epethites
as, <hi>Knave, Puppy, Fool, Raſcal, Loggerhead, Cheat;</hi>
which with much more of the ſame loathſome Sent he is pleaſed
to beſtow upon <hi>George Fox,</hi> as <hi>a neceſſary Introduction to our
Adverſary's Confutation of his Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Certainly Reader, we have little Cauſe to eſteem theſe men,</hi>
the Reſtorers of Paths to dwell in, Defenders of the true
Religion, and Tryers of other mens Spirits, <hi>who give
ſuch little Proof of the Knowledge of their own,</hi> as to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the very Alphabet or firſt Principle of Common
Civility.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Reader,</hi> I will not longer detain thee in an Epiſtle,
whatever variety of matter I may have to invite me; hoping
that the enſuing Diſcourſe will abundantly ſatisfie thee in thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
things for which our Adverſary thinks us moſt unfit of all to be
believed.</p>
            <p>I have not given my ſelf the common range that other Writers
do; few caring to buy, and fewer to read large Diſcourſes; but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60238:5"/>
as the Matter briefly and naturally riz upon every Head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other artifice or dreſs, it is preſented to thee. I omit more
then an Hundred Things, that would engage to perſonal Reflection;
for my Soul hath no Pleaſure in ſtriving therein, as knowing the
inconſiſtancy of that uncharitable virulent Temper with a Chriſtian
Spirit, <hi>which I am aſſur'd is quite another thing, from
what is Verboſe, Abuſive Cavelling, Airy, and meerly
Notional;</hi> which had our Adverſary duely conſidered, he
would have found it more his true Intereſt to have liv'd in a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Subjection to the pure Grace that brings Salvation, and have
kept his mind diligently exerciſed therein, to the perfecting Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the Fear of the Lord, then thus to exalt himſelf againſt an
inoffenſive People; but I leave all with God, whoſe Will be done;
recommending thee (<hi>Reader</hi>) to his holy <hi>Witneſs</hi> in thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to be by that alone Condemn'd or Juſtify'd in this Apologetical
Undertaking.</p>

Spirit of Truth
VINDICATED,
Againſt That of
Error &amp; Envy;
Unſeaſonably Manifeſted:
In a late Malicious LIBEL, Intituled,
The Spirit of the Quakers Tryed, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Cannot but eſteem it a peculiar Providence of Mercy from
the Moſt High God, <hi>to us his poor Deſpiſed People,</hi> though an
Inſtance of great Unkindneſs in our Adverſary; that after
our ſeveral years preſſure, <hi>under the Heavy Calumnies of being
involved with a Socinian Confederacy,</hi> he ſhould ſo ſuffer it to come
to paſs, that without the leaſt Provocation given on our parts,
<hi>one of that ſort of men ſhould become our Compurgator,</hi> indeed our beſt
Advocate in pleading againſt us; for whilſt he goes about to
detect the <hi>Quakers</hi> of an Erronious Spirit, <hi>it is to be ſuppoſed, that
he denies them any ſhare in his; and therefore no</hi> Socinians. I hope
whatever comes of this Debate, we ſhall no longer ſuffer for
being what we are not; it would be hard, that we ſhould both be
condemned for Socinians, and then abuſed for refuſing to be ſo:
Let them not be offended with me if I uſe the word; <hi>its not from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60238:7"/>
any undervalue of the Man they take it from, nor out of any Reproach to
them; but only as a word of Difference to diſtinguiſh Perſons or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And without any other Prologue or Introduction, I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to the Book it ſelf.</p>
            <p>§. 1. Firſt then,<note place="margin">Tit. P. 1.</note> He is pleaſed to allow us, at leaſt, a
great many among us, <hi>To be Honeſt-hearted, yet wonderfully
deluded, and very Dangereus to the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
it is no wonder, when men will make themſelves Work, and
rather then want it, beſtow their Cavils at the Truth it ſelf, that
they ſhould fall into ſtrange and impertinent Contradiction; but
that any man pretending ſo highly to Reaſon and Religion
ſhould ſhew ſo little Underſtanding in either, as to conceive
that a Man can be <hi>properly Honeſt-hearted,</hi> and yet Deluded, and
Dangerous to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; I confeſs is beyond my
skill to reconcile.</p>
            <p>I deſire, God knows, <hi>to be the Honeſt-hearted Man, and let him
take the reſt to himſelf:</hi> For that which reduces man (<hi>fallen ſhort of
the Glory of God</hi>) to an Honeſt Heart, and a Life good and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
as our Adverſary ſpeaks of us, <hi>muſt be the Grace of God
through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and not another thing;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>who has that, is not Deluded, nor Dangerous to the</hi> Chriſtian
<hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. <hi>If we Excel in all things,</hi> as he confeſſeth; which
is to ſay,<note place="margin">pag. 1.</note> that there are but few things wherein we don't
tranſcend all others; how poſſibly can we be Dangerous
and Diſhonourable to the Chriſtian Religion? Is the
Chriſtian Religion among the few things, wherein we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
wanting, which is the main thing of all? if ſo, <hi>What are
the many?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. It was ill done, and an Aggravation not only of
his Uncharitableneſs and Incivility,<note place="margin">pag. 1, 2.</note> but his great Injuſtice
and Deceit, to refuſe us his Name, upon a Pretence of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Subject for our Perſonal Reflection, <hi>whilſt both
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60238:7"/>
his Beginning and End is an entire Abuſe againſt our Perſons and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what he owns Praiſe-worthy in us, is not becauſe he
would be honeſt to us; but that he might by paying us our due in
leſſer matters, <hi>the more plauſibly Rob us of our Right to what is of more
weighty Importance,</hi> namely, <hi>The true Life and Doctrine of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
which ſhews how little a ſhare he has of either.</p>
            <p>§. 4. Nor does he leſs then palpably belye us, in telling
the World,<note place="margin">pag. 2.</note> We condemn all Vertuous Perſons whatſoever,
if not of our own Perſwaſion; ſince we never held nor
defended any other then the Principle of Vertue (there is
<hi>none good but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

conformable to him, thoſe we eſteem our beſt Friends;</hi> our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
with the World, not being about dark, obſtruſe, unprofitable
Notions, nor Conteſts about words; <hi>but mens being ſo rich in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and ſo barren in Obedience; they ſaying, They will go, and they
do not; praying, Thy Will be done, and they never ſet about to do it;
which Will is their Sanctification, through the Eternal Spirit, if they
would but obey the Convincing Light thereof in their own Conſciences;</hi>
ſince it was given, that all might be convinced of ſin; and in
being converted and led by it, <hi>they might be adopted Children of
God, and Heirs of his Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. Chriſt's Perſon (which he prejudicially ſayes we
deny) is (ſtrictly conſidered) an Unſcriptural Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">pag. 2.</note>
for that place which ſeems moſt to countenance ſuch a
way of ſpeaking, <hi>viz. 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 10. is to be underſtood,

like: and it ill becomes a man to write againſt others for pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>§. 6. His Darkneſs, <hi>in reflecting upon our Heaven within us,
denying us to have a due regard to things above on Chriſt's Right-Hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 2.</note>
is as thick as <hi>Aegypt</hi>'s; for if God's Preſence makes
the Heaven, as we have been alwayes taught, and all have
believed and confeſt; then, ſince God vouchſafes to <hi>Temple and
Tabernacle in men,</hi> it follows, that his <hi>Heaven is there alſo:</hi> but
certainly this conceited man fancies with ſottiſh <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton,</hi>
and the vain <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> of old, <hi>That God's in the
ſhape of a Man, and that Heaven is a Viſible Place to be liv'd in, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome reſemblance to this viſible World;</hi> which characters him
more <hi>Mahomaton</hi> then <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> otherwiſe he could never be ſo
ſtupid or Malicious, as to conceive, that becauſe we aſſert a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and heavenly Enjoyment of God's Preſence within us,
<hi>therefore we deny Christ the Dignity of his Father's Right-Hand above
us,</hi> or that there is no ſuch thing as ſetting our Affections on
things that are above: What can be more dark and ignorant
then this mans inference?</p>
            <p>§. 7. But he further tell us, <hi>That though we are much to
be commended for our Courage and Patience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 2.</note> 
               <hi>yet we are highly to
be diſcommended for our Superſtition and groſs Ignorance.</hi> I
dare warrant, the man is highly opinionated of this
fine gingling Phraiſe: But its beyond the ken of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Knowledge (as he thinks) to vindicate his own Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Folly and Inconſiſtence, as well as juſtifie his Abuſe of
us thereby: for I utterly deny, <hi>That any man can be much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for his Religious Courage and Patience</hi> (Divine Gifts) and yet
be <hi>ſuperſtitious, and groſly ignorant;</hi> for the Day is not an effect of
Light, more then <hi>Heat, Paſſion, Perſecution, Frowardneſs and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
are the proper and Natural fruits of ſuperſtition and groſs
Ignorance:</hi> But ſuch as have done the Will of God have need of
Patience; Why? becauſe it works Experience, and that Hope,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60238:8"/>
which makes not aſhamed, nor afraid; the want of which made
this man, with the reſt of his Serpentine Aſſociates, creep
and cringe to this and the other conforming Chaplin (friendly
to their Faith) as the <hi>Mountains and Rocks that were only able to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the gloomy day of ſevere Inquiſition after, and Perſecution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the deſpiſed</hi> Quakers; this is the meaning of his following
words, <hi>Whereby you expoſe your ſelves in great part to thoſe Labours
and Hazzards you undergo;</hi> to render which into better Engliſh,
thus, That becauſe you will walk in an <hi>inconformable Way to the
World, too ſeverely preſs a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Life, as that without which you
deny all poſſibility of Salvation,</hi> particularly in keeping your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>not forſaking the aſſembling of your ſelves together;</hi> and refuſing
to acquieſs in the obedience of thoſe Laws about Oaths and
Tythes; and ſometimes going to bear a Sermon, to prevent
Excommunication, and the Brand of Phanaticiſm; or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
with the like <hi>Convenient Prudent Actions;</hi> you do unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
ruin your ſelves into Sufferings, and bring upon you
what you might with <hi>Chriſtian Policy</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion</hi> ſecure your
ſelves from.</p>
            <p>And if he denies my comment, I am able to prove it upon better
terms, then he can our Superſtition and Ignorance: for with
him and his Brethren <hi>to think Practice more neceſſary then Notion,
is want of Diſcretion; and to be Plain in the Profeſſion of our
Faith, and Conſtant, is the Superſtition and Headineſs he chargeth
us with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>But he promiſeth for the future to decline this way

            <p>I will not give him the <hi>Lye,</hi> but I hope he will not ſay I am
Uncivil or Unchriſtian, if I tell him, He has already contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted

the ſober Reader judge.</p>
            <p>§. 9. But when did any of our Leading-men, as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to call them, refuſe this <hi>Idle Boaſter,</hi> indeed a <hi>very Dreamer,</hi>
ſuch ſober rational Conference, in Publick or Private, by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal

were never the men that deny'd it on thoſe termes, wherein it
might redound to ſuch Chriſtian Advantage, as ſhould be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
aimed at in the like Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>§. 10. And for accepting the <hi>weakeſt Reaſon that is on our ſide;</hi>
I ſhall only ſay, That ſo very grateful is the loweſt degree of
Reaſon to us, whereſoever we find it, that we can no more deny
it, or occaſionally refuſe our ſelves the uſe of it, then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
ſince its being ſo does not <hi>unreaſon</hi> it, or render it <hi>no Reaſon
in it ſelf;</hi> though confeſſedly a leſs degree of Reaſon: nor is it
poſſible that the meaneſt Appearance of Reaſon can withſtand
the greateſt, ſince Reaſon alwayes acknowledgeth and owneth
her ſelf, in what Degree ſoever ſhe meets: It is not <hi>Stature that
makes a Man, nor Magnitude a Tree or Stone, but the Nature and
Property of each.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly we are well contented with our weak Reaſon (as he
is pleaſed to call it) we know it to be God's <hi>Light, Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Truth;</hi> that ſince we gave our Minds intirely to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and exerciſed by it, <hi>We have found that Mortification of Sin
and Corruption, that Renewing of Heavenly Divine Life, that holy
Courage and Patience, and it has brought us to ſo good an Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Myſteries of God's Eternal Kingdom, and Aſſurance (as we
are faithful to the ſame) of Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs;</hi> that 'tis beyond
the power of the ratling of theſe Leaves of Charge and Reproach
to ſcare us from our <hi>Standing,</hi> or beget the leaſt Queſtion in us
concerning the certainty of this Pure Unchangeable Way of
God, in which we walk; but is inviſible to his <hi>vulterous</hi> Eye, who
ſo diſdainfully writes againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I had ſome hopes he had done with Perſonal Conteſt, at leaſt,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60238:9"/>
againſt the Body; but I find him ſtill in his Reflections,</hi> For
whilſt you look upon your ſelves as led by an infallible Spirit (though it be
indeed nothing but the Fancy of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> or ſome other of your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
you muſt needs reject the cleareſt Light that God hath given to Men

ever any) to the Dreams and Fancies of a few illiterate men,
under <hi>an Apprehenſion of being led, not by them; but an Infalible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
Yet ſince in this one Expreſſion lies wrapt up, if not his great
undervalue of an Infallible Spirit, at leaſt, his Disbelief of any
ſuch thing, as the Guide of men, and his unworthy Reflection
upon us in crediting any ſuch Doctrine, I am more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
engag'd to ſtate and vindicate that one <hi>moſt neceſſary Doctrine,</hi>
(viz.) <hi>Whether God's holy and Infallible Spirit be the proper Rule of Faith,
Judge of Controverſies, and Guide of a Chriſtian Life, or any other thing:</hi>
this I reckon as the main Hing on which all turns, and I now make
it my <hi>Post,</hi> by which in God's Strength I am reſolved to ſtand
firm in its Defence, and that by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> hoping,

               <head>The Queſtion Stated.</head>
               <p>Whether God's Holy and Unerring Spirit (<hi>for I am ſo Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
as to think he believes God's Spirit to be ſo</hi>) is, or
ſhould be the proper Judge of Truth, Rule of Faith, and Guide of
Life among men, eſpecially under the Adminiſtration of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, or not? <hi>I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, and proceed to prove it both by</hi> Scripture <hi>and</hi>
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. And the Lord ſaid, My Spirit ſhall not alwayes
ſtrive with man, for that he alſo is Fleſh; yet his dayes ſhall be an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Twenty Years, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If God's Unerring Spirit has been wont to ſtrive with men,
either to convince them of, and convert them from the Evil of
their Thoughts, words and Deeds; or elſe, to provoke them yet
more fully to do the Will of God, ſo as to preſs on from one
degree of Glory to another; then Men have had an Unerring
Spirit to be their Teacher, and Judge and Rule, and Guide
of that Truth, concerning that Faith, and in that moſt holy
Way which leads to Eternal Life: But the Scripture proves the
firſt Propoſition, <hi>That God's Spirit has frequently ſtrove with men,</hi>
and for the Ends before-mentioned; and conſequently, they have
not <hi>been without an Holy Vnerring Spirit to Teach, Judge, Regulate
and Guide them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 19, 20. Yet thou in thy manifold Mercies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſookeſt
them not in the Wilderneſs; the Pillar of the Cloud departed not
from them by Day, to lead them in the Way; neither the Pillar of
Fire by Night, to ſhew them Light, and the Way wherein they ſhould
go.</p>
               <p>Thou gaveſt alſo thy good Spirit to inſtruct them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60238:10"/>
If under the Diſpenſation of the Law, God gave his good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to inſtruct his People, which is to ſay, <hi>that it ſhould teach them,
rule them, and guide them</hi> in whatever was neceſſary for them to
know or do; otherwiſe God's Spirit would have been lame and
defective in his holy Inſtruction (which far be it from any ſober
man to affirm) then will it follow, that <hi>much more ſhould the ſame
Eternal Spirit be poured out under the glorious Diſpenſation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:</hi>
But, all that acknowledge the Divine Authority of the
Scriptures muſt confeſs to God's Goodneſs to his People in the
outward Wilderneſs, in the free Gift of his Eternal Spirit; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Eternal Spirit was and is the Teacher, Judge, Rule and Guide
of his People now:</hi> beſides, that ſtate was but figurative of the
Myſtical Travel of the true Church in the dayes of the Goſpel;
and how is God ſo propitious now as then, <hi>if he be not as a Pillar of
Cloud by Day, and of Fire by Night,</hi> I mean Spiritually and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly,
<hi>ſo to illuminate his People concerning the way he would have them
to walk in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job 32. 8. Prov.</hi> 2. 6. But there is a Spirit in man, and
the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them Vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>For the Lord giveth Wiſdom; out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge
and Vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>If the Spirit in man, <hi>be not of man,</hi> as the foregoing words
ſhew, and therefore is that divine Spirit, by and from which
comes the Inſpiration of the Almighty; and if the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he moſtly intended, be of Divine and Eternal Matters, as
the whole Subject treated on in the preceeding and following
Chapters, as well as that in which the words are, manifeſts; <hi>then
is it not from the ſtrength of mans Reaſon, Memory, or utmoſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Ability, that his Knowledge of Religious and Heavenly Things
comes; but from the Revelation and Diſcovery of the Inſpiration of
the Almighty?</hi> And if by ſuch Divine Inſpirings it be that the
Will of God comes to be underſtood, then certainly <hi>muſt God's
unerring Spirit be the Judge of what is God's Will from what is not, and
the Rule how and in what we ought to believe unto Salvation, and that
Guide which infallibly leads in the Way that is moſt acceptable with the
Lord.</hi> Nothing can be more Natural then theſe Conſequences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60238:11"/>
Fourthly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 7. Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall I flee from thy Preſence.</p>
               <p>If God's Unerring Spirit be ſo nigh, and the ſenſe of it ſo
certain, it muſt either be to reprove for Evil done, or to inform,
uphold, lead and preſerve in reference to all Good: Now in
which of the two ſences it ſhall be taken, the <hi>Preſence of God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spirit, and his being the Saints Inſtructor, Judge, Rule and Guide,</hi>
are evidently deduceable from the words.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 10. Teach me to do thy Will; for thou art my
God: thy Spirit is good; lead me into the Land of Vprightneſs.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion will be, Whether it was <hi>David</hi>'s intent, and the
ſcope of his deſire, that God ſhould teach and lead him by his
good Spirit, or ſome other thing; but methinks it is reſolvable
in the affirmative in two reſpects.</p>
               <p>1. In that <hi>David</hi> is ſo very frequent in his deſire to the Lord
for the Aſſiſtance, Strength, Teaching and Guidance of God's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Spirit; otherwiſe declaring, <hi>how that the Word was hid in his
Heart;</hi> and largly ſpeaking of the Force of that Internal Law,
Word and Spirit of God, which plentifully ſhews, how much he
was an <hi>Enthuſiaſt and Quaker</hi> in the ſenſe this man eſteems us moſt
hetrodox.</p>
               <p>2. The very words imply the thing we urge them for, and can
import no other ſence, viz. <hi>That God would pleaſe to teach him to do
his Will, and lead him into the Land of Vprightneſs by his good Spirit:</hi>
elſe, what did that Claws do there, the Unerring Spirit being
that by which God vouchſafes to diſcover his Divine Knowledge,
and convey his moſt Spiritual Succor and Conſolation to his
People? and conſequently his Saints have ever known, but do
more eſpecially under the Goſpel, <hi>injoy an infallible Judge, Rule and
Guide in and about Faith and Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 1. Wo to the Rebellious Children, ſaith the Lord,
that take Counſel, but not of me; and that cover with a Covering, but
not of my Spirit; that they may add ſin to ſin.</p>
               <p>From whence I plainly argue thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60238:11"/>
If they are Rebellious againſt God, and add ſin to ſin, who
take not Counſel of him, and are not covered with his Holy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Spirit, that <hi>leads into all Truth, Innocence, Patience, Faith,
Hope, Charity, and every good Word and Work.</hi> Then</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God's Children have an</hi> Immediate Councellor, and need not
another; and are covered, or encompaſt about by the infallible Spirit of
God to all Soundneſs of Mind and Holineſs of Life. <hi>And</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They muſt be Heinous Offenders, and obſtinately Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Adders of ſin to ſin with a witneſs, that not only neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
or refuſe to be ſo counſel'd and cover'd; <hi>but diſpute fervently
againſt it,</hi> as a meer <hi>Whimſie,</hi> and Effect of an Ignorant Erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſpirit; for beſides that ſuch deprive themſelves and others of
the unſpeakable benefit that comes thereby, they are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to God, and do certainly incur his fierce Wrath in their
ſo wicked requital of him for his Heavenly Gift.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. As for me, this is my Covenant with them,
ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my Words which I have
put in thy Mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out
of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed's Seed,
ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and forever.</p>
               <p>I think it is granted by all that own the Chriſtian Religion,
that this remarkable place refers to Chriſt, the true Seed and Heir
of promiſe, who bruiſeth the Head of the Serpent, in whom
alone all Nations of them that believe come to obtain the
Bleſſing: But whether it will be allowed, or another Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
allotted (as that the Promiſe was to the Church)
to be ſure here is enough to maintain our Poſition, viz. That
God, in the dayes of the Goſpel more particularly, has given
his good Spirit for an Inſtructer, Judge, Rule and Guide, in
all that concerns the Eternal Well-being of the Souls of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as I proceed to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If that very ſame Eternal, Holy and unerring Spirit, which
God poured out upon his only begotten Son,</hi> be in a way of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
ordained to continue with and upon all the Faithful, his Seed, and
Seed's Seed, begotten unto a lively Hope by the raiſing of Chriſt Jeſus from
the dead, and ſo become Members of his own Glorious Body, then are
not the Children of God deſtitute of his Vnerring Spirit, not left to their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60238:12"/>
own frail, and fallible Judgments, to determine of what is Right or
Wrong, what Men ſhould believe, and what not, how they ſhould walk,
and how not.</p>
               <p>But ſo gratious is the Promiſe, and ſo certain is the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
(as we livingly witneſs againſt all the dry cavelling Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngers
in the World (who Quarrel about the holy-mens
words, and are Strangers to the Convictions, Judgments,
Tryals, Tribulations, Temptations and Travels they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went,
in order to that knowledge they had (and which frets
their ſerpentine natures, whoſe vulterous Eye would in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
ſtate of Worldly Wiſdom, that knows not God,
fain (without the Death of the Croſs) creep into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the myſtery of the Reſurrection, which ſtate alone knows
the things that are above, at the Right-hand of God.)</p>
               <p>Therefore I conclude, That God's Unerring Spirit under the
Goſpel, <hi>does attend, aſſiſt, direct, and finally eſtabliſh his Children in
the Way of Truth;</hi> and that his ſo doing is but the Anſwer or
Accompliſhment of the moſt eminent Propheſies, referring
to the Tranſcendent Glory of the laſt Ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. And I will put my Spirit within you,
and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments,
and do them.</p>
               <p>Behold a moſt pregnant Inſtance in the expreſs Language of
the Holy Ghoſt, brought to the proof of our Aſſertion, that
(with reverence we would ſay it) ſcarcely could it have
been more exactly and emphatically worded, as I proceed to
ſhew.</p>
               <p>1. That this Paſſage has a relation to the Times of Reformation,
or Coming of the Meſſiah, and Dayes of the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
read the whole Chapter. I know not that it was ever
doubted, or otherwiſe taken by any, <hi>no not the very Rabbies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
who from ſuch places have obſerved the coming of a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,
and Glorious times that would enſue.</p>
               <p>2. That if it be granted, then the <hi>Vnerring Spirit of God was
to be placed within the Hearts and Conſciences of his People,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
they could not be properly and truly under the new
Covenant; and be without it, ſince the having of that Eternal
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60238:12"/>
Spirit for the Ends and Purpoſes afore-mentioned, is the
very Badge, Condition, and Mark of the New and Laſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It ſeems to be the means under the Goſpel, by which</hi> God
cauſes his Children to keep his Statutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will put my Spirit within
you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes; and ye ſhall keep my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and do them.</p>
               <p>To conclude (to ſpeak ſtrictly) If in the dayes of the ſecond
Covenant, which began from Chriſt's viſible Appearance, God
put his Spirit within his People, as ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
and that it was thereby he did and doth cauſe them to
walk in his Statutes and keep his Judgments; then <hi>God's Children
are not without an Infallible Teacher and Leader in the Things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to their Eternal Salvation:</hi> But we plainly ſee and read
from the very Letter of the Scriptures, that God gives his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
or Light within, to Judge, Lead and Guide;</hi> and conſequently,
the oppoſit Doctrine is both falſe and very pernicious. I
might further argue thus, That if God's Unerring Spirit only
enables men to walk in his Statutes, and keep his Judgments to
do them, then <hi>ſince all are required to walk therein, none are exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a ſufficient meaſure of that Vnerring Spirit in order to it.</hi>
Much might be argued hereon, but this ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28, 29. And it ſhall come to paſs afterward, that
I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſhall Propheſie, your Old Men ſhall dream Dreams, your Young Men
ſhall ſee Viſions: And alſo upon the Servants and upon the Hand-maids
in thoſe dayes will I pour out my Spirit.</p>
               <p>That this is generally believed, and frequently quoted as a
Proof of Goſpel-Times, is well known to moſt who are inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
after Matters of Religion, and how hard it bears upon
the Anti-ſpiritual Opinion of our cavelling Adverſary, though
very evident; yet we ſhall further proceed to ſhew,</p>
               <p>1. Here is God's Royal Engagement, to effuſe or pour forth
of his bleſſed Spirit in the dayes of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>2. Here is on whom it is to be poured forth, expreſt in two
words, ALL FLESH; in more words, <hi>Young and Old, Men
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60238:13"/>
and Women, Maſters, Miſtreſſes, and Servants:</hi> Mark the Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of God's Mercy and Grace. Now from hence I argue,</p>
               <p>If God's Unerring Spirit be to be poured out on all under the
New Covenant, and that this is the time thereof, <hi>then has God
poured out of his Vnerring Spirit,</hi> as aforeſaid; that the Spirit is
to be poured out under the Adminiſtration of the Goſpel the
Text proves; that this is the Time he himſelf confeſſes, pag. 1,
12, 13, 45. therefore the Concluſion is undeniable, viz. That
God has poured forth of his Holy and Unerring Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, If the Spirit of God is that, without which none can
obtain Propheſie and Viſion, and that Propheſie and Viſion are
Chriſtian-Church Gifts, then, <hi>ſince the Church of Chriſt is not to
be without Propheſies and Viſion to the End of the World;</hi> it follows,
<hi>ſhe cannot be without an infallible Spirit to the end of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus, If without having the Spirit none can have Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
and Viſion, and that Propheſie and Viſion are both to be and
to continue in Chriſt's Church univerſally; then it will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, <hi>that ſhe cannot be without that Vnerring Spirit;</hi> and that
ſuch as are, cannot in that ſtate be <hi>Members of the true Church;</hi>
then conſequently Hereticks, as concerning the true Faith.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 5. According to the Word that I Covenanted
with you when yee came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo my Spirit remaineth among
you, fear not.</p>
               <p>This place doth very emphatically prove my Aſſertion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Judgſhip and Guidance of God's Spirit, two things
ſeem clear.</p>
               <p>1. That it was a part of God's Old Covenant, to wit, That
his Spirit ſhould remain amongſt them.</p>
               <p>2. That the Spirit's ſo remaining was to ſome eminent Service;
for ſaid the Lord, <hi>Fear not;</hi> as much as to ſay, don't faint in
your Minds, concerning the Work you have to do, neither be ye
filled with Doubts or Scruples, who ſhall inform us, who direct
us, or we want a Leader in this difficult matter, ſome one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
our Objections and Fears, and to preſide or be as
Judge among us, how to order and regulate us to the doing of
the Service expected from us; for thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60238:13"/>
remains among you, fear not; He is ſufficient for you, He ſhall teach
and counſel you, repair to Him, adviſe with him,</hi> and you ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with all things neceſſary for you: Don't rebel againſt my
Good Spirit, and you are ſafe; it ſhall be well with you.
In ſhort,</p>
               <p>If it was a Condition of the Old Covenant, That God ſhould
accompany his then Children with the Aſſiſtance and Preſence
of his good Spirit, and accordingly he teſtified by his Prophet,
That his holy Spirit remained among them, <hi>then much more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
it is to believe, that the Preſence of that Eternal Spirit ſhould
continually accompany his Children under the New and Laſt Teſtament:</hi>
The firſt part the Place proves, the ſecond is made good by the
plain import of the following Prophetick verſes, where he ſaith,
<hi>I will ſhake all Nations, and the Deſire of all Nations ſhall come:
And I will fill this Houſe with Glory; and the Glory of this latter Houſe
ſhall be greater then of the former, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How then can it poſſibly be, That God's Evangelical Houſe
and Tabernacle ſhould be a dry, empty, barren erronious man,
alwayes enquiring, but never come to the infallible Knowledge
of the only True God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,
whom to know by the Revelation of the Eternal Spirit is Life
Everlaſting?</p>
               <p>Nay, who ſo great, who ſo pernicious Enemies to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
Glory of the latter Houſe, and Temple of God, <hi>as the
cavelling Anti-ſpiritual Men of our Age,</hi> who are ſo angry with
thoſe that own a <hi>Conviction, Faith and Worſhip grounded upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Inſpiration,</hi> that their Rage leads them (becauſe they
feel it not) to the utter denying of any ſuch things: but I will
aſſure them, they ſhall yet grope in the dark, till they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the daily obedience of the Light, <hi>and there reſt contented to know
only as they experience;</hi> and not from a ravening comprehending
Brain, that would, in its unregenerated ſtate, graſp at the
clear Myſteries of the Kingdom; into which, fleſhly Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
and Notions can never enter: but all muſt be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
from their firſt Birth, Education and traditional read
Knowledge, as he is unmanned, that is, again become a little
Child, before the Secrets of God's Work come to be made
known; therefore ſaid our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I thank thee,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60238:14"/>
O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things
from the Prudent, and revealed them unto Babes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eleaventhly; <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. Jeſus anſwered, Verily, verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit he cannot enter
into the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>This moſt weighty Scripture, containing the very Work of
Regeneration, and, <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> or that only certain Means,
Condition and Requiſit, without which there can be no obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Eternal Life and Salvation; requires our beſt notice and
conſideration: in order to which I ſhall divide the place into
theſe two Heads, and briefly raiſe my Argument thereon.</p>
               <p>1. Chriſt's moſt poſitive excluſion of all from any Portion in
God's Kingdom who were not born again (in anſwer to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi>
his carnal Conceit of the impoſſibility of an old mans
entring a ſecond time into his Mothers Womb.)</p>
               <p>2. That the Birth which all ſuch as would inhererit God's
Kingdom, ſhould be Witneſſes of, <hi>was and is the Birth of Water
and the Spirit;</hi> upon which I thus proceed to argue,</p>
               <p>If none can Inherit God's Holy Kingdom, but thoſe who are
regenerated of Water and the Spirit, <hi>then none can inherit God's
Holy Kingdom, but ſuch as are cleanſed by Water, and taught, led
and guided by God's Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt none can deny that own the Scripture, it being but a
part of the very verſe quoted; the ſecond I evidently prove
thus.</p>
               <p>If Water and Spirit be the only operative to Regeneration,
and Regeneration the alone Way to the Kingdom of God, <hi>then
can no man inherit God's Kingdom,</hi> that <hi>is not regenerated;</hi> neither
can any man be regenerated, that is not <hi>waſhed by the Water of
Life, begotten, work't, formed, inſpired and acted by that Eternal
Spirit to Newneſs of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That to be begotten, is to be principally guided and acted by
that by which any is ſo begotten, I prove.</p>
               <p>No man can live, move, ſenſate or act but from the original
Heat, Life, Motion and Action of that which did beget him;
becauſe the Nature of that which begets, being conveyed to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60238:14"/>
begotten, truly renders him begotten, or elſe there were no
ſuch thing: <hi>but every regenerate man is the Begotten of the Eternal
Spirit, ſo far as concerns his Renovation or Regeneration; therefore every
ſuch regenerated man was and is led, motion'd and acted by that Eternal
Spirit which begot him;</hi> and conſequently, the Saints which are the
regenerated, are not left deſtitute of an infallible Teacher, Judge,
Rule and Guide amongſt them.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, We look upon being born of Water and the Spirit
to be, <hi>Our being cleanſed from all filthineſs, and quickened, informed,
ruled and guided by the moſt pure and perfect Dictates and Operations of
God's Eternal Spirit:</hi> And how a Regenerated man can be made or
continue ſuch, without the daily Guidance of that Infallible Spirit,
<hi>and the Scriptures kept clear from the Reflection of Contradiction, if
not groſs Error,</hi> is a Riddle too hard for me to explain, and a
Task I may without Preſumption ſay too great for our trifling
Antagoniſt to perform.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18, 20. &amp; 16. 13. And I will pray
the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
with you forever: Even the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot
receive, becauſe it ſeeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; but ye know
him; for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you. I will not leave you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs,
I will come to you; at that day ye ſhall know, that I am in my
Father, and you in me, and I in you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Howbeit, when he the Spirit of Truth is come, be will guide
you into all Truth.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Divine Paſſages, thus particularly expreſt by the
Holy Ghoſt, I offer theſe ſhort Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. If the Spirit of Truth, or moſt infallible Spirit, be God's
Gift to his Servants, in Goſpel times, to abide with them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
then <hi>are they accompanied with an infallible Spirit:</hi> but we ſee
the plain Text proves, that God gives his Spirit of Truth to his
Servants, that they might be aſſiſted in all their Wants; and
therefore they are not without ſuch an infallible Spirit. And our
Adverſary is more to blame to reflect upon the Guidance of an
infallible Spirit, which is ſo conſonant with the expreſs Letter of
a multitude of Scripture Paſſages, then <hi>we are becauſe we credit</hi>
G. F. <hi>upon Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60238:15"/>
And if he tells us, That unleſs we believe what our Eyes ſee
of Contradictions (as he pretends) by him collected out of
<hi>G. F</hi>'s Book, that he will not believe whatever we ſhall ſay or
affirm; we may on much better Grounds conclude, never to
believe what he aſſerts, and wholy to decline writing or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him (to uſe his own words) if hereafter he will dare to
continue in the belief of ſo Anti-ſcriptural and Anti-goſpel an
Apprehenſion, as that there <hi>is no infallible Spirit to guide men in the
Way of Salvation;</hi> which is as expreſs and evident from many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Texts of Scripture, as that <hi>God is Truth;</hi> elſe never did any
Writing more delude Mankind, becauſe none could be more
particular and plain in the Promiſe and allowance of it: But
<hi>let God and his written Will be true, and our Vnſpiritual Adverſary in
his confeſt Fallible Judgment of us a very Lyar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If the not ſeeing and knowing of the Spirit of Truth be
the Reaſon rendred by our Lord Jeſus, why the World receives
it not, then may we moſt juſtly infer, that they never ſaw it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know it; but are of the World, who cannot receive it, but
write againſt it, in reference to its greateſt Office (<hi>viz.) Of being
the Saints Teacher, Leader and Comforter.</hi> And indeed, becauſe
the Spirit is not ſome viſible elementary thing, that may be ſeen
by their outward Eyes, and be comprehended by their dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
and diſputative Brains (which is contrary to the Decree
and Way of God's manifeſting of his Will from the conviction of
the leaſt ſin, to the enjoyment of the higheſt Glory) therefore
<hi>they diſ-regard it as contemptible, and diſ-believe it as incredible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If the Ground of the Saints Knowledge of that Infallible
Spirit, be the <hi>Spirit's inhabiting them</hi> (for, <hi>He dwelleth with you,
and ſhall be in you</hi>) then <hi>were they not without that Spirit;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they were attended with an infallible Guide within them.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>If the Lord Jeſus would not leave them comfortleſs, but
though viſibly with-drawn, yet in a more Spiritual and Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner would come to them again; and that</hi> at that day they
ſhould know, that He was in his Father, they in Him, and He in them:
Then were his Servants not deſtitute of an infallible Judge, Leader and
Guide, becauſe they had Him that was the Way, Truth and Life, to
whom all Power and Judgment were committed.</p>
               <p>5. If both the Spirit of Truth was promiſed to come, and when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60238:15"/>
come, to guide into all Truth; that is to ſay, that whateve
they ſcrupled, were ignorant in, or ought to know and practicer
with what they were oblieged to reject and teſtifie againſt, ſhould,
be by that Eternal Spirit diſcovered unto them; then <hi>undoubtedly
they were not without an infallible Spirit, to Judge, Regulate and Guide
them, in all that concerned Faith, Worſhip and Converſation:</hi> but the
firſt Propoſition is purely Scriptural, and therefore the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
not deniable by ſuch as own the Divine Truths contained
in thoſe Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor is the dint of this to be avoided by ſaying, That theſe
Promiſes were only to the Apoſtles, and no body denies them to
have had all this;</hi> for if we are to walk, as having them for our
Examples, we are to have the like Sufficiency and Guide. <hi>Nor does
Chriſt leave the matter there; for in his moſt ſolemn Prayer to
his Father he thus ſpeaks,</hi> Neither Pray I for theſe alone, but for
all them that ſhall believe on me through their word, that they all may
be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they all may be one
in us: <hi>which how it is poſſible for thoſe who then believed, and
us of after Generations to be,</hi> without being born of, and baptized
and drunk into the ſame one Eternal Spirit, <hi>I know not to believe,
neither can any man that gives himſelf the uſe of his own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 9, 14. There is therefore now no Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but
after the Spirit; but you are not in the Fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be
that the Spirit of God dwell in you: now if any man have not the Spirit
of Chriſt, he is none of his. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,
they are the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>1. If to be brought and kept out of Condemnation, men muſt
walk according to the Leadings and Guidings of the Spirit of
God, and that it is a ſtate unto which Chriſtian men ſhould come,
then <hi>are they not without God's Infallible Spirit to lead and direct them
in what Way they ought to walk,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is perniciouſly falſe;</hi> ſince ſuch muſt needs live ever under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
who are ſo far from walking after the <hi>Leadings of
God's unerring Spirit, that they deny men to have any ſuch thing.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60238:16"/>
2. If to have the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling (that is, <hi>ruling</hi>) in us, be
to live no more after the Fleſh; and not to have that infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt ruling in us, be to be none of Chriſt's; then <hi>both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
men ſhould not be without Chriſt's Spirit dwelling in them; and
ſuch as are without that Spirit are none of Chriſt's:</hi> But we plainly
ſee, that the Apoſtle aſſerts, That every man that walks not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Fleſh, has that Spirit dwelling in him, and is guided
thereby; and that ſuch as have not the holy Spirit of Chriſt, are
none of Chriſt's; therefore it follows, That Chriſtian men are
led by an Infallible Spirit. But</p>
               <p>3. If as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of
God, as ſaith the Apoſtle, then <hi>both God's Children are led by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit, and ſuch as are not we utterly deny to have any part or
portion in Him, notwithſtanding their Praying, Preaching, Writing,
Reading and Diſputing:</hi> but the plain unaltered words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teſtifie, that both God has given his good Spirit to lead men
into that holy Life, Nature and Converſation, by which they
truly become his Image and Children; and that ſuch (and we
may ſay, only ſuch) are his own begotten Children, and Heirs of
Eternal Glory.</p>
               <p>Fourteenth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12, 14, 15. But God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit teacheth all things, yea, the
deep things of God.</p>
               <p>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man,
which is in him; even ſo the Things of God know no man but the Spirit
of God.</p>
               <p>Now we have received not the ſpirit of this World, but the Spirit
which is of God, that we might know the Things that are freely given
to us of God.</p>
               <p>But the Natural man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God;
for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they
are ſpiritually diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ued.</p>
               <p>But he that is Spiritual judgeth (<hi>or diſcerneth</hi>) all things, yet he
himſelf is judged (<hi>or diſcerned</hi>) of no man.</p>
               <p>Methinks the bare recital of theſe pathetical Sayings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt on the matter in controverſie might be ſufficient Proof
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60238:16"/>
for the affirmative of the Queſtion, did not our Adverſary under
all his Pretences of honouring the Scriptures, either implicitly
deny them their juſt Authority, or by falſe Gloſſes diſguiſe and
pervert them to his ſiniſter Perſwaſions; and ſo I proceed, as before,
to offer my Arguments upon them.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>If the Bleſſed Things which God hath prepared for them
that love him, are not revealable, but by his Spirit, and were
then thereby revealed, as ſays the Scripture quoted, and contex;
then</hi> ſince there were thoſe at that time who loved God, and that there be
many now who love God, it will Naturally follow, That both than and
now, the Things that God has laid up for ſuch, both then were and now
are revealed by His Eternal Spirit; <hi>and conſequently,</hi> God's
People are not without a familiar Communion with the Holy Spirit of
God.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>If the ſpirit of a man, or humane intelligent ſpirit, be that
by which man comes to an underſtanding of thoſe things that
ſtrictly and properly concern him in an humane capacity; and
that the Spirit of God is that only by which man comes to know
the Things of God, becauſe the Things of God knoweth no man
but the Spirit of God; then</hi> it is utterly Impoſſible for our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
himſelf, or any elſe to obtain the Knowledge of the things of God, or
His Kingdom, but by the pure unmixt Revelation of God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spirit, from all the Comprehenſions, Conceivings, or Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of mans utmoſt ſtrength or ſcience (For (<hi>as ſaith the Apoſtle</hi>) the
Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.)</p>
               <p>3. If the Knowledge of thoſe things that are fecely given of
God, is only to be had from the Revelation of his holy Spirit;
then ſince in every Age from the moſt primitive Times, it has
behoved every Chriſtian man to underſtand thoſe Good and
Heavenly Things, it follows, <hi>That it has behoved them, and ſtill
does all, to wait for the Knowledge and Injoyment of thoſe Bleſſed Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which only are revealed by the Eternal Spirit:</hi> And is not that
Science infallible? which the Spirit of this World ever was, and
will be a Stranger too, under all its diſguiſed Shews of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worſhip, with which it has deceitfully adorned it ſelf, in a
way of Scorn of and Oppoſition to the <hi>moſt Spiritual Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of God,</hi> making good the Apoſtle's ſaying, <hi>For they are but
Fooliſhneſs unto them.</hi> To conclude,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60238:17"/>
4. If the Spiritual Man, or that Man in whom dwelleth the
Spirit of God, and who is led by it diſcerneth and judgeth all
things, and is not judged, or cannot be ſeen or diſcerned (he
being in the Light, and the natural man in the dark) then <hi>is or
ſhould God's Holy Spirit be the right Judge, Leader and Guide of all,
becauſe it alone gives true Diſcerning, ſound Judgment, and leads in the
Path of Life Eternal:</hi> for it ſearcheth the deep things of God,
which all Natural Underſtanding can never fathom, becauſe they
are Spiritually to be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Fifteenth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. What? Know ye not that your Body
is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you, which ye have of God?
and ye are not your own.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle treating of the great nearneſs that every Believer
ſtands in to the Lord, and that Bleſſed Union which the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the Goſpel brings to, by the putting away the Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Fleſh and Spirit, and the Anſwer of a good Conſcience
before God; in winding up this ſubject he thus ſmartly, and as
if his Query were enough to clear up all that he had to ſay to
them, as to their Duty, and his Exhortation; <hi>What? know ye not
that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you:</hi> From
whence I draw this Argument,</p>
               <p>If Believers be the Temple, in which the Holy Ghoſt dwells,
as evidently ſpeaks the Scripture, then <hi>are they not left without an
Infalible Spirit, as Judge, Rule and Guide to repair to;</hi> but it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to ſence, that the holy Ghoſt is by the Apoſtle affirmed to
inhabit, or take up his abode in believers; therefore they muſt
needs be attended with an iufallible Spirit; and for what? if not
the End before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>Sixteenth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized

and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p>
               <p>By which Divine Sence of the Apoſtle, we cannot but allow,
that if they were both baptized by one Spirit, into one Body, and
made to drink into the ſame Spirit, that the <hi>Saints were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Infallible Spirit;</hi> ſince ſuch Baptizing and Drinking do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60238:17"/>
and their daily Union with, and intimate Enjoyment of
it the whole courſe of their lives. And certainly, If by that
Eternal Spirit they were baptized ito that one Body Chriſt, <hi>It
was as impoſſible for them, as Members thereof, to live without the Life,
Vertue and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus their Head, as for any natural Body to
live without the ſame Life, Blood, Heat and Motion, which belongs to
its Head.</hi> And how this man can be eſteemed a good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
who would render Chriſt Jeſus the Head of a Fallible Body, by
diveſting Chriſtians of an Infallible Spirit, I leave to Perſons of
better Judgment, more Honeſty, and greater Moderation then

as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from
Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This whole Chapter is an admirable account of the Super-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the Goſpel Adminiſtration of Life, to that of the
Law, how far it did tranſcend it, as to all ſpiritual Knowledge,
Priviledge and Enjoyment, which I deſire the Reader ſeriouſly
to read, as well as to conſider what is offered from the Verſe
cited.</p>
               <p>If a Chriſtian's Change into God's Image, from Glory to
Glory, be the Work of the Eternal Spirit in men, it follows ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily,
<hi>That</hi> Chriſtians <hi>can no more be without the Diſcoveries,
Leadings and Orderings of God's Spirit, then they can be his Children
without his Image</hi> (ſince whatever they think, ſay or do, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Religion, ſhould bear a near Relation to that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of God, which above all things they ought to act corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondently
with) but we ſee how very expreſly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
the Apoſtle deſcribes the exceeding Bleſſedneſs of
the New Covenant, namely, <hi>A being changed into the Image of
God, from Glory to Glory;</hi> not by our own Notions or Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
from the ſtrength of our natural Reaſon, or any Book
without us; but by the Spirit of the Lord operating in us:
therefore God's Children <hi>are not without an infallible Spirit,</hi> unleſs

Chriſtian throughout the whole courſe of his Life, from the firſt
ſtep or meaſure to the fulneſs and perfection of his ſtature, is to
be informed, regulated and guided by the infallible Spirit of God,
as the Apoſtle's Reproof of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> for their declining to

               <p>If the Union betwixt Chriſt and his Children be, that they
dwell in him, and he in them; and that they thereby know it, <hi>by
the Spirit that he hath given them;</hi> which implies, that they had
the Unerring Spirit of Chriſt: <hi>then true Believers are not without
Chriſt and his Spirit dwelling in them, to Guide, Rule, and Inſtruct

               <p>If ſuch as have not the Spirit are ſenſual, <hi>then, becauſe the true
Children of God are not ſenſual, it follows, that they have the Spirit;</hi>
and that thoſe who have it not, are not the Children of God,
becauſe ſuch are ſenſual.</p>
               <p>This the Apoſtle further manifeſts to be his mind, becauſe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſenſualiſts, he addreſſes himſelf to the Sanctified of God,
exhorting them, <hi>To build up one another on their moſt holy Faith,
Praying in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> which ſhews, that they performed
their Worſhip to God in the Motion of the Eternal Spirit;

               <p>Thus have I briefly run through the Scriptures of Truth, and

People in all Ages ſuch a meaſure of his Eternal Spirit, as hath
been ſufficient to <hi>Inform, Rule and Guide them,</hi> infallibly, in and
about thoſe things which are abſolutely neceſſary to be known

muſt either be by the viſible Creation, or <hi>that inviſible Taſte or

knowledge of himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> And as I know not any, who profeſſeth Religion,
that makes the leaſt ſcruple of this; ſo how is it poſſible, that
ſuch Diſcoveries as God himſelf is pleaſed to make, ſhould be
fallible, or ſubject to any Defect in themſelves; for, were
that admitted (as muſt be, upon the Principles of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
then muſt we conclude an Imperfect Knowledge; <hi>nay,
an uncertain</hi> (not to ſay Erronious) <hi>Knowledge of, and Faith in
God,</hi> to be from God's own defective Manifeſtations of himſelf,
which however truly deduced from his Poſitions, <hi>is a moſt
Vnworthy and Falſe Reflection upon the Mercy and Goodneſs of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is an abſolute neceſſity, That what it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for man to know, ſhould be certainly and infallibly
diſcovered to him, becauſe of that great Corruption, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Superſtition, <hi>which through that miſty and uncertain Proſpect
they ſay man has of the Divine Will, he may be ſubject to fall into;</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60238:20"/>
and like the vain Worſhippers of old, conceit an <hi>Ape, Serpent
or Crockedell to be a Deity,</hi> or ſome other Beeings, or Fancies;
though leſs groſs, yet too groſs for a Chriſtian man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Upon our Adverſary's Principles, there can be no
aſſured Ground of Comfort; for when a man ſhall think he
hath workt out his Salvation in the Way he Conceives moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
with God, perhaps he hath followed an Erronious
Judgment, and Unſubject Affection; and when Repentance may
be too late, he is to be fob'd off with ſuch an Award as this,
<hi>You had no Infallible Knowledge, and having lived in an Erronious
ſenſe of your own, you muſt inherit the Diſpleaſure that follows:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
making well or ill, believing or doing, <hi>a meer Lottery, or doing
of things by Chance,</hi> and not from any certain knowledge in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of what God required of them: <hi>A Conceit worthy to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by every ſober man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And were I as our Adverſary, I would never beat
my Brain about what is true or falſe, ſince upon his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
when Truth meets me, <hi>I know her not from Error;</hi> and after
I ſhould have writ Volums, <hi>I am as certain of the Truth of what I
oppoſe, as of what I aſſert:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Quakers</hi> may be in the right
for ought he knows; nor have they any certain grounds from
him on which to alter, or believe the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Nor does this Opinion of our Adverſary (<hi>that there
is no ſuch thing, as man's being now led by an infallible Spirit</hi>) end
there; for it rendereth the Almighty more injuſt then the worſt
of men; ſince firſt he ſeems to offer men the cleareſt Diſcoveries
of ſo much of his Will as he requires them to live conformable
unto; yet, <hi>means nothing leſs, by leaving Mankind to labour under
the perplexity of an uncertain Knowledge:</hi> And ſecondly, Concludes
him, notwithſtanding <hi>under the greateſt certainty of eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks then, If theſe things ſeem unreaſonable (though
the genuine Effects of a fallible Guide) our Adverſary ſhould
by this time think it fit to allow us,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:60238:20"/>
1. <hi>That God cannot be known,</hi> but by the Diſcoveries he
makes of himſelf through his Eternal Power and Spirit unto Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>2. That though ſuch Diſcoveries may be imperfect in Degree,
yet <hi>not in kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>That ſuch Revelation, Diſcovery or Inſtruction is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
true, and that there is nothing wanting on God's part,</hi> to
accommodate man with a Spiritual, Certain, Infallible Diſcovery and
Knowledge of Almighty God his Creator; and therefore man has to
rectifie and aſſiſt his fallible Judgement, an Vnerring, Certain, Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit, Power or Principle, which as man liſtens unto it, and follows
it, his Vnderſtanding becomes illuminated, his Reaſon purified, and
a ſound Judgment reſtored; <hi>and in all things is he made a fit Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
for the Glorious God to live in: Thus is he</hi> King of Saints,
and will he be King of Nations, who is God over all Heaven and Earth,
bleſſed forever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be two Objections, which I fore-ſee may be made by
ſome to the way I have taken to prove, That a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Judge,
Rule and Guide is the Unerring Spirit of God; whom I ſhall
endeavour to anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Though you have ſaid a great deal to prove, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
ſhould have an Infallible Spirit in general; yet you prove
nothing diſtinctly; but confound a Judge, Rule and Guide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<hi>To which I anſwer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That to me there is no more difference, then eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
there can be in the <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice and Holineſs of God</hi>
which are but ſo many words, that agree to expreſs the
Perfection of one and the ſame Beeing; and ſo that as the
one cannot be without the other; but the ſame Eternal Godhead
is all, and <hi>that in all:</hi> for he is truly <hi>Wiſe, in being Juſt,</hi> and both,
<hi>in being Holy;</hi> and back again, they are ſo interwoven, that the
one goes not without the other; thus it is in being a <hi>Judge, Rule
and Guide:</hi> for that which gives me a right Senſe or Judgment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60238:21"/>
of Truth from Error, is as well to me <hi>a Rule, what I ſhould believe,
or diſ-believe; and a Guide, what I ſhould practice, or not practice;
as at firſt it was my Judge, of what was Truth from what was Error.</hi>
So that the ſame Informing Convincing Spirit, is that <hi>Ruling and
Guiding Spirit</hi> (and not a driſtinct Spirit, or medium) by which
ſuch as are convinced through the Illumination and Reproof of
it, are to be ruled and guided in all they believe and practice,
about Matters relating to God and his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 2. But at this rate,</hi> you utterly contemn and ſeclude
the Scriptures, as having no Part nor Portion in being a Judge,
Rule or Guide to <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. By no means; for though we acknowledge it to be our
Principle, That the Eternal Spirit, who in ſeveral Generations
hath revealed a great part of the things contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be ſuperior to theſe Writings; yet far be it from us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>to deny the abſolute neceſſity of our Conformity to ſuch weighty
Chriſtian Truths and Principles, as are therein expreſſed, and urged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Churches, as what are indiſpenſable to eternal Salvation:</hi> So
that we plead not, that the Spirit of God ſhould be a Judge,
Rule and Guide contrary to the Truth declared in Scripture,
<hi>nor yet excluſive of the Scripture;</hi> but as the holy men of old time
were ordered, ruled and guided by that Eternal Spirit, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to thoſe weighty things, which the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
were moved to exhort thoſe of that time to preſs after: ſo that
it is impoſſible for men now to come into a right Chriſtian-frame,
and keep therein, <hi>but by the Spirit's being their Judge, Rule,
and Guide, as he was to the Ancients, who truſted in God, and obtained
a good Report.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In ſhort,</hi> The Scripture is much like the ſhaddow of the true
Rule, which may give us ſome ground to gueſs what the Rule it
ſelf is; <hi>as a Card, or Map of a Country, how it lies, yet not be the very
Place it ſelf:</hi> and in this reſpect it may be a kind of ſecondary
Rule, carrying with it a Teſtimonial Confirmation, that what
we are led by is the TRUE SPIRIT, becauſe the People of
God in old time enjoyed the ſame, as the Eternal Spirit
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60238:21"/>
firſt of all confirms the Divine Authority of the Scriptures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
to us, That they are a Declaration of the Will and
Pleaſure of Almighty God to the Sons of Men in ſeveral Ages of
the World.</p>
               <p>He that is ſo inward with a Prince, as to know, <hi>viva voce,</hi>
what his mind is, heeds not ſo much the ſame when he meets it in
Print (becauſe in Print) <hi>as becauſe he has received a more living
Touch and ſenſible Impreſſion from the Prince himſelf, to whoſe Secrets
he is privy.</hi> And this the Scriptures teach us to believe is a right
Chriſtian's State and Priviledge; for ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>We have
the Mind of Chriſt; and the Secrets of God are with them that fear
Him; and guide me by thy Counſel, and bring me to thy Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Conclude;</hi> The Scriptures we own, and the Divine Truths
therein contained, we reverence and eſteem, as the Mind and
Will of God to men; and we believe that they ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to, according to the true intent of the Holy Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and we know, that all good People will reſpect them, read
them, believe and endeavour to fulfil or obey them: And thoſe
who trade neither <hi>Miniſterially</hi> or <hi>Controverſally</hi> with them, and
are out of that, Cleanſed, Holy and Self-denying State they
teſtifie of, and believe it not attainable, <hi>the Plagues therein declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

that God dwells in us, in ſome moſt ſingular and divine manner, and

VINDICATION
OF
George Fox,
And the TRUTH by him Vindicated,
Particularly his Quotation of Scripture; from

            <p>WE ſhall ſay nothing here of the Diſingenuity of the
Man, in writing againſt a particular Perſon, to prove
a Charge againſt a People, having already pointed at it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place; but ſhall fall to the Charge it ſelf, which I will
faithfully lay down in his own words, and the rather, ſince it
is one main part of his Proof againſt <hi>G. F. that he is an Impoſtor,</hi>
becauſe he renders not the very words of Scripture, though
words importing the ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Pag. 3. If you will but allow us competent Witneſſes to prove that
<hi>G. Fox</hi> killed a man, ſuppoſing we have ſeen him at noon-day thruſt
him through the Heart with a Sword, or if you will grant that we can
read <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and know that A. B. is not C. O. then upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
we will undertake to prove, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> is a falſe Prophet, a
Lyar, or Impoſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:60238:26"/>
This Reader is the Charge; And doſt thou not think it is <hi>rarely</hi>
drawn up? Well may I ſay rarely, for I dare ſay, it is the firſt of
the ſort that is extant in the World.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I am at a ſtand what he intends with his ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Introduction to it; for I as little underſtand what the man
means <hi>by allowing Vs Competent Witneſs</hi> (when the <hi>Vs</hi> are to ſee the
thing done) as he can pretend Difficulty in the obſcureſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Writings: for either he ſhould have ſaid; <hi>If you
will but allow Vs</hi> (to be) <hi>competent Witneſſes,</hi> ſuppoſing we have
ſeen him at Noon-day, &amp;c. or if, as by him already Phrais'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> If you will but allow Us competent Witneſſes (leaving out
<hi>to be</hi>) then ſay I, it ſhould be, ſuppoſing They, (and not We)
have ſeen him at Noon-day, &amp;c. for as expreſt, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Witneſſes: But if this be ſo trivial, as that our time
might have been better ſpent, and our Charity have over lookt it,
as a ſlip of the Mans Pen, or in the Compoſitors Setting: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
he was as laviſh of his Time as penurious in his Charity,
that, without any Juſt Provocation, he ſhould trouble the world
with an enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Book, containing little elſe but a Collection of
ſuch ſlender (at moſt) omiſſions, enlarg'd with his own <hi>malicious
Comments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but it is now time, that we ſhould ſee this wonderful
diſcovery he has made of <hi>George Fox,</hi> and that ſo plain, as killing
a man at noon-day (which unhandſom Compariſon is no mean
Inſtance of his own vexed, baſe, and murdering Spirit) or as his
Mathematical Demonſtration, that A. B. is not C. O. for which
peculiar and eaſie way of well-expreſſing of a Charge, we remain
his Debtors.</p>
            <p>To prove this Charge (the only thing we want, for of falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers
and Accuſations we have enough) he thus goes about it,
to uſe his own words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If G. Fox</hi> in matters of concernment, not only to mens Bodies and
Eſtates, but alſo to their Souls and eternal Eſtates, affirm that to be true,
which to your own Eyes is manifeſtly falſe, or that to be falſe, which is
true. <hi>Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If</hi> G. F. doth belye not an ordinary Perſon, a mortal Man
or Prince, but God Almight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt.
Moreover, If he deal thus through Deſign and Purpoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> then he is what
I have ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> a falſe Prophet, Lyar, and Impoſtor with a Witneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:60238:27"/>
This is but <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> or a meer begging of the queſtion,
nothing is more proved here then in the Charge it ſelf, nay it is
but the Repetition of the Charge, expreſſed in other tearms; Yet
to it ſo expreſſed, I return in ſhort thus much.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I deny that <hi>George Fox</hi> his affirming things to be true
which are falſe, and falſe which are true, to be obvious to our
Eyes or Sences; for we can ſee no ſuch thing: And ſince we are
ſo to ſee them, in order to the Concluſion, it follows, that <hi>he is
no falſe Prophet, Lyar or Impoſtor by his own Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, I utterly deny, that <hi>George Fox</hi> ſo affirming
or aſſerting, ſuppoſing as our Adverſary ſays of him, renders
him either a <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> or <hi>Impoſtor;</hi> ſince he only is a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that either runs to inſtruct or teach a People, and not ſent
of God, but ſpeaks other mens words, not his own Viſions; or
who propheſies ſuch things to come, as never come to paſs, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
happen quite contrary, in neither of which acceptations is <hi>George
Fox</hi> proved a <hi>falſe Prophet:</hi> therefore none. The like may be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to clear him from Impoſture, ſince he only is an <hi>Impoſtor</hi>
that aſſumes to himſelf the Dignity of an extraordinary <hi>Ambaſſador</hi>
from God, and proves a <hi>Cheat,</hi> as <hi>Simon Magus among the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans
and Romans, Mahomet among the Turks, and the late Jew in
Italy.</hi> So that if <hi>George Fox</hi> had ſingly affirm'd that to be true
which were falſe, it prov'd him no <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> or <hi>Impoſtor;</hi> And
therefore our Adverſary ſhews himſelf a raw Diſputant, and meer
Novice in the ſound framing of an Argument; For what man,
that underſtands an Horſe from a Cow, would thus argue; If
<hi>G. Fox, in matters of concernment not only to mens Bodies and Eſtates</hi>
(then in matters of concernment, in part to mens Bodies and
Eſtates) <hi>affirm that to be true which is falſe, he is a falſe Prophet
and Impoſtor;</hi> He might as well have ſaid, if <hi>George Fox</hi> affirms
he gave ten pound for an Horſe, when he gave but five, then <hi>G.
Fox</hi> is a <hi>falſe-Prophet and Impoſtor with a witneſs;</hi> But I think, it
will not hurt us, to let him have to himſelf the whole Reputation
of this kind of proving to Peoples ſences the Truth of his Charge,
who, had he not been void of all Sence himſelf, and Reaſon too,
would never have ſuffer'd ſo much weakneſs and untruth to paſs
the Preſs without Correction.</p>
            <p>Nay though he could make it appear (which neither his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60238:27"/>
nor prejudice will ever be able to do) that <hi>G. Fox</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly
and on purpoſe belyed the Almighty God, the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt, as he chargeth him to have done;
Yet ſtill I affirm, that he could not properly &amp; ſtrictly be tearmd
a <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> or <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> though all but ſuch, would juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him as wicked, as our Adverſary is malicious: for might
not a deboiſt fellow, that mocks at God and Godlineſs, when
he kills, lyes, or commits Adultery, ſay in his defence, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
did, on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the holy Ghoſt, which in the Apoſtle

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thing: Yet I hope, none in their wits
would count ſuch a fellow a <hi>falſe Prophet or Impoſtor, though very
impious and prophane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that there are too many, who from <hi>Nathan</hi>'s words to
<hi>David,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Vriah's</hi> Wife, and from the liberty taken
by ſome of the Ancients, have interpreted and concluded, that
their boundleſs Luſts are by Scripture irreprehenſible; thereby
<hi>making at firſt ſight the holy Ghoſt an acceſſory to their licentious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
who was the Author of the truth therein contained, (which
is belying him with a Witneſs) I ſuppoſe, our Adverſaries Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
in the World cannot but give him to underſtand;
Yet how we can properly Character ſuch <hi>Libidinoſo's,</hi> or inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Perſons, <hi>falſe Prophets, or Impoſtors,</hi> is left with the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Reader to conſider.</p>
            <p>I hope by this time, the Way he takes to prove <hi>George Fox</hi> what
he wickedly ſayes him to be, is evidently detected of Inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and that upon his own poſitions, <hi>George Fox</hi> can not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
either an Impoſtor or falſe Prophet. I ſhall now make
it appear, that he is as well miſtaken in the proof of the Truth of
his Charge, as in the way he took to ſtate it, and that no man in
that compaſs, could well have manifeſted more Weakneſs, Folly,
Malice and Untruth (as well in deſending of his own, as in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
our Principles) then this our Adverſary we have in
hand.</p>
            <p>To follow him into every Abſurdity, would not only be more
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60238:28"/>
then he deſerves at our hands, or any mans that loves time better
then to loſe it; But it would needleſly ſwell the Diſcourſe, beyond
both my Intention and the Service it is deſigned to; I ſhall
therefore contract and divide his exceptions to <hi>George Fox's</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Scriptures into theſe three ſorts.</p>
            <p>1. Such as may refer to Doctrinal Difference, I mean wherein
he oppoſeth us.</p>
            <p>2. Such as refer to his Socinian Interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
wherein Chriſt's Divinity is aſſerted, where we oppoſe
him.</p>
            <p>3. Such as are meerly trivial, in which there can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for accuſing <hi>George Fox</hi> of any alteration, as to what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
judges generally to be the ſence of the places, only perhaps
a tranſpoſing of the words, or the uſing of a word of equal force,
but not the ſame, no wayes detracting or varying from the mind
of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But that a man ſhould make fifty Cavils, and faithleſs number
doctrinal, or to any ſolid purpoſe, <hi>befits no man that loves to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
employed;</hi> but it therefore ſuits him, that <hi>is ſo over-run with
the Lazy,</hi> as I am really perſwaded, he buſies not himſelf in one
ſerviceable Work in a week together; <hi>only ſits upon his own Saturnal
Dreams till he has with difficulty hatcht them into ſome ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency,
and then they are to ſlutter abroad upon his paper wings</hi> (ſcarce
good enough for waiſt) <hi>to the ſhop,</hi> which traffiques in ſuch kind of
ware) <hi>till perſecution comes; with the Scorch of which they are wont
to ſinge and wrap up like a Scrole;</hi> But enough of this. Now for
his Doctrinal Exceptions.</p>
            <p>He begins with what we confeſs to Gods Glory to be our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and ſtumbles at it, as much as did the Jews of old; I
<hi>mean Chriſt Jeſus, the great Son of Righteouſneſs, and Light of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
and ſpiritual World, by Which the inviſible Souls and Spirits of
men come to obtain the ſaving Knowledge of God, and what is required
from them, in order to their eternal Salvation.</hi> What can we expect
then but Darkneſs, from him that ſeeketh to diſparage the Light.
But let us hear him.</p>
            <p>The firſt Scripture which I ſhall pitch upon as miſrecited (in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
(that is George Fox's) perverted and corrupted) ſhall be that in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60238:28"/>
John 1. 9. he cites it almoſt as often wrong as right. The Scripture
<hi>runs thus in our tranſlation,</hi> That was the true Light that lighteth
every man that cometh into the World. (<hi>A long Porch, where's the
Houſe) ſays he,</hi> in the Greek it is coming, (not that cometh) and ſo
it may refer to light as well as man; <hi>But</hi> George Fox <hi>hath it thus,
John ſaid,</hi> Every man that cometh into the World is enlightned, and
ſeveral ſayings of the like tendency. <hi>But now hath he obſerved that
Exactneſs, which he requires in others?</hi> may there be no Difference
between lighteth and enlighteth, muſt every man of neceſſity he enlightned
becauſe the Light lighteth him?</p>
            <p>Wonderful Diſtinction! Certainly this man ſets up for a new
Claſs of <hi>Criticks:</hi> I wonder into what Labyrinth he hath travell'd
for this notable gloſs! a body would think he had left his Wits
(if ever he had any) behind in exchange. But I anſwer,</p>
            <p>I look upon it as conceited and preſumptious, for any man
to undertake what he cannot prove, and not leſs baſe, to affirm
a man miſ-cites, perverts and corrupts Scripture, when he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the genuine ſenſe of it. And this I briefly prove,</p>
            <p>If I grant to this <hi>Pſeudo-linguiſt</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not a Verb, as our Engliſh renders it; what then?
muſt it needs follow, that it refers to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and not to
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? Has he made no better uſe of his <hi>Greek</hi> Grammar?
'Tis ſtrange that any man ſo mean in that Tongue, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to thwart the current of all indifferent Tranſlators, whom
he ſticks not to make uſe of at other times.</p>
            <p>I have taken a view of the moſt and beſt Editions, both of

               </p>
               <p>2. Beſides, what ſhall we ſay upon their Tranſpoſition of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60238:32"/>
words, as to the time then preſent? I mean when the Light after
their ſenſe, <hi>was coming into the World;</hi> for that the Scriptures will
be moſt falſe, methinks they themſelves ſhould ſee; ſince it is
notorious, <hi>that neither whilſt he was coming, nor come, one quarter of
Mankind was any whit extraordinarily enlightned, much leſs ſavingly
by him;</hi> but they remained Infidels as before.</p>
               <p>3. Nor is this all, for at this rate, <hi>We,</hi> ſince his Departure,
are left as deſtitute as they before his coming, and as they who
heard not of him, when he was come, were wholly ignorant;
for how is it poſſible, upon their Interpretation, that we ſhould
have any ſaving Light? Chriſt, in whom was the excellent Light
and Power, is gone; Say they, the Scriptures in many points are
left dubious, as <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifies of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; Say I, neither
is there any unerring Interpreter or Guide to be obtained at this
time a day (Say they again.) <hi>Certainly then, there can be but little
true Knowledge, ſound Faith, or well-grounded Comfort in ſo ill-foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Religion, whoſe Belief is a kind of Fiction, and their Hope but a
better ſort of Deſpair.</hi> To conclude.</p>
               <p>4. We therefore think it a wrong done to the Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Participles unſuitableneſs to Light, and its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
agreement to Man; for men are continually coming into the
World, and <hi>at ſuch enlightned,</hi> which can not be ſaid of Light in
their ſenſe. The Meſſiah don't viſibly appear as formerly; That
Light is ecclipſt, as he himſelf ſaid it was convenient to be, or
the Comforter would not come; <hi>but that Divine intellectual Light,
which was moſt excellent, he promiſed ſhould endure with his to the End;</hi>
by a degree of which alſo the holy Patriarchs of old ſaw the
Glory of his Day, and Evangelical Diſpenſation, though as to
the then State of the World, it was altogether unfit for it;
wherefore it is ſaid, that they deſired to ſee his Day and ſaw it
not; How? <hi>Did they not ſee it as to themſelves? By no means;</hi> for
many of them ſaw it, <hi>but they never ſaw it break forth as Gods Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
to the World</hi> (though they much deſired it) becauſe of
the Worlds incapacity to receive it.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I further ſay? If <hi>coming</hi> cannot ſo properly be
ſaid of Light in their ſenſe, as of Man in ours, (ſince ſo every
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60238:32"/>
man in all ages comes to have the benefit of that Light offer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, which in the other ſenſe muſt be loſt to thouſands, or
they looſe the advantage of it (being not then born in that Age,
in which that Sun (though for a little ſeaſon) was pleaſed to viſit
the World) then let it not be <hi>Light coming,</hi> but <hi>Man coming into
the World.</hi> In ſhort, take it in their ſenſe, <hi>and one Age is hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitted,</hi>
take it in ours, <hi>and all mankind is illuminated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the drift of our Adverſary in his Tranſpoſition of the
<hi>Participle,</hi> viz. <hi>the Diveſtigating Chriſt of all Right to Eternal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi>
(which is the <hi>Snake in the Graſs</hi>) I ſhall anon ſufficiently
I hope, vindicate that great Truth, though I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſince we without dammage can allow him, that the Words
may be true both wayes, as I have already, and may yet further
demonſtrate, that he would deſire only to receive them in one,
as if on purpoſe he had a mind <hi>to dethrone him from the Seat of his
Eternal Majeſty;</hi> For what if <hi>John</hi> had chiefly intended a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Heavenly Structure of the New World, and Chriſt to
have been the Enlightner of all that come into it; and further, that the
Meſsiahs then coming was Author of that moſt excellent Creation;</hi>
muſt it needs therefore follow, <hi>that he was not antecedent to that
work, that he never enlightned the Fathers and holy men of old, with a
ſufficient meaſure of that ſame Divine Light,</hi> which without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
appeared in him, and far greater then before to the Sons of
men? <hi>I appeal to any modeſt intelligent man, if this be not Ingratitude,
nay Sacriledge in the higheſt degree.</hi> Certainly therefore it can be no
Injury to the Scripture, if we ſay, That He, who enlightned the
Patriarchs and Prophets of old, <hi>hath in a more excellent manner, and
ſuitable to the Spirituality of his own Divine Nature, revealed himſelf
in this Goſpel adminiſtration,</hi> the which may aptly be compared to a
well-built Temple, which has been of old begun, but left to
theſe latter daies of Chriſt's more eminent manifeſtation to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtruct,
compleat, adorn and ſit for him the eternal Light of
Life and Righteouſneſs to be worſhipped in; ſo that there is a
great Difference, as <hi>Grotius</hi> in other words doth well obſerve,
between the Beginning of an adminiſtration, and of the Author
of it. <hi>That might be the Beginning of thoſe large Diſcoveries, but not
the Light that gave them;</hi> and conſequently, notwithſtanding
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60238:33"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> ſhould have intended a Divine Creation, yet it will not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow, that the Light, which is that Creator, <hi>was not
in beeing antecedently to that Divine Creation;</hi> and ſo God both by
<hi>pre-exiſtence and omnipotency.</hi> But I ſhall ſay no more of this, I mean
the tranſpoſition of the Participle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, till our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
ſayes more to the contrary, if we may then think it worth
our notice.</p>
               <p>But it may be fit to obſerve, that the man ſhows a wave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his own Judgment, which is not only manifeſt from his ſaying,

he was willing to be a little more modeſt in print then in his

and <hi>that this Fancy ſhould be the firſt Corner and Foundation Stone of

                  </gap> is <hi>Lighteth,</hi> and not <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned?</hi>
For my part, I ſee no other loſs in it, then that it is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60238:35"/>
not ſo forceably expreſt; For man being compoſed of Soul and
Body, the Soul is the Interior, the Body is the Exterior part
of man; So that when the Body is lighted by the Sun, or any
other Fire, we may ſay the External part is lighted about its bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
or occaſions; and when the Internal part, the Soul, is
lighted, <hi>We may in reference to the whole man ſay, He is inlightned
or lightned within,</hi> becauſe the Soul may properly be ſaid to be
<hi>internal</hi> or <hi>within,</hi> or <hi>the moſt hidden and Spiritual part of man.</hi>
Behold then the redoubtableneſs of this <hi>Adverſary,</hi> his Will is
<hi>good,</hi> I mean bad, as the Apoſtle ſaith in a more ſerious Caſe,
<hi>To will miſchief to us was preſent with the man, but how to perform he
knew not;</hi> yet this pedling Controverſiſt will be doing, though
as little to purpoſe as need be: Witneſs one material part of
his Obſervation againſt G. F. <hi>if it hath any matter at all in it,</hi>
viz. that he changed the Phraſe, and Tenſe or Time. Alas
poor man! and what then? Ergo, ſaith he, <hi>G. F.</hi> is a <hi>Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
a Lyar,</hi> and <hi>an Impoſtor:</hi> boldly ſaid; but prove it who can, or
wil for him. But what then wil become of the man that would have
the Text controverted thus rendred, <hi>Haec eſt Lux illa vera quae veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem
in mundum illuminat omnem hominem:</hi> this were as ingrammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
altogether, but we ſpare him, though we muſt remember him;
for we cannot eſteem it Doctrinal Error for a man to miſs a
Tenſe, and would have him &amp; all men know, that <hi>our Religion ſtands
not in Grammatical Tenſes,</hi> but <hi>the Fear of God, and Faith in Chriſt
Jeſus, whoſe Blood cleanſeth from all Sin ſuch as walk in his Light.</hi>
Nor did the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſtand upon Tenſes, eſpecially
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> whoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> don't much exceed
the <hi>Quakers Engliſh. G. F.</hi> was not ſent to preach up Propriety
of Speech, <hi>the World is but too Curious and Proud in ſuch Human
Science</hi> and acquiſition; <hi>But like a Faithful Miniſter of God, by his
Eternal Spirit and Power to turn People from Darkneſs to the Light
(in which the Ranſomed walk, with Everlaſting Joy upon their Heads)
and from the Power and Kingdom of Satan, which ſtand in the Luſt
of the Eye, Luſt of the Fleſh, and Pride of Life, unto God, and his
Holy Kingdom, which ſtands in Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy

               <p>Having, I hope, ſufficiently proved, that the Participle

                  </gap>, <hi>Venientem,</hi> or <hi>Coming,</hi> is to be referred to <hi>Men,</hi> and not

that <hi>Enlighten:</hi> Nay, in caſe they were not ſo, that it would
prove little prejudicial to our ſenſe (as the difference hath been
already explained) I am now willing to make appear, That the
Light, of which we have been ſo treating, is no natural nor
created Light; but, <hi>a Supernatural and Eternal Light;</hi> which
done, the Controverſie, at leaſt on this Subject, we ſhall
conclude.</p>
               <p>1. If man be enlightened by that Word,<note place="margin">John 1. 1, 2, 3.</note> which
<hi>was with God, and was God, and that before the World was;</hi>
then man is enlightened by a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> and <hi>eternal
Light:</hi> but the Scripture in the firſt, ſecond, and third
verſes of <hi>John</hi>'s firſt chapter, proves man to be ſo enlightened,
and that Light to be ſuch, as beforeſaid; <hi>therefore man is Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a Supernatural Eternal Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he object another ſence of theſe Verſes, then the words
ſimply and nakedly ſeem to import; for inſtance, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
there mentioned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> relates not to the World, and viſible
elementary Creation, but the inviſible Creation, as I know is
their common refuge. I Reply,</p>
               <p>2. If all things were made by him, and without him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
made that was made;<note place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> then, either <hi>John</hi> ſpake equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatingly,
not meaning what he ſaid; or elſe, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and properly, and conſequently all Things (of
which the World is the greateſt part) were made by him;
and therefore <hi>He muſt needs have been before all created things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60238:36"/>
3. If he were that true Light, <hi>by way of exemption to all
others</hi> (as the <hi>Socinians are wont to interpret God to be true
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. and there is no reaſon to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
<hi>then was he Light in himſelf;</hi> and conſequently, did
not illuminate by a received or borrowed Light, from another;
<hi>but</hi> ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe, <hi>out of himſelf, and from himſelf only, and therefore God;</hi> as
ſaith <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, This then is the Meſſage which we
have heard from him, That God is Light, &amp;c. The firſt
Propoſition is Scriptural,<note place="margin">1 Jo. 1.</note> and needs no Proof; and
the ſecond I prove thus,</p>
               <p>4. If the Divine Life of this creating Word be that
True Light by way of excellency and excluſion of all
others,<note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>with which he enlightens every man coming into this
World, then muſt he be Light in Himſelf, and from Himſelf;
unleſs he can be Himſelf without that Divine Life which is in Him;</hi>
which becauſe he cannot, it will follow, that he is ſuch a true
Light as hath been aſſerted; and conſequently, muſt be God,
<hi>inaſmuch as he, who is the Fountain of true Life, is God.</hi> Which I
further prove thus,</p>
               <p>5. If he, who is eminently that true Light, by whom only
all Mankind is enlightened, neither is, nor can be that Light,
as any part of Mankind, however immaculate (<hi>ſince ſo he would
be a Light unto Himſelf,</hi> which is both abſurd and impoſſible)
then that Creating Word, which is that Divine Life, which
is evidently that true Light, by which all men are enlightened,
neither is nor could be a <hi>Mortal Man, however Holy; and properly
therefore it was not Chriſt, as Man, but as God, that he was and is
eminently the Light of Men.</hi> Which I further prove.</p>
               <p>6. If that Light, <hi>in which all men ought indiſpenſibly
to believe for Salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> be the Light, with which men
are enlightened; <hi>then are all Men ſavingly and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
enlightened:</hi> But the Scripture here quoted proves
the Light in which all ſhould believe, and which illuminates
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60238:37"/>
all to be the ſame; and conſequently, the Light, wherewith men
are enlightened, is Saving and Supernatural.</p>
               <p>7. If that World was made by him, in which he was,
and which knew him not;<note place="margin">Verſ. 10,</note> 
                  <hi>then, becauſe this elementary
World was the World in which he was, and Mankind then in it,
thoſe that knew him not, it follows, that this viſible elementary
World, and Mankind in it, were made by him;</hi> and if made by him,
<hi>then neceſſarily he muſt have been before them:</hi> and ſince this Word
is that Light, by which men are enlightened, it followeth,
that they are Illuminated by a Supernatural and Eternal
Light.</p>
               <p>8. If to as many as receive him (the true Light en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
all) to them he gives Power to become the
Sons of God;<note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> then the way to be a Son of God is, <hi>to
obey the Light,</hi> or to receive and obey the Light is the
way to be a Child of God; <hi>not born of Blood, nor of the Will of
the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God;</hi> but the Scripture
plainly teſtifies that to be the way: <hi>therefore the Light is Saving
and Supernatural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much in ſhort from <hi>Scripture:</hi> I have a few Arguments to
offer from Reaſon.</p>
               <p>It is, I think, granted on all hands, That God has enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mankind with ſome Light or other; the Queſtion then will
be this, What Nature, this Light is of, Saving or Inſufficient, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or Supernatural? I prove it to be Supernatural and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus.</p>
               <p>1. If the Light, with which God hath enlightened Men,
were natural, then could it inform men only in and about na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Affairs; but we ſee that men do thereby in meaſure <hi>know
and diſcern things that are Supernatural;</hi> therefore this Light is
not Natural, but is Supernatural, and conſequently Saving.</p>
               <p>2. That it gives men ſome Knowledge of Divine Things,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60238:37"/>
I ſuppoſe all believe; however, I thus prove it: God gave it
for ſome End, or no End; for no End we cannot, we dare not
ſuppoſe; if for ſome End, then not in reference to Natural
Things, becauſe they are knowable by the ſpirit of Man as
ſuch; <hi>conſequently it muſt be in and about things relating to Man's
Duty to God and his Neighbour,</hi> in which conſiſts the Salvation of
his own Soul: if ſo, then I prove its ſufficiently thus,</p>
               <p>3. Whatever God gives to any Man for any end, <hi>is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for that End for which he gives it him:</hi> but God has given his
Light unto men, in order to their Duty to Him and their
Neighbour, in which conſiſts the Salvation of their Souls; and
conſequently that Light is ſufficient to that End.</p>
               <p>That what God gives to any End is ſufficient to compaſs it,
I thus prove;</p>
               <p>4. God requires all Men ſtrictly to ſerve and obey him, and
to work out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling; or
elſe, their End ſhall be Deſtruction: but this the Almighty
(with Reverence I ſay it) could not juſtly do, unleſs the Light
with which he enlightens men were ſufficient and ſaving: <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
unleſs our Adverſary will impeach him of manifeſt Injuſtice, or
deny that he thus requires men to fear him, and work out their own
Salvation, he muſt grant, that not only God hath illuminated all men,
but that the Light, wherewith he hath illuminated them to that great
End, is Saving and Supernatural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>I know the Objection that is on theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
frequently ſtarted, viz.</hi> How cometh it then that
all Men have not a clearer View of this <hi>Light</hi> whereof you
ſpeak?</p>
               <p>But Men muſt have a care of concluding the Light ever the
leſs Divine in it ſelf, becauſe of that dim and imperfect ſight
their own infirmities cauſe them to have of it; perhaps ſome
are as incapable to behold the Light as it is, as an Infant to make
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60238:38"/>
a true Proſpect by the natural Day: Others are grievouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
with <hi>Rumes, Bloodſheds,</hi> and many other Diſtempers;
whilſt not a few either wilfully cloſe their Eyes, are blinded
with Motes and Beams, run into obſcure Places, or by their
continued obſtinacy in Wickedneſs, come at laſt wholy to loſe
both the Light, and their Capacity of ſeeing it. Such are
thoſe on whom the Night comes, in which none can work;
and this was impenitent <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Caſe, which is too too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and lamentably paralelled in our dayes. Men muſt
not think to ſee all at once; and becauſe their inquiſitive,
impatient and wondring Mind is not anſwered by whole heaps
of glittering Diſcoveries; <hi>therefore, in a brittle unſubject Nature,
ſling off all regard to the Light of God, and vainly think to compaſs
Salvation in their own unwarrantable ſtrivings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let men conſider ſeriouſly their own dark ſtate, how ſong
the Light hath ſhined there uncomprehended; and ſince it has
pleaſed the Eternal God to viſit them with ſuch a Miniſtry
and Teſtimony as turns them unto that bleſſed unchangeable
Light, diligently to adhere to it, and be humbly contented to
practice what they know (for, to that only End and Purpoſe
does God cauſe it to ſhine in their Hearts) before they look
after other Diſcoveries, <hi>from that graſping, ravenous, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſpirit in man, which would know the End before it practiſeth the
beginning,</hi> which is curſed of God, and is for eternal Judgment;
this loſt <hi>Adam</hi> his <hi>Paradice, and obſtructs Thouſand, from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Way of God at this very day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore Bleſſed are they, who knowing their own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
wait diligently upon the Lord for ſuch daily Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of his own ſaving Light, as ſuit their own ſtates, <hi>as to
their daily Temptation, Preſervation and Increaſe in the experimental
Knowledge of the Way of God:</hi> Such are not wiſe above what's
written in their Hearts by the Finger of God; and ſpeak
and declare of God, and his Unchangeable Way, according
as they have felt and handled; I mean, <hi>as He hath revealed
Himſelf both in Judgment and in Mercy,</hi> through the in-ſhining
Light of his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this I publiſh to the whole World,</hi> That I never knew God
truly and heartily to be of purer Eyes then to behold Iniquity, I was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60238:38"/>
never conſcientiouſly convinced of any Evil, I never was brought into
true Repentance, I never experienced real Attonement, I never had
right Faith in Chriſt, nor did I ever inwardly come to feel a cleanſing
from any ſin, and a being juſtified by his Blood, by which to know him
my Mediator, Saviour and Redeemer, but by the Reproofs of that
Light wherewith Chriſt has enlightened me, and by turning to it, and
walking in it with all Godly Fear and Subjection, according to its bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Diſcoveries and Requirings. <hi>Wherefore I boldly call it,</hi> A
Sufficient, Saving and Supernatural Light: <hi>And according to

This by their own Principle cannot be denyed, as well as that
it is true in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, That all men of themſelves want Light;
that God, ſince he would have all be ſaved, has given all Light;
that this Light muſt give a certain Diſcerning; and that ſuch
as are guided by it are conſequently certainly led. In
ſhort, The Light is both Univerſal, Supernatural, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>

the Concluſion of the Libel, that may not improperly be
conſidered under this Head.</p>
               <p>Certainly it would be thought very ſtrange, and that I
have ſpent my time as unprofitably as the Emperor that would
be all day a killing of Flies, if at laſt I ſhould make this man
ſpeak the Language of the Light, nay, to be a Defender of it

                  <hi>Though in one page he tauntingly ſayes,</hi> He is perſwaded
that ſome of us have ſuch an Opinion of the Light, our great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
that though an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach any other
Doctrine, then that which <hi>G. F.</hi> hath preached, they could not give
ear to it (<hi>which Saying one would think abuſive enough of the

addreſſeth himſelf to us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note> Or rather that ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached

he is not guilty Himſelf in a much higher degree of ſuch

                  <hi>things as he condemns in others.</hi> Monſtrum horrendum! What
man of tollerable ſenſe would thus write his own Reproof,
and in leſs then two Pages give himſelf the Lye? But it is
juſt with God that ſuch men ſhould be ſtrongly infatuated.
Is it not ſtrange that he ſhould mock at our deſiring to be
informed by the Light at the bottom of one Page, and make
his own Appeal unto it at the top of the very next? Is it fit
to direct us in and about what he writes, and not concerning
the Writings of other men? or, Is it a true and approved Light
when it concurs with him, and <hi>but a weak, deluſive, and what not
Light when it leads us to oppoſe him?</hi> But out of his own mouth let
him be judged. I ſhall therefore contract the benefit I make of
his own Appeal into theſe two Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. That unto which he makes an Appeal muſt be capable of
giving an Infallible Judgment, and ſo <hi>a true Judge, or elſe he
appeals fooliſhly:</hi> But the Light within is that unto which he
makes his Appeal, and we would not think him to do it to a
thing not fit to give a certain Judgment; <hi>therefore the Light is
an Infallible Judge by his own Appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If it be appealed to by him as a competent Judge; nay,
that by which we ſhould ſatisfie our own Conſciences, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the things he layes to G. F's. charge, namely, <hi>Impoſtor, &amp;c.</hi>
and ſince thoſe things are of the higheſt nature in Religion, or
againſt it, then will it follow, <hi>that the</hi> Light <hi>is to be the Judge of</hi>
George Fox, <hi>and not only of him, but concerning thoſe weighty Points
of Religion wherein he is abuſively charged by the Libeller:</hi> And if
ſo, I would both tell him, That G. F. <hi>is pronounced not guilty by
the Verdict of that</hi> Light, <hi>from which there is no Appeal: and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
firſt guilty of charging him with what he has not proved; and
ſecondly, of Abuſing, Degrading, and Contemning</hi> the Light;
and then, contradictorily to himſelf, <hi>of making his ſolemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and Appeal to</hi> the Light, <hi>as the moſt Impartial and Vnerring
Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tell me now, what could we have ſaid more in praiſe of the
Light, ſo far as meer words go? and what could he have ſaid

ſay, has promiſed his holy Spirit to thoſe that humbly implore it in the
Obedience of that Light.</hi> Further, <hi>That we have entertained it under

For when the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that have not the Law, do by Nature

he groſly contradicts himſelf, compared with his ſeveral leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Expreſſions of the <hi>Light:</hi> But I hope, now he has told us
that both the Proteſtants and himſelf receive and aſſert the <hi>Light</hi>
to be the right Judge and Guide, <hi>that both will never more be angry

Conduct of his Life,</hi> as our <hi>Adverſary</hi> hath plentifully confeſt,

Contradiction is but a ſmaler degree of Diſtraction; I would

one. How can the <hi>Light</hi> be a <hi>Judge of good and evil,</hi> and yet <hi>not

make up the Queſtion, the Light cannot be ſecluded as wanting in true
Judgment, becauſe Good and Evil are part of the Queſton, in the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Propoſition;</hi> Deny that the <hi>Light</hi> is ſufficient in any caſe of
Right and Wrong, and deny all. But to me it ſeems very
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60238:42"/>
ſtrange, that the very ſame Light, which was at t'other ſide of
the leaf the great Judge of Doctrinal Truth, and with which
God had endu'd men to their ſingular benefit, <hi>ſhould at laſt be

what then? Muſt the <hi>Light</hi> be no whit concerned there in becauſe
of the great Difficulty in the Point? By no means, the <hi>Light</hi>
dictates and requires theſe things in their times and ſeaſons; for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60238:43"/>
whatever our <hi>Adverſary</hi> does, no ſober man can believe that the
<hi>Light</hi> is ſufficient to the moſt weighty things that concern man's
Salvation, and yet be unable to judge of thoſe Differences
mentioned by the Apoſtle, <hi>which were ſuch Weakneſſes as needed
Chriſtian Charity to bear with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, it was by the <hi>Light</hi> that their Weakneſs was ſeen, neither
could it have been born, or they ever have grown ſtronger then
to place diſſents in thoſe trivial things, <hi>but by walking up to the
Light,</hi> which was alone able to give them Right Diſcerning in
the Caſe. I conclude therefore that in the Inſtance made by
our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> there could be no Difficulty too great for the
<hi>Light,</hi> nay that <hi>the Inſtance is ſo trivial in compariſon of the excellent
Knowledge, and Judgment which are received by the Light,</hi> that it
makes but the more for us to the diſparagement of him that hath
alledged it.</p>
               <p>And thus much (though a Knock to himſelf, even whilſt he
thinks us under his blow) when he ſayes, <hi>And where is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
you ſpeak of in particular Perſons, in all Caſes? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
if you conſider this well, you will perceive that the Light in
every man (eſpecially in thoſe whoſe Judgments have been prepoſſeſs'd
into falſe Notions, as many of you have been before you were</hi> Quakers)
<hi>doth not teach him all things whatſoever, but all things that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for him to know in order to a Holy Truſt in God, and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in the general Courſe of his Life.</hi> Well! before I would
undertake Controverſies, and thus give away my Cauſe, nay
ſo wofully, yet frequently contradict my ſelf, I would never
write while I live. But to make my advantage of this too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infallibility</hi> of Perſons any further then as they are joyned,
and conformed to the <hi>Light</hi> of God. We never affirmed: and
<hi>Fallibility of the Light becauſe of the fallibility of Perſons We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
owned,</hi> and now deny as a moſt Ridiculous and Falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</p>
               <p>He tells us of Contrary Judgments in our Aſſemblies of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and from thence queries, Where is the Infallibility of
Perſons? What then, in caſe that were true, as we diſclaim it?
<hi>Why I am perſwaded the Light in every man doth not teach him all
things.</hi> This New Way of Demonſtration I am a Stranger to;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60238:43"/>
What is it but to ſay? <hi>You ſometimes differ, therefore the Light
is fallible:</hi> or thus, Every man that ſins is enlightned, <hi>therefore
the Light in every man ſins;</hi> If this be Abſurd and Wicked, let
our <hi>Adverſary</hi> purge himſelf as he can.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>but Infallibility in all Caſes</hi> doth ſuppoſe, that though
not in all, yet in many, at leaſt in ſome Caſes <hi>men may be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;</hi>
If ſo, I ask, in what? Surely in thoſe <hi>wherein they walk
conformably to the Light:</hi> If ſo, then what's the Conſequence but
this; <hi>When men live up in all things to the Light, they are Infallible,</hi>
but when they go from it, they are not. Surely then the man
has but hitherto beat the air.</p>
               <p>And why may We not make the moſt of what he ſayes for us,
and infer, If that before We were <hi>Quakers,</hi> and come to live
under the holy Conduct of this <hi>Light,</hi> we were poſſeſs'd with
falſe Notions, he means (or at leaſt the Expreſſion will bear
it) that ſince we <hi>were Quakers we came to be poſſeſs'd with true
ones.</hi> Well, but the extent of the <hi>Light</hi> is not to all things, yet,
(ſayes he) what is it to ſay I? why only to <hi>all that is neceſſary for
him to know, in order to a Holy Truſt in God, and ſincere Obedience
in the general Courſe of his Life.</hi> Very well, I would now fain
underſtand the Difference, <hi>of knowing all, or Right or Wrong, in
all Caſes wherein a man is concerned; and knowing all things neceſſary
for him to know,</hi> unleſs he will confeſs, when he ſaid the <hi>Light</hi>
was not ſufficient to determine the Right and Wrong of all Caſes,
<hi>that he meant of Caſes that did not concern men to know;</hi> and then
we will with him conclude ſo too. But if the <hi>Light</hi> be ſufficient
to diſcover unto man all that is fit for him to know, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, and his own Soul, <hi>and yet in ſome Caſes it cannot
determine the Right from the Wrong, in which man's Good is concerned,</hi>
it is manifeſt to all the World, that this will be the direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
the <hi>Light</hi> is not ſufficient to give men the Knowledge
of all that is fit for them to know, but <hi>the Light is ſufficient to
diſcover unto them all that which is neceſſary for them to know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he is wonderful Jealous that We neglect the means the</hi>
Light <hi>doth dictate unto us the great need and uſe of; namely,</hi>
the Scriptures, and other diligent ſtudy, <hi>and here he falls down
right upon us:</hi> Muſt God be bound with his Divine Light and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
to ſupply the defects of our Idleneſs and Pride? for when other

that might be urged (what Gloſſes might be given, or
Authorities produced) 'tis this, That as Chriſt Jeſus is the

be it but <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> is compleatly and unqueſtionably

much as admit of an Oath, as being fitter to be enjoyned equivocating

Cauſe is removed (<hi>Lyes, Equivocations, mental Reſerves, &amp;c.</hi>)
the Effects, or that extraordinary &amp; ſcrupulous way of Evidence
ſhould ceaſe. And if any object the Law of the Land, or the
Ignorance of Magiſtrates of our Truth and Innocency: I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<hi>The Law is either anſwered by Truth being ſpoken, or ſatisfied
by an infliction of the ſame Penalty upon the Lyar that is incurred by a

to ſcare us into Truth-ſpeaking, who Believe in,
Fear and Worſhip the God of all Truth, and that in Spirit and
Truth.</p>
               <p>The next abuſe of us, ſo far as concerns our Belief, belongs to
reſpecting of Perſons; he calls it, our <hi>great Doctrine</hi>

without his wonted Folly, at <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Wo unto them

what is certainly imply'd in Chriſt's Prohibition (which
he ſhould have firſt confuted) he undertakes the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>True indeed, ſayes Chriſt, Be not ye called</hi> Rabbi; <hi>for one is
your Maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> Now
I will take the Liberty to argue a little, becauſe the Text ſeems to be ſo
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60238:48"/>
plain on your ſide; firſt, you do reſtrain it from extinding all Men from
being called Maſter, whilſt you allow your Servants to call you our
Maſters, becauſe you are their Maſters (<hi>which Exception is not in
the Text</hi>) why may not another call you Maſters, becauſe you have
Servants, and are Maſters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> Firſt then, he has broke his word with us, which
in plainer <hi>Engliſh</hi> is, he has told us a Lye, in aſſuring us at the
beginning, He would deal with us neither from Scripture nor
Reaſon, and yet undertakes both: Certainly he is ill able to
maintain Right Swearing, that is wanting in True Speaking,
or writing at leaſt. We may well ſuppoſe his Evidence, ſo much
boaſted of, has left him now, that he betakes himſelf to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Reaſon for defence; but conſidering how little they
will prove friendly to his Cauſe, he is no otherwiſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of for Breach of Word, <hi>then that the Will may be accepted
for the Deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But next, The Text alſo muſt be blamed; Why? may an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-hearted

ſo abſurd, that I am confident I have heard a better Argument
out of <hi>Bedlam;</hi> however, let us once more repeat it, <hi>If you call
men Maſters, that are really your Maſters, why may you not call your

               </p>
               <p>We can call <hi>Him</hi> Maſter, Father, Servant, or <hi>Her</hi> Wife, who
really is ſo to us; but in doing it otherwiſe, we believe we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60238:48"/>
ſhould Err. A Maſter and Father of old I confeſs to have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
a <hi>Religious as well as Civil Honour</hi> (I mean, <hi>Sect-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

common Truth, as the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> we renounce the Title;
and are the rather ſo to do, becauſe of that great Thirſt, which
this Age as well as that in which our Lord ſo ſeverely reproved it,
has after that very Vanity, Deceit and Wickedneſs; and this
ſimple honeſt Practice, and Zeal for it, we are not aſhamed to
have weighed in the Ballance of God's Sanctuary, againſt all
the flattering, cringing Cuſtoms of Perſonal Reſpect, whether
by Word or Geſture, now practiced in the VVorld.</p>
               <p>VVell, But he is of the mind, that the Scripture is not a
little for him, <hi>ſince the Apoſtle, both in his Epiſtle to the</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
<hi>and in that to the</hi> Colloſſians, <hi>exhorts Fathers not to provoke
their Children, and Maſters to give what was equal to their Servants:</hi>
in which the poor man is as much beſides himſelf, at leaſt the
matter, as in all the reſt; for, he might as well argue againſt
what he takes for granted (viz.) <hi>That we refuſe not to call ſuch
Maſters, as really are our Maſters;</hi> as to ſuppoſe we deny, that
an <hi>Apoſtle or Miniſter of Chriſt might not exhort the Fathers of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be tender to them, and Maſters of Servants to be juſt to them.</hi>
Certainly none can be ſo ſtupid as to imagine, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
called them <hi>Fathers and Maſters in a way of Title, or upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Reſpect:</hi> We may as well ſuppoſe, that becauſe he doth
reciprocally exhort <hi>Children and Servants,</hi> that therefore he ſtiled

to be under Obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law. And if they will
learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at home; for it is a ſhame
for Women to ſpeak in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 34, 35. <hi>Here if
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60238:51"/>
the Apoſtle</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>doth not command Silence to Women by Sex,

nothing that is written;</hi> But <hi>G. F.</hi> pag. 380. ſayes,—Now the
<q>Woman here hath an Husband to ask, and not uſurp Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

who redeems from under the Law, and makes free from the
Law, that man may ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi> Now if we may take Liberty
to expound the Scripture thus, it will be a Noſe of wax, that may be
turned which way we pleaſe: Beſides, it ſeems to be built upon a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reading
of Husband for Husbands, becauſe Chriſt, who is but One, is
made the Husbands that muſt be asked at home. So one of your Authors
ſaith,</hi> 
                  <q>But what Husbands have Widdows to learn of but
Chriſt? And was not Chriſt the Husband of <hi>Philip's</hi> four
Daughters? and may not they that learn of their Husbands
ſpeak then?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But before I go any further it may be obſerved, how very
ſlight his return is to <hi>G. F's</hi> Senſe of the place: and eſpecially,
that though he quotes another <hi>Friends</hi> Query on the matter, he
never offers to give it any Anſwer, and I am really perſwaded,
he was confounded by it.</p>
               <p>However, why is it ſo abuſive of the Scripture, to ſay that
which the Scripture ſaith it ſelf? Are not the Spirits of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

he muſt never have read, or at leaſt have forgot what he
read in the Scriptures of Truth, who denies this: If ſo then,
why is it Improper or Abuſive as he calls it, to ſay, that when
Mens Spirits of themſelves, eſpecially in the unlearned State,
ſpeak, <hi>it is that Woman, which is forbidden to ſpeak of her ſelf,</hi> ſince
the Context ſaith, that though they may all ſpeak one by one,
yet it is if any thing be revealed to them, which becauſe that
cannot be without Chriſt reveal it, whom the Father hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be his eternal Word, by which to declare to man
the inviſible things of his Kingdom; <hi>it follows, that it is Chriſt the
Bridegroom and Husband of his People, who by his Power ſpeaks
through his People, to the Edification of his Body?</hi> And as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is the Weaker Veſſel, ſo is Man in compariſon of Chriſt;
and therefore may not unfitly be accounted a Woman, from
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60238:51"/>
his <hi>comparative imbecillity:</hi> So that as Chriſt Preſides or Governs in
the Aſſemblies of his People, it may be rather ſaid, <hi>the Man, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
is, the Bridegroom and Husband of his People ſpeaks in them, and by
them, then they themſelves,</hi> who without him, <hi>are but as the Strength
of a Woman,</hi> and it being her place to yield to the Soveraignity of
her Lord and Husband, to whom is ordained the Rule, <hi>ſhe ought to
receive the Law from his mouth, who is the everlaſting High-Prieſt, and
Prophet of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now ſuppoſe I ſhould yield it to him that the Apoſtle
chiefly intended the Words in a Literal Senſe, and not ſo myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
as we have already diſcours'd, will it therefore be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
myſtically? by no means; <hi>it is frequent to find both a myſtical
and literal Senſe in the ſame paſſage,</hi> as when the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt

to be fulfilled by Chriſt's bodily Cures; which is true
in that Senſe, yet hath one more inward and myſtical.
But to be ſhort, I utterly deny from the Literal Text, that
Women are prohibited to preach, <hi>ſingly as Women, or of that Sex,</hi>

may preach, which I prove thus.</p>
               <p>If the Apoſtle had Companions and Fellow-Labourers in the
Goſpel that were Women, then we ought to believe, that all
Women, as Women only, were not by him denyed to ſpeak in
the Church: But the Apoſtles had Female Fellow-Labourers in
the Goſpel; therefore not all Women, but ſome Women only,
are excluded. That he had ſuch Companions, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               </p>
               <p>Again, If <hi>Anna</hi> preached to the People in the Temple at

as may be read in <hi>Luke:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2. 36 Act. 18. 26. cap. 21.</note> and <hi>if</hi> Philip's <hi>four Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

Apollo, <hi>as well as her Husband, the Way of God more
perfectly,</hi> even at that time, <hi>when he was a Preacher

ſay I, with good Reaſon, <hi>Women, as Women, are not denyed by

               </p>
               <p>And methinks the Place, urged by him againſt it, clearly
intimates as much; For, the Apoſtle is not treating in that
Chapter, who, or what Sex ſhall Propheſie, and what not;
<hi>but of that Order and Decency which ſuch as Propheſie ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:</hi>
For when he ſaid, <hi>You may all Propheſie one by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> if
it had been asked, <hi>Who, Men or Women?</hi> doubtleſs he would
have anſwered, <hi>All, or every one, provided any thing be revealed to
you:</hi> So that then this Prohibition of the Apoſtle, extends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to their Diſorder in the Church, <hi>occaſioned by their Ignorance,
which put them upon the propoſing of their Doubts and Scruples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably;</hi>
that is, ſuch of them <hi>as were Vnlearned;</hi> and not an

who Preached</hi> Iſrael'<hi>s Redemption, and Expounded the Way of the
Lord, and were Fellow-Labourers in the Work and Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
So then the words are to be read thus, <hi>I permit not an Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
or Ignorant Woman, to ſpeak in the Church; and if ſhe will

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60238:53"/>
his Adverſary for ſaying,</hi> The Light is a Creature; which is to
ſay, <hi>Christ, who is called the Light, is here called, a New Man,
and ſuch a one as is created; and conſequently is not God, but a
Creature:</hi> A Doctrine that well becomes our <hi>Adverſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which I Anſwer,</hi> That the New Man, who is there ſaid

in the Verſe before, who is thus deſcribed by the
Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>But now you alſo put off all theſe, Anger, Wrath,
Malice, Blaſphemy, Filthy Communication out of your

the Old Man.</hi> Which ſhews he meant by the Old man, thoſe
Habits and Cuſtoms of Evil (which were almoſt become Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
that they were before addicted to; and conſequently, that the
New Man was the inward Regeneration, or New Creation of
the Soul, Mind and Spirit, with the Inclinations and Affections
thereof; ſo that the Image of the New Man may be created or
begotten in Believers, and on that account be called the <hi>New
Man;</hi> but not that Chriſt Jeſus is the created <hi>New Man:</hi> For,
it is he by, their own Principle, <hi>That Creates all things New in the
Heavenly World of the Goſpel;</hi> who having all Power, begets his
People into a New State, <hi>renewing them in all Divine Knowledge
after the Image (or that they may be the Likeneſs) of him that created
him;</hi> that is, <hi>that Image:</hi> for nothing can be
renewed that was not loſt;<note place="margin">Read <hi>John</hi> 1. 16.</note> but Chriſt was never
loſt (to ſpeak properly) in our Adverſary's

been loſt, almoſt from the Foundation of the World; <hi>Therefore
it is not Chriſt, but his Image, that is renewed and anew created:</hi> So
that if G. F. did put <hi>Them</hi> for <hi>Him,</hi> it is not falſe; <hi>for to create
them anew in his Image, or a new Image in them, is all one;</hi> and the
words will bear it, that Chriſt creates new Men after his own

which he ſaith, G. F. <hi>often uſeth, and alwayes abuſeth,

as he remembers:</hi> I doubt his Memory much; but let's

                  <hi>And now, O Father, Glorifie thou me with thine

World was.</hi> Thus the Scripture; but <hi>G. F.</hi> thus,
<hi>Christ, who was Glorified with the Father before the World began.</hi>
On which read his Comment. <hi>You will ſay perhaps, his words

and Enmity with a witneſs! What, Is every <hi>Variation</hi>
of a <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Syllable</hi> a <hi>Wrong done to the Meaning of Scripture?</hi>
And did ever Chriſt, his Apoſtles, or any ſober Man living
chide or reprove a Perſon, if through <hi>Defect of Memory,</hi> or for
<hi>Brevity,</hi> or in a way of <hi>Paraphraſe he did leave out, or put in, or change
a Word, not in the leaſt perverting the Senſe?</hi> ſo uncharitable a
Perſon I know not ever to have heard of, fitter to be ſeverely
reproved, then anſwer'd: and to whom Silence had been the
beſt Confutation, had it not been more for the ſake of others
then his: To dare to conclude a Man <hi>a Lyar, Impoſter, Falſe-Prophet,
and I know not what more, becauſe he expreſſes the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with a ſmall Variation in the Words;</hi> But I ſhall ſay more of
this elſe-where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He proceeds,</hi> Nay, doth not <hi>G. F.</hi> take his Phraſe in a Divers Senſe
from what Chriſt intended by his; for (ſayes He) it is manifeſt that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
prayed now to be glorified with the Glory wherewith He was not then
glorified, but God was glorious before the World was, therefore Jeſus
intends by the Glory He had with the Father before the World was, the
Glory He had given him in Decree, before the world was.</p>
               <p>The Clinch is Fooliſh, and his Conſequence, Falſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious;
For what if Chriſt was not then glorified, <hi>muſt it
therefore follow, that He was not in being, much leſs glorified before the
World was?</hi> Can He be ſo great a Stranger to the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

an exalted and glorified Eſtate before He humbled Himſelf, <hi>elſe
how was He humbled?</hi> And it is peece of Sacriledge and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
I almoſt tremble to think on, that becauſe He was pleaſed to
deſcend in the Likeneſs of men, in order to the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
(in which <hi>Our Adverſary may alſo have his ſhare, if He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly

in the Form of God,</hi> whilſt He Himſelf thought it <hi>no Robbery
to be Equal with God;</hi> So that though in his humbled Eſtate and
Faſhion of a Man, <hi>He could not properly be ſaid to be glorified, and
therefore prayed to be ſo,</hi> yet it is no right Conſequence, that
therefore He never was before; For that would be to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
an Earthly <hi>Prince</hi> may for a certain time debaſe himſelf,
and take upon him the Condition of an Inferior Perſon, for ſome
great Benefit that He thereby deſignes to do his Country, if
after having effected it, He deſires to be received again into
that Glory and Splendor he enjoyed before, <hi>that therefore he
never had any before, only in Decree;</hi> If this would be both Falſe
and abſurd, the other is much more. This is the great Myſtery
of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> indeed the Rock on which they ſplit; they do
not diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>Form of God,</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs of Men;
that</hi> which came into the World <hi>to do the Will of God,</hi> and the

               <p>Nor does this Scripture at all make for his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">John 7. 39.</note>
                  <hi>for Jeſus was not yet Glorified;</hi> ſince it might as well
have been ſaid, He has not yet dyed the Death of

the Period of that ſtate; unto which He had from the Form

has he been preſſed thereby as a Cart is with Sheaves, and that

               <p>
                  <hi>4thly, He quotes</hi> G. F. <hi>thus,</hi> The Promiſe is to the

<hi>To which he ſayes, The Apoſtle has it thus,</hi> And when

to the Holy Spirit's words, then to put Chriſt for God.</p>
               <p>It will not be hard to clear this Miſtake in our Adverſary, and
that to his great Shame; For who will think him fit to mannage
Controverſies, that is ignorant in the very letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
It is evident, that he denies Chriſt to be all, and in all;
and that <hi>G. F</hi>'s ſo aſſerting him to be, is the Cauſe of his Cavil
at him. Now hear what the Apoſtle ſayes in the matter, Col. 3. 11.
<hi>Where there is neither</hi> Greek <hi>nor</hi> Jew, <hi>Circumciſion nor Vncircumciſion,</hi>
Barbarian, Scythian, <hi>Bond nor Free; but Chriſt is All, and in All:</hi>
And if Chriſt be All, and in All, and he that is All, and in All
be the True and Living God; then, <hi>becauſe Chriſt is All, and in
All, Chriſt is the true and Living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, who has done the Injury, G. F. to the Holy Writ,
or this obſtinate and peeviſh Adverſary to Chriſt Jeſus, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Lord of Glory?</p>
               <p>5thly, His next <hi>Socinian</hi> Claſh at G. F's Citation
of Scripture is in the ſame Page with the former;<note place="margin">Page 15.</note>
and it is at his ſaying, <hi>God is the Word,</hi> inſtead of,
<hi>the Word was God;</hi> adding, <hi>That though the Word was made Fleſh,
(or was Fleſh) yet no conſiderate man will ſay, that Fleſh is the Word.</hi>
A great deal of do, for fear Chriſt ſhould be God; but from
this notable Diſtinction of his we are not without a Relief: If
the Word was God, and the Word be God, <hi>then God muſt
needs be the Word;</hi> that is, If he that is called God, be the
ſame Being with him that is called the Word, then God may
as well be called the Word, as the Word may be called God;
for inſtance, If Chriſt and Jeſus agree equally to one and the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60238:55"/>
ſame Being, what is the difference betwixt ſaying, <hi>Jeſus was
Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt was Jeſus?</hi> Certainly we may juſtly ſay of him
what he in a way of Reflection ſayes of G. F. Methinks he is
more Nice then Wiſe. And for his Inſtance about the Word's
being made Fleſh, that is; (ſayes he) <hi>was Fleſh:</hi> I deny his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe;
for it is neither properly to be read, was made
Fleſh, nor was Fleſh; but rather, <hi>The Word took Fleſh, and pitcht
his Tent or Tabernacle in us:</hi> Thus <hi>Clarius;</hi> and almoſt all agree
It to import a more Spiritual ſignification; ſo <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
eſpecially; and for the Ancients, they were poſitive, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,
Juſtinus, Tertullianus, Origen, &amp;c.</hi> but above the reſt,
<hi>Tertullian adv. Praxeam;</hi> but this is not ſo very material to the
Point. However, if the very Word had become very Fleſh,
I mean viſible to Carnal Eyes; it would not be inconſiderate in
any man to ſay, then Fleſh is or was the Word: and if our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
underſtood himſelf, he would perceive, that there would
be only a Tranſpoſition of words, and no material Alteration:
<hi>For that which is now Fleſh, or</hi> (as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have it) <hi>Man, is
the Word;</hi> as that which is God, <hi>is alſo the Word.</hi> But enough for
this, only we may obſerve by the way, that the Man is not ſo
hearty an Enemy to Tranſubſtantiation as he would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
pag. 44. who can think the Word was properly made
Fleſh.</p>
               <p>6thly, His Objection againſt G. F. for joyning
Chriſt with God,<note place="margin">Page 16.</note> ſaying, <hi>His Father and He are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all,</hi> is Irreverent and Frivolous; For, who
dares deny it? and what abuſe is it to Scripture? Sure I am
his ſaying ſo, and that without any Reaſon, ſhews him to be a
man of Unreaſonable Confidence.</p>
               <p>7thly, He is angry that when G. F. mentions
this Paſſage,<note place="margin">Page 17.</note> 
                  <hi>To whom every Knee muſt bow, and Tongue
confeſs to the Glory of God,</hi> that he adds not <hi>Father.</hi>
I could not have believed, that any man, who loves Seriouſneſs,
ſhould beſtow his Time ſo idlely: <hi>Is this the earneſt and deep Study
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e talkt of, by which he hopes to obtain Divine Knowledge?</hi> But ſayes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60238:56"/>
he, Why did he not add the term Father to God, <hi>nor inſert,
that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord?</hi> But the truth of this Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
not with their Doctrine, that the Father and Son are one.
I confeſs it is ſomewhat hard to underſtand what he would
be at; but let it ſuffice, that he who is called God, is called
Lord above an Hundred times, therefore one; to which Chriſt
Himſelf bears Record, <hi>I and my Father are one, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worketh hitherto,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and I work; for, whatſoever things
he doth, thoſe doth the Son. To us a Child is born, to us
a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon His
Shoulders;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,

Prince of Peace;</hi> the ſame Power, Spirit, Light, Life, Wiſdom
and Being forever.</p>
               <p>8thly, His next Antichriſtian Cavil is at G. F's
making the Holy Spirit as well to proceed from
the Son,<note place="margin">Page 17, 18.</note> as from the Father: The Scripture
runeth thus, <hi>But when the Comforter is come, the
Spirit of Truth, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father</hi> [even]
<hi>the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the Father, He ſhall teſtifie
of Me:</hi> But, ſayes he, according to G. F. thus, <hi>Chriſt is in the
Father and the Father in Him, and He will ſend them the Comforter,
that proceeds from the Father and the Son:</hi> and for this quotes an
Epiſtle writ by <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> and prefixt to <hi>G. W</hi>'s Book of
the Divinity of Chriſt. It is paſt my skill to underſtand the
Difference, unleſs it be this, That the Spirit he makes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
as well from the Son as from the Father, and ſo it doth if
I underſtand Scripture; for the place it ſelf ſaith it: But when
the Comforter is come, <hi>whom I will ſend unto you from the Father;</hi>
which ſhews, <hi>that not only God, but Chriſt alſo, ſends forth the Holy
Spirit into the Faithful.</hi> Alſo, <hi>But if I depart, I will
ſend Him unto you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 16. 7, 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of Himſelf, but
whatſoever He ſhall hear—He ſhall glorifie me and ſhall
ſhew it unto you</hi>—And when he had ſaid this (Peace be
unto you;<note place="margin">Chap. 20. 21, 22.</note> my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I
you) <hi>He breathed on them, and ſaith unto them, Receive
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60238:56"/>
ye the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In ſhort, If the <hi>Holy Spirit be ſent by Chriſt,</hi>
and <hi>received of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>is breathed on His by Chriſt,</hi> then the
Spirit muſt needs proceed or come from Chriſt; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
what G. F. ſaid is ſound and Scriptural, and our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's
Clamours are Vain and Envious: For, whilſt he
quotes G. F's calling upon <hi>Vincent, Danſon,</hi> and others, for
plain Scripture, and would ſuggeſt, becauſe <hi>doth proceed</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
inſtead of <hi>is ſent,</hi> that he himſelf is Unſcriptural, He
omits to tell the World what it was G. F. made that Demand
for, viz. to prove <hi>Three Diſtinct and Separate Perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
Now whether there is the ſame Reaſon for the one as for
the other, I leave to all ſober Men to judge, yea, to our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
himſelf, if he dare be juſt.</p>
               <p>9thly, His laſt <hi>Socinian</hi> Objection to G. F's Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Application of Scripture, is this,<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> That
whereas the Scripture ſayes, <hi>For this End Chriſt both
dyed, and roſe, and revived, that He might be Lord both of the Dead and
Living:</hi> He ſayes, <hi>That he might be God both of the Dead and Living.</hi>
Alſo, where the Scripture ſayes, <hi>Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in
you richly:</hi> G. F. has it, <hi>Let the Word of God dwell richly in you:</hi>
By all which it is eaſie to obſerve, how averſe he is from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt the leaſt ſhare in an Eternal Divinity, making it, his
Buſineſs to abſtract from every Scripture that may in the leaſt
Favour ſuch a thing, and imperiouſly rant it over us in the
abuſiveſt termes, as <hi>Impoſtor, Lyar, Falſe Prophet, Forger, void
of all Reaſon,</hi> with abundance of the like Complexion, the
proper Language of Brutiſh Malice, and not a True Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple.</p>
               <p>But let us anſwer to his Objection, If Chriſt
be God over all,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 5.</note> as ſaith the Apoſtle, then why not
<hi>God both of the Dead and of the Living,</hi> as well as
<hi>Lord both of the Dead and Living;</hi> and likewiſe, why not, let
the Word of God, as well as let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you
richly; for if the Word of Chriſt <hi>be the Word of God, and if God,
be the Lord, and the Lord, God,</hi> then why not <hi>God in both places as
well as Lord?</hi> Firſt, I am well aſſur'd that God is
called Judge of Quick and Dead,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 1.</note> and if ſo, <hi>then
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60238:57"/>
becauſe Chriſt is Lord of Quick and Dead, Chriſt
the Lord is God of both Quick and Dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 5.</note> unleſs
there be more Lords of the Living, and the
Dead, then the One Almighty God and Lord of Heaven and
Earth.</p>
               <p>Beſides, methinks this <hi>Critick</hi> might have conſider'd, that it is
not expreſly in the Greek, <hi>that He might be Lord,</hi> but that he might
<hi>Raign over the Dead and the Living,</hi> ſo ſaith the <hi>Arabick;</hi> but the
<hi>Aethiopick</hi> has it, <hi>That he might judge both the Dead and the Living.</hi>
In ſhort, Chriſt is called both <hi>God, Lord</hi> and <hi>Judge;</hi> and ſince
there is but one only True <hi>God, Lord and Judge</hi> of right Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
we therefore believe, <hi>Chriſt to be that only True God, Lord,
and Judge of both Quick and Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here let me caution the Man of his eager Oppoſition to
Chriſt's Divinity, ſince ſuppoſing it ſhould not be true, <hi>there can be
no Detraction;</hi> and if it ſhould prove true, as he may one day know,
he will be guilty of robbing Chriſt of that, for which he thought
it no robbery himſelf to be equal with God; that is, to be the
<hi>only true God Himſelf.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Firſt,</note> in anſwer to a Prieſt thus, <q>Contrary to
<hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine and Chriſt's, who ſaith, The Light
that doth enlighten every man that cometh into
the World,<note place="margin">Page 8. Joh. 17.</note> is the true Light, that man through the
Light might believe.</q> Our Adverſary anſwers, <hi>That it

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60238:57"/>
Light <hi>John</hi> had, <hi>he received it from Chriſt, the Fountain of Life:</hi>
So that ſtill the Light was that <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Inſtrument.</hi> Beſides,
he does not poſitively charge G. F. with referring thoſe words
to that Verſe; and to be ſure that is no Doctrinal Miſtake, ſince
moſt true in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, His next Criticiſm is this, whereas the
Scripture runs thus,</hi> For God,<note place="margin">Pag. 8, 9.</note> who commanded Light to
ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give
the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>He
brings in G. F. citing it thus,</hi> The Light which ſhined in their Hearts
to give the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.
<hi>Again,</hi> Which was the Work of the true Apoſtles, to bring People to
the Light within, that ſhined in their Hearts, to give, &amp;c. <hi>Again,
he ſayes,</hi> The Light, that which gives the Knowledge. <hi>But, ſayes
he, if he had recited it right, it would then have appeared,</hi> not only
that God was the Giver, but alſo, that it is the Light of Knowledge,
and created; for God cauſed Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs by creating it,
<hi>Gen. 1. 3, 4. Thus far this impertinent Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I ſay, that firſt he obtrudes an arrant Lye upon
our very Senſes, to ſay, that <hi>G. F.</hi> has not rightly cited it,
for ſo much as he did cite; For God cauſed the Light to ſhine,
where? in their Hearts: So ſayes <hi>G. F.</hi> But for what? to
give of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus
Chriſt; And doth not <hi>G. F.</hi> ſay the ſame? Wretched Scribler!
How Idle, how Frivolous, and how very Troubleſom is he
with his Ridiculous Remarks?</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Knowledge comes by the Light, all but
ſuch Bats as himſelf muſt needs ſee; For why did God give his
outward Light, if not to give external Sight, and Diſcerning?
And to what purpoſe did He cauſe his Inviſible Spiritual Light
to ſhine, <hi>if not to give an Internal Knowledge of the Glory of God
in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Beſides, God himſelf is Light, He
is that Great Supernatural Sun, that ſhines throughout the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
World, offering unto Men the Knowledge of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Glory, and that in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. This is our
Meſſage, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Creation of this Light, becauſe it gives Knowledge, may
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60238:58"/>
as well ſay, <hi>God who was the Fountain of it was created too,</hi> becauſe
He gives Knowledge; I would have him give us one Scripture
that therefore calls the Light created, becauſe it gives Divine
Knowledge, <hi>or if he can, but one Reaſon:</hi> who fools himſelf,

it: For what groſſer Darkneſs can be, then to aſſert the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the hight upon that very Account, for which we
ought moſt truly to believe it Spiritual and Eternal; But
enough for this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith, <hi>But the Word is nigh thee in thy
Heart.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 9. 10.</note> Deut. 30. <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith our Adverſary, <hi>ſayes,

dare tell him, that he will not grow over-Rich with the Spoils
he is like to gain by ſuch Conqueſts, though his Fancy be ſtrong,
which is the Diſeaſe that follows him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, However he is reſolved to proceed, that what each

which our <hi>Adverſary</hi> corrects thus, Now the Angels
words runs thus; <hi>Why ſeek ye the Living among the Dead? He is
not here, but is riſen:</hi> So <hi>G. F.</hi> leaves out, <hi>He is not here, out of
the middle of the Citation, for that would have overthrown his Opinion
of Chriſt within.</hi> I ſtill intreat the Reader to obſerve what
Slight Grounds he hath to build his infamous Charge upon:
But what will not Envy do? but, he greatly errs, if he
thinks that the putting in, or leaving out of thoſe Words doth
overthrow our Hearty Belief of Chriſt's manifeſting of Himſelf
within; For what if the Angel chiefly intended the Reſurrection
of that Viſible Body which was ſlain a few dayes before, will
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60238:58"/>
it therefore follow, that the place may not alſo be very aptly
uſed to expreſs the Myſtical Reſurrection of the Divine Life
(which for many Ages hath as well by <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Pilates, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
as Vncircumciſion, Profeſſors as Prophane,</hi> been crucified,
laid as in a Grave, and a Stone rowl'd over it, yea and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

of the Pride, Glory, Pleaſures, and Religions of this
World ſhould riſe again to teſtifie againſt them all) which has
been the Cauſe why Truth hath ever met with rugged enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
from the men of the World? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is evident that

                  </gap>n of them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what Faith they ought to have had in the Promiſe of
his Reſurrection, which did direct them to an inward Power,
whereby they might have had a more Heavenly Senſe of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
and Life in themſelves, far more beneficial to them,
then coming thither in an affectionate haſte after his Viſible
Appearance, which it was expedient for them that it ſhould
be with-drawn.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, G. F. <hi>He is riſen, and the Saints ſits with
Him in Heavenly Places.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 10, 11.</note> Our Adverſary (<hi>we muſt take
no notice of the Failure in Syntax, for that's frequent) Now</hi>
Paul <hi>ſayes</hi> Epheſ. 2. 6. <hi>And made us ſit together in Heavenly
Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now there may be a different Senſe of
Sitting with Chriſt, and Sitting in Him; <hi>For the People of a
State may be ſaid to ſit in their Ambaſſadour when he is ſeated,</hi>
but ſcarcely <hi>with him.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, he wrongs G. F. in
ſaying he has abuſed the Scripture by putting <hi>with</hi> for <hi>in,</hi> ſince
there is no Difference at all in what he would Fantaſtically
have to be <hi>one;</hi> for if the People are in the Ambaſſadour, and
the Ambaſſadour ſit <hi>then the People ſit, or I don't underſtand Words:</hi>
for who can the Ambaſſadour repreſent but the People? If then
the Ambaſſadour ſits, <hi>certainly the People ſit repreſentatively.</hi> Now
though the Similitude be lame, yet it plainly refutes him as to
the uſe for which he brought it; I conclude therefore that ſuch
as ſit in the Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>can't be ſaid to
ſtand with Him, if He be there ſeated, and conſequently they ſit with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60238:59"/>
him,</hi> ſuitable to that expreſſion of his, <hi>Ye are they
which have continued with me in my Temptations,</hi>

I appoint unto you a Kingdom as my Father has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my Table in
my Kingdom, and ſit on Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
Secondly, He tells us a plain Lye, for finding Fault with G. F's
Syntax, viz. <hi>Sits</hi> for <hi>Sit,</hi> ſayes he, that he muſt take no notice
of that which at the ſame time he flings in his Diſh, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, But now he thinks he has enough againſt
G. F.<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> and manages it, not with a little Triumph;
<hi>And ſo to the Word Chriſt Jeſus, Him by whom the World
was made, before it was made.</hi> This he thinks ſtabs our Cauſe to
the very Heart, and proves that good Man <hi>an Impoſtor, Lyar,

controle.</hi> But let not his frothy Spirit boaſt ſo much (ſaying he

of him to ſolicit for an Anſwer, and would not have been
much wiſer in us to have gratified him, if a Benefit to others had
not invited us to it.</p>
               <p>But is there no allowance to be had for <hi>Curt Expreſſions,
Eſcapes of the Pen, Overſight in Compoſitors, and Errors in the
Preſs?</hi> Doth he deal candidly, or as he would be dealt by?
But ſuppoſe the worſt that may be (<hi>for we would not indebt our
ſelves to his Favour</hi>) can we make no Senſe of it? Suppoſe a
Comma at the firſt <hi>made,</hi> and read it thus; <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, Him
by whom the World was made, before it was made;</hi> where, <hi>and,</hi> being
underſtood, explaineth the Senſe, <hi>was,</hi> maketh it more clear:
And how frequent are ſuch Words, nay, of more moment, left
to be underſtood? Read the Scriptures, and how many Words
are there that have none in the Original, <hi>and read but the other
Words once without them,</hi> and G. F's Expreſſion will not ſeem
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60238:59"/>
abſurd or paradoxal. Beſides, it is allow'd by all, if the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of the Words will make out the Senſe intended, that
it removes of right, the Exception; Now read the Words
thus, <hi>And ſo to the Word Chriſt Jeſus, before the World was
made, Him by whom it was made,</hi> and then let our <hi>Adverſary</hi>
quarrel his fill.</p>
               <p>However we have one Way of reading theſe Words, yet,
and that by Figure he hath taught us (viz.) <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, Him
by whom the World was made</hi> in Decree, <hi>before it was actually made;</hi>
for ſo he ſayes, Chriſt had of his Fathers Glory before the
World began, not actually, <hi>but by Decree only,</hi> which if it ſeem
Ridiculous, I hope he may have a better underſtanding both
of himſelf and the place. But to proceed:</p>
               <p>Seventhly, G. F. anſwering a Prieſt that denies
Conſcience can juſtifie, ſayes,<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>which is contrary to
plain Scripture, where the Apoſtle ſaith, their Conſciences
either accuſing or excuſing.</hi> But hear our peeviſh Adverſary, <hi>who
would think that</hi> G. F. <hi>ſhould have either ſo little Wit or Conſcience
as to write in this manner?</hi> For the Scripture words are theſe,
<hi>their Conſciences alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean
while accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi> The Difference (I mean
Doctrinal) in this place I don't ſee; It becomes a Man of his Wit
and larger Conſcience to perceive it, <hi>who can make and fling dixt
for the Alteration or Omiſſion of a word not abſolutely neceſſary:</hi> for
how can we ſuppoſe he meant thoſe good Gentiles that became
a Law unto themſelves, to have <hi>thoughts</hi> different from their
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſo far as concerned Evil or Good, and the Peace
or Trouble that followed the Doing of the one, or the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the other? For to what did their Conſcience bear them
Witneſs if not to their Doing Well or Ill, and conſequently
to acquit or accuſe? <hi>Therefore their Conſcience did bear Witneſs
to the Accuſing or Excuſing as well as their Thoughts, for that
their Thoughts and Opinion of one anothers Innocency or Guilt are
ſquared by the Witneſs that their Conſcience did give,</hi> the place
ſtrongly implies. In ſhort, they could not make that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one another without a certain Knowledge of the ſame
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60238:60"/>
thing in themſelves, and they muſt have received that only
by the Teſtimony of their own Conſcience; which is no more
but this, <hi>the Judgment of a man concerning his own good or ill
State, by the In-ſhining and Diſcoveries of God's Holy Light:</hi>
and this the Gentiles had in meaſure, and our Adverſary
granteth it, as well as his Eminent Preacher, pag. 40.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, G. F. ſayes, in anſwer to the Prieſt,
that denyed him to be perfect who bridled his Tongue,<note place="margin">Page 14.</note>
                  <hi>which is contrary to the Apoſtle</hi> James, <hi>who ſaith he is;</hi>
which our Adverſary calls belying the Apoſtle, who ſayes, <hi>If
any man offend not in word, the ſame is perfect.</hi> And what Difference
is there now? one ſayes, <hi>He that bridles or rules the Tongue,</hi> and the
other ſaith, <hi>He that offends not in Word is the perfect man:</hi> unleſs
a mans Tongue can be ſaid to be bridled or ruled when it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
(which cannot be ſuppoſed by any, but Perſons of this
mans Ignorance.) In ſhort, <hi>Not to offend in word, or bridle that
which would utter it, is one and the ſame thing:</hi> for that which bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
the Tongue bridles the Body, which is the perfect man that
offends not in word.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, G. F. ſayes, <hi>That God works all in us and
for us;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 14. 1 Cor. 12. 6. Eph. 3. 20. Phil. 2. 13.</note> for which he reflects upon him as at other
times, ſaying, he knows no ſuch place: but it is
ſtrange that he never heard or read, <hi>And there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
of Operations, but it is the ſame God which worketh
all in all—according to the Power that worketh in us; for
it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do.</hi> Now,
unleſs when God works all in all, &amp;c. we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
his working in us (<hi>and ſo give the Scripture the Lye</hi>) or, if
workt in us, <hi>yet not for us,</hi> which is to give our own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Lye; it will follow, and doth follow, That
God, who worketh all in all—according to his Power in
us, both to Will and to Do, does work it both in us, and for
us. But, Oh the Vanity of this poor man! that thinks by
theſe Paper Pellets, his Malice caſts at us, either to Wound us in
our ſelves, or in the minds of Sober People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:60238:60"/>
Tenthly, But he thinks he has done G. F's buſineſs
for him now,<note place="margin">Page 16.</note> where bringing him in ſaying, <hi>through
the Power of God the Goſpel;</hi> again, <hi>the Goſpel is the
Power of God:</hi> he thus adventures to correct him, The Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Christ, for it is the Power of
God unto Salvation, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now where to find out that Difference, which this <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted
Man</hi> abuſes G. F. for (ſaying, it proceeds <hi>from the ſame
bitter Root in him that perverts the ſence of Scripture</hi>) is paſt my skill;
for, <hi>if the Goſpel be God's Power, then God's Power is the Goſpel:</hi>
In one of the Paſſages it is as he would have it, which may ſhow,
that G. F. meant by the other Tranſpoſition of the word:
<hi>No new Sence or Doctrine;</hi> Groſs Folly, Incharity, and
Carping.</p>
               <p>Eleaventhly, But he ſtiffly charges him with
miſcitation in this Paſſage.<note place="margin">Page 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.</note> G. F. <hi>And ſo deny Chriſt
the Lord that bought them.</hi> Peter ſaith only, <hi>Denying
the Lord that bought them.</hi> Which, ſayes he, may as
well agree to <hi>God the Father, as Chriſt the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may gueſs at his Meaning without an Interpretation;
But muſt Chriſt be Lord, and not Lord, at every turn, when
this preſumptious Perſon will? If the fore-going Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be conſidered, it will appear, That <hi>Chriſt is that Lord that
ſome ſhould deny, after they had made Profeſſion of Him.</hi> In ſhort,
If a man's believing Chriſt to be that Lord, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him an <hi>Impoſtor, &amp;c. who is true;</hi> let all the World read,
and obſerve of what Ungodly Stuff and very Traſh his Libel

               <p>Twelfthly, The Scripture (ſaith our Adverſary,
and his own) runs thus, <hi>He that believeth on Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 19.</note>
                  <hi>out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of Living Water;</hi> where
<hi>His Belly</hi> is plainly ſpoken of <hi>Him that believeth:</hi> But G. F.
applies it to the Light <hi>Chriſt, out of whoſe Belly ſlowed Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Living Water, the Light, the Light muſt be Magnified
by G. F.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60238:61"/>
To which I ſhall only ſay, That it is no improper ſence at all;
<hi>for no man's Belly can be filled, but from His; therefore He is the
Fountain of Living Water Himſelf, from whoſe Belly ours come to be
filled.</hi> Beſides, If a Scripture will admit of two diſtinct ſences,
without Contradiction, they may be uſed in both thoſe ſences,
upon occaſion: So Chriſt the Light (whom we will Magnifie
above our Adverſary's Darkneſs) is that Belly and Fountain;
and ſuch as believe in Him, ſhall have their <hi>Bellies</hi> filled with
the Rivers of Living Water, that come from Him: He is the
<hi>Fountain that is ſet open for</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the River that
makes glad the City of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenth, G. F. <hi>The Church is the Pillar and
Ground of Truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 19. Epheſ 5. 25, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>without Spot, or Wrinkle, or Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
or any ſuch thing.</hi> Our Adverſary thus, And
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That He might preſent it unto Himſelf
a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch
thing.</hi> He ſaith, that <hi>might</hi> and <hi>ſhould,</hi> not that <hi>it is;</hi> but this
is the old Deviliſh Diſtinction of Sin-Pleaſers, that would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have the <hi>Church Compient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things follow hence; <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Disbelief of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the preſent <hi>Myſtical Church, by which Chriſt is rendred the
Head of a ſpotted Body. Secondly,</hi> That he is himſelf in a ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and wrinckled Condition, and every ſuch thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>an unfit Perſon to maintain the Faith of the true unſpotted Church
of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenth, G. F. (True Chriſtians)</hi> are Fleſh of
His Fleſh,<note place="margin">Page 19.</note> and Bone of His Bone. <hi>But the Apoſtle,
ſayes our Adverſary, has it thus,</hi> For we are Members
of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones. <hi>The Fault is this, that
he left out,</hi> For we are Members; <hi>hoping that it ſufficiently
proves Chriſt to be in Heaven, abſent from his Church; not
conſidering, that</hi> a Body can be no more without its Head, then Fleſh;
<hi>nay,</hi> it can better diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nſe with the loſs of much Fleſh and many
Bones, then the Head; <hi>for, if that be abſent, the Body quickly
dyes:</hi> Chriſt is the Head, Root, and Life of his Church, without
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60238:61"/>
which ſhe can never live one Comfortable Day. <hi>Beſides,
it contradicts poſitive Scripture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14. 18, 19.</note> I will not leave you
Comfortleſs,<note place="margin">Matt. 28.</note> I will come to you; I will be with you to the
End of the World: becauſe I live you live alſo. He that
is with you ſhall be in you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteenth, G. F. and the Apoſtle ſaid,</hi> The deep
Things of God was revealed by the Spirit of God.<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> 
                  <hi>But
the Apoſtle, ſaith our Adverſary, ſpeaketh not ſo,</hi>
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for
the Spirit ſearcheth all things,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10.</note> yea, the deep Things
of God.</p>
               <p>Let all Sober People judge, whether this man does not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
cavil at us: For, if God reveals his deep Things by his
Spirit, <hi>then does the Spirit give unto us the Revelation of the deep
Things of God.</hi> Could he bluſh, he might be aſhamed to ſhew
himſelf ſuch a frivolous Buſi-body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixteenth, G. F.</hi> And ſo, who is in Chriſt is a New
Creature,<note place="margin">Page. 21.</note> old things paſs away. <hi>Our Adverſary,
The Apoſtle thus,</hi> Therefore if any be in Chriſt he
is a New Creature, old things are paſſed away, behold all things are
become New, 2 <hi>Cor. 15. 17. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the</hi> New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
as done; <hi>G. F.</hi> as a thing doing; <hi>but with great Patience
(for a little would be tired) I Anſwer, Where old things are
done away, and all things become new, there the New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is done;</hi> But in ſuch as he, that believes the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to be ſpotted, wrinkled, &amp;c, all things are far from being made
new, ſince old things are not past away; and in ſuch there can be no
New Creation as yet.</p>
               <p>Seventeenth, G. F. For it is the ſavour of Death
to the Death,<note place="margin">Page 21. 2 Cor 2. 16.</note> and Life to the Life. The Apoſtle,
ſaith our Adverſary, thus, <hi>To the one the ſavour of
Death unto Death, to the other the ſavour of Life unto
Life.</hi> Thus, that he may be true to his Way, he
undertakes the Confutation of G. F. and Proof of him to be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60238:62"/>
an <hi>Impoſtor:</hi> the Difference betwixt the Apoſtle's ſaying, and
G. F's citation, is, imputting <hi>the</hi> before Death and Life, which
is the ſame in Sence and Intention. But again,</p>
               <p>Eighteenth, The Scripture quoted by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
thus,<note place="margin">Page 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Of this ſort are they which CREEP
into Houſes, and lead captive ſilly Women, laden with Sins,
and led away with divers Luſts, ever learning, but never able to come to
the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> But G. F<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith, <q>Of ſuch as
have got the words, &amp;c. who are Reprohates concerning the
Faith; which crept into Houſes before the Apoſtles deceaſe;
which have kept alwayes learning, and never able to come to
the Knowledge of the Truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> led away with divers Luſts.</q>
Very well; and what's the Error or Perverſion here? Why,
the <hi>Apoſtle does not attribute to theſe Falſe Teachers, that they kept Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
alwayes learning, but they led captive ſuch as were ſo.</hi> And what
then? therefore is it not true in the ſence in which G. F. quotes
it? What wrong is there done to the Text, or ſuch Teachers
either? For who knows not that falſe Teachers do keep People
alwayes learning, but never bring them to the Knowledge of
the Truth? And certainly, they cannot be falſe Teachers, that
are not led away of divers Luſts: therefore they are both led
away of divers Luſts, and they lead others too. But it is worth
our notice, That he who has ſo frequently, and with ſuch Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
reflected upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> G. F's <hi>Syntax</hi> and <hi>falſe Engliſh,</hi> is ſo far
from being unblamable himſelf as to make that <hi>Elegant Apoſtle
guilty;</hi> for in the Epiſtle it is, They which Creep; in his
Quotation, <hi>They which CREEPS.</hi> But we delight not to ſpend
our time ſo unprofitably; ſuch are his Conteſts about the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine, being ſet over Chriſt's Head by his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers;</hi>
for he would have it written as ſaid in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and G. F. ſayes, <hi>Set atop of Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>over His
Head;</hi> and true it is what he obſerves. That <hi>all Languages have
crucified Him; and thoſe that have been moſt Learned, have been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
from the Kingdom,</hi> that is reſembled to little Children:
<hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid
theſe things from the Wife and Prudent, and revealed them unto Babes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:60238:62"/>
Nineteenth, G. F. ſayes, the Goſpel <hi>is preached in
every Creature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 22, 23.</note> Our <hi>Adverſary</hi> ſayes, <hi>was preacht
to every Ceature;</hi> and both are true: for in time paſt
it Was, and now I hope he will not deny but it Is.
<hi>In</hi> every Creature, or <hi>To</hi> every Creature may be the ſame;
For when the Goſpel of Repentance and Faith in God, are by
his Light and Spirit ſecretly revealed and declared in eveey
Heart, <hi>doubtleſs 'tis alſo to the Heart as well as in it;</hi> And though
there may be outward Preaching of the Goſpel, yet that which
is Effectual, comes from the Spirit and Power of the Goſpel,
and reacheth into the Innermoſt Parts, <hi>and the ſame Spirit gives
there the true Diſcerning and Senſe, and makes the Effectual Application
thereof, ſo that his Carping there is like all the reſt, Malicious and
Troubleſom!</hi> But he hath ſomething to the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>XX. Again G. F. <hi>If Chriſt be not within Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they are Reprobates.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 23, 24.</note> The Apoſtle and Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ſay, Know you not your own ſelves that Chriſt is
in you, <hi>except ye be Reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 15. 5. as if
<hi>in you</hi> could admit of no other Senſe but <hi>within you.</hi> Let us
ſee if the Words of Chriſt will alwayes admit that Senſe, <hi>Mat.</hi>
20. 26, 27. <hi>But it ſhall not be ſo</hi> within you, <hi>but whoſoever will
be Great</hi> within you, <hi>let him be your Miniſter &amp;c.</hi> thus far our
<hi>Adverſary.</hi> But certainly the Man can't think, that becauſe
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may ſometimes ſignifie <hi>among,</hi> that therefore in all caſes it
muſt do ſo; for let us read the verſe cited ſo, <hi>Know you not
your own ſelves that Chriſt Jeſus is</hi> among you <hi>except ye be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi>
This in his Opinion of Chriſt's Reſidence would be
moſt falſe: Beſides, if it ſhould be read <hi>within you,</hi> it might
be underſtood thus, <hi>within your Precinct, Company,</hi> or <hi>Society;</hi>
and the Senſe very good ſtill. However, it ſhews he hath but
little to do, who ſhall employ his time in correcting <hi>within you</hi>
for <hi>in you,</hi> ſince whatever is in any thing, <hi>is within that in which
it is,</hi> or elſe I know nothing. But he tells us that G. F. is
guilty of the like fault in relation to <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. where the
Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the <hi>Anointing, which abides in you;</hi> but he
thus, <hi>the Apoſtles brought the Saints to the Anointing within them;</hi>
To which I ſay, that He is Guilty of the like Fault of Fooling
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60238:63"/>
as before; For a School-Boy would be whipt for ſo much Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Ill-ſpent Time: He might have learn't better his
Greek Grammar; but indeed, I have cauſe to queſtion his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency:

of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and then
ſaying it is the groſſeſt Forgery, <hi>is as ſolvable as the
reſt:</hi> For firſt, the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of
Heaven are all one, unleſs when men are in the Kingdom of
Heaven, they are not in the Kingdom of God; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
wiſe. Thus <hi>John</hi> called that very Kingdom
which in the Text is ſtyl'd the Kingdom of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 2.</note>
                  <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> The like may be read in the
tenth of <hi>Mark.</hi> If then the Kingdom of God and Kingdom
of Heaven be all one, <hi>certainly if the Kingdom of God
be confeſt to be within,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 20.</note> the Kingdom of Heaven muſt
be there too. If this be the groſteſt Forgery, G. F.
is far from an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXII. He quotes <hi>Iſaiah, To the Law and
to the Teſtimony,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 24. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>if they ſpeak not according to this
Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20.
but G. F. thus; <hi>For Iſaiah bid them come to the Law
and to the Teſtimony, and you that come not to that Rule it is becauſe
you hate the Light in you;</hi> where he is much diſpleaſed that it
is hate the Light, and not rather, that <hi>they have no Light;</hi>
But this proceeds from that Ungodly Narrow Spirit, that
would not all ſhould be Enlightened, and would rather lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Blame of not Living up to the Law and Teſtimony <hi>to God's
not giving men Light, then to his and other mens hating of it:</hi> but
every one has Light, though every one hath not the benefit
of it through their own Diſobedience to it.</p>
               <p>XXIII: G. F. <hi>The Letter was dead, and did
not give Life;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> but, ſayes he, I am to ſeek for the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60238:63"/>
Scripture, I find indeed the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith 2 Cor. 3. 6.
<hi>The Letter killeth.</hi> But here he is not juſt to his Promiſe, as
in ſeveral other places; he finds G. F. uſing ſome Scripture
Words mixt with the like matter, and preſently ſayes; <hi>he
knows not to what place they do agree, if not to ſuch a ſaying of this
or that Apoſtle,</hi> making him to quote that which it may be
was not in his mind to quote. Next, the Literal Knowledge
does kill, and not make alive: and the Letter may alſo be called
dead, becauſe it makes dead by killing, as well as that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſenſe, there is no Life in it: But We know the ſtrict Senſe
of the place to relate to the Diſpenſation of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>XXIV. But now he thinks, he has unvail'd all,
and detected G. F. to the purpoſe.<note place="margin">Page 26.</note> G. F. <hi>in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a Prieſt about the Reſurrection of the Body,</hi>
he ſayes, anſwers thus, Chriſt—is <hi>the Reſurrection and the
Life, and thy dead body ſhall live with my dead body;</hi> This is
Scripture: but he calls it the greateſt Vanity, and Lightneſs,
beſides Forgery, that he has obſerved, in citing of Scripture.
And behold his Refutation! Is not this Man a ſtrange Kind
of Champion, who beſides his Abuſe, gives us no Knowledge
that he takes any notice of G. F. in the matter. For my part
I think the Anſwer good; for Chriſt is the Reſurrection, and
We do confeſs to a Reſurrection of the Dead out of the Graves
in the Judgment Day, by the Voice and Power of Chriſt
Jeſus our Lord, that men may be faſhion'd like unto his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Body, which is Spiritual, and Glorious, and Immortal.</p>
               <p>XXV. But he chargeth G. F. with wrong
Citation and Paraphraſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 37,<note place="margin">Page 27.</note> 
                  <hi>But let your
Communication be yea yea, nay nay; for whatſoever is
more then this cometh of evil:</hi> G. F. thus, He (Chriſt) ſayes,
<hi>In all your Communication let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, for
whatſoever is</hi> contrary <hi>is evil;</hi> why not here as he has it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
<hi>whatſoever is more is evil,</hi> charging us with calling
God to Witneſs in Communication <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis ſtrange to me that one, who not long ago was for <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60238:64"/>
ſhould now think the <hi>Quakers</hi> that are againſt it <hi>go too far in
calling God to witneſs.</hi> But let the man know, that by contrary
G. F. underſtands the extraordinary wayes of Affirmations, as
Oaths, and the like, eſpecially in Caſes of Evidence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an <hi>Evangelical Righteouſneſs is more then ordinarily concerned:</hi> This
he might have collected from thoſe <hi>words he after cites;</hi> but he
wanted that Candor, that Generous <hi>Adverſaries</hi> ſhew.</p>
               <p>XXVI. He is very angry with G. F.
for putting <hi>is</hi> for <hi>was;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 27.</note> 
                  <hi>God is in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
the World unto himſelf,</hi> 2 Corrinth. 5. But
methinks, if he conſiders as he believes, that all men are not
actually reconcil'd, then men are at moſt <hi>but a reconciling,</hi> and
<hi>that's the time preſent:</hi> wherefore, if God in Chriſt only can
reconcile the World unto himſelf, then ſince there is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the World irreconcil'd, though the work be going
on in ſome; it will follow, <hi>that either none now</hi> can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
or elſe God is as well (though not by ſo viſible an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance)
in Chriſt <hi>now reconciling the World to himſelf as</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
therefore, <hi>is,</hi> may be as proper as <hi>was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXVII. But he brings in G. F. anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prieſt about the Saints enjoying the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature thus,<note place="margin">Page 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, that the
Divine Nature the Saints were made Partakers of:</hi> but ſaith our
<hi>Adverſary,</hi> Where doth any Apoſtle ſay ſo? <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes,
that by theſe you might be Pertakers of the Divine Nature;</hi> in which
I ſee no difference at all, that would have given any ſober Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the leaſt Scruple; for both import a <hi>participation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature.</hi> Doubleſs it griev'd the man he had no more againſt
Gods People partaking of the Divine Nature; for he ſeems to
deſire to work out all himſelf, and to be as little indebted to
God as he can; but, poor man, his works will be burnt.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. G. F. quotes this Scripture, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
10. 26, 27.<note place="margin">Page 28.</note> 
                  <hi>And he that ſinneth after he hath received
the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sin, but a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60238:64"/>
fearful looking for of Judgment:</hi> But ſaith our Adverſary, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath it, <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after that we have received the
Knowledge of the Truth, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that the difference, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
lies in the word <hi>wilfully:</hi> but as all men ſin not of compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but wilfully, ſo it was never our Principle to make God a
hard Maſter, or an unmerciful Judge, as he well knows; and
methinks he ſhould have had more reſpect to the juſt God, and
his own Soul, then to inſinuate what in his own Conſcience he
knows to be a plain falſhood, on purpoſe to bring us into ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſgrace. But I wiſh him Repentance and Remiſſion
for this <hi>wilfull</hi> ſin.</p>
               <p>XXIX. Here he does not ſo much charge
<hi>G. F.</hi> with corrupting Scripture,<note place="margin">Pag. 28, 29.</note> as with <hi>Idleneſs
and Ignorance</hi> in making uſe of it; Now let us ſee
wherein, why <hi>G. F. will have the Scriptures to be the Words, but
not the Word of God by way of excellency,</hi> as in <hi>Luke 1. Acts</hi> 1.
<hi>Rev. 22. alſo</hi> Moſes <hi>himſelf call'd them Words;</hi> to which our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi>
replies, <hi>That in the inſtance out of the</hi> Acts, <hi>that word which
is Engliſhed</hi> Treatiſe, <hi>is the ſame with that in the firſt of</hi> John <hi>which
is called the</hi> Word. But this is weak; for the ſame word may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e
uſed to ſeveral ends; I mean, that the ſame word which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Word of God as an Excellent Being, may be ſimply uſed
at an other time for Diſcourſe, Reaſon, Speaking, or the like;
and great care is to be taken in rendring of Words, that they
bear the ſence they are employed for in that place. So in the
<hi>Acts,</hi> It was an Hiſtorical Diſcourſe or Narrative of the Actions
of the Apoſtles, and therefore would have been ill appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to another ſignification. Thus <gap reason="foreign">

his Criminal Animadverſions upon <hi>George Fox,</hi> which he doth
thus, G. F. <hi>God juſtified</hi> (Job) <hi>and ſaid,</hi> Job <hi>did not ſin with his

with his Lips;</hi> which he ſayes, <hi>is far from not ſinning with his Mouth;</hi>
but which way I know not: For <hi>Lips</hi> are often by <hi>Synecdoche</hi> put
for <hi>Mouth;</hi> ſo that, if the Lips did not ſin, the <hi>Mouth did
not ſin.</hi> But after this Art of Evaſion, a man may ſay Himſelf

               <p>Firſt, I would deſire all that read our Diſcourſe to obſerve,

Scriptures; <hi>moſtly confeſſing, that the Alteration lies more in the Words,
then ſence of the places by him cited.</hi> If therefore I ſhall make it
appear, that both Chriſt and his Apoſtles have not obſerved ſuch
Exactneſs, as he ſo ſeverely reproves G. F. for the want of:
It is to be hoped, that he will either retract his unworthy Abuſe
of that Innocent and Good Man; or elſe, not think it hard in
us to charge this Blaſphemous Inference upon him, namely,
<hi>That he makes Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles Perverters of Scripture,

               <p>But what if we were unable to render thoſe obvious Reaſons
already offered? Would it follow, that G. F. muſt neceſſarily
be condemned as a Perverter of Scripture; and as having cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured

By no means; For it is granted on all hands, that what moſt of

falling ſhort of, or contradicting his own <hi>avow'd Principles.</hi> This
was the Caſe of the Prieſts G. F. diſputed againſt, but not his
They ſay, That the Scriptures, or Writings of the Holy Men of
God, as they are tranſmitted to us, with every Point, Iota,
or parcel of them, <hi>are ſuch a Sufficient, Infallible, Perſpicuous and

more clear, certain, &amp;c.</hi> But G. F. and we who are called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi>
although we heartily acknowledge the Scripture, ſo given
forth, to be a Declaration of the Mind of God, ſo far as it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60238:67"/>
pleaſed him to diſcover it; and that men ought to believe, read,
obey and fulfil them, as the Ancients did: yet that the Eternal
Spirit is by way of Excellency the Rule and Guide of <hi>Chriſtians,
who convinceth the World of Sin, reproves for, and redeems from it,
into the perfect Liberty of the Sons of God, as received and obeyed:</hi>
And this only gives the Knowledge of the Truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and brings into thoſe States of which the Scriptures are
but a Godly Narrative; And that this Infallible, Living, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit is therefore the moſt Certain and Unerring Rule,
above and beyond the meer Letter, which hath been and is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to any Miſcarriages: Wherefore <hi>G. F.</hi> had good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to put the <hi>Prieſts</hi> upon Scripture Proof, <hi>and that ſo critically,</hi>
as that they might not foyſt in any Doctrines upon Abſtruſe and
diſputable Conſequences of their own drawing, but grounded
on expreſs Texts of Scripture: For, if they defended the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>in every Iota, to be the very Word of God, and only ſtanding Rule;
of Faith, Worſhip and Converſation under the Goſpel;</hi> it was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
in him to tye them to their own Rule; whilſt on the

ſtanding Rule of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (however he might otherwiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
them) as rightly believing, That not a Law engraven on

Nay, G. F. is very excuſable, in what they by their own
Principle are condemnable. And therefore he cannot be upon the

of that Perſon from whom it came, who, a little after that cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Invitation to anſwer him, ſayes, That if I do, he ſhall ever
after have a better opinion of the Popiſh Writers that defend
Tranſubſtantiation, implying, That I ſhould be the abſurdeſt
of men, by how much there is not a more ridiculous Poſition in
any Religion then that: but this Abſurdity and Abuſe I return
upon himſelf, ſince no ſuch Writer could ſpend his time more
unprofitably then our <hi>Adverſary</hi> in his trivial Objections againſt
<hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>perhaps ſcarce ſo ſcurrcouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I forgive him his ſmall <hi>Eſſays</hi> at me (for they pinch me not)
only I will tell him, that the Eighteen pence <hi>Apology</hi> he would
ſeem to laſh both me and <hi>G. W.</hi> for, <hi>contains that Truth, Reaſon

                  <hi>And for the Excuſe he makes, why he ſeruples to tell us who
he is, I have already Anſwered it, and therefore need not reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the ſame things, only one Paſſage may be further conſidered,
and that is, where he ſayes;</hi> If you had my name, it muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what Party I am of, whether Epiſcopal, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Independant,<note place="margin">Page 44.</note> &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> accordingly all that is odious
either in the Doctrine or Practice of the whole Party, or
any <hi>Particular Perſon</hi> thereof, muſt be reckoned up againſt me; or if
I ſhould chance to be an old man, as your Adverſary <hi>Jenner,</hi> that
would help to render me doting at every turn; or if I have been a
Braſier, or a Taylor, the World muſt be told my name, with Tinker,
and Taylor at the end on't; and if this won't do, you have a way of
ſuggeſting (as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> againſt Mr <hi>Danſon,</hi> that he was
given to Gaming, Bowls and Nine-Pins) and if it prove falſe, you may
come off as he, by ſaying, you did but query, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To all which I ſay, Firſt, That he horribly belyes us, for we
never charged the Infirmities of a ſingle Perſon farther, then upon
that guilty Perſon, unleſs he were connived at, or juſtified in
his Wickedneſs by any whole Party. I charge him to give us
one Inſtance to prove his Reflection: Secondly, We know him
to be neither <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian,</hi> nor <hi>Independant, but a</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
Socinian, <hi>either aſhamed, or afraid of his Profeſſion.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
In the worſt ſence, he is an old man; for <hi>Malice, Slander,
Pride</hi> and <hi>Enmity</hi> reign in him, the nature of the Old Man that
is Accurſt: and <hi>if he be otherwiſe Young, he is ſo much the more
blameable, that he ſhould dote before he is old.</hi> Fourthly, We never
told the World mens Trades in a way of Detraction, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach:
our Souls abhor it; it is well known what we are our
ſelves, not of the great Tribes of the Earth, and therefore ought
the leſs to diſpiſe others for being Mechanicks, whilſt we are
moſtly ſuch our Selves, though were we what we are not; <hi>It
were a token of Pride and Incivility, as the other would be of Inſolency,
to diſdain either Poverty or Labour.</hi> It may be indeed, that the
<hi>Trade</hi> of ſome man may more generally denote him, then his
<hi>Name,</hi> becauſe there may be many of the ſame Name, but not of
the ſame Calling; as many <hi>Bunnions,</hi> but not many <hi>Bunnions</hi> that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60238:70"/>
are <hi>Tinkers,</hi> and being generally ſo ſtiled, not in reproach (that we
know of (<hi>ſince that title neither adds nor diminiſhes)</hi> but in a way of
diſtinction, <hi>perhaps we may have ſo diſtinguiſhed him;</hi> but certainly
if our <hi>Adverſary</hi> were either of an honeſt Calling, or ſought not
after a reputation in the World above it, he need not be aſhamed
of telling us who he is.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, his baſe Suggeſtion of G. W. is manifeſt: for who
knows not that the Prieſts give themſelves the Liberty of more
then that, what Game (almoſt) do they ſcruple to play at:
But indeed their religious Game they are moſt conſtant and
expert in, <hi>which they get moſt by;</hi> for in other Sports, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
loſe, but <hi>in that Game, they alwales win, the poor People
are the Loſers: And if</hi> G. W. to detect the Prieſt, ſince others
gave themſelves that loſe, did therefore make that Query; muſt
it therefore be taken for granted that he concluded him ſuch?
Would this malicious <hi>Adverſary</hi> be ſo ſerved in every Query that
may be put by him? But I appeal to all the reaſonable men that
ſhall ever read us, if his apprehenſion of our calumniating
him, be a Good reaſon for him to refuſe us his name, <hi>

                  <hi>Well, but</hi> the holy, and just God will certainly one day avenge our
Innocency upon the head of this malicious Slanderer, and all ſuch as

being freely reſigned to do his Will in our Generation, knowing, that
he is a plentifull Rewarder of thoſe that truly fear him, though the time
