            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is from a deep Senſe of a clear and through Exerience
that I am moved to lay before you, having freſh in my
Thoughts your Conditions; for upon that Ground did
I ſet up my Tent for many years, and was moſt unwilling to
remove it, till the Lord by Fire and Sword did purſue me,
and did turuble me out of all my Falſe Reſts; and whilſt I was
ſettling upon my Lees, he poured me from Veſſel to Veſſel,
where I never had a ſettled <hi>Peace</hi> nor <hi>Comfort,</hi> till the Lord ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
the Ark of my Soul upon the Mountains of <hi>Ararat;</hi> then
I did ſee all the World (I mean thoſe of that ſpirit) lying as
ſo many Dead Corps, ſwimming upon the Waters; and then my
Soul was refreſhed with the Senſe of God's Love, who had
pulled me like a Brand out of the Fire, who was walking from
Hill to Mountain, and running after the <hi>Lo here,</hi> and <hi>Lo there,</hi>
and ſeeking the Living amongſt the Dead, and the Pearl abroad,
that was lying hid within my own Breaſt; I was feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Husks, and the Inventions of Man, ſeeking the Law from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100928:3"/>
his Mouth, and treading upon the Light which was within,
which ſhined in Darkneſs, but Darkneſs could no compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it; and thus did I live in the Night of Darkneſs: but
that it was a <hi>Day of Love that the Lord viſited me from on high,
when I was wallowing in my Blood,</hi> with my Navil-ſtring uncut,
nor ſalted; and notwithſtanding the ſetting of my Feet in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Light, after ſo many years Conviction, and
that I had gone near to ſin out my Day, and that before the
Candle of the Lord was put out in my ſpirit, <hi>he did of Mercy ſhine
upon me;</hi> and though late I coming to the Vineyard to work,
he gave me the Wages of thoſe that came firſt. O the Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
Love of a Merciful, Loving, Tender and Long-Suffering
God; which did not cut the Thread of my Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Conviction and being brought to the Obedience of
the Truth; it was only the Free Love and Mercy of the Lord
that preſerved me, and the more that I ponder it the deeper
ſenſe I have of it, even to the bowing of me down, ſo that I
had no Peace till that I ſhould make my Condition known to
thoſe who are where I was; and that I may be ſet up as a <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

now being come to my Reſt, it is the more with me to ſhew to

               <l>It was the Lord's Free Grace</l>

            </lg>
            <p>Whilſt I was in my young and tender years, I was brought
up in a Family, and Families, where the Lord was Worſhipped
according to the Worſhip of that Nation of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but as
I grew more in years the Lord was pleaſed to give me more
and more the Light of his Preſence, and did offer me more plenty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100928:3"/>
of his Grace then I was willing to receive; and if I hàd gone
any further then the Form of the National Church (ſo called)
did allow, I was counted a Sectary, and ſo diſowned; and
my looking one Step further then their publick Faith did allow
ſhould become a Brand of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> notwithſtanding
as to their Law I was as ſtrict a <hi>Phariſee</hi> as many of my Equals,
and brought up at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> For, ſince I entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Covenant with that People, I came to ſee a little clearer,
and that the Covenant did tye ſo my Conſcience to their Form
of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> my ſpirit did begin to fail me in the thing;
and when there was an Order from the General Aſſembly, <hi>For
all the Nation to take the Covenant the ſecond time,</hi> in that Interim
the Lord had cleared the Fogs and Miſts, partly by opening the
Eyes of my Underſtanding, ſo that I Refuſed to take the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
the ſecond time upon the Day appointed for that End,
which was to be done upon a Firſt-day, called <hi>Sunday.</hi> A dear
Friend of mine (whoſe Name I will omit, becauſe now remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

ſlighting the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>That he wiſht all the Nation

to me, <hi>he was brought up a Herdſman, with keeping of Sheep at home,</hi>
which was a rare thing in the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> in theſe
times; and they were come one ſtep nearer to the <hi>Quakers</hi>
Principles, eſpecially having diſcharged the wearing of Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:
and if they had continued Faithful to the Meaſure
they had received then, and not run retrograde, they had not
ſo much ſtood in oppoſition to them now: But as I have ſaid,
We going to eſchew the Covenant-taking, to hear the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
who was called from his Sheep-keeping to Preach, we eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the taking of the Covenant the ſecond time.</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100928:4"/>
               <l>This was like the Covenant of old,</l>
               <l>That could not all perform;</l>
               <l>So neither could we live as we would</l>
               <l>In Things that are enorm.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Yet not ſo, but that I was taken notice of; and when I came
to receive the Sacrament (ſo called) at the preparation, the
day before it, in the <hi>Queen's Ferry,</hi> the Miniſter (ſo called)
of that Town, told me, <hi>That I muſt not come to morrow to their
Sacrament, except that I would take the Covenant;</hi> which I refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to do, nor never did after the firſt time: And that ſame
Perſon with ſeveral others of that Denomination, ſeeing me
to look further then their publick Faith did allow me, did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to keep me ſtill under Bondage to their Eccleſiaſtical
Law, ſeeing me not matter much the hearing of them; for I
having in meaſure entered the Promiſed Land, their Manna be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
loathſome to me; and they Expoſtulated ſo with me,
<hi>Why I did not frequent their Aſſemblies ſo much as formerly?</hi> I told
them, <hi>That there was a Thing beyond that, which I looked for:</hi> To
which they replyed, <hi>That I muſt take heed to that, for that was
a Sectarian and Dangerous Principle:</hi> And I told them plainly,
<hi>That I was not to receive the Law from the Mouth of Man:</hi> Then
the ſaid (called) Miniſter ſaid, <hi>That I Tempted God:</hi> And
when I told him, <hi>That God could not be Tempted</hi> (that is, <hi>to
Evil</hi>) his Anger was raiſed againſt me, ſo that he left any more
meddling with me in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>But that which firſt began to nauſuate me, and make me to
loathe that ſort of Government was, to ſee the Domineering
Pride of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of that Nation, that they could force
ſome that were not one with them in their Principles, to come
and take with them their Sacraments, as that of Bread and
Wine, and ſprinkling of their Children, whereof neither
Precept nor Preſident can be produced from holy Scripture;
and if the Parents will not bring their Children to them to be
Sprinkled, they will do it in their Abſence without, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100928:4"/>
How inconſiſtent this is with the Rule of the Goſpel,
and the Scriptures of Truth, I leave it to all that have the right
Eye open to judge of it: For they ſay. <hi>That the Children are
ſaved by the Faith of their Parents,</hi> and yet the Parents have not
that Liberty to uſe their own Freedom in that thing: And
the prophaneſt Wretch that lives ſhall not be refuſed that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge

or Figs of Thiſtles?</hi> And what other Miſcarriages of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
did alienate my Spirit from it, as the Pride of the
Covetous Clergy, and their going from one Benefice to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as they call it, <hi>Majus bonum Eccleſiae;</hi> but I ſay, <hi>Ventri;</hi>
that is, not for the more Good of the Church, but for the
Fatter Benefice of the Belly: and this is evidenced, that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
any of them go from a bigger to a leſs Stipend or Salla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but to a bigger, and ſo to ſell them that they have Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
with for the bigger Sallary; and ſome I have ſeen that
would not come till they had their Bargain made, for ſo much
a Year, as one would buy a Horſe in a Market; and if he be
not paid, he will not preach; and then when he is ſettled
Pariſh Prieſt, he is ordinarily Commander in chief, and all
his Pariſhioners muſt ſtoop to him; and if they pay not duely
what they Covenanted for, he will by proceſs of the Law,
purſue them, and ſtrain their Goods.</p>

did fall a Threatning him with their Thunder-bolt of their
Excommunication, ſo that he could not get ſo much time as
to conſider upon it, and to give in his Anſwer for his Defence ſo

not; <hi>for the Light ſhineth in Darkneſs, and they comprehend it not:</hi>
Ears they have, but hear not; <hi>but to the ſweet Enchantings of the

I being out of the Obedience; and inſomuchas I could not
loſe my <hi>Life,</hi> I did chooſe <hi>Death; for mans Life in this World is in
Viſibles,</hi> unwilling to be ſeparated from the World's <hi>Faſhions, and
Cuſtoms, and vain Religions, Honour and Profit,</hi> and all things which
I ſtood upon was a <hi>falſe corrupt Ground,</hi> whilſt I thus ſtood in the
Alienation. Upon the Conſideration of all this, the Lord was
pleaſed to dart in upon my <hi>prodigal ſpirit, to call me home from the
Husks that I was feeding upon, to my Father's Houſe;</hi> and whilſt the
Door of Mercy was open, he put a ſtop to the <hi>unlimitted Pleaſures
of the Fleſh;</hi> and then I came to hear the <hi>calm and ſtill Voice of the
Spirit,</hi> that was ſtirring in that contemned people called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi>
and the firſt ſtirring in me of that Nature, which I did emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
take notice of, was, <hi>As I was riding from</hi> Edinbrough <hi>in a
Winter Evening to my own Houſe, I did hear a Noiſe of ſome men, as it
were Fighting, ſo that I bid my Man ride up in haſte to ſee what it was,
which my Man doing, he called to me, and ſaid,</hi> That there was two
Men on Horſe-back beating of another Man going on Foot; <hi>ſo
that I ridingup to them, I did ſee them beatiug him, and he ſtill keeping
them off, ſaying,</hi> What did I ſay to you, but bid you FEAR GOD?
<hi>ſo that preſently I did perceive, that it was a</hi> Quaker, <hi>reproving ſin in
the other two; ſo I asking his Name, which he telling me, I knew
the man by Name, though not by Sight; and I was ſo offended with the
other two, that I fell to beat them with my Rod, and ordered thoſe that
were with me to carry them to the next Priſon; but he, the ſaid</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100928:7"/>
               <hi>did intreat me to let them go, which (after taking notice of their
Names and Places of Abode) I did let them go.</hi> And a Week after
the ſaid <hi>Quaker</hi> was telling a Relation of mine what a Curtiſie
I had done to him in a manner to ſave him; yet ſaid he, I <hi>found
that ſame ſpirit in him that was in the other two men who beat me;</hi> and
my Relation telling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me ſimply the word; as he ſpoke them,
the words did ſo reach me, that I meeting the ſaid <hi>Quaker</hi>
again, I did deſire him, <hi>That as he paſſed that way he would
make my Houſe his Lodging-place;</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>Which he ſeeing the Witneſs in me reached, he was the more

that I could diſcern ſpirits, as betwixt the ſpirit of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and
<hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> yet there was ſtill that Mind <hi>unbrought down,</hi> that ſtood
in my way to hinder my Obedience, ſo that the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſtick cloſer to me with his Rod; for firſt, <hi>He ſtripped
me naked by removing of my Children, which was by Piece-meal, to fit
me to yoke my ſelf under the Croſs, and then by ſeparating me and my
Wife for ſeveral years, ſo that I was wholly turned out of my Eſtate alſo,
as to this day I am to live in a Wilderneſs Condition, ſo that I was forced
to leave my native Country, and go to</hi> France; where then the Lord
began to work upon my ſpirit, to bring me the nearer to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
for when all Viſibles failed me, and thoſe to whom my <hi>Wife</hi>
and <hi>I</hi> moſt truſted did become my <hi>ſubtileſt Enemies;</hi> yet the Lord
did ſo Commiſerate my Condition, that in the Bowels of Mercy
he made me to take up the Croſs to my own <hi>will,</hi> and to reſign
my ſelf fully over to him, ſeeing all Viſibles failed me; and he
uſed that way of Mercy to bring me nearer to him, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe could; and thus cloſing with the Viſitation of the
Lord, <hi>I found more ſweetneſs and contentment then ever I had in my
fulleſt delight and Pleaſure of the World,</hi> and thus I do witneſs,
and the Lord is my Witneſs, that I never came to my Reſt till
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100928:7"/>
then; and I would have done any thing never ſo hard and
unpleaſing to the Fleſh, to bear a Teſtimony to the Truth that
the Lord had revealed in me; and ſhortly there was an Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
caſt into my hands to try me, and that was this, There
came a Woman Friend out of <hi>England</hi> to the Town of <hi>Diep,</hi>
(where I was then) together with a Maid, to bear a Teſtimony
to the Truth againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of that Nation, and brought
with them ſeveral Books of Friends tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi>
and diſtributed in the Town, and gave me alſo to diſtribute,
which were writ by <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>William Dewsbury,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
others, and ſome Papers they gave forth themſelves, which
I tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> they not knowing the Language;
but in all this they never did manifeſt to me their Intentions;
for it is like that in that frame of ſpirit that I then was in, and
fore-ſeeing the Danger, and not ſo fully come to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Truth, as I thought I was before the Tryal came; yet
ſo it was, that they went the next Firſt-day (called Sunday)
to the Meeting-Houſe of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> where there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Thouſands of People, and there did place themſelves in the
moſt Conſpicuous Place of the Meeting, juſt over-againſt the
then called Miniſter, the ſaid Friend having clothed her ſelf
in Sack-cloth, and her Hair hanging down ſprinkled with
Aſhes, was covered with her Mantle and Hood, and when
the ſaid called Miniſter was in the higheſt of his Devotion, ſhe

did ſtrike ſuch a Conſternation both upon the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

was ſo affected with that Sight, that ſhe ſaid, <hi>This is of a deeper
Reach then I can comprehend;</hi> for the Witneſs in ſome was ſo
reached at that time: and a little while after they both did fall
down upon their Knees, and Prayed, and then went out of the
Meeting, where a great many following of them, to whom
they diſtributed of their Books, and ſpoke in the Market-place,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100928:8"/>
and then came to their Lodging, which was in a <hi>Scotch</hi>-man's
Houſe, who kept a Victualling-Houſe, but no Entry there was
for them, and they being deſtitute came to my Lodging, I
knowing nothing of this all this time, I not going to that
Meeting, and when they came to me they did ſhow to me,
That their Work was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne that they came for to that Nation,
and now wanted Lodging till they went away: and I asked
them, What they had done? and they told me: ſo I went to
ſome other Victualling-Houſes to get them Lodging, which was
promiſed for them, ſo as I kept them at my Lodging till Bed-time;
and then I went with them to that place as was promiſed
me, and when we came Entry was refuſed there alſo, ſo that at
that time of Night Lodging could not be had for them, the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> had ſo ſtopped their Entry and where; ſo that I took
them back to my Lodging again, and offered them my Bed, and
would ſhift for my ſelf, I being better acquainted in the Town,
but they refuſed to put me out of my Chamber; then I dealt
with my Landlady of the Houſe, to let them ſtay in any of her
Rooms for that Night to ſit up in, but ſhe refuſed it, ſaying;
<hi>She durſt not, for fear of giving Offence to others;</hi> all that I could
prevail with her at that time of the Night, was to let them
have an Out-houſe to ſtay in for that Night, which was an Hen-Houſe,
ſo that I gave one of them my Night-Gown, and to
the other my Furred-Coat, to ſave them from the Cold that
Night, and the next day I brought them to my Chamber again;
and after that we had broken faſt, I went to the Key to look
for a Paſſage-Boat to carry them to <hi>England</hi> again, and in my
returning back I ſaw ſo many people of all ſorts ſtanding about
my Lodging, that I did paſs by it, but immediately one came
running to me, ſaying, <hi>That the King's Advocate was at my
Chamber, waiting for me;</hi> and when I came in he told me, <hi>That
I had Tranſgreſſed the Laws of the Nation, by receiving Perſons
of another Religion to my Lodging; for the King tollerated only two
Religions,</hi> viz. <hi>the Papiſts and the Proteſtants:</hi> Then I told him,
<hi>That I had not Tranſgreſſed the Law of Hoſpitality, and I was
forced to it, ſo as I could not let them lie in the Street, where they
were in Danger of their Lives by the rude Multitude:</hi> So they took
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100928:8"/>
them away with Serjeants to the Judicatory, where, after they
had judged them, they ſent them to Priſon, &amp; they not knowing
the Language, they wanted Food, and other Outward Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
none looking after them; ſo that I went to the Judge
<hi>Criminal,</hi> and ſought leave to provide for them, which I did,
by bringing to them both Bread and Drink, Fireing, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Neceſſaries ſo long as they were there: And the ſaid
Judge ſent for me, and whilſt I was with him to be Examined,
he ſent to my Chamber to ſearch what of theirs they could find
with me; ſo that they found ſome Books, and the Sack-cloth,
and ſome Aſhes, which they ſent to the Parliament of <hi>Roan,</hi>
from whom they had received an Order to read a Paper to
them, <hi>That they ſhould be tranſported forth-with back to</hi> England
<hi>with the firſt Paſſage-Boat (and all their Papers and Books to be burnt
at the Market Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

ſhould come to that Nation again:</hi> And ſo a Paſſage Boat being
made ready, they were put into it, in the Night time, but would
not ſuffer me to go along with them to it, yet did I provide
ſuch things as were neceſſary for their Voyage; and I told
them, <hi>That they were not to pay any thing for their Paſſage;</hi> but the
Judge told them, <hi>That they were to pay for their Paſſage;</hi> to
whom I replyed, <hi>That if I had the Liberty to chooſe a Paſſage-Boat,
and time allowed me, I would pay for their Paſſage, otherwiſe let the
ſame Boat bring them back again.</hi> So they were forced to pay
their Paſſage. After they were gone, they intended to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
me, as one of their Judgment; but I (willing to eſchew
the Croſs) told them. <hi>That I was there before they came to</hi> France,
<hi>and they could prove nothing againſt me, only the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
them, that I did not come to their Meeting, yet this they
could not make a Crime;</hi> as alſo, I told them, <hi>If they perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the like to be done to their Merchants in</hi> England: Then the
Judge ſent to the Cuſtom-Houſe, to ſee if my Name was in
their Cuſtom-Books, which they finding, did go no further a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt
me. Yet for all this I was not ſo ſenſible of the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs
of my Heart, as afterwards I was; for when the Judge
affirmed, <hi>That I was of their Judgment;</hi> I told him, <hi>That I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

them, but they were better then I, but that their Way was too

            <p>There were two things Remarkable that fell out within the

Friends of Truth. The one was, That the ſaid <hi>Scottiſh</hi>-man,
who ſhut them out, Dyed within the Twelve Moneths. And
the Woman, my Landlady, that refuſed them a Chamber to
fit in, that ſame time Twelve Moneths her Houſe was Burnt,
and never yet known whence the Fire came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though it
was in the middle of the Town, yet there was none Burnt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
but it alone.</p>
            <p>But afterwards I having ſent for ſeveral Hundreds of the
ſaid Friends Books, and did diſtribute them to the Country
and City, ſo many of them, ſo that they intended to ſearch
after me juſt as I was upon my leaving of that <hi>Town:</hi> having done
my Service there, did return to <hi>Roan;</hi> whereupon one Night
that I could get no Reſt, and was ſomewhat indiſpoſed in my
Body, ſo that it did ariſe in the Night time in my Heart, To
get up, and ſend ſome of theſe ſaid Books by Poſt, as ſome to
the Judge <hi>Criminal</hi> of <hi>Diep,</hi> and ſome of them to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
Colledge there, and ſome of them to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Colledge and
the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Paris,</hi> directing them after the <hi>French</hi>
ſtile, otherwiſe they could not have been received at the Poſt-Houſe;
and then I had much Reſt in my ſpirit, and my Body
returned to a Right Temper.</p>
            <p>And after that I had ſojourned a while at <hi>Roan,</hi> I found that
there was ſome Service for the Truth by me to be done at
<hi>Caen,</hi> becauſe it was a Town where moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were, and
there I did diſtribute ſo many of Friends Books there, and the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> there retaining ſo much of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
(as moſt part of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> do) having a
greater Inclination to perſecute thoſe who differ from them,
then to ſuffer for Religion; for they were the greateſt Enemies
I had (right <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) and they fearing that my Books
might bring them to ſuffer, becauſe they ſpoke againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts:</hi>
and I not coming to their Meeting, did complain of me
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100928:9"/>
to the Lievtenant General of that Town, ſo that they forced
me to leave that place.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>All you that are of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Race,</l>
               <l>Are thirſty after Blood.</l>
               <l>But thoſe that ſtand in <hi>Abel</hi>'s place</l>
               <l>Do follow after what is Good.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And after my Service done there, I went to <hi>Alencon,</hi> where
many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> live, where I ſtayed all that Winter; and when
I was in my Service, the Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Criminal</hi> ſent for me, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long Diſcourſe he and I agreed ſo well together, that he
invited me to come and ſee him oftner, and we ſhould not
ſpeak in Matters of Religion, and if I would that he ſhould
ſend for ſome of the Jeſuits, and they and I might have free
Inter-communing together: To whom I replyed, That I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Stranger I was not willing to diſpute with any, it not
being permitted to a Stranger; yet I would not be afraid to
maintain my Principles againſt all the Jeſuits of the Nation:
Which words did ſo exaſperate (it ſeems) them againſt me,
that it did raiſe a new Perſecution againſt me, which did fall
out, that when my Wife and I was walking in the Fields, at my
returning it was told me, <hi>That there was ſome ſearching at my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and had broken up my Chamber Door,</hi> ſo that I ſent my Wife
Home, and I did go ſtrait to the Judge <hi>Criminal,</hi> to know what
the Searching meaned; but he told me, <hi>He knew nothing of it;
and if there was anything, it did proceed from the Jeſuits becauſe of
my Confidence againſt them:</hi> and ſome probability I had of the
thing, for I found my Letters broken up at the Poſt-Houſe
ſeveral times; and when I challenged the Poſt-Maſter, he ſaid,
<hi>That they came to him ſo.</hi> So the time drawing near to go from
that place, and that I had done my Service in <hi>Alencon,</hi> I told
the Judge <hi>Criminal,</hi> That I was to go to the great Fair of <hi>Caen</hi>
within Fourteen dayes; then the ſaid Judge ſaid, <hi>That he
would protect me ſo long:</hi> And ſo at the time appointed I went to
<hi>Caen,</hi> where I was not long but my Correſpondent at <hi>Alencon</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100928:10"/>
did write me word, <hi>That the day after I came from it, the Governour
of the Town had been at my Lodging, to ſeek for me, but I was
gone:</hi> And ſo after that all my Service was done that I had
then in <hi>France,</hi> and that War was declared betwixt <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>France</hi> in the year 1666. I returned to <hi>Diep</hi> in order to
my return to <hi>England,</hi> and ſo I ſtaid there for Paſſage, which
I could not get in the Time of War, till the (ſo called) Lord
<hi>Holli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Embaſſador from <hi>England,</hi> was returning for <hi>England,</hi> of
whom I deſired Paſſage in his Company, which he freely gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me, and ſo came to <hi>England</hi> with his Convoy.</p>
            <p>But I have omitted all this time to ſhew you, that the High
Places as yet were unbroken down in me, but that ſome Groves
were as yet left ſtanding, notwithſtanding all the Wonderful
Mercies the Lord had beſtowed upon me, in carrying me and
my Wife upon the Wings of his Providence in our Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
Condition, which would ſpend more time to relate
then ſome (it may be) would beſtow upon the reading of it;
yea, and I dare ſay, that none could well underſtand nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but thoſe who have trod in the ſame Pathes as we did:
But I being ſo long in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and I ſo habituated and leavened
to their Faſhions and Cuſtoms, I was like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that could
Swear by the Life of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and had not come to that Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Language which God doth require, but could Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
with their Faſhions and Words: And I had Thoughts
that all was well with me, till I came to a Tryal in <hi>England</hi>
again, ſo that the Face of Friends did ſtrike a Dread and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in my Heart, when I thought that all was well, till the
Spirit of the Lord running through others of his Veſſels did
awaken me; for I was Upright in my own Judgment; but
the Lord ſearched me: For I could come with Confidence to
Meetings, and frequent the Aſſemblies of the Lord, yet I durſt
not own the Name of <hi>Quaker,</hi> I not being Faithful to the
Meaſure which I had receiv'd; for now it was become ſo far high
for me, as before my Obedience I had eſteemed it low; and after
that, I would willingly by Wiſdom have made void the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into ſuch things as Matters of Indifferency, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
them but Circumſtantials, and Fooliſh to put any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100928:10"/>
Weight upon the doing or not doing, it became ſo burthenſome
to me, that I could have undergone the greateſt Strait Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
rather then omitted it; and as I became Obedient,
there I felt Strength and Power, and a more real Content did
ſpring up in me; and in this Light and Power of the Spirit,
that hath viſited me, did I feel Strength to wait and know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Will and Mind; for in the height of this Exerciſe I
found my ſelf overcome; and my ſelf not my own, but the
Lord's, to do with me what he pleaſed to require of me, what
Service he would, I ſhould be willing to obey in his Strength;
and if the Lord never ſhow me any more, I feel Contentment
in his Will, earneſtly deſiring, that I may never ſtop the courſe
of his Spirit; for <hi>I</hi> find, that there is nothing can, nor is able
to ſatisfie my thirſty Soul ſhort or beneath the Lord of Life.</p>

               <p>THere are a few Words, which I have to add to you;
The Litteral Profeſſors, who can own the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Chriſt without you, but deny him within;
and who raiſe up Jealouſies and Prejudices againſt us, as
if we denyed the Scriptures and Ordinances of God, and
Chriſt that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> profeſſing him in Words,
but denying him in Reallity and Subſtance; and you to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100928:11"/>
be the only Owners of Chriſt, and yet ye forget your
own Principles, who have been all your time praying
for the Spirit of the Lord, and now when he comes to you
in his Spirit, ye will not only be ſhie, and ſcare off him,
but ye will perſecute all that will not own him after
your Form, though we really in our hearts own that
Chriſt in the Fleſh, which in the Fulneſs of Time
did offer up that Body prepared to do the Will of the
Father, according as it is expreſſed in the Scriptures
of Truth: Neither do we hold any thing for Chriſt, but
him who appeared, and was made manifeſt in the Fleſh.
I cannot believe that Doctrine of you the Litteral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
who recede from your own Principles of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Profeſſion of the Letter, which ſaith, <hi>Is not Chriſt
within you, except you be Reprobates?</hi> and <hi>Chriſt in you the
Hope of Glory.</hi> I know that ſome of you will ſay, That
it is the Vertues and Graces of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
know of you, How <hi>Chriſt's Vertues</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> are
ſeparated from himſelf? This ſeems a ſetting up of
your own Conceivings, or an Image in your Mind, of
the Mind of the Spirit, and miſs the Thing it ſelf,
which alone is known by the Spirit: For we find expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
a clear Diſtinction betwixt the ſearching
out by the Reaſonings of the carnal Mind, and Scriptures
opened by the Spirit, and felt in the Life. Therefore it
were better for you, to examine really your Knowledge
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> your Faith and Knowledge of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
and your Prayers alſo, leſt ye miſs of the Subſtance,
and meet with a Shaddow, which is only able to pleaſe
the Natural Part, but juſtifieth not the Soul, I deſire
that you let not this my <hi>Chriſtian-Expoſtulation</hi> with you
diſpleaſe you, but rather ſet you home, to ſink down
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100928:11"/>
to that which is only able to make you clearly diſcern,
whether you or we are the Trueſt Owners of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ye cannot make it appear by Scripture, which ye ſay
is your Rule to walk by, that the Outward Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> bringeth Salvation, without the Inward Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of the Spirit.</p>
