         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Deſign of this Treatiſe; ſince the aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That there is no ſuch thing as a Miracle,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Work above Nature,</hi> undermines the Foundations of both Law and Goſpel, overthrows the Credit and Authority of Divine Revelation, and remits us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a bare Religion of Nature and Morality, or to none at all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Authors <hi>Spinoza,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burnett.</hi>
               </note>The Book (to Aſſign to each Author his ſhare in it) conſiſts of Two Parts. The latter, which is the main, from the middle of the third Page to the end of the Book, is wholly (except two or three Authorities in the laſt page) a bare Tranſlation of the Sixth Chapter of the <hi>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus,</hi> written by <hi>Spinoza.</hi> Which Chapter he ſeems to have made choice of out of that Author, as effectual by it ſelf to compaſs the deſign of his whole Treatiſe: <hi>viz.</hi> To inſtill the Principles of <hi>Deiſme</hi> or <hi>Atheiſme</hi> into the minds of his Readers. The other part, which takes up the two firſt Pages and half of the third, is a Tranſlation likewiſe of part of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about <hi>Miracles</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part 3. cap. 37.</note> from whence he has taken as much as he thought would make for his purpoſe, and ſeem to be of a piece with the other Tranſlation out of <hi>Spinoza,</hi> to which he has prefixt it.</p>
            <p>Introductory to the Book there is a <hi>Premonition to the Reader.</hi> And here we might juſtly expect from him to ſpeak himſelf, and to give us a free and ingenuous Account of his Authors, his Tranſlation, and the Deſign of it. But the greateſt part of this too is Borrowed (or Tranſlated, whether you pleaſe) out of Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi>'s <hi>Telluris Theoria Sacra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 11. p. 114.</note> and the reſt only ſome brief Touches of what he has after more at large out of <hi>Spinoza.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49094:4"/>Of his Three Authors, the <hi>laſt</hi> I believe,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett</hi> againſt the opinion for which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</note> is not very proud of the company of the <hi>other two</hi>; and therefore is not much obliged to his Tranſlator for clapping him and them together as Confederates and Brethren in Opinion. But it is more pertinent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that two of the three are clearly <hi>againſt him</hi> in their ſenſe about the <hi>main point in Controverſie. Spinoza</hi> indeed is the great Patron of his Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That there is no ſuch thing as a Miracle, if we take the word to ſignifie a Work above or beſide Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> are point blank of the contrary mind, and therefore either they muſt ſpeak very inconſiſtently, nay in effect contradict themſelves, or what he here produces out of them cannot be drawn to favour his and <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo the co-herence of the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Collection</hi> will not appear to be very great, nor the Harmony very agreeable, to any that ſhall firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider each as they ſtand apart in the diſtinct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, before he examine them as they are here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated in the <hi>Rhapſody</hi> of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>To begin with <hi>Mr. Hobbs,</hi> whom we have leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect to have any wrong done him, we have no more to do but to read the reſt of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> leaves him, and we ſhall ſoon find that he admits and ſuppoſes Miracles in that very ſenſe, wherein he is produced to deny them here. For, Firſt, He defines a Miracle to be, <hi>A work of God beſide his Operation by the way of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ordained in the Creation</hi>; which is flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to that Aſſertion, <hi>That nothing can fall out but according to the order of Nature.</hi> 2. He infers from that Definition, <hi>That a Miracle is not the effect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49094:5"/>
Vertue in the Prophet whoſe Doctrine it confirms, but of the immediate hand of God: and that no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Angel, or created Spirit can work a Miracle.</hi> Which Poſitions (however queſtionable if underſtood of a delegated Power in Men or Angels) are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to demonſtrate that it is his ſenſe, that there are Miracles or Works above Nature. For if there are Works wrought which no <hi>finite Spirit,</hi> nothing but <hi>the immediate hand of God</hi> can effect, theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt ſurpaſs the force of Nature, ſhe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſecond Cauſes in all her Operations.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deſtroys the Authority of Miracles.</note>It is to be confeſſed, That Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> does <hi>in his own way,</hi> as well as <hi>Spinoza,</hi> deſtroy the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Miracles by his Doctrine: in as much as he <hi>does not admit them for ſufficient Credentials of the Divine Miſſion of any Prophet, when the Doctrine he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals does not ſquare with the Religion eſtabliſhed by the Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> So that all the Miracles of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were of no force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Doctrine they taught contradicted the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Tenets of the ſuperſtitious <hi>Jews,</hi> and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Yet, though theſe two Authors (equally to be honoured for the good Service they have done the Chriſtian Religion) agree very well in the main Deſign, they differ notwithſtanding very widely in the way of compaſſing it, as far as the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite parts of a contradiction can ſet them at odds: the one Aſſerting that there are works above Nature, the other denying it: So that the Author of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was not very well adviſed to think they would cotten ſo well together; and ought rather to have tried firſt how far the Work might be done by one of them ſingly, and to have reſerved the other for a new expedient if the former had failed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49094:5"/>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> then, we ſee, aſſerts there are Miracles. And ſo does Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi> in Words moſt expreſs, and in the very ſame Paragraph, part whereof he has quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of him in the Latine in his laſt Page, and at very little diſtance from the very Words, there quoted to repreſent him as an abettor of the contrary opinion,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>It is, I think, a ſufficient prejudice againſt the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he produces theſe Authors to inſinuate and patronize, or at leaſt his judgment in the choice of his Authors, that two out of three declare flatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in that Point. Yet 'tis poſſible that, as he produces them here, they may both better conſiſt with him and <hi>Spinoza</hi> than with themſelves. This therefore comes to be examined, and will lead us gradually to give a particular Anſwer to each part of the whole Work. We begin therefore with the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the Reader,</hi> he there with Mr. <hi>Burnett.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What he takes from Mr. <hi>Burnett,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The firſt part of the <hi>Premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> taken out of Mr. <hi>Burnett.</hi>

And ſo goes on with the reſt of that Page, which he tranſlates more faithfully: what he deſigned in this amplification, whether to amuze his Reader, oblige Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> or to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49094:6"/>
make a fair ſhew of his own great reading, I ſhall not enquire.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49094:7"/>I preſume that he does not <hi>play</hi> with us in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this importance, <hi>i. e.</hi> That he does not mean by the Scriptures <hi>relating ſuch things as Miracles,</hi> onely that it relates the production of them in ſuch Terms, as Idiots and Illiterate Perſons may from thence conceive that they are ſuper-natural Effects (for then all he ſays will be very true, but withal very impertinent) but that it ſets them down for Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects Miraculous and Supernatural as much as any in the whole Bible. And if he means thus, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted the ill Conſequences of his Doctrine,<note place="margin">It does not follow from Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> and how diſagreeable his Concluſion from Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett</hi>'s Principles is to that which Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi> himſelf draws from them, and ſhall proceed now to ſhew how unnaturally it is drawn from ſuch premiſes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtand to make any tedious Reflection upon each particular in the ſummary Account which I have given above of what he has out of Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi>;<note place="margin">How far each Particular, in what he has from Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett,</hi> is true.</note> but I ſhall apply my ſelf chiefly to the Conſideration of that whereupon he ſeems wholly to build his Concluſion. All that I ſhall ſay to the reſt is this, Touching <hi>the deſign of the Sacred Writers when they ſpeak of natural things,</hi> I grant it to be ſuch as is there ſuggeſted: And, That in ſubordination to that Deſign, they may be conceived to <hi>explain the viſible Works of God in a manner ſuitable to the received Opinions of the Vulgar</hi>; i. e. To ſpeak their Senſe and Dialect about Natural Things, when they do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally ſpeak of them, and to comply therein with their common prejudices; as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeem to do <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16. where he ranks the <hi>Moon</hi> with the <hi>Sun</hi> as the other <hi>great light,</hi> i. e. the next or only one beſides of conſiderable magnitude; ſpeaking there agreeably
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49094:8"/>
to the appearance of ſenſe, and the apprehenſion of the vulgar grounded thereupon. Yet not that they are obliged to comply with all their prejudices neither; For this is one, <hi>That every conſiderable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Nature is miraculous and ſupernatural:</hi> And the Deſign of the Sacred Writers does not oblige them to condeſcend ſo far to the apprehenſions of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as to relate every effect for Miraculous which they conceive to be ſo. Their Deſign is, <hi>Not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in the knowledge of Nature, but to excite Piety and Devotion in us.</hi> The utmoſt therefore that Deſign will oblige them to, in this regard, is to make no mention of the Train of ſecond Cauſes in the Productions of Nature (which effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the firſt part of their Deſign) and to aſcribe all Effects to God as their Author (which as fully anſwers the ſecond) and nothing of all this amounts to a <hi>Relation of the Effects of Nature for Miracles,</hi> as will appear immediately.</p>
            <p>To the next thing, <hi>That they wreſt the general cauſes and ends of the whole Creation in favour of the peoples prejudices, as if all things were ordained only for the good and benefit of Mankind</hi>: I deny that the Scripture wreſts the ends of the Creation; for this were to make the parts of the World be Created by God for other ends and purpoſes than he created them for. All the Scripture does is, that it mentions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe ends of Nature (out of many for which it is ordained in the Divine Wiſdome) that relate to the good and benefit of Mankind (as for inſtance thoſe ends only of the Heavenly Bodies,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>That they are for lights in the Firmament of Heaven, and for Signs, and for Seaſons, and for Days, and for Years</hi>) yet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49094:8"/>
it does not deny but that there may be many other which to conſider is not pertinent to its purpoſe.<note place="margin">The Principle from whence he draws his Concluſion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the Principle from whence he draws his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, is in the laſt words of what he has out of Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi>: viz. <hi>That the Authors of the Holy Scriptures make no mention of the ordinary Train of ſecond Cauſes in the productions of Nature, but recur immediately to God himſelf, the firſt Cauſe, Author, and Preſident of it, and compendiouſly refer all things to his immediate Power, and to his irreſiſtible Will and Command.</hi> Their recurring immediately to God himſelf, and referring all things to his immediate Power, is to be underſtood in this ſenſe, Not that the Scripture declares theſe Effects to proceed from nothing but the immediate hand of God (for this is to declare them to be ſpernatural, and ſuch then they are unqueſtionably.) But, That it aſcribes them only to God, and makes no mention of any Train of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes ſubſervient to him in their production. For Inſtance, the Scripture immediately refers the Effects of Nature to God himſelf, in thoſe places of the 147th <hi>Pſalm</hi> where it ſays,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſalme</hi> 47. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>He giveth ſnow like wooll; he ſcattereth the hoar-froſt like aſhes. He caſteth forth his ice like morſels. — He ſendeth out his word and melteth them, he bloweth with his wind and the waters flow.</hi> So when God ſays to <hi>Noah, I do ſet my bow in the cloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9.13 1 Sam. 9.16.</note> and to <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, To morrow about this time I will ſend thee a man out of the land of</hi> Benjamin. Theſe Inſtances are his and <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s, as appears p. 17th and 18th below in his Treatiſe. And the Scripture refers theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects immediately to God, as it mentions him only as the Author of them, and no other mediate cauſe;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49094:9"/>
not that it ſays that he alone Acts in the production of them, for this were to relate them for Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ground of the Connexion of his Concluſion, with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from whence he draws it.</note>This therefore being ſtated, his way of Arguing will appear to be this, <hi>The Authors of the Holy Scriptures make no mention of the ordinary Train of ſecond Cauſes in the Productions of Nature, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur immediately to God himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo, <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late many things as Miracles, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are the Effects of Nature.</hi> The Connexion of this antecedent and conſequent is by Vertue of this Propoſition, <hi>That the Authors of the Holy Scripture muſt be conceived to relate thoſe Effects as Miracles, which they immediately aſcribe to God, without mention of any ſecond Cauſes ſubſervient to him in their production.</hi> The falſhood whereof I ſhall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcover. 1. <hi>By Inſtance.</hi> 2. <hi>From the natural import of the words.</hi> 3. <hi>From the reaſon of the thing it ſelf.</hi> 4. <hi>By ſhewing in ſome Inſtances what it is for the Holy Scripture to relate any thing as a Miracle.</hi>

               </gap> whereby we are to know what Effects are related therein as ſuch. The Scripture teaches us (from the mouth of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi>) to pray to God immediately for our daily Bread, for our Food and Raiment, for the annual increaſe of our Corn, Wine, and Oyle, for the former and latter Rain in their Seaſon. It takes no notice of the ordinary way whereby Nature it ſelf ſupplies us with theſe Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, how our Corn grows in our Fields, how the Vine ſends forth her Grapes, how the <hi>Clouds drop Fatneſs</hi>:<note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 9, 11.</note> But in a word, refers all to God without any more ado. <hi>He,</hi> it ſays, <hi>Viſiteth the Earth and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49094:9"/>
bleſſeth it: He maketh it very plenteous: he crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the year with his goodneſs.</hi> In a word,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.16.</note> 
               <hi>He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hand and filleth all things living with plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Yet, I ſuppoſe, it were very hard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the Scripture ſets down all this as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and miraculous: That it obliges us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (not the Flood only, but even) the former and latter rain to come down by Miracle: That it prompts us to expect as ſupernatural a proviſion of our daily bread, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> in <hi>Horeb</hi> when the Ravens were his Purveyours, the Widow with whom he lodged, whoſe <hi>Barrel of Meal</hi> was preſerved from waſting; or laſtly, the <hi>four or five thouſand</hi> fed by our Saviour in the Goſpel, which I ſuppoſe was a work of Nature, but <hi>related</hi> in Scripture <hi>as a Miracle,</hi> becauſe it mentions not how the Corn grew in the hands and mouths of them that did eat it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Natural import of the Words diſproves this conceit.</hi> To be related as a Miracle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> From the Natural import of the words.</note> is to be recorded for an effect of God's own immediate Hand and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Power. To be immediately refer'd or aſcribed to God, without mention of a Train of mediate cauſes, is quite another thing. There it is expreſly or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence declared; that the Work is above Nature; here it is left in <hi>Medio,</hi> without any determination from the manner wherein it is related, whether it be a natural or ſupernatural effect of the Divine Power. For inſtance, the Scripture ſays in one place, <hi>Thou makeſt Darkneſs, and it is Night.</hi> in another,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104. v. 20, 105. v. 28.</note> 
               <hi>He ſent Darkneſs, and made it Dark.</hi> In the former it ſpeaks of the ordinary, in the latter of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs; and both it immediately refers to God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49094:10"/>
mentioning no natural cauſes of the one or the other. Both of them it may thus aſcribe to God, though the one be the Effect of Nature, and the other a Miracle; and therefore to aſcribe any Effect immediately to God, is not to relate it as a Miracle.</p>

From the reaſon of the thing.</note>3. <hi>This will farther appear from the very reaſon of the thing it ſelf.</hi> The Scripture may juſtly aſcribe to God all the Effects of Nature without mentioning any train of ſuborbordinate cauſes, and yet cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be juſtly concluded to relate theſe things as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. And this becauſe firſt God is the Author of Nature, by his Power, and the Governour and Preſident of it by his ſuperintending Providence: therefore every Effect in Nature may be juſtly aſcribed to him as it's Author. 2dly, The Scriptures deſigns to ſpeak of the Effects of Nature only with regard to the Power and Providence of Almighty God; therefore it may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribe them to him without mention of the train of natural Cauſes whereby he mediately produces them. If then any Effect may be in this manner aſcribed to God, and yet he be no farther the Cauſe of it, than as he is the Author and Governour of Nature by his Power and Providence: if ſo, then it is no juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>That the ſacred Writers relate any thing as a Miracle, becauſe they immediately refer it to God without meniion of the train of natural Cauſes ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to him in the Production of it.</hi>

               <note place="margin">What it is for the Scripture to relate any thing as a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note>4. But to give as full ſatisfaction as may be in this Point, (and withal to ſhew that, all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there are ſome Effects ſo related in the Holy Scripture, as that it may be juſtly conceived to have recorded them for Miracles) I ſhall ſtate, <hi>What it is for the Scripture to relate any thing as a Miracle.</hi> It
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49094:10"/>
is not enough (as we have ſeen already) that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Effect to God as its Author: nor that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſcribes it to him, without mention that it is produced by the mediation of ſecond Cauſes. For every thing proceeds from him, whether it be by the courſe of Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a Work of his ſupernatural Power, and therefore is to be aſcribed to him: and the Scriptures aſcribing of it to God without mention any other Cauſe, does not neceſſarily imply, that no other Cauſe had any hand in the Production of it. But to relate a thing as a Miracle, is to relate it for an Effect of Gods own immediate Hand, or, an Effect above, beſide, or contrary to Nature. And this may be done two wayes: 1. <hi>By expreſs Declaration:</hi> 2. <hi>By rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in ſuch a manner and with ſuch circumſtances as from thence we may rationally conclude the Effect to be miraculous.</hi> For the firſt, there may ſeem to be very few inſtances if any, wherein we can certainly aſſure our ſelves, that the Holy Scripture <hi>declares</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Effect to be a Work above Nature. For though it may and often does uſe the Word <hi>Miracle,</hi> yet, that being Ambiguous, it may ſtill be uncertain whether it be to be taken for any thing more than an Effect Wonderful and Surprizing indeed, yet purely Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. All which notwithſtanding, in ſome places we may truly vouch the <hi>expreſs declaration</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, that ſuch and ſuch Effects are miraculous. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11. After the relation of our bleſſed Saviour's <hi>Turning</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine,</hi> the Text ſays, <hi>This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Miracles did Jeſus.</hi> So alſo <hi>John</hi> 4.54. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Nobleman's Son, This is again the ſecond Miracle that Jeſus did.</hi> In theſe two places the Scripture does in a manner reflect upon the Works
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49094:11"/>
it had related, and declares them to be ſupernatural. But by the Word <hi>Miracle</hi> may poſſibly be meant no more than an Effect Strange and Wonderful, not a Work above Nature: unleſs we can give ſome certain proof of the contrary. And I think this one Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be ſufficient to evince it. The Deſign of the Scripture in relating theſe Works of our bleſſed Saviour, is to propound them to us as undoubted Evidences of his Divine Miſſion. Now Evidences of that they could not be unleſs they were Works above Nature, becauſe an Effect of Nature cannot prove Gods immediate power and preſence, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently confirm the truth of any Prophets Commiſſion from Heaven to reveal his Doctrine. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therefore to relate theſe Works of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as undoubted Evidences of his Divine Miſſion, will argue that the Scripture where it ſtiles theſe Works Miracles, Signs, and Wonders, muſt mean ſtrictly ſuch as exceed the power of Nature: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would impoſe upon our belief, and oblige us under pain of Damnation to embrace a Doctrine as Divine, upon ſuch Evidences, as are in no wiſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to confirm the Authority of the Perſon that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals it. And upon this Ground we might diſcover many more inſtances of Effects, <hi>expreſly declared</hi> in Scripture to proceed from God's immediate extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power. For it holds as well in the Miracles of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour's,</hi> and in <hi>Moſes's</hi> too, the Scripture relating them as wrought to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his Commiſſion from Heaven to inſtitute the Law, as well as thoſe of our Saviour and his Apoſtles to evidence their Authority to Preach and Plant the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49094:11"/>
Goſpel. But if there were no ſuch expreſs Declaration in the Holy Scripture, there are yet, 2. <hi>Many rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Matters of Fact couched in ſuch Terms, as that we may juſtly conclude from thence that the Effects there ſpoken of are related as Miraculous and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</hi> As, 1. Where the Effect is related as done without the uſe of Means. So in our Saviours curing Diſeaſes (and indeed Working moſt of his Miracles) by the Word of his Mouth, turning the Water into Wine by the internal tacit Act of his Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Where Mention is made of Means uſed, but thoſe ſuch as cannot be conceived to be in their own Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or ſufficient to produce the Effect. As the Clay wherewith our Saviour cured the Eyes of the Perſon born Blind, the Spittle wherewith he looſed the tongue of the other that was Dumb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe effects may be juſtly affirmed to be related in Scripture as Miracles: not upon this account, that the Scripture <hi>refers them immediately to God without mention of any train of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes ſubſervient to him in their Production:</hi> it appears we have ſome ſurer Grounds whereupon to proceed in examining what Effects in Scripture are <hi>related as Miracles,</hi> though that which he would poſſeſs his Readers with the Opinion that it is the only <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">Corollary 1.</note> is not for it <hi>to relate the Effect as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous:</hi> and therefore from its referring the Effects of Nature immediately to God, we cannot infer (as he does) <hi>that the Scripture relates many memorable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49094:12"/>
things as Miracles, which yet notwithſtanding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the fixt and immutable Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

                  </gap>.</note>2. That there are yet many Effects plainly related in Scripture for Miracles; by it's expreſs Declaration, and it's relating of them in ſuch Terms, from whence we may by undeniable Conſequence gather as much. And ſo (ſuppoſing that the Scripture is a true Hiſtory, for which we have infinitely more evidence than for any other Hiſtory in the World) it follows evidently (againſt his main Aſſertion) from the relations of theſe miraculous Effects in Scripture, that <hi>there really have been Miracles</hi> in the ſenſe wherein he denies them, <hi>i. e. Works beſide, above, and contrary to Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Corollary (though very pertinent to our purpoſe) is <hi>ex abundanti</hi>: All that we were obliged to, was to ſhew, that the Concluſion which he draws from the Principles he takes out of Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi> is falſe and illogical. Since therefore Mr. <hi>Burnett</hi> aſſerts po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively that there are Miracles, as is ſhewed above, and nothing here produced out of him can infer or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate the contrary: we may juſtly demand both <hi>in his Name,</hi> and <hi>in behalf both of Religion, Reaſon, and good Logique,</hi> that this part of the <hi>Premonition</hi> be returned into the Place from whence it came, where it may ſtand with more Truth and Coherence; and the Concluſion of the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> left to ſtand apart by it ſelf, as a bold and (I may ſay) Impious Aſſertion without any Proof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The reſt of the <hi>Premonition</hi> conſidered.</note>But, not to wrong him, he has ſome <hi>Succedaneous</hi> Arguments in the cloſe of the <hi>Premonition</hi>: but theſe' as I before hinted, are only ſome brief Touches of what we have after more at large out of <hi>Spinoza.</hi> viz.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49094:12"/>
               <hi>That for God to work by a power immediate</hi> (or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural) <hi>is inconſiſtent with and Point-blank repugnant the Fundamental Laws and Conſtiſtutions of Nature.</hi> (It ſounds ſomewhat like to the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> being inconſiſtent with the <hi>Fundamental Laws of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Priviledge.</hi>) <hi>That theſe Laws are the Acts of the Divine Wiſdom, &amp; extend themſelves to whatever events he hath Willed and Decreed: that the power of Nature is infinite, as being one and the ſame with the Power of God.</hi> He has one thing which he aſſerts beſides, <hi>that among all the Miracles related to be done in favour of the Iſraelites, there is not one that can be apodictically Demonſtrated to be repugnant to the eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abliſhed Order of Nature.</hi> Now here I am not bound to Demonſtrate it for his ſake, for two Reaſons. 1. Becauſe it were to prove a Negative, 2. Becauſe his <hi>main Ground</hi> (or <hi>Spinoza's</hi> rather) why he denies all ſupernatural Effects, is not upon account of his own great reach in Natural Philoſophy, whereby he could undertake to ſolve Mechanically all the effects related in Scripture for Miraculous; but from Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purely <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> proving in his Opinion, the impoſſibility of any ſuch thing as a Work above Nature. For to this he holds and not the other, as appears from p. 21. of the Treatiſe where he <hi>concludes abſolutely</hi> (from his Arguments againſt the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Miracles.) <hi>That all the Events that are truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Scripture to have come to paſs, proceeded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily according to the immutable Laws of Nature: And that if any thing be found which can be apodicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Demonſtrated to be repugnant to thoſe Laws, or not to have followed from them, we may ſafely and piouſly believe the ſame not to have been dictated by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49094:13"/>
Divine inſpiration, but impiouſly added to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Volumes by ſacrilegious Men.</hi> So that unleſs the Scripture Miracles will ſubmit to his Touch-ſtone, unleſs they will come and lay open their Occult Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and the whole plot and confederacy of thoſe natural Cauſes that combined to Effect them, he has an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> to blot their Names out of the holy Scripture, and a <hi>Court of Inquiſition</hi> for thoſe that relate them, to arraign them for <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Impiety</hi>: But I paſs on to conſider each part of the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> in order.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Sum of what he has from Mr. <hi>Hobb's</hi> in the beginning of the Treatiſe.</note>The Treatiſe is divided between Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Spinoza.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſpeaks as far as to the middle of the third page, out of the Chapter about Miracles, in the third Part of his <hi>Leviathan.</hi> He firſt explains the ſignification of the Word, from its Etymology, and other words in ſacred and profane Writers of like import with it. From its Etymology he deduces that it ſignifies, <hi>A Work of God which men admire or wonder at.</hi> Then propoſes to enquire what works are ſuch, and reduces them to two kinds. 1. <hi>Such as are rare, and the like thereof ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never ſeen.</hi> 2. <hi>Such as we cannot conceive to be produced by natural Cauſes, but only by Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand.</hi> He gives ſome Inſtances of both: An Oxe or an Horſe ſpeaking,<note place="margin">Treat. p. 2.</note> preter-natural Births, the Converſion of a man into Stone, and the firſt Rainbow that appeared. That ſuch Effects as theſe ſeem Miraculous, becauſe rare, or no natural cauſe of them conceivable. On the contrary, the Works of Art, however wonderful, not reputed to be Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, becauſe their Cauſes known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49094:13"/>Upon the ſame ground he obſerves, That the ſame thing may ſeem to be a Miracle to one Man, and not to another, in proportion to their different degrees of Knowledge and Experience. So, <hi>Eclipſes</hi> Miracles to the vulgar, not to Philoſophers: Simple Men made to believe that others can know their moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Actions by Inſpiration, when the more wary and prudent perceive the juggle. So far Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> here, in his <hi>Leviathan</hi> he proceeds to aſſign another property of a Miracle, viz. <hi>That it be wrought to confirm the Divine Miſſion of ſome Prophet or other,</hi> and then to give a definition of it: but there his <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator</hi> leaves him, and paſſes on to <hi>Spinoza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we follow him thither,<note place="margin">Reflection upon what Mr <hi>Hobb's</hi> ſays.</note> we may reflect a little. 1. Upon Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Doctrine. 2. Upon the uſe whereto he applies it. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> informs us, What Works are by Men wondered at and reputed miraculous: He ſhews by Inſtance, That they are ſuch as are rare and unuſual, or ſuch as we cannot conceive to proceed from Natural Cauſes.</p>
            <p>He does not ſay, That this is all that goes to the making of a Miracle, nor that this is the only Rule we have whereby to diſcern what Effects are ſuch: but that this is enough to make things ſeem to men to be miraculous, and that a true Miracle is indeed an Effect rare and inexplicable, and ſomewhat more. If he mean otherwiſe, he contradicts himſelf ſoon after, when he defines a Miracle to be a <hi>Work of God</hi> (not conceived only, but really) <hi>beſide his Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the way of Nature ordained in the Creation:</hi> and infers from thence, <hi>That it cannot be the Effect of any thing but the immediate hand of God.</hi> Yet, to clear all; That a man cannot conceive ſuch an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49094:14"/>
to proceed from Natural Cauſes, may bear a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe. 1. That he is not capable of aſſigning the Natural Cauſe of it, or farther, of apprehending how it can be effected by any. 2. That he <hi>clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly perceives</hi> that it is impoſſible to be produced by the Courſe of Nature. I grant that this is enough to aſſure a man that it is a Miracle; but if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it to be ſo in the other caſe, he is guilty of preſumption in meaſuring the extent of the force of Nature by the narrow reach of his own knowledge or capacity.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The uſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Traſlator</hi> applies what he takes from Mr. <hi>Hobb's.</hi>
               </note>This may prepare us to conſider the uſe whereto Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Doctrine is applied by his <hi>Tranſlator.</hi> His Deſign is, before he come to <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s Arguments againſt the belief of Miracles, to make a diſcovery of the Cauſes that introduced this grand Miſtake into the World.<note place="margin">Tr. p. 3.</note> And the firſt, as a <hi>Corollary</hi> from Mr. <hi>Hobb's</hi> Doctrine, he makes to be, <hi>Admiration,</hi> and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from theſe two Cauſes, <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> That is, all the effects which the deluded World has miſtaken for Miracles, are ſuch as are only rare and unuſual, and inexplicrable: and the Cauſes which make mankind ſo prone to admit them for Miraculous, are our ignorance of the Cauſes, and want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and obſervation of the Effects of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Where he takes <hi>Spinoza</hi> in hand.</note>The ſecond cauſe which he Aſſigns of the belief of Miracles, is <hi>Superſtition,</hi> viz. That it is our hopes and fears which make us conceive every unuſual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Nature to be the effect of an extraordinary Divine Power, fore-bodding to us ſome good or evil. And here he takes <hi>Spinoza</hi> in hand, and we come at length to the main part of his Work, to which the reſt is only Preliminary, and with what Coherence and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49094:14"/>
how much to his purpoſe, hath already been ſhewed. Before I joyn Iſſue with him about the main Point in Controverſy, I ſhall premiſe only this ſhort obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in regard to what he ſays of the Cauſes of the belief of Miracles. It may very well be granted him, that the generality of Mankind, who are the Ignorant and unthinking Sort, are very prone to admire and wonder at every conſiderable Effect of Nature, and to look upon it as proceeding from an extraordinary Power, and the immediate hand of God: And that the Cauſes of this may be their want of knowledg and experience, and their ſuperſtitious Hopes and Fears. But to inſinuate thereupon the ſame to be the only ground of the belief of any Miracles, is very Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as well as Irrational: unleſs it could be evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out that all Miracles are impoſſible; and to ſee how effectually that may be done is our next Work, <hi>viz.</hi> to examine the Method wherein <hi>Spinoza,</hi> and from him the <hi>Author of this Collection,</hi> attempts to demonſtrate it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spinoza</hi> begins with a brief Account of the chief <hi>Heads</hi> of this (as he calls it) popular miſtake,<note place="margin">Tr. p. 3.4, 5.</note> and the firſt <hi>Authors</hi> of it. Theſe he makes to be the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who to magnify their own Nation, as under a more peculiar care of the Divine Providence than any other, and to ſet forth the greatneſs of the God they adored above the Gods of the Heathen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to them what <hi>mighty Works</hi> he had <hi>done for them,</hi> and how all the parts of Nature, which the Heathens Worſhipped, were under his Command and Controul. The particulars of this Error which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are theſe, <hi>That the ordinary ſort of Men think that God's Power and Providence does then moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49094:15"/>
appear, when any thing happens contrary to what they conceive to be the Courſe of Nature. That they think Nature's ſwerving from her own Laws, to be the beſt Argument for the exiſtence of a Deity. That they take thoſe perſons for Atheiſts, who attempt to deduce a Miracle from Natural Cauſes. That they think God ſits idle when nature acts in her uſual way, and Nature is ſuſpended, whenever God pleaſes to interpoſe. That they form in their brain a Notion of two Powers numerically diſtinct, the one of God, the other of Nature, underſtanding not what they mean by either.</hi> And <hi>that all this they do partly out of ſuperſtition, partly out of a deſire to oppoſe themſelves to Men of more Wiſe and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not ſtand to examine the Truth of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: it appears to be purely <hi>Declamatory,</hi> and not (which might have been more juſtly expected) a fair opening of the ſtate of the Queſtion, and a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration what <hi>thoſe</hi> of his Adverſaries hold concerning it, who take up the belief of Miracles upon better grounds than vulgar Prejudice and Superſtition. I ſhall have Occaſion to do that for him in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Tr. p. 6.</note>He proceeds therefore, and propoſes to do four things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Four Propoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid down by <hi>Spinoza.</hi>
               </note>1. <hi>To prove, that nothing in the World happens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature, but that Nature keeps an eternal, fixt, and immutable Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To prove, that by Miracles we cannot know the Eſſence nor the Exiſtence, nor conſequently the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God: but that all theſe may be better known by the fixt and immutable Order of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49094:15"/>3. <hi>To ſhew by inſtances out of the Scripture, that by the Decrees and Volitions, and conſequently the Providence of God, it underſtands nothing elſe but the very Order of Nature, which neceſſarily follows from his eternal Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>To treat of the manner of interpreting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Miracles, and what is chiefly to be obſerved in the Relations about them</hi>; or (as the Traſlator) <hi>to ſhew that moſt Men have erred in the manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Miracles recorded in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe Four, the firſt onely tends directly to prove his Aſſertion: the ſecond Obliquely ſtrikes at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles, as it makes them no Evidences of the immediate Power and Preſence of God, and ſo wholely uſeleſs and inſignificant, as no Proofs of what they are deſigned for. The other two tend only ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to draw the Scripture to his ſide, or to elude the force of the Arguments brought from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is to prove,<note place="margin">1. Propoſition.</note> 
               <hi>That nothing in the World hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens contrary to Nature, but that Nature keeps an eternal, fixt, and immutable Order.</hi> Before I come to examine his Arguments, I ſhall 1. State what is meant by <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of it, in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. 2. Lay down the main Grounds whereupon the poſſibility of Miracles depends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is the meaning of the Word Nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is here meant by Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture and the Laws of it.</note> 
               <hi>and the Laws of it in this Controverſy.</hi> A Miracle in the common acceptation of the Word, which <hi>Spinoza</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, is taken for a Work beſide, above, or contrary to Nature, beſide the order, above the force, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of it. Now the Word Nature may be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49094:16"/>
taken in many Significations. Eeither 1. For the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any, but properly of Material and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beings. Or 2. For the Aggregate of them, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial World. Or 3. For the Author of Nature, God himſelf, called thence <hi>Natura Naturans.</hi> Or Laſtly, For the Order of the ſeveral Bodies, as they act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt one another, according to their innate Powers and Diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>Now the acception of the Word here, is for the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of Bodies in the World, and the Order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they act amongſt one another: And ſo the Laws of Nature muſt be, ſuch as determine the Manner wherein Natural bodies act among themſelves; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be the <hi>general</hi> Laws of Motion, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how each part of Matter muſt be moved upon the occurrence of other Bodies, or <hi>particular</hi> Laws impreſſed upon their ſeveral Natures, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning each to act in ſuch or ſuch a particular manner. The queſtion therefore about the poſſibility of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, muſt be this, <hi>Whether there can be any ſuch Effects in the Material World, as are beſide, above, or contrary to the Order wherein Natural Bodies are determined to act among themſelves:</hi> i. e. ſuch Effects as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend their Power and Efficacy, and deviate from or are repugnant to the general or particular Laws of motion determining them to act.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">The Ground of the Poſſibility of Miracles.</note>2. The Queſtion therefore thus ſtated, I am to ſhew, <hi>what are the main Grounds whereupon the Poſſibility of Miracles depends.</hi> And I think it may be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deduced from theſe Principles. God is able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any thing which neither does, 1. Imply a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the Nature of the thing it ſelf; nor 2. Is repugnant to the Nature of God and his infinite
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49094:16"/>
Perfection. Omnipotence is properly a Power to bring any thing to Effect which does not imply a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: and the Contradiction muſt lie in one or the other of theſe two. I am to ſhew therefore that a Miracle, or a Work above Nature is, not impoſſible upon either Account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Miracle does not imply a Contradiction in the Nature of the Thing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Miracles implyes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the Nature of the thing.</note> Every Miraculous effect is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Production of ſomething by a Supernatural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or a Suſpenſion or utter Abolition of its Being. The thing produced or deſtroyed by Miracle, is either Matter it ſelf, or a Form, Quality, Motion, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accident of it. 1. Matter; as ſuppoſe a new Portion of it created, beyond the extent of this World; or the Matter of this World; or any determinate Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it reduced to nothing. 2. A Form, Quality, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or any other Accident of Matter; as ſuppoſe, 1. God ſhould endue any part of Matter with a Form, Quality, or any other Accident, above or contrary to what it other wiſe might or ſhould have, by the courſe of Nature. 2. God ſhould deveſt any part of Matter of any Form, Quality, Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it muſt have by the courſe of Nature. Two kinds of Miracles therefore we have here: 1. When a portion of Matter is created a-new, or reduced to nothing. 2. When a Form, Quality, or Motion, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any other Accident of Matter, is produced, ſuſpended, or deſtoyed in a Supernatural Manner. And to theſe two are reducible all Effects above or contrary to the Order of Nature; as the whole Frame and Order of Nature, is made up of Matter, and the Forms, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Motions, and other Accidents thereof.</p>
            <p>Now neither of theſe implyes a Contradiction in

            <p>In all theſe Inſtances there is nothing done, but only a Form, Quality, Motion, or the like, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſuſpended, or deſtroyed in the parts of Matter, by a Power above Nature. And that nothing of all this implies any Contradiction in the Nature of the thing, may be thus made to appear. Matter in its own Nature is indifferently ſuſceptible of any Form or Qualities imaginable, and therefore is in it ſelf capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at any time of being without thoſe Forms and Qualities which it has, or of having any others inſtead thereof. Capable it is of being without any particular Forms &amp; Qualities which it has, becauſe they are each of them contingent &amp; accidental to Matter conſidered in its own Nature: For inſtance, that it ſhould have ſuch Magnitude, Figure, Texture, Order and Scituation, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Reſt of its ſenſible or inſenſible parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Body of ſuch a particular Nature, endowed with ſuch and ſuch Qualities peculiar to it. Capable likewiſe it is at any time of having any Forms or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities indifferently, becauſe in its own Nature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it is ſuſceptible of any, and in it's own Nature conſidered, not determined to receive any one more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49094:18"/>
than another. Now if this be ſo, it is then poſſible for any Form or Quality to be produced, in any part of Matter, at any time; or to be ſuſpended, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed utterly, in that Body which is endued with it: and conſequently for any part of Matter to be endued with ſuch a Form or Quality, which otherwiſe it could or ought not to have by the Courſe of Nature; or, on the other hand to be deveſted of that Form or Quality, which otherwiſe by the Courſe of Nature it muſt have had and kept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For inſtance, the <hi>water</hi> at the <hi>Marriage Feaſt in</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galilee, could not at the bare Word or Will of Chriſt by the Courſe of Nature have its Form changed into the Form of <hi>Wine,</hi> and yet the Matter in it's own Nature was capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Form of Wine, and capable too of being without the Form of Water, though left to it ſelf and the Order of Nature it muſt have kept it.

            <p>The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> where they treat of Laws, make the firſt diviſion of them into the Eternal Law, and thoſe that are derived from it. The Eternal two-fold. 1. The Order whereby God eternally decreed to do all things. 2. The Order which he decreed to preſcribe to his Creatures, to be obſerved by them according to their ſeveral Natures and Conditions. The latter is branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in theſe particulars, the Law of Natural Agents,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49094:21"/>
of Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Men; and this, either the Law of Natural Reaſon, Divine Revelation, or Humane Inſtitution. This ſecond Eternal Law, and the branches of it, are ſuch as that the ſeveral Agents to whom they were given, may ſwerve from and not Act in a conſtant and uniform obedience to them. So the Angels firſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their Law; then Mankind theirs, as they daily do all Laws Natural and Poſitive, Divine and Humane. The natural Agents indeed, as not endued with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Will, obſerve one conſtant Order and Tenor if left to themſelves: yet may either ceaſe to Act, or Act otherwiſe, if God in his eternal purpoſe think fit to interpoſe, who can then either ſuſpend their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, or determine them to act beyond their Sphere, beſide their uſual courſe, and contrary to their natural tendencies and the Laws of their Motion. But the firſt Eternal Laws is of univerſal extent, and holds inviolably. Nothing can fall out beſide, above, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. It directs to its own grand purpoſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrayes from the particular Laws of its Creation, draws good out of evil, and makes all Events conſpire to the ſetting forth of the Glory of God. It ordains the ſins of lapſed Angels and Men, to the irrevoka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Damnation of the firſt, and the Redemption of the latter, by the moſt ſurprizing and myſterious Methods of love and mercy. It provides for a ſuppliment to the loſt or decayed light of Nature, the Revelations of Law and Goſpel by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; and to atteſt their Divine Authority and Miſſion, ordains Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to act above or contrary to her ſelf by an <hi>obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Power.

We conceive God to will the ſame thing, when we regard this farther, That the Nature</hi> (v. c.) <hi>of a Triangle is ſo contained in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, not upon account of the neceſſity of the nature of a Triangle it ſelf, but upon account of the neceſſity of the Divine Nature: and that all the neceſſity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Triangle and its properties, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as eternal Truths, depends not upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of its own Nature, but the Divine.</hi> So that for God to Will or Decree any thing, is for the ſame <hi>to be contained neceſſarily in the Divine Nature, by reaſon of the neceſſity of it, as an eternal truth:</hi> And therefore, <hi>Whatever God wills or decrees involves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal truth and neceſſity.</hi>

            <p>This is his <hi>Principle,</hi> which he borrows from his <hi>Fourth Chapter,</hi> and we ſee it is grounded upon a particular Notion which he had formed in his Brain of the Divine Will and Underſtanding.

That God is a Subſtance abſolutely infinite,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Subſtance endued with an infinite number of Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, each infinite, each diſplaying his infinite Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: two whereof are known to us, Cogitation and Extenſion. That from the neceſſity of the infinite Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Attributes of God do proceed (as properties from an emanative cauſe) infinite Modes wherein the Divine Nature and Attributes do ſubſiſt and act. That Nature and all created Beings are only theſe various Modes wherein the Divine Eſſence and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes do neceſſarily diſplay themſelves: In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that all Bodies and finite Spirits are only vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Modes of thoſe two infinite Attributes in God, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion and Cogitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from theſe Principles we may indeed deduce not only his conception of what it is in God to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and to will: but many other Conſequences admirably agreeable to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Right Reaſon.</hi> As, 1. That God is an extended Subſtance, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion infinite. 2. That God is the emanative cauſe of all finite Beings, and they therefore really and identically contained in the Divine Nature, and the ſame with him. 3. That God ſubſiſts in all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and finite Spirits, as a Subſtance under its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Modes flowing from its Eſſence: and therefore both he himſelf material and bodily, as being extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every body in Nature a part of him. So that now we clearly ſee the ground whereupon <hi>Spinoza</hi> aſſerts, <hi>That nothing can happen contrary to Nature</hi>: viz. becauſe God and Nature are one and the ſame, <hi>God Nature subſiſtent,</hi> and <hi>Nature God modified.</hi>

And why he ſays, That for <hi>God to will or decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, is for the thing to be contained in his Nature as an eternal truth flowing from the neceſſity of it,</hi> viz. becauſe his Will is only that of an emanative cauſe, and every thing which we conceive produced by the Divine Will, is ſo only in regard that it flows neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily from his Eſſence, as light in the Sun, and heat in the Fire from their very nature. And ſo likewiſe his underſtanding of the ſame thing, is only that he ſees its neceſſary Exiſtence proceeding from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his own Nature.</p>
            <p>Here we have a full diſcovery of his Senſe and Scope in this Argument; and it plainly terminates in one of theſe two, <hi>Atheiſm</hi> or <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For to make God and Nature the ſame thing, is either to advance a Creature into the place of God, or (what <hi>Tully</hi> ſays of <hi>Epicurus</hi>) <hi>Oratione relinquere Deum, re tollere.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Naturâ Deorum <hi>l.</hi> 1.</note> I ſhall not therefore proſecute his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo far, as to confute him through the whole Set of his Principles: nor take my ſelf to be obliged, in order to prove the poſſibility of a <hi>Work above Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to go ſo far about as to prove firſt the Being of a God above it.<note place="margin">His Argument, ſetting aſide his Principles, may be true, and yet not infer the truth of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> But his Argument may deſerve a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Conſideration, ſetting aſide his Principles, and that only in order to ſtate how far the Laws of Nature may be granted to be the <hi>Decrees and Voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God,</hi> and whether and how far thereupon they <hi>involve eternal neceſſity and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Argument therefore is in form this, <hi>Whatever God Wills or Decrees, involves eternal neceſſity and truth.

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49094:24"/>The Laws of Nature may be conſidered as in Nature it ſelf, or as in the Author of it. In Nature it ſelf they ſignifie the determinations of Bodies to act in ſuch or ſuch a manner. In the Author of it they ſignifie thoſe Decrees whereby the Order of Nature is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and particular Bodies determined to act in ſuch a particular manner. In this Senſe, I grant that the Laws of Nature are the <hi>Decrees and Volitions of God.</hi> And how they are ſo, and how far thereupon they may be conceived to <hi>involve eternal neceſſity and truth,</hi> may appear from theſe Conſiderations:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">How the Laws of Nature are the Decrees of God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Truth.</note>1. That there is one grand Univerſal Law, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and Purpoſe of the Divine Will, whereby he eternally ſet down with himſelf the Order wherein to work all things. This Conception is moſt agreeable to the ſimplicity and immutability of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To his ſimplicity, that as his Nature, ſo the Act of his Will, ſhould be perfectly one, and not multiplied <hi>in infinitum</hi> in proportion to the variety of Effects ordained and regulated by it. To his immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that we ſhould not ſuppoſe him to be daily enacting new Laws and Decrees, but that he works all things by a Decree co-eternal to himſelf. And this Conception is cleared by our parallel apprehenſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Divine Underſtanding. The Objects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are temporary, yet the Act of his Knowledg where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſees them eternal: they are manifold and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet that ſimple and uniform. Therefore as by one Act of his Underſtanding he ſees <hi>ab aeterno</hi> all things future in their ſeveral times, ſo by one Act of his Will he ordains them all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in this univerſal Law are included, <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum noſtrum concipiendi modum,</hi> many particular
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49094:24"/>
Laws and Decrees eſtabliſhing the Order of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Events, neceſſary and contingent, natural and above Nature, in their particular times and places.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That theſe particular Laws and Decrees have each (in ſubordination to the univerſal) a limited and determinate compaſs of times, places, and events, wherein they take effect.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That yet each of them does certainly take effect within that determinate compaſs to which it is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore</p>
            <p n="5">5. That a Propoſition declaring that ſuch a Law and Decree will certainly take effect, is true; and the truth of it neceſſary and <hi>ab aeterno</hi> by vertue of that Law and Decree.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That yet as the Law it ſelf and the Decree is, ſo is the neceſſary and eternal Truth of that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>viz.</hi> It is neceſſary and true <hi>ab aeterno</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this Law and Decree ſhall take effect within that determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate compaſs of times, places, and events, whereto it is limited, and no further.</p>
            <p>Now the Laws and Decrees by which the Order of Nature is eſtabliſhed, are ſuch particular Laws and Decrees; and ſuch is their eternal Truth and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For Inſtance, The motion of the Sun is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in Nature, proceeding from Gods Will and Decree: Yet ſo limited (in ſubordination to his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Law and Purpoſe) to a determinate compaſs, as not to take effect at ſome points of time within that period for which Nature is eſtabliſhed: I mean at that time, when the Sun ſtood ſtill at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s word, and when it went back ſo many degrees for a ſign to King <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> So that the ſame univerſal Purpoſe and Decrees of God might ſettle the order of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49094:25"/>
the Suns motion, and thereupon it be neceſſary and true <hi>ab aeterno</hi> that the Sun ſhall move in this Order; and yet withal ordain, that at ſuch times notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Sun ſhould ſtand ſtill or go back, and thereupon it be as neceſſary and true <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> that at thoſe points of time the Sun ſhould go back or ſtand ſtill. The Laws therefore of Natural Agents may in this ſenſe be the <hi>Decrees of God,</hi> and <hi>involve eternal neceſſity and truth</hi>; and yet it may be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſome certain effects to fall out contrary to them, <hi>viz.</hi> without that compaſs within which they are limited to take effect, and no farther. But if <hi>Spinoza</hi> will have it, That whatever God wills to come to paſs in ſuch a time, muſt therefore be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; or, that whatever Order God ſettles for ſuch a determinate compaſs, muſt, becauſe he wills and ſettles it, hold eternally: I deny that in this ſenſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Law and Decree of God involves eternal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eternally neceſſary and true, That whatever God Decrees to be, ſhall be: if he decree any thing to be and endure to perpetuity, it is eternally true and neceſſary that it ſhall be perpetually; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree it to ſuch a compaſs, it is <hi>ab aeterno</hi> neceſſary and true that it ſhall hold ſo long, and his Decree or the truth and neceſſity of the Effect, conſequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, is not violated if it hold no longer.</p>
            <p>So much therefore may be ſaid in Anſwer to his firſt Argument to prove that <hi>Nothing can happen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature,</hi> &amp;c. The Sum is, That he miſtakes the meaning of the Terms of the Queſtion. That he makes Nature the ſame with God, and ſo (beſides his taking the word in a ſenſe of his own) he in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49094:25"/>
rejects the Exiſtence of a Deity in Order to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the belief of Miracles. Laſtly, That in the ſenſe wherein I have conſidered his Argument, it may be true, and yet his Concluſion not follow from it.</p>
            <p>His Second Argument is,<note place="margin">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cond Argument for his firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>Becauſe the Power of Nature is the power of God, and therefore as infinite as himſelf.</hi> E. <hi>Nothing can fall out without its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, or contrary to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ground whereupon he proceeds in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be ſure the very ſame conception of the Divine Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That Nature is nothing but an infinite variety of Modifications of the Divine Eſſence, and the power of it conſequently nothing but the infinite fecundity of the Divine Eſſence determining it neceſſarily to exert it ſelf in all the infinite variety of the modes of its being. I ſhall therefore onely give this Argument ſo much conſideration as it may require, ſetting aſide his Principles. The power of Nature is the force that natural cauſes have to act each in their ſeveral manners, and the vertue and efficacy of the whole ariſing from the joynt concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſeveral parts in their diſtinct Operations: This, to ſpeak properly, is all reſolved into a <hi>Viſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> impreſſed upon matter, enabled to act by Gods Power, and determined to do it by his Will. This therefore certainly muſt be different from the power of its Author, in as much as the powers muſt be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent if the Subjects differ to which they belong. But granting that the power of Nature is <hi>virtually and origionally</hi> (though not <hi>formally</hi>) the Divine Power exerting it ſelf in Nature as its Inſtrument: Yet it no more follows thereupon, that the power
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49094:26"/>
of Nature muſt be infinite, then it follows that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the motion of the Sun is the motion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore it is of as great extent as the motion of the whole frame of Nature beſides. Or becauſe the Power that moves the hand is the power of the Soul, that therefore the whole Sphere of the Souls Power in the Body is no larger than the hand. The Argument is from a <hi>particular</hi> to an <hi>univerſal.</hi> Gods power, though ſimple and indiviſible, is yet unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. It may act far beyond that compaſs wherein it does, and therefore infinitly beyond the limits of Nature. It exerts it ſelf both in a natural and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural way; and both kinds of effects proceed from one and the ſame indiviſible omnipotence: which is no more multiplied by the variety of effects that flow from it, than the power of the Soul as it moves the hands, and the feet, the eye, and the tongue.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the Arguments he brings for the proof of his firſt Propoſition.<note place="margin">Tr <hi>p.</hi> 8</note> The reſt is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he draws from the whole, <hi>viz. What a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is: That</hi> (it being proved that all Supernatural Effects are impoſſible) <hi>a Miracle can be only an effect inexplicable by our own obſervation, or the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Nature known to us.</hi> Having therefore proved that ſupernatural Effects are not impoſſible, and anſwered his Arguments for the contrary, I may take leave to draw a Concluſion contradictory to his, That a Miracle is not only what he ſays, but an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beſide, above, or contrary to the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Propoſition 2. Tr. P. 2.</note>The ſecond thing he undertakes is, <hi>To prove that by Miracles we cannot know the Eſſence, Exiſtence,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49094:26"/>
or Providence of God: but that all theſe may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known by the fixt and immutable Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this Propoſition he miſtakes the end for which Miracles are deſigned.</note> His Deſign in this ſeems to be to deſtroy the Authority and Credit of Miracles, by ſhewing that they are not proofs ſufficient of what they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for. But in the framing of this Propoſition, he miſtakes the end, for which they are deſign'd. For 1. The deſign of Miracles is not to make a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very (at leaſt immediately and by themſelves) of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God. They are proper and meet evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the truth of any Revelation, and if in that Revelation it pleaſe God to make any ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſplay of his own Nature, then Miracles may be ſaid mediately to diſcover to us the Eſſence of God; otherways they demonſtrate no other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God but his power, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend the Operations of Nature, or to act above it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither do they tend in any peculiar manner to prove the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of a Deity, but rather ſuppoſe it: <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a Supream Being who is the Author of Nature, who gave it ſuch a Power and ſet it ſuch Laws whereby to act; which Power and which Laws, a Miracle being either above or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to, proves thereupon (not that God is, but) that it is he who then acts by his own immediate hand, and not Nature. But, for any proof it gives us of the Being of a God, it is onely in the ſame way that every natural Effect demonſtrates it, by leading us to a firſt Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miracles are indeed ſufficient Evidences of the Divine <hi>Providence</hi>; that God does take upon him and actually exerciſe the Government of the World; that he does not leave Nature to her ſelf, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49094:27"/>
interpoſes and ſets her aſide: That he does not ſit an unconcerned Spectator of the Actions of Men, but ſometimes in a moſt ſignal manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or puniſhes them here in this life. Yet the demonſtration of Gods <hi>Providence</hi> is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and primary end of ſupernatural Effects, but</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Miracle is properly intended to prove, 1. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, the immediate power and preſence of God Acting himſelf in an extraordinary manner in the working of it. 2. (By Vertue of this evident Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Gods immediate extraordinary preſence) the Divine Authority and Miſſion of that perſon whom God has been pleaſed to make his Inſtrument in the effecting of it; at whoſe word or requeſt the Order of Nature is ſuſpended, which we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God would permit either for no end at all, or for one ſo repugnant to his Sanctity and Goodneſs, as to aſſiſt an Impoſture.</p>
            <p>Thus much therefore we may know by miracles, not what God is in his Nature, nor his Exiſtence any better than we may know it by any Effect of Nature: but his Providence, his extraordinary preſence and power, and the Authority of that perſon whoſe Divine Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it atteſts. We are next to enquire whether his Arguments are more ſufficient to diſprove the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Miracles in this regard.</p>

               <hi>and ſo takes away the certainty both of the being of God and every thing elſe.</hi> This Argument ſtrikes as much at the belief of Miracles themſelves as of any thing elſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Credit and Authority: for there can be no Reaſon to believe any thing, which to believe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me to doubt of every thing elſe as impoſſible to be certainly known. The ground whereupon he aſſerts that the belief of Miracles, <hi>leads us to Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme,</hi> is, <hi>becauſe it takes away the certain Truth of thoſe Notions from whence we conclude the being of a God or any thing elſe that we know</hi>; and <hi>that this it does in as much as it ſuppoſes a Power in God able to alter the Truth of theſe Notions, for this too he muſt be able to do, if able to change the courſe of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe Notions may be underſtood two things;<note place="margin">The belief of Miracles does not introduce Scepticiſme.</note> 1.

Or 2. the definitions of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49094:28"/>
things, and propoſitions aſcribing to them their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Properties: as <hi>

Now theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Truth are all neceſſary, and immutable, and the Truth of them does not depend upon the being or order of Nature: a poſſibility therefore of change in the order of Nature does not imply that by the ſame Power the truth of theſe Notions may be altered. They are, firſt, neceſſary and immutable, becauſe it implies a contradiction for them to be falſe, v. c. <hi>for the whole to be no greater than any part, Man not to be a rational creature, God to be cruel or unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c. 2. They are true independently upon the being or order of Nature. If God ſhould deſtroy the whole frame of Nature, yet it were true notwithſtanding, <hi>that the whole</hi> Body <hi>were bigger than any part.</hi> If he ſhould reduce Mankind into nothing, it were ſtill true notwithſtanding, <hi>That the nature of Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of a rational Soul, and a Body endued with life and ſenſe.</hi> God may turn one thing into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and make the ſame Matter appear under a Form above or contrary to what it ſhould have by the courſe of Nature, but he cannot <hi>make it be and not be, be of this Nature and of another, at the ſame time.</hi> He can ſuſpend the Actions of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but yet cannot make them <hi>Act and not Act both together.</hi> In ſhort, however God by his Power may alter or ſuſpend the Order of Generations in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet this Principle will hold true, that in an
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49094:28"/>
order of ſucceſſive generations of Men there muſt be ſome firſt Man, and this firſt Man muſt have a Cauſe that is not Man, and this Cauſe muſt either be it ſelf, or lead us at laſt to, an infinite Supream Being. So that the <hi>exiſtence of a God may be deduced from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and neceſſary Principles, though the Order of Nature be capable of being changed by his Almighty Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The altering therefore of the courſe of Nature, makes no alteration in the principles of Knowledg. But does it not infer a Power in God to change our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Apprehenſions of them and of every thing elſe? A Phyſical Power indeed it does, as it proves him <hi>Omnipotent:</hi> but this will not drive us to <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme,</hi> while we are certain that it is as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to his <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> as compatible to his <hi>Power</hi> barely conſidered. For it is impoſſible that a Being infinitely Good and Holy ſhould impoſe upon his Creatures, and implant ſuch Notions in their Minds as would neceſſarily induce them to believe a Lye, or ſo alter their apprehenſions of things, as to make it impoſſible for them to make a true Judgment by the uſe of their own reaſon.</p>
            <p>The belief of Miracles therefore does not <hi>lead us unto Scepticiſme,</hi> and ſo does not <hi>take away the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Being of a God,</hi> but yet perhaps <hi>it may not be a fit</hi> Medium <hi>to prove either his Exiſtence, or his Proovidence, or to declare bis Nature to us.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49094:29"/>
thing finite, and therefore cannot be a fit</hi> Medium <hi>to prove the being of an Agent of infinite Power.</hi> To the <hi>Firſt,</hi> a Miracle is a Work that tranſcends our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to underſtand it; i. e. it is beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our Knowledge to deduce it from natural Cauſes, and good reaſon, becauſe it is beyond their power and efficacy to Effect it. But yet ſo far it is within our Capacity, that it is poſſible for us to know whether it be an effect ſupernatural or not, and when it is known to be ſuch it is ſufficient to demonſtrate the immediate operation of God's Power and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Second,</hi> nothing is more falſe or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs than that Aſſertion. It is ſo far from being true, that a finite Effect cannot be a Proof of an infinite Cauſe, that every finite Effect is ſo; either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, as when the Effect though finite exceeds the force and efficacy of any finite being in the Order and Sphere wherein it acts, or mediately when the Effect is produced by a train of finite Cauſes, which yet muſt have had their own being and their firſt motion or power to act from an infinite Agent. The argument for an Infinite from the exiſtence of finite beings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus, every finite being is contingent, and ſo might not have been; therefore the reaſon of its being muſt not be in it ſelf, but in ſomething elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cauſe that produced it. Again, every finite being has limits of Perfection; theſe cannot be ſet by it ſelf, but by ſomething elſe which gave it ſuch a degree of Perfection and no greater; and this muſt be the cauſe that produced it. If this Cauſe be finite too, it muſt proceed from another, and the Queſtion will recur till we ſtop, at laſt in a Cauſe ſelf-exiſtent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>

His reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the Laws of Nature are infinite, eternal, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and therefore in ſome meaſure indicate to us the infinity, eternity, and immutability of God:</hi> or rather (to make him ſpeak more plainly out of his <hi>Opera Poſthuma</hi>) becauſe <hi>God and Nature are all one,</hi> and <hi>the more I know of Nature the more I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the modifications of the Divine Eſſence.</hi> But if he tells us that the belief of Miracles leads us to <hi>Scepticiſme,</hi> we may reply that this Diſcovery of the Divine Eſſence which he pretends to make from Nature, will rather carry us either to <hi>Atheiſme</hi> or <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to his Arguments from Scripture, which are two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He argues from <hi>Deut</hi> 13. v. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Becauſe a Miracle</hi> (as is plain from that place) <hi>may be wrought by a Perſon that deſigns to introduce the worſhip of a falſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He argues <hi>from the corrupt notions the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>had of God and his Providence, notwithſtanding ſo many Miracles wrought among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. v. 1, 2, 3. are theſe.<note place="margin">Arg. 1. <hi>from Scripture.</hi> Tr. p. 13.</note> 
               <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth thee a Sign or a Wonder, and the Sign or Wonder come to paſs, whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, let us go after other Gods (which thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49094:30"/>
haſt not known) and let us ſerve them; thou ſhalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet, or Dreamer of Dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your Heart and with all your Soul. And that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or that Dreamer of Dreams ſhall be put to death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From hence he argues, a Miracle may be wrought by one that deſigns to introduce the Worſhip of a falſe God.</hi> Ergo, <hi>by Miracles we may be as eaſily induced to embrace the Worſhip of a falſe God, as of the true.</hi> E. <hi>God cannot be made known to us by Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Though a falſe Prophet may work a Miracle, yet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſufficient evidences of a true Prophet.</note>This is a difficulty commonly propounded for theſe Words in <hi>Deut.</hi> viz. <hi>How Miracles can be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted evidence of the authority of a Prophet and the truth of his Doctrine, &amp; yet it be poſſible for a Miracle to be wrought by a falſe Prophet in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree:</hi> viz. <hi>a Preacher of Idolatry.</hi> And the beſt way to give a clear and ſatisfactory Anſwer to it, will be to conſider the utmoſt force of it as it is urged from this place. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to whom theſe Words were ſpoken, had already a Law given them, and the Authority of it atteſted by unqueſtionable Miracles; the ſame Law repeated again in this book of <hi>Deut.</hi> with a repetition likewiſe of the Hiſtory of thoſe mighty Works which had been wrought for it's confirmation. Their Religion therefore being thus ſettled, to fortifie them againſt all Temptations that might draw them to the Worſhip of the Gods of the Nations round about them, they are fore-warned in this place not to give ear to any Perſon that ſhould entice them to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though he ſhould work a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to confirm the Authority of his falſe Doctrine; for that God might poſſibly permit ſuch a Perſon to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49094:30"/>
work a Miracle meerly to try the ſtedfaſtneſs of their Faith and Adherence to his Worſhip. This is the Caſe wherein thoſe Words (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.) muſt be underſtood to be ſpoken; and this is all that can be rationally drawn from them, that God may permit a Miracle to be wrought by a falſe Prophet after he has eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the true Religion, and fore-warned his people not to believe a Miracle againſt it. We are to enquire therefore whether <hi>if this be poſſible, Miracles can be ſufficient evidences of a true Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument is in form this, <hi>If God after he has eſtabliſhed the true Religion, and fore-warned his people not to believe a Miracle againſt it, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a falſe Prophet to work a Miracle to try the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of their faith; then Miracles are not ſufficient Evidences of a true Prophet.</hi> But <hi>God may in this caſe permit a Miracle to be wrought by a falſe Prophet.</hi> Ergo. If the conſequence is, That Miracles are not <hi>always</hi> ſufficient Evidences, or not in this particular <hi>Caſe,</hi> I readily grant it: If, That they <hi>never</hi> are in any caſe (which muſt be the Concluſion if to the purpoſe.) I deny it: and the reaſon of my denial of it is this, becauſe notwithſtanding an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> may work a Miracle in this caſe, and ſo the Miracle he works be no evidence of a true Prophet: yet in any other caſe (notwithſtanding the force of theſe words) it may be (and I may poſitively ſay is) impoſſible for a true Miracle to be wrought by an <hi>Impoſtor</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Miracles which are not reducible to this Caſe may be certain and infallible Evidences of a true Prophet. For Inſtance, two ſorts of Miracles are excepted from this Caſe. 1. Thoſe Miracles (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that were wrought among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49094:31"/>
after this warning given them not to believe any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that would ſeduce them to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though he ſhould work a Miracle, by perſons that did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſeduce them from the Worſhip of the true God. 2. Thoſe Miracles which were wrought at any time by any perſons whoſe Doctrine the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom they were wrought had not been fore-warned by God not to believe. And that neither of theſe could be wrought by an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> but both were ſufficient Evidences of a true Prophet, I ſhall demonſtrate evidently from theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In every Miracle or ſupernatural Effect, God muſt be preſent (not conſenting and aſſiſting only, but) working it himſelf by his extraordinary Power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This God cannot do (<hi>viz.</hi> alter the courſe of Nature) for no end, or for any that is mean and trivial.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor can his end be to deceive or impoſe upon thoſe perſons before whom it is wrought.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If his end cannot be to deceive us, and yet he cannot Work a Miracle, but for ſome great end: it follows, That every Miracle wrought by any perſon pretending thereupon a Commiſſion to reveal any Doctrine, muſt either be ordained by God to ratifie and confirm his Commiſſion, and this Miracle cannot be wrought by a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: or if it be not ordained by God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Commiſſion, but may be done by him though he be a falſe Prophet, it muſt be onely in ſuch a caſe where ſufficient warning has been given to thoſe before whom the Miracle is wrought, that they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49094:31"/>
are not to believe the Authority or Doctrine of that Prophet though he work a Miracle.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Therefore in this one Caſe (where ſufficient warning is given us not to believe ſuch a perſon though he work a Miracle) God may work a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle by a falſe Prophet, and therefore it is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence of a true: In any other caſe it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he ſhould work it by a falſe Prophet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not ſufficient Evidence of a true.</p>
            <p>All this neceſſarily follows from the Wiſdome, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and Holineſs of God. His Wiſdome cannot permit him to work a Miracle by any man for nothing or upon any trivial account: and his <hi>Veraciy</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> cannot permit him to bear witneſs to a <hi>Liar</hi> and <hi>Seducer</hi> (working a Miracle and pretending thereupon to a Commiſſion from Heaven to Preach his Doctrine) which he does in working a Miracle by him, unleſs in ſuch a Caſe where he gives us warning not to believe him upon the Authority of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: And in that Caſe he does not bear Witneſs to a Liar, becauſe he fore-warns us that his Miracle is not done to atteſt the Authority of that Perſon by whom he does it: And ſo though it were the <hi>ſetting of his Seal</hi> to his Commiſſion (to uſe that expreſſion) yet we are ſufficiently ſecured from being impoſed upon thereby, becauſe fore-warned that in this caſe his Seal is to be no Evidence to us, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it be the cleereſt and moſt convincing Evidence imaginable. A Miracle therefore, where warning before-hand is given againſt it, may be wrought by a Seducer and Impoſtor, but where we are not fore-warned againſt it, it muſt be wrought by a true: <hi>Ergo, Though in that Caſe a Miracle is no Evidence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49094:32"/>
of a true Prophet, yet in every other Caſe it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, and</hi> conſequently, <hi>Though an Impoſtor may work a Miracle,</hi> yet <hi>a Miracle is in moſt caſes an undoubted Evidence of a true Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the warning or notice given us in this caſe, may be either expreſſed, or implied. <hi>Expreſſed</hi> as in the place fore-mentioned,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> under the Law; or where we are forbidden to hearken to <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt 24.24. Gal. 1.8.</note> 
               <hi>which ſhall do great Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; or to an Angel from Heaven that ſhould Preach another Doctrine, then that we have received</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Heb. 1, 2.7.16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Implied,</hi> as where the Doctrine and Inſtitution of the Goſpel is declared to be the laſt Will of Almighty God, and a Law to endure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration or repeal to the end of the World; for if God declare it to be ſuch, this implies that no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrary to it, no other Doctrine, is to be embraced, though the perſon preaching it ſhould work a Miracle to confirm his Authority.</p>
            <p>All other Miracles therefore are Evidences of a true Prophet, except where ſuch warning is given. And thoſe I reduced to two ſorts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that were wrought among the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> after the warning given them <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon that did not attempt to <hi>ſeduce them from the Worſhip of the true God</hi>; for againſt ſuch a perſon working a Miracle they had no warning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Miracle was enough to command their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe wrought at any time by any perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whoſe Doctrine there had been no warning eign to the perſons before whom the Miracles were wrought. And under theſe two kinds are placed all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49094:32"/>
the Miracles whoſe Authority <hi>Spinoza</hi> would deſtroy by this Argument. To begin with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, they were wrought before the <hi>Iſralites</hi> had any warning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Authority of any Miracles whatſoever: and if after, they were wrought not to ſedvce them to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> but with the contrary deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſettle the Worſhip of the true God among them. So alſo <hi>Elijah</hi>'s, to reclaim that people from Idolatry. And the Miracles of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> will not I ſuppoſe be ſaid by any one to be wrought to ſeduce the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Worſhip of the true God. So that if all theſe Miracles muſt be excepted from the Caſe wherein a Miracle may be wrought by a <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> his Argument <hi>from the poſſibility of it</hi> (out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.) <hi>againſt the authority of all Miracles,</hi> falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>His other Argument from Scripture is <hi>from the corrupt Notions the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>had of God and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <p>Argument <hi>2.</hi> from Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tr. p. 14.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> 
               <hi>notwithſtanding all the Miracles wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</hi> He inſtances in their Worſhipping the <hi>Calf</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s abſence: In the doubts the Author of the 73 <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſays he had about a Providence; and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Opinion that all things were governed by chance, which he confeſſes he once held. To this I anſwer, 1. I have already intimated that Miracles in themſelves do not diſcover to us what God is in his Nature, any farther than as it is done in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion which they confirm. 2. Therefore I hope he will not ſay that the Revelation which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had concerning God, was ſuch as was not ſufficient if they would have attended to it, to have taught them that God was not to be Worſhipped under the reſemblance of a <hi>Creature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 106.20.</note> much leſs <hi>his glory to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49094:33"/>
turned into the ſimilitude of a Calf.</hi> 3. The mighty Works that God did for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were ſuch as might eaſily have convinced them, that ſuch a baſe Creature was not <hi>the God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 22.4.</note> 4. Therefore he ought rather to impute it to the great ſtupidity and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that People, there being newly converted from the worſhip of the <hi>Egyptian Apis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 106.21.</note> and their <hi>forgeting of God their Saviour who had done ſo great things for them,</hi> than to any inſufficiency either in the Miracles to demonſtrate God's Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to them, or in the Law he had newly given them to inſtruct them how he was to be Worſhipped. I paſs by what he ſays of <hi>Solomon</hi> and the Author of the 73 <hi>Pſalm</hi>: their doubts were about ſuch things wherein Miracles were not proper means to inform them: <hi>viz.</hi> Why the wicked proſper in this life?</p>
            <p>What he has beſides under this Head, is, 1. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane abuſe of the Scripture,<note place="margin">Tr. p. 15.</note> inſtead of an Anſwer to thoſe plain Expreſſions therein, where God is ſaid to have wrought his Miracles, <hi>that he might make his power to be known,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 106.8. Ex. 10.2.</note> 
               <hi>and that the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>might know that he was God.</hi> This, he ſays, is not as if the Scripture meant, that Miracles are in themſelves convincing Arguments, but onely that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> makes uſe of them as Arguments <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that is (for want of better Evidences) he is fain to take all the advantage he can of their pre-conceived Opinions, however irrational and abſurd, and makes theſe his Topicks, as moſt effectual to perſwade or convince them, and in this ſenſe he interprets what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that <hi>to the Jews he became as a Jew, to the Greeks as a Oreek,</hi> that is, argued with both
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49094:33"/>
not from any true and rational Principles, but by making the beſt uſe he could of their prejudices and prepoſſeſſions to gain them to his ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is not conſiſtent with true Philoſophy,<note place="margin">Tr. p. 16.</note> that God in the Order and Courſe of his Providence ſhould be conceived to take greater care of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Nation than another; <hi>viz.</hi> he is not only bound to provide for all whatſoever means are neceſſary for their happineſs, but alſo obliged not to give any one Man over and above any degree of Grace which he does not equally impart to all the World. To anſwer theſe two Poſitions fully, we ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to examine <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s ſecond and third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>Tractatus Theologico-Polit.</hi> whereto he refers us for the demonſtration of both.</p>
            <p>I paſs on therefore to the third thing he propoſes to make out:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Propoſition</hi> 3. Tr. p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>viz. That the Scripture by the Decrees and Commands, and conſequently the Providence of God underſtands nothing elſe but the fixt and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Order of Nature.</hi> This he attempts to prove two ways, 1. By Inſtance. 2. Becauſe the Scriptute relates ſeveral <hi>Circumſtances</hi> in the production of thoſe Effects that are commonly held to be ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.<note place="margin">Arg. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> His Inſtances are ſome that I mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in my Anſwer to the <hi>Premonition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <p>Tr. p. 17.</p>
                  <p>1 Sam. 9.15, 16.</p>
               </note> viz. God telling <hi>Samuel, He would ſend him a Man out of the land of</hi> Benjamin, which was onely <hi>Sauls</hi> coming to him to enquire about the Aſſes.<note place="margin">Pſal. 105.24. Ex. 1.</note> God being ſaid <hi>to turn the hearts of the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>ſo that they hated the</hi> Iſraelites, who yet it appears, were moved to hate them upon Politique Accounts. Gods ſaying, <hi>He would ſet his Bow in the Sky,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9.13. Tr. p. 18.</note> and yet the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and undoubted Effect of Nature. So alſo the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49094:34"/>
melting of the Snow called Gods Word,<note place="margin">Pſal. 108.18. <hi>and</hi> 104.4.</note> and the Wind and Fire his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>I grant that the Scripture in theſe Inſtances, by Gods Decrees or Commands means no more than the Laws of Nature: but his Argument ought to conclude univerſally, for which a few inſtances in ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein it holds, are not ſufficient. It is enough for me to name ſome things which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture relates as the Decrees and Purpoſes of God, which yet could never take effect by the mere Courſe of Nature. As for Inſtance, <hi>That a Virgin ſhould conceive and bear a Child,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 7.14. Dan. 3.</note> That three Men ſhould be caſt into <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Furnace, and the ſame Fire kill thoſe perſons that came ſo near to the Mouth of the Furnace as to throw them in, and yet not ſo much as ſinge a hair of their heads, though thrown into the midſt of it. That the Sun ſhould ſtand ſtill at the word of a Man;<note place="margin">Joſh. 10.</note> Fire come down from Heaven at the command of another; the Sea be ſtilled, the Dead raiſed, the Devils caſt out, at the Word, Touch, and Shadow of others. All theſe Effects the Scripture ſets down as wrought by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Order of Almighty God, but not, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, by the Courſe of Nature. In a word, the Anſwer has been given before: That the Scripture a: ſcribes all Effects to God, natural or above Nature and as, from it's <hi>aſcribing the Effects of Nature to God, without mentioning how he produces them,</hi> we cannot juſtly conclude that it <hi>records them for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi>; ſo on the other hand, from its ſpeaking of ſupernatural Effects in the ſame manner, we have as little reaſon to infer, that it <hi>means nothing by them but the Order of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49094:34"/>His ſecond Reaſon is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Tr. p. 19.</note> becauſe the Scripture relates ſeveral <hi>Circumſtances</hi> in the production of Miracles; which Circumſtances, he ſays do ſhew that theſe Miracles required Natural Cauſes. So the Sprinkling of Aſhes required to produce the Plague of Scabs,<note place="margin">Ex. 9, 8.10.14.14.21</note> an Eaſt Wind to bring the Locuſts, and a Weſt Wind to drive them away; an Eaſt Wind likewiſe to drive back the Red Sea. <hi>Elijah</hi>'s laying his Body upon the Body of the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Child,<note place="margin">2 Kings 4.34.</note> in order to raiſe it to life again.</p>
            <p>If he argue to the purpoſe, he muſt grant that theſe Circumſtances, which he makes requiſite in the Order of Nature to produce theſe Effects, were alſo proper and ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ient in the Order of Nature to produce them either wholely or in part.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Wind may ſeem a very proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to bring and carry away the Locuſts, and to drive back the Sea: but the raiſing of the Wind, and determination of it is aſcribed to another Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not very proper to be the efficient Cauſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtretching out of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Hand</hi> and his <hi>Rod.</hi> And this commonly was the firſt Circumſtance in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Miracle which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought, and therefore though it were not ſufficient to produce thoſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects immediately and by it ſelf, yet it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed proper to ſet all the other ſubordinate Cauſes on Motion. For their <hi>requiring natural Cauſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe related with ſome Circumſtances concurring to their production,</hi> muſt imply that theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were the Natural Cauſes requiſite. And if ſo, then <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod had many great, many occult, yet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Qualities, very-hard indeed to explain or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and very admirable though not miraculous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49094:35"/>
as of <hi>raiſing and laying Winds and Storms of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Hail, turning the Water into Blood, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Frogs out of the River, producing Lace out of the Duſt, Water out of the Rock,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, the Circumſtances commonly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as concurrent to the production of Miracles, are ſo far from proving that they had Natural Cauſes, that they prove the contrary. For if they had any Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes, theſe Circumſtances muſt be all or part of them: but they are ſuch as are in no wiſe qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to produce the Effects aſcribed to them in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, therefore muſt be qualified for it by a Supernatural Power, which can produce <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> and make any thing inſtrumental to what Purpoſes and Effects it pleaſes.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance, the <hi>Clay</hi> and the <hi>Spittle</hi> were the immediate Inſtruments applied by our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the Eyes of the Blind, and Tongue of the Dumb-man, The mention whereof in the account of theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, if it prove that they required Natural Cauſes, then theſe were the Cauſes requiſite, theſe they had, and theſe immediately produced the Effects. This they could not by the force of Nature, therefore by Miracle; and ſo his Argument deſtroys it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But farther, what if many are produced without any Circumſtances at all, but purely at the Word and Will of the perſon that works them? This he ſays we cannot be aſſured of from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> becauſe there may have been ſome though not mentioned there (he refers to <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.27. compared with <hi>Ex.</hi> 15.10.) But what if the Scripture does not only not make mention of any, but in a manner declares there were none? So in our Saviours ſtilling the

Storm,<note place="margin">Luk 8. v. 25.</note> the very Reflection that his Diſciples make upon that Miracle, proves that it was wrought by his bare Word, and not by the Application of any Means, much leſs, Natural.<note place="margin">Tr. po. 2</note> Before he draws his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from theſe Arguments, he anſwers an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from Scripture, <hi>viz. That Famins are ſaid to be cauſed by the ſins of Men,</hi> and the like: and Rain and Plenty reſtored by their Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that the Scripture does here ſpeak <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> and with the ſame Propriety as when it ſays that God is <hi>angry, ſorrowful, repents,</hi> or the like; and that it is not true that any of theſe are the Cauſes of the Effects aſcribed to them. Here 1. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he is wary in his Anſwer. He might have granted that Famine is ſent for the ſins of Men, and Rain and fruitful Seaſons for a return to their Prayers and Repentance, and yet have denied that either of theſe is wrought by Miracle. For Nature is ordered and directed by the Wiſdom and Providence of Almighty God, as well as preſerved and upheld by his Power; and therefore his Wiſdom may ſo direct it, as often even by the Courſe of Nature to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his divine purpoſes whether of Judgment or Mercy. He ſees our Actions and hears our Prayers from all eternity, and therefore may, as he has the whole Order of Nature before his eyes, direct and determine the certain and neceſſary Events of it to their proper Seaſons, and make them Inſtrumental to the accompliſhing of his purpoſes, whether of ſhewing favour or executing wrath upon the Sons of Men. Thus therefore he need not be ſo ſtrict as to deny any poſſibility of God's puniſhing us for our ſins in the Order of Nature, for fear leſt it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49094:36"/>
ſhould betray him unawares to the conceſſion of a Miracle. Natural Cauſes indeed our Sins or P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayers are not of theſe Effects, nor yet Supernatural neither, but moral only and meritorious, as God upon view of either determines to puniſh or reward us. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were not ſo, 2. He gives but a very mean So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the difficulty <hi>that the Scripture ſpeaks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly here, and in condeſcenſion to the Capacities and Opinions of the Vulgar, as it does when it ſays that God is angry, ſorrowful or repents.</hi> We grant the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be conceived to be obliged to ſpeak in this manner, concerning the incomprehenſible Nature of God, and ſuch of his Perfections the modes whereof it is not neceſſary we ſhould have explained to us, how they are and act in him: but yet it is not neceſſary that it ſhould ſpeak of every thing in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or that every thing that it ſays ſhould be ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled off by this or the like ſuggeſtion. Nothing is more natural and eaſie to be conceived, than that God does puniſh or reward our good or bad Actions, and that in this life, and that his Juſtice and Wiſdom will oblige him to do it as he takes upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World: though it be very hard for the Vulgar to conceive how he does it without anger or diſpleaſure and the contrary affections. Therefore the Scripture may be conceived to ſpeak of the one in condeſcention to our Capacities, though yet no reaſon why it ſhould be preſumed to ſpeak of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in like manner.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Propoſition 4. Tr. p. 21.</note>I proceed to his fourth and laſt undertaking, <hi>viz. To treat of the manner of interpreting the Scripture Miracles, and what things are chiefly to be obſerved in the Relations about them.</hi> Or (as the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49094:36"/>
Tranſlator) <hi>to ſhew that moſt Men have erred in their way of interpreting the Miracles recorded in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.</hi> To ſet us right he directs us in the reading of the Scripture-narrations about Miracles, to enquire into two things, 1. <hi>The particular Opinions and Prejudices of the Relator</hi>: 2. The <hi>Idioms, Phraſes and Tropes, of the Hebrew Tongue.</hi> The firſt, becauſe generally all Hiſtorians relate the events they ſpeak of ſuitable to their own Conjectures, Opinions, and Prejudices. The other, becauſe otherwiſe we may, from the Scripture-Style, conceive ſome things to be related for Miracles which really are not. For the firſt he inſtances in <hi>Joſhua</hi> 10. v. 12, 13. where the Account of the extraordinary length of that Day is given according to the common opinion of the Sun's and not the Earth's motion. For the Second, in ſome, allegorical places out of the Prophets. <hi>Zachariah</hi> 14. v. 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. v. 10.48. v. ult. By theſe two inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations he would elude the force of all the clear and plain narrations about miracles in Scripture. To the firſt, and the inſtance he brings for it, I anſwer, the truth of the Miracle which <hi>Joſhua</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates is not at all prejudiced though it were true that the Earth moves, and not the Sun; for the courſe of Nature was ſtopped, whether in the motion of the Sun or the Earth, and therein conſiſts the truth of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: As to the relation of it, it was not neceſſary either that <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſhould himſelf be ſo great a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher or ſo far inſtructed by an extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, as to put up his requeſt to God that the Earth ſhould ſtand ſtill and not the Sun; or that the Account of it which he gives ſhould be otherwiſe than according to the appearance of ſenſe, and the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49094:37"/>
apprehenſions of the Vulgar grounded thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, the truth of the Scripture-Miracles depends not upon any allegorical expreſſions in the Prophets, but upon the naked Relations of matters of Fact in the Hiſtorical Writers; ſo that though in the former we are to proceed with ſome Caution, and not to take every thing for Miraculous, which is ſpoken of in an high ſtrain of expreſſion: yet in the latter we find no ſuch danger of being impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Tropes and Figures of the Hebrew Tongue, all things being delivered in the Hiſtorical part of Scripture with the greateſt plainneſs and ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>I have run through the main of <hi>Spinoza's</hi> Chapter, which conſiſts in the proof of his four Propositions at firſt laid down.<note place="margin">Tr. p. 26.</note> What is behind, is, 1. An account of his different Method in this Chapter from that which he takes in his firſt and ſecond Chapters about <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi>: but this is proper to his <hi>Tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Theologico Polit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tr. p. 27.</note> 2. He attempts to prove from Scripture the Immutability of the Order of Nature, repeating alſo ſome of his former Arguments for it; 3. He cloſes all with a paſſage out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Opinion His places of Scripture which he alledges, are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. v. 6. <hi>He hath eſtabliſhed them for ever: he hath made a decree,</hi> which ſhall not paſs; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. v. 9. <hi>That there is no new thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun,</hi> and other places parallel to them. To the firſt, the Order of Nature may be ſaid to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for ever, and yet that Term imply no unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted or eternal duration of it: ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49094:37"/>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.14, &amp;c. To the ſecond, it is poſſible, notwithſtanding that place, that there may ſomething new happen even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of Nature, for <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves there no more than this, that ordinarily in Nature there is a conſtant viciſſitude, a coming and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeveral Species of Things: for all which, it is poſſible within the Period of Six thouſand years that Nature may produce ſomething new and not ſeen or heard of before: and if by Nature ſomething thus new may be produced, there is no Reaſon from this place but the like may be done by Miracle too.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Authority it is enough to oppoſe the learned Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s remark of him in his <hi>Opera Poſthuma,</hi> p. 33. That he makes it his buſineſs to leſſen and detract from the greatneſs of the Miracle which he relates out of the Scripture, only to gain a more eaſie approbation of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> among the <hi>Heathen</hi>: and this Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> makes out by ſeveral inſtances, one whereof is the paſſage here quoted by <hi>Spinoza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s Quotation out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator</hi> adds one or two more out of <hi>Valeſius,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burnett,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sprat.</hi> Mr. <hi>Burnett,</hi> I have ſhewed above, in the very next Words almoſt to thoſe which here he quotes out of him, aſſerts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively that there are Miracles. I need not tire my ſelf to examine whether the reſt are as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him, as I make no queſtion they are.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then I have made it appear, that the whole <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is only a <hi>Collection</hi> out of other Authors. That all of them, except <hi>Spinoza,</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49094:38"/>
the opinion for which they are produced. And whether I have given a full Anſwer to his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I leave to the candid and impartial Reader to determine.</p>
