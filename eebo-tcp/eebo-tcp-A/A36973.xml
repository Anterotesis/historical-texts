            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>'Tis doubtless the depraved Quality of the present Times, which makes that often appear Flattery, which considering the real <hi>Merit</hi> of the Person, may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be but <hi>Iustice.</hi> The greatest Wits of former Ages, I am sure, were of this Opinion, that never spar'd with their highest Elegance, to Illustrate the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of their <hi>Patrons,</hi> who in return, with their choicest Favours, express'd their Gratitude, without Blushing, or believing that to be a <hi>Compliment,</hi> which was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a due belonging to their <hi>Merit.</hi>

                  <l>IF I'm of Age, to know what's Good from Bad,</l>
                  <l>I must declare our Patentees are Mad;</l>
                  <l>They've known my Comick Humour all along,</l>
                  <l>And yet this Morning sent me here—a Song,</l>
                  <l>A nimble dapper Dancing-Master too,</l>
                  <l>And bids me chuse, for nothing else will do.</l>

                  <l>For as toth' first, my English Bulk's not made;</l>
                  <l>I want an Air for <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s Capring Trade:</l>

                  <l>If they expect, I'll be a Capon for't,</l>
                  <l>I'd have 'em know, my Salary's too short;</l>
                  <l>I'd do much for Diversion of the Town,</l>
                  <l>But not do something to lose all my own.</l>
                  <l>Ah, Sirs, you are the cause of these our Streights,</l>
                  <l>You still have been our dire malignant Fates:</l>
                  <l>By your lewd Humours first, which when we follow'd</l>
                  <l>Our Smutty Plays out of our Doors were Hollow'd,</l>
                  <l>And Zealous Spirits 'gainst our Function Bellow'd.</l>
                  <l>And then besides, your Critick Quality,</l>
                  <l>Makes such a wretched Drug of Poetry,</l>
                  <l>That we are forc'd, to help our Withering Bays,</l>
                  <l>Strangers to Hire, of <hi>Sigismundian</hi> Race,</l>
                  <l>At Price so dear, we purchase Voices Killing,</l>

                  <l>My Trade's quite spoil'd, I cannot vend my Ware,</l>
                  <l>Ah, would to Heav'n I were a Dancing Bear,</l>

                  <l>I'll draw the City Fops, and Suburb Whores,</l>
                  <l>And Cheat the Town by Sixes, and by Fours.</l>
                  <l>But since our Poet is resolv'd to day,</l>
                  <l>Once more to entertain you with a Play,</l>
                  <l>A famous Story, and known lately True,</l>
                  <l>Mixt with good Humour, and good Musick too,</l>
                  <l>Which there is in it, give the Devil his due:</l>
                  <l>I'll once more hope too, it will please your Fansies,</l>
                  <l>As well as if it were all Songs and Dances.</l>
                  <l>And if some Foes their Malice should pursue,</l>
                  <l>Let but our Friends do generous Iustice too,</l>
                  <l>We'll Criticks fear no more, those Play degraders,</l>
                  <l>Than Wise Men did of late the new Invaders.</l>
                  <l>The first, our Heroes of sharp Vnderstanding,</l>
                  <l>On Wit's fair Island, shall oppose from Landing.</l>

                  <l>For th' Character of my kind Lord and me:</l>
                  <l>A Husband vent'ring so to save his Wife,</l>
                  <l>And she, for his sake, slighting her own Life;</l>

                  <l>Such Rarities—where are they to be found?</l>

                  <l>Pleas'd with the Subject, must our Scenes approve:</l>
                  <l>And you, fair Ladies, that have Husbands dear,</l>
                  <l>Concern'd must in the Poet's Cause appear;</l>
