            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF the Reflection upon other Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, may afford at any time Diversion, or Improvement, by minding us of the Signal Vicissitudes of Humane Affairs; these Tragical Scenes, which we now offer to publick view, (exhibiting a serious, yet withall, delightful Representation, of one of the most splendid Calamities that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hath transmitted to Posterity) may peradventure be look'd upon as no unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Entertainment.</p>
            <p>The Poem, as to its Subject, wants nothing of Grandeur to ennoble it, nor, as to its Composition, of Ingenuity: Having gain'd by the joynt Suffrage of the most knowing Criticks of this latter Age (<hi>Lipsius, Delrius, Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Heinsius</hi>) the
<pb facs="tcp:96646:3"/>
Title of <hi>The Divine Troades.</hi> And one of the most Eminent Modern Masters of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Poesy among us, Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> in his Essay upon that Subject, hath declar'd it to be the Master Piece of <hi>Seneca;</hi> especially that Scene therein, where <hi>Ulys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> is seeking for <hi>Astyanax</hi> to kill him. <hi>There</hi> (says he) <hi>you have the Tenderness of a Mother so represented in</hi> Andromache, <hi>that it raises Compassion to a high Degree in the Reader, and bears the nearest Resemblance of any thing in the Antient Tragedies, to the excellent Scenes of Passion in</hi> Shakespeare, <hi>or in</hi> Fletcher.</p>
            <p>If in this our Version, those commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Graces of the Original be not utterly lost, the candid Reader will find somthing therein, which happily, he may not dislike.</p>
            <p>For the better clearing of the obscurer places in the Poem, there are added some Mythological, Historical, and Topographical Notes; not such (I must confess) as may fully answer the expectation of the Critically Learned, yet such (if I mistake not) as may serve, in some Measure, to satisfie the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Curiosity of the less knowing Reader.</p>

            <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Greeks</hi> after ten Years War, having taken and ruin'd the City of <hi>Troy,</hi> were hindred from returning home by cross Winds. The Ghost of <hi>Achilles</hi> appearing denies any possibility of returning, until they sacrifice to his Ashes <hi>Polyxena,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Priam</hi> and <hi>Hecuba,</hi> in treating about whose Nuptials he was treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously slain. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> out of kindness to <hi>Polyxena,</hi> denies to have her sacrific'd. This begets a hot Dispute and Contest between <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> which <hi>Calchas</hi> at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ngth decides, by declaring, That not only <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyxena,</hi> but <hi>Astyanax</hi> likewise, (Son of <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Andromache</hi>) were both to be slain e're they could hope for favourable Winds. In pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which prophetical Decree, the one was by <hi>Ulysses</hi> thrown headlong from the <hi>Scaean Tower;</hi> and the other, habited like a <hi>Grecian</hi> Bride, sacrific'd by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> at his Father's Monument.</p>

There is a passage or two in <hi>Homer,</hi> whence the computation may be made; the the first, <hi>Iliad.</hi> 8. where the <hi>Trojan</hi> Camp is described, to contain 1000.
