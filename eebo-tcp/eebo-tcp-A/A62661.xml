            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THis Epistle Dedicatory which
humbly lays this Little Volume
at your Lordships feet, and begs
a Protection there, is rather an Address
<pb facs="tcp:98886:3"/>
than a Dedication; to which a great
many hands have subscrib'd, it Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Lordship a Garland whose
Flowers are cull'd by several Iudgments
in which I claim the least part; whose
sole Ambition is this way to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
your Lordships new Addition of
Honour, that of the Most Noble
Order of the <hi>Thistle,</hi> an Honour
which preced's that of the <hi>Garter,</hi>
having been supported by a long Race of
of Kings, and only fell with the most
Illustrious of Queens, whose m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

(which ought to be Establish'd, in
all hearts can not be better preserv'd,)
than by reviving this so Ancient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
well has His Majesty chosen its
Noble Champions, among whom
none merits more the Glory of that
Royal Favor than your Lordship: whose
<pb facs="tcp:98886:3"/>
Loyalty to His Sacred Person and
interest through all the adversities of
Fate, has begot you so perfect a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
in all hearts, and is so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
the Innate vertue of your Great
mind; a virtue not shewn by unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
fits when it shall serve an end,
(a false Bravery for a while when least
needful, and thrown off when put to
useful Tryal; like those who weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Advantages by Probabilities only,
and fancying the future to out-poyse
the present, cast there their Anchor of
Hope,) but a virtue built on so sure
and steady Basis's of Honour, as nothing
can move or shake; the Royal Interest
being so greatly indeed the Property
of Nobility, and so much even above
life and Fortune: Especially when to
support a Monarch so truly just, so
<pb facs="tcp:98886:4"/>
wise and great; a Monarch whom God
Almighty Grant long to Reign over
Vs, and still to be serv'd by men of
Principles so truly Brave, as those that
shine in your Lordship.</p>
            <p>Pardon, my Lord, this Digression
and the meanness of this Present, which
to a Person of your Lordships great
and weighty Employments in the world
may seem Improper, if I did not know
that the most Glorious of Statesmen
must somtimes unbend from Great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and seek a diversion in trivial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments:
Though Poetry will Iustle
for the Preheminency of all others, and
I know is not the least in the Esteem
of your Lordship, who is so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Iudg of it, if any thing here may

            <head>LYCIDUS:
OR, THE
Lover in Fashion, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have receiv'd your melancholy Epistle, with
the Account of your Voyage to the <hi>Island of
Love;</hi> of your Adventures there, and the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the death of your <hi>Aminta:</hi> At which you
shall forgive me if I tell you I am neither surpris'd
nor griev'd, but hope to see you the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,
as absolutely reduc'd to reason as myself.
When Love, that has so long deprived you of
Glory, shall give you no more Sighs but at the
short remembrances of past Pleasures; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you have heard my Account of the Voyage I
made to the same place, with my more lucky one
back again, (for I, since I saw you, have been an
Adventurer) you will by my Example become
of my Opinion, (notwithstanding your dismal Tales
of Death and the eternal Shades,) which is, that
if there be nothing that will lay me in my Tomb
till Love brings me thither, I shall live to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98886:9"/>
I must confess 'tis a great Inducement to Love,
and a happy Advance to an Amour, to be handsom,
finely shap'd, and to have a great deal of Wit;
these are Charms that subdue the Hearts of all the
Fair: And one sees but very few Ladies, that can
resist these good Qualities, especially in an Age so
gallant as ours, yet all this is nothing if Fortune
do not smile: And I have seen a Man handsom, well
shap'd, and of a great deal of Wit, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of a thousand happy Adventures, yet
finds himself in the end, fitter for an Hospital than
the Elevation of Fortune: And the Women are
not contented we should give them as much Love
as they give us, (which is but reasonable,) but
they would compel us all to Present and Treat 'em
lavishly, till a Man hath consumed both Estate
and Body in their Service. How many do we see,
that are wretched Examples of this Truth, and
who have nothing of all they enjoyed remaining
with 'em, but a poor <hi>Idaea</hi> of past Pleasures, when
rather the Injury the Jilt has done 'em, ought
to be eternally present with 'em. Heaven keep
me from being a Woman's Property. There are
Cullies enough besides you or I, <hi>Lysander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think now, That I, who can talk
thus Learnedly and Gravely, had never been any
of the number of those wretched, whining, sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
dying Fops, I speak of, never been jilted
and cozen'd of both my Heart and Reason; but
let me tell those that think so, they are mistaken,
and that all this Wisdom and Discretion, I now
seem replenish'd with, I have as dearly bought as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98886:9"/>
any keeping Fool of 'em all. I was ly'd and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Wit, jilted and cozen'd into Prudence,
and, by ten thousand broken Vows and perjured
Oaths, reduced to Sense again; and can laugh
at all my past Follies now.</p>
            <p>After I have told you this, you may guess at a
great part of my Story; which, in short, is this:
I would needs make a Voyage, as you did, to this
fortunate Isle, and accompanyed with abundance
of young Heirs, Cadets, Coxcombs, Wits, Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
and Politicians, with a whole Cargo of
Cullies all, nameless and numberless we Landed
on the Inchanted Ground; the first I saw, and lik'd,
was charming <hi>Silvia;</hi> you believe I thought her
fair as Angels; young, as the Spring, and sweet
as all the Flowers the blooming Fields produce;
that when she blush'd, the Ruddy Morning open'd,
the Rose-buds blew, and all the Pinks and Dazies
spread; that when she sigh'd or breath'd, <hi>Arabia</hi>'s
Spices, driven by gentle Winds, perfum'd all
around; that when she look'd on me, all Heaven
was open'd in her Azure Eyes, from whence Love
shot a thousand pointed Darts, and wounded me
all over; that when she spoke, the Musick of the
Spheres, all that was ravishing in Harmony, blest
the Adoring Listener; that when she walk'd,
<hi>Venus</hi> in the Mirtle Grove when she advanc'd to
meet her lov'd <hi>Adonis,</hi> assuming all the Grace
young Loves cou'd give, had not so much of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
as <hi>Silvia:</hi> In fine, she did deserve, and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
her to all the Fopperies, the Suns, the Stars,
the Coral, and the Pearl, the Roses and Lillies,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98886:10"/>
Angels Spheres, and Goddesses, fond Lovers dress
their Idols in. For she was all, fancy and fine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
could adorn her with, at least, the gazing
Puppy thought so. 'Twas such I saw and lov'd;
but knowing I did Adore, I made my humble
Court, and she, by all my trembling, sighings,
pantings, the going and returning of my Blood,
found all my Weakness and her own Power; and
using all the Arts of her Sex, both to ingage and
secure me, play'd all the Woman over: She wou'd
be scornful and kind by turns, as she saw conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
This to check my Presumption and too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
hope; That to preserve me from the brink of
despair. Thus was I tost in the Blanket of Love,
somtimes up, and somtimes down, as her Wit and
Humor was in or out of tune, all which I watch'd,
and waited like a Dog, that still the oftner kick'd
wou'd fawn the more.</p>
            <p>Oh, 'tis an excellent Art this managing of a
Coxcomb, the Serpent first taught it our Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Eve;</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> was the first Cully: E're
since they have kept their Empire over Men, and
we have, e're since, been Slaves. But I, the most
submissive of the whole Creation, was long in
gaining Grace; she used me as she meant to keep
me, Fool enough for her Purpose. She saw me
young enough to do her Service, handsom enough
to do her Credit, and Fortune enough to please
her Vanity and Interest: She therefore suffer'd me
to Love, and Bow among the Crowd, and fill her
Train. She gave me hope enough to secure me
100, but gave me nothing else, till she saw me lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98886:10"/>
to that degree, she feared, to lose the Glory
of my Services, by my death; only this Pleasure
kept me alive, to see her treat all my Rivals with
the greatest Rigour imaginable, and to me all sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
exposing their feblesses; and having taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of my Languishment, she suffered me Freedoms
that wholely Ravish'd me, and gave me hopes I
shou'd not be long a dying for all she cou'd give.</p>
            <p>But, since I have a great deal to say of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
in passing out of this <hi>Island of Love:</hi> I
will be as brief as I can in what arrived to me on the
Place; and tell you, That after Ten thousand
Vows of eternal Love on both sides, I had the Joy,
not only to be believ'd and lov'd, but to have her
put herself into my Possession, far from all my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals:
Where, for some time I lived with this char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Maid, in all the Raptures of Pleasure, Youth,
Beauty, and Love could create. Eternally we
loved, and lived together, no day nor night sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
us, no Frowns interrupted our Smiles, no
Clouds our Sun-shine; the Island was all perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Spring, still flowery and green, in Bowers, in
Shades, by purling Springs and Fountains, we
past our hours, unwearied and uninterrupted. I
cannot express to you the happy Life I led, during
this blessed Tranquility of Love, while <hi>Silvia</hi>
still was pleased, and still was gay. We walked
all day together in the Groves, and entertained
ourselves with a thousand Stories of Love; we
laught at the foolish World, who could not make
their Felicity with out Crowds and Noise: We
pittied Kings in Courts in this Retirement, so well
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98886:11"/>
we liked our Solitude; till on a day, (blest be
that joyful day, though then 'twas most a-curst,)
I say upon that day, I know not by what accident
I was parted from my Charmer, and left her all
alone, but in my absence, there incountred her a
Woman extremely ugly, and who was however
very nice and peevish, inconstant in her temper,
and no one place could continue her: The finest
things in the World were troublesom to her, and
she was Shagreen at every thing; her Name is
<hi>Indifference;</hi> she is a Person of very great Power
in this Island, (though possibly you never incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
her there,) and those that follow her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the <hi>Isle of Love</hi> without any great pains.
She brought <hi>Silvia</hi> to the Lake of <hi>Disgust,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in persuing her (at my return,) I found her,
ready to take Boat to have past quite away, and
where there are but too many to transport those
Passengers, who follow <hi>Indifference</hi> over the Lake
of <hi>Disgust.</hi> I saw this disagreeable Creature too, but
she appeared too ugly for me to approach her, but
forcing <hi>Silvia</hi> back, I returned again to the Palace
of <hi>True Pleasure,</hi> where some days after there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to me a Misfortune, of which, I believed I
should never have seen an end. I found <hi>Silvia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
round with new Lovers, still adoring and
pleasing her a thousand ways, and though none of
'em were so rich, so young, or so handsom as I, she
nevertheless failed not to treat 'em with all the
Smiles and Caresses 'twas possible to imagin; when
I complain'd of this, she would satisfy my fears
with so many Vows and Imprecations, that I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98886:11"/>
would believe her, and think myself unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but when she would be absent whole days, in
an hundred places, she would find such probable
Excuse, and lye with such a Grace, no mortal
cou'd have accused her, so that all the whole
Island took notice that I was a bassled Cuckold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I could believe she would deceive me, so hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
she damn'd herself: Through all the Groves I
was the pointed Coxcomb, laught at aloud, and
knew not where the jest lay; but thought myself
as secure in the Innocence of my deceiving fair
One, as the first hour I charmed her, and like a
keeping Cully, lavish'd out my Fortune, my
plenteous Fortune, to make her fine to Cuckold
me. 'Sdeath! how I scorn the Follies of my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
and am resolv'd to persue Love for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in such a manner as it shall never cost me a
Sigh: This shall be my method.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>I was a great while, (like you,) before I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the remembrance of my first Languishments,
and I almost thought, (by an excess of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,)
that the end of my Misfortunes were with my
Life at hand: Yet still like a fond Slave, willing to
drag my Fetters on, I hop'd she would find Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to convince me she was not false; and in
that Humor, fear'd only I should not be handsomly
and neatly jilted. Could she but have dissembled
well, I had been still her Cully. Could she have
play'd her Game with discretion, but, vain of her
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98886:13"/>
Conquest, she boasted it to all the World, and I
alone was the kind keeping Blockhead, to whom
'twas unperceived, so well she swore me into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of her Truth to me. Till one day, lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a solitary Shade, with my sad Thoughts fixt
on my declining Happiness, and almost drown'd
in Tears, I saw a Woman drest in glorious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all loose and flowing with the wind, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fields and Groves with such a pace, as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
when she heard her lov'd Youth was slain,
hasted to behold her ruin. She past me, as I lay,
with an unexpressable swiftness, and spoke as she
run, with a loud Voice. At her first approach,
I felt a strange trembling at my Heart without
knowing the reason, and found at last this Woman
was <hi>Fame.</hi> Yet I was not able to tell from whence
proceeded my Inquietude. When her Words
made me but too well understand the Cause: The
fatal Subject of what she cry'd, in passing by me,
were these;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Poor <hi>Lycidus</hi> for sharne arise,</l>
               <l>And wipe <hi>Loves</hi> Errors from thy Eyes;</l>
               <l>Shake off the God that holds thy Heart;</l>
               <l>Since <hi>Silvia</hi> for another burns,</l>
               <l>And all thy past Indurement scorns</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98886:14"/>
I believed, as she spoke, that I had ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
her, but she repeated it so often, that I no
longer doubted my wretchedness. I leave you,
who so well can guess, to imagin, what Complaints
I made, filling the Grove, where I was laid, with
my pitious Cries; somtimes I rose and raved, and
rail'd on Love, and reproached the fair Fugitive.
But the tender God was still pleading in my Heart,
and made me ever end my noisy Griefs in Sighs and
silent Tears. A thousand Thoughts of revenge I
entertained against this happy Rival, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ingrate: But those Thoughts, like my Rage,
would also end in soft reproaching murmurs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
only. And I would somtimes argue with
Love in this manner.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah, cruel <hi>Love!</hi> when will thy Torments cease?</l>
               <l>And when shall I have leave to dye in Peace?</l>
               <l>And why, too charming and too cruel Maid,</l>
               <l>Cou'd'st thou not yet thy fleeting Heart have stay'd?</l>
               <l>And by degrees thy fickle Humor shewn,</l>
               <l>By turns the Enemy and Friend put on:</l>
               <l>Have us'd my Heart a little to thy scorn,</l>
               <l>The loss at least might have been easier born.</l>
               <l>

With feigned Vows, (that poor Expence of Breath,)</l>
               <l>Alas thou might'st have sooth'd me to my death.</l>
               <l>Thy Coldness, and thy visible decays</l>

               </gap>
was not without some secret hope, that what I had
heard was not true; nor would I be persuaded to
undeceive myself of that hope which was so dear
and precious to me. I was not willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
I was intirely miserable, out of too great a
fear to find it true; and there were some Moments
in which I believed <hi>Fame</hi> might falsly accuse <hi>Silvia,</hi>
and it did not seem reasonable to me, that, after
all the Vows and Oaths she had made, she should
so easily betray 'em, and forgetting my Services,
receive those of another, less capable of rendring
them to her advantage. Somtimes I would excuse
her ungratitude with a thousand things that seem'd
reasonable, but still that was but to make me more
sensible of my disgrace; and then I would accuse
myself of a thousand weaknesses below the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Man; I would even despise and loath
my own easiness, and resolve to be no longer a
<hi>Mark-out-fool</hi> for all the Rhiming Wits of the Island
to aim their Dogrel at. And grown, as I imagined,
brave at this thought, I resolved first to be fully
convinced of the persidy of my Mistress, and then
to rent my Heart from the attachment that held it.</p>
            <p>You know, that from the <hi>Desart of Remembrance,</hi>
one does, with great facility, look over all the
<hi>Island of Love.</hi> I was resolved to go thither one
day; and where indeed I could survey all things
that past, in the Groves, the Bowers, by Rivers, or

'twas from thence, that one day I saw the
faithless <hi>Silvia,</hi> in the Palace of <hi>True Pleasure,</hi> in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98886:15"/>
the very Bower of Bliss with one of my Rivals,
but most intimate Friend.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>'Twas there, I saw my Rival take</l>
               <l>Pleasures, he knew how to make;</l>
               <l>There he took, and there was given,</l>
               <l>All the Joys that Rival Heaven;</l>
               <l>Kneeling at her Feet he lay,</l>
               <l>And in transports dy'd away:</l>
               <l>Where the faithless suffer'd too</l>
               <l>All the amorous Youth cou'd do.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Ardour of his fierce desire</l>
               <l>Set his Face and Eyes on fire.</l>
               <l>All their Language was the Blisses</l>
               <l>Of Ten thousand eager Kisses.</l>
               <l>While his ravish'd Neck she twin'd</l>
               <l>And to his Kisses, Kisses join'd.</l>
               <l>Till, both inflam'd, she yeilded so</l>
               <l>She suffer'd all the Youth cou'd do.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98886:16"/>
In fine, 'twas there I saw that I must lose the
day. And I saw in this Lover Ten thousand Charms
of Youth and Beauty; on which the ingrate with
greedy languishing Eyes, eternally gazed with
the same Joy she used to behold me when she made
me most happy. I confess, this Object was so far
from pleasing me, (as I believed a confirmation
would,) that the change inspired me with a rage,
which nothing else could do, and made me say
things unbecoming the Dignity of my Sex, who
ought to disdain those faithless Slaves, which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
first made to obey the Lords of the Creation.
A thousand times I was about to have rush'd upon
'em, and have ended the Lives of the loose betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of my repose, but Love stepp'd in and stay'd my
hand, preventing me from an Outrage, that would
have cost me that rest of Honour, I yet had left:
But when my rage was abated, I fell to a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
Torment, that of extream Grief to
find another possest of what I had been so long,
and with so much Toil in gaining: 'Twas thus I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
and after a little while brought myself to
make calm Reflections upon this Adventure, which
reduced me to some reason. When one day as I was
walking in an unfrequented Shade, whither my
Melancholy had conducted me, I incountred a Man,
of a hauty look and meen, his Apparel rich and
glorious, his Eyes awful, and his Stature tall; the
very sight of him inspired me with coldness, which
render'd me almost insensible of the infidelity of
<hi>Silvia.</hi> This Person was <hi>Pride,</hi> who looking on
me, as he past, with a fierce and disdainful Smile,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98886:16"/>
over his Shoulder, and regarding me with scorn, said;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Why shou'd that faithless wanton give</l>
               <l>Thy Heart so mortal pain,</l>
               <l>Whose Sighs were only to deceive,</l>
               <l>Her Oaths all false and vain?</l>
               <l>Despise those Tears thou shedd'st for her,</l>
               <l>Disdain to sigh her Name.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Love,</hi> thy Liberty prefer;</l>
               <l>To faithless <hi>Silvia,</hi> Fame.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I knew by his words he was <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi>
and would have embraced him; but
he put me off seeing <hi>Love</hi> still by me, who had
not yet abandoned me, and turned himself from
me with a regardless scorn, but I, who was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to forsake so discreet a Counsellor, rather
chose to take my leave of little <hi>Love;</hi> who had
ever accompanyed me in this Voyage. But oh!
this adieu was not taken so easily and soon as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
<hi>Love</hi> was not to be quitted without abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Sighs and Tears at parting, he had been
a Witness to all my Adventures, my Confident in
this Amour, and not to be deserted without a great
deal of pain; I stayed so long in bidding the dear
Boy adieu, that I had almost forgot <hi>Disdain;</hi> at
last, though my Heart were breaking to part with
the dear fondling, I was resolved and said;</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98886:17"/>
               <l>Farewel, my little charming Boy!</l>
               <l>Farewel, my fond delight,</l>
               <l>My dear Instructer all the day,</l>
               <l>My soft repose at night.</l>
               <l>Thou, whom my Soul has so carest,</l>
               <l>And my poor Heart has held so fast,</l>
               <l>Thou never left me in my pain,</l>
               <l>Nor in my happier hours;</l>
               <l>Thou eas'd me when I did complain,</l>
               <l>And dry'd my falling showrs.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Silvia</hi> frown'd still thou woud'st smile,</l>
               <l>And all my Cares and Griefs beguile.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But <hi>Silvia</hi>'s gone, and I have torn</l>
               <l>Her Witchcrafts from my Heart;</l>
               <l>And nobly fortify'd by scorn</l>
               <l>Her Empire will subvert;</l>
               <l>Thy Laws establish'd there destroy,</l>
               <l>And bid adieu to the dear charming Boy.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98886:17"/>
In quitting <hi>Love</hi> I was a great while before I
could find <hi>Disdain,</hi> but I, at last, overtook him:
He accompanyed me to a Village, where I received
a Joy I had not known since my Arrival to the <hi>Isle
of Love,</hi> and which Repose seemed the sweeter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was new. When I came to this place, I
saw all the World Easie, Idle, and at Liberty: This
Village is like a Desart, and all the Inhabitants
live within themselves, there is only one Gate, by
which we enter into it from the <hi>Isle of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place is called <hi>Indifference,</hi> and takes its
Name from a Princess inhabiting there, a Person
very fair and well made; but has a Grace and Meen
of so little Wit, and seems so inutile and so silly,
that it renders her even ridiculous. As soon as I
arrived there, I called to my remembrance all those
affronts and cheats of Love, that <hi>Silvia</hi> had put
upon me, and which now served for my diversion,
and were agreeable thoughts to me; so that I called
myself Ten thousand Sots and Fools for resenting
'em; and that I did not heartily despise 'em, laugh
at 'em, and make my Pleasure with the false One
as well as the rest; for she dissembled well, and
for ought I knew, 'twas but dissembled Love she
paid my Rivals. But I, forsooth, was too nice a
Coxcomb, I cou'd not feed as others did, and be
contented with such Pleasures as she cou'd afford,
but I must ingross all, and unreasonably believe a
Woman of Youth and Wit had not a longer Race
of Love to run than to my Arms alone. Well, 'tis
now confest I was a Fool, nor could I hinder my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from saying a thousand times a day;</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98886:18"/>
               <l>That Coxcomb can ne're be at ease,</l>
               <l>While Beauty inslaves his Soul.</l>
               <l>'Tis Liberty only can please,</l>
               <l>And he that's Fetter'd is an Owl.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I found it very convenient and happy to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
from Love, and I have wondred a thousand
times at the Follies that God has made me commit:
And though I somtimes thought on <hi>Silvia,</hi> I
thought her less charming and fair than she was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her fall; and the Humour I now was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
her no more meriting that Passion I once
had for her, and I fancied she had lost all those Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for which once I lov'd her: In fine, I was so wholly
recovered of my disease of Love for <hi>Silvia,</hi> that I
began to be uneasie for want of imploying my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses;
and a change from so violent a Passion
to such a degree of coldness, became insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to one of my Youth and natural Gayety; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that I was seized with a Dulness, or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishment,
and so great a sit of Melancholy, as I
had never felt the like; and my Heart, that was so
accustomed to Love, was so out of Humour, that
it had no Object or Business for thought, that it
lost all its Harmony and Wit; it having nothing to
excite it to Life and Motion, passing from so vast
a degree of tenderness to an unconcern equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.
I thought it rude, ill-bred, and idle, to
live so indifferent and insignificant a Life. And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98886:18"/>
walking perpetually by myself, (or with those of
my own Sex, that could not make my diversion,)
I sung all day this following Song to a Hum-drum
Tune, to myself;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Not to sigh and to be tender,</l>
               <l>Not to talk and prattle Love,</l>
               <l>Is a Life no good can render,</l>
               <l>And insipidly does move:</l>
               <l>Unconcern do's Life destroy,</l>
               <l>Which, without Love, can know no Joy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Life, without adoring Beauty,</l>
               <l>Will be useless all the day;</l>
               <l>Love's a part of Human Duty,</l>
               <l>And 'tis Pleasure to obey.</l>
               <l>In vain the Gods did Life bestow,</l>
               <l>Where kinder Love has nought to do.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What is Life, but soft desires,</l>
               <l>And that Soul, that is not made</l>
               <l>To entertain what Love inspires,</l>
               <l>Oh thou dull immortal Shade?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98886:19"/>
Thou'dst better part with Flesh and Blood,</l>
               <l>Than be, where Life's not understood.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>These were my notions of Life; and I found
myself altogether useless in the World without
Love; methought I had nothing to animate me to
Gallant things, without Love, or Women: I
had no use of Wit or Youth without the fair, and
yet I did not wish wholly to ingage myself neither
a second time, having been so ill-treated before
by Love: But I found there were ways to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
one's self agreeably enough without dying or
venturing the breaking of a heart for the matter:
That there were Beauties to be obtained without
the hazard of hanging or drowning one's self: I
never had tryed, but I found it natural enough
to my Humour and Constitution, to flatter and
dissemble, swear and lye; I viewed my self in my
Glass, and found myself very well recovered from
the Ruins my first Amour had made, and believed
myself as fit for Conquest, as any Sir <hi>Fopling,</hi> or
Sir <hi>Courtly Nice</hi> of 'em all. To this sine Person
and good Meen and Shape, (as I thought,) I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
handsom Dressing, the thing that takes the
Heart infinitely above all your other Parts, and
thus set out a snare for vain Beauty; I every day
went out of the City of <hi>Indifference,</hi> to see what
new Adventures I could meet withal.</p>
            <p>One day I incountred a Woman, who, at first
sight appeared very agreeable; she had an Air ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98886:19"/>
free, and Galliard; such as fails not to take
at first view: This was <hi>Coquettre,</hi> who, the very
first time she saw me, Addrest herself to me with
very great Complisance and good Humour, and
invited me to her Apartment, where she assured me
I should not fail to be entertained very agreeably;
and at the same time pulling out of her Pocket a
Paper, she shewed me these Words written;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Let Love no more your Heart inspire,</l>
               <l>Thô Beauty every hour you see;</l>
               <l>Pass no farther than desire,</l>
               <l>If you'll truly happy be.</l>
               <l>Every day fresh Objects view,</l>
               <l>And for all have Complisance.</l>
               <l>Search all places still for new,</l>
               <l>And to all make some Advance;</l>
               <l>For where Wit and Youth agree,</l>
               <l>There's no Life like Gallantry.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Laura</hi>'s Heart you may receive,</l>

               <l>Take what young <hi>Diana</hi> gives,</l>
               <l>Pity <hi>Lucia</hi> when she dies:</l>
               <l>

                  <hi>Portia</hi>'s Face you must admire,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Phillis</hi> Dancing gives you Fire,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Celia</hi>'s Softness, <hi>Clara</hi>'s Wit.</l>
               <l>Thus all at once you may persue,</l>
               <l>'Tis too little to Love two.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The powerful smiling God of Hearts</l>
               <l>So much tenderness imparts,</l>
               <l>You must upon his Altars lay</l>
               <l>A thousand Offerings every day:</l>
               <l>And so soft is kind desire;</l>
               <l>Oh! so Charming is the Fire,</l>
               <l>That if nice <hi>Adraste</hi> scorns,</l>
               <l>Gentler <hi>Ariadne</hi> burns.</l>
               <l>Still Another keep in play</l>
               <l>(If One refuse,) to give you Joy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Cease therefore to disturb your Hours,</l>
               <l>For having two desires</l>
               <l>A Heart can manage two Amours.</l>
               <l>And burn with several Fires.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98886:20"/>
The day has hours enough in store</l>
               <l>To visit two or half a score.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I gave her thanks for her good Counsel, and
found I needed not much persuasion to follow <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettre</hi>
to a City that bears her Name, and I saw
over the Gate of the City at my Entrance, these
Verses writ in Gold Letters;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The God of Love beholding every day</l>
               <l>Slaves from his Empire to depart away;</l>
               <l>(For Hearts that have been once with Love fatigu'd,</l>

               <l>No second Beauty e'r can move</l>
               <l>The Soul to that degree of Love.)</l>
               <l>This City built, that we might still obey,</l>
               <l>Thô we refus'd his Arbitrary Sway:</l>
               <l>'Tis here we find a grateful Recompence</l>
               <l>For all Loves former Violence;</l>
               <l>Tir'd with his Laws we hither come</l>
               <l>To meet a kinder softer doom.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98886:21"/>
'Tis here the God, without the Tyrant, Reigns,</l>

               <l>Here 'tis with Reason and with Wit he Rules,</l>

               <l>No check or bound to Nature gives,</l>
               <l>But kind desire rewarded thrives.</l>
               <l>Peevish uneasy Pride, the God</l>

               <l>All Jealousies, all Quarrels cease,</l>
               <l>And here Love lives in perfect Peace.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This agreeable description, gave me new desire
to enter into the City; where I incountred a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fine Persons all gloriously drest, as if they
were purposely set out for Conquest: There was
nothing omitted of Cost and Gallantry, that might
render 'em intirely Charming, and they employ'd
all their Arts of Looks and Dress to gain Hearts.</p>
            <p>It is, in a word, from these fair Creatures you
are to draw your Satisfaction, and 'tis indeed at a
dear rate you buy it, yet, notwithstanding the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
a world of People persue 'em.</p>
            <p>When I came into the City, I was soon percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be a Stranger there, and while I was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
whither I should go, or how to address my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98886:21"/>
to these fair Creatures, a little <hi>Coquett Cupid</hi>
presented himself to me for a kind Instructer; and
to explain him, this in a word is his Character:</p>
            <p>He is of the same Race with the other <hi>Cupids,</hi>
has the same Mother too, <hi>Venus:</hi> He wears a Bow
and Arrows, like the rest of the young Loves;
but he has no Bando, nothing to cover his Eyes,
but he sees perfectly; nor has he any <hi>Flambeau:</hi>
And all the Laws of <hi>Coquettre</hi> he understands and
observes exactly.</p>
            <p>I had no sooner received the little Charming
God, but he instructed me in all the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Arts to please, in all his little wiles and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deceits; all which he admits of as the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Recourses to that great end of Man, his true
diversion: With all which I was so extreamly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that resolving to be his Votary, I followed
him to the most delightful place in the World, the
City of <hi>Gallantry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gallantry</hi> is a City very magnificent; at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Gate you incounter <hi>Liberality,</hi> a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of great Wit, delicate Coversation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisance:
This Lady gives her Pasport to all that
enter, and without which, you cannot pass, or at
least, with great difficulty; and then too you pass
your time but very ill; and the more Pasports you
have, the better you are received from the fair In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
and pass your time more agreeable with
the fine Conversation you meet with in this City.
Love told me this, and it was therefore that I took
a great many Pasports from this acceptable Person
<hi>Liberality.</hi> But what renders you yet more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98886:22"/>
by the Fair and the Young who reside at
<hi>Gallantry,</hi> is, to have a delicate soft Wit, an assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
Address and a tender way of Conversing;
but that which best cullies and pleases the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of People there, is <hi>Liberality</hi> and <hi>Complisance:</hi>
This place of so great Divertisement is refrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all the Parties of the best and most amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Company, where they invent a thousand new
Pleasures every day; Feasting, Balls, Comedies,
and Sports, Singing and Serinads, are what em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
the whole Four and twenty hours.</p>
            <p>By the Virtue of my Pasports from <hi>Liberality,</hi> I
was introduced to all the fine Conversations and
Places that afford Pleasure and Delight: I had the
good Fortune to make Parties, insomuch, that I
was soon known to all the Company in the City,
and past the day in Feasting, going with the Young
and Fair to delightful <hi>Villa's,</hi> Gardens, or Rivers
in Chaces, and a thousand things that pleas'd; and
the Nights I passed in Serinading, so that I did
not give myself time for Melancholy; and yet for
all this I was wearied and fatigued; for when once
one has tasted of the Pleasure of Loving and being
Beloved, all, that comes after that, is but flat and
dull; and if one's Heart be not a little inflamed,
all things else are insignificant, and make but very
slight touches.</p>
            <p>I began therefore for all this to be extreamly Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green
and out of Humour, amid'st all these Pleasures,
till one lucky day I met with an Adventure, that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
my Heart with a tender flame which it had not
felt since my happy beginning one for <hi>Silvia:</hi> One
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98886:22"/>
day, as I said, I was conducted by my officious <hi>Cupid</hi>
into a Garden very beautiful, where there are a
thousand Labyrinths and Arbours, Walks, Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's,
Groves and Thickets; and where all the Fair
and the Gay resorted; 'twas here I incountred a
young Beauty called <hi>Bellinda;</hi> she was well made,
and had an admirable meen, an Air of Gayety and
Sweetness; but that which charmed me most of all,
was her Wit, which was too ingaging for me to
defend my Heart against: I found mine immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
submitting to her Conversation, and you
may imagine I did not part with her so long as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and good Manners permitted me to stay with
her, which was as long as any Company was in the
place; nor then, till by my importunity I had
gained so much upon her to suffer my Visits, which
she did with a Condescention that gave me abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of hope.</p>
            <p>I was no sooner gone, but my <hi>Cupid,</hi> who took
care of me, and entertained me to the best Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
carryed me that Evening to a Ball, where
there were a world of Beauties, among the rest
one fair as imagination can conceive; she had all
the Charmes of Youth and Beauty; though not so
much Wit and Air as <hi>Bellinda.</hi> To this young ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
I made my Court all the time I remained
there, and fancied I never found myself so Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I fancied all the Graces had taken up their
dwelling in her Divine Face; and that to subdue
one so fair and so innocent, must needs be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Pleasure: Yet did I not so wholly fix my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
on this lovely Person, but that the Wit of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98886:23"/>
               <hi>Bellinda</hi> shared my Heart with the Beauty and
Youth of <hi>Bellimante,</hi> so was this young Charmer
called: I was extreamly well pleas'd to find I could
a-new take fire; and infinitely more, when I found
I should not be subdued by one alone; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to dull Dotage on a single Beauty; but that I
was able to attain to the greatest Pleasure, that of
Loving two amiable Persons at once: If with two,
I hoped I might with Two score if I pleas'd and
had occasion; and though at first it seemed to be
very strange and improbable to feel a Passion for
two, yet I found it true, and could not determin
which I had the greatest tenderness for, or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to: But 'tis most certain, that this Night I
found, or thought I found, more for <hi>Bellimante,</hi>
who fired me with every Smile; I confess she wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Gayety of Spirit <hi>Bellinda</hi> had, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that fire she raised: And ever when I was
thoughtful a moment, <hi>Coquettre</hi> (who is ever in
all the Conversation, and where she appears very
magnificent and with a great Train,) would, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
sing softly in my Ear this Song, for she is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Galliard;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Cease to defend your Amorous Heart,</l>
               <l>Against a double flame;</l>
               <l>Where two may claim an equal Part</l>
               <l>Without reproach or shame.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98886:23"/>
'Tis Love that makes Life's happiness,</l>
               <l>And he that best wou'd live</l>
               <l>By Love alone must Life caress,</l>
               <l>And all his Darts receive.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <hi>Coquettre</hi> is a Person, that endeavours to please
and humour every Body, but of all those who eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day fill her Train, she caresses none with that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
and Assiduity as she did me, for I was a new
Face, to whom she is ever most obliging and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining.
However, notwithstanding the Advice
of <hi>Coquettre,</hi> I fancied this young Charmer had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
all my Soul; and while I gazed on her
Beauty, I thought on <hi>Bellinda</hi> no more; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
I should wholly devote myself to <hi>Bellimante,</hi>
whose Eyes alone seemed capable to inflame me.</p>
            <p>I took my leave with Sighs, and went home
extream well pleas'd with this days Adventure. All
this Night I slept as well as if no tenderness had
toucht my Heart, and though I Lov'd infinitely, it
gave me no disturbance; the next morning a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pleasant things <hi>Bellinda</hi> had said to me, came
into my mind, and gave me a new inclination to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
myself with that witty Beauty; and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
myself in haste with the desire I had to be with
her, I went again, the morning being very invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to the Garden, where before I had seen her,
and was so lucky to encounter her; I found her
blush at my approach; which I counted a good
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98886:24"/>
Omen of my future happiness; she received me
with all the Gayety and Joy good liking and Wit
could inspire: Nor was I backward on my part,
but addrest myself to her with all imaginable res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and as much Love in my Eyes as I was able
to put on; which, I found, she saw with Pleasure;
she had not entertained me half an hour, but I
was so absolutely charmed, that I forgot there was
a <hi>Bellaminte</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Thus for several days I lived; every day visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both these attracting Beauties, and at Night,
when I was retired, was not able to inform myself
which I liked best: Both were equally beloved,
and it was now, that methought I began to tast of
true Joy; I found myself in Love without any
sort of inquietude, when I was Melancholy, I went
to visit <hi>Bellinda,</hi> and she with her Gayety and
Wit would inspire me with good Humour; If I
were over-prest with good Company, and too
much Conversation and Noise, I would visit <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi>
who by a certain softness in her discourse, and
a natural Languishment in her Eyes and Manners,
charmed and calmed me to a reposed tranquillity;
so that to make me fortunate in Love, I could not
have fixed my desires better: I had too little Love
to be wretched, and enough to make my happiness
and Pleasure.</p>
            <p>After I had past my time a while thus in <hi>Coquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi>
this little <hi>Love,</hi> who was my Guide, carried
me to <hi>Declaration:</hi> I thought then upon the time
of my first Arrival on the <hi>Isle of Love;</hi> and how
<hi>Respect,</hi> that awful hinderer of our Pleasure, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98886:24"/>
me from going to this Place: I urg'd this
very argument <hi>Respect</hi> then made me, to my
<hi>Coquet</hi> Love now, who for answer return'd me
nothing but loud Laughter; and when I ask this
reason, he replyd, that <hi>Respect</hi> did not forbid any
to go to <hi>Declaration,</hi> but those only who knew
not how to behave themselves well there, and
who were not so well fashion'd and bred as they
ought to be, who go thither: And that it was a
mere cheat in <hi>Respect</hi> to conduct people to <hi>Love</hi>
by <hi>Discretion,</hi> that being much the farthest way
about, and under favor to Monsieur <hi>Respect</hi> he is
but a troublesome companion to a Lover, who
designs to cure those wounds the fair has given
him, and, if he have no better counsellor, he
may languish all his life without revealing the
secret of his soul to the object belov'd, and so
never find redress. But this Sir <hi>Formal, (Respect,</hi>
says <hi>Love,</hi>) is a very great favorite of the Lady's,
who is always in fee with them as a Jilt with a
Justice; who manages their Fools just as they
wou'd have 'em; for it is the most agreeable thing
in the World to them, and what the most feeds
their vanity, to see at their feet a thousand Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
sigh, burn, and languish; the fair are never
angry to find themselves belov'd, nor ever weary
of being Ador'd. I was extreamly pleas'd at this
frank Humour of my little Love who told me
this, and without much scruple or consideration
to <hi>Respect</hi> I follow'd him towards <hi>Declaration,</hi> and
in my way he gave me this Advice.</p>

            <p>By this time we were arriv'd to <hi>Declaration,</hi>
which is a very little Village, since it is only for
Passengers to pass thrô, and none live there, the
Country is very Perilous, and those that make a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98886:25"/>
false step run a great risque of falling from some
Precipice: Round about rises a very great mist,
and people have much ado to know each other;
of these mists there are two sorts: The one
on the side of <hi>Denial,</hi> the other on that of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi>
the first is very disagreeable and draws a
very ill consequence with it; the other directs
you to a place of intire divertisment, but I had
so good a guide that the entrance gave me no
trouble at all. When I came to the Village, I
found <hi>Bellimante,</hi> and <hi>Bellinda,</hi> to whom by turns
I told all my heart; and discover'd all its passion
or its tenderness which was to me much better.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>When to the charming <hi>Bellinda</hi> I came,</l>
               <l>With my heart full of Love and desire,</l>
               <l>To gain my wisht end I talkt of a flame,</l>
               <l>Of sighing, and dying, and sire,</l>
               <l>I swore to her charms that my soul did submit,</l>
               <l>And the slave was undone by the force of her Wit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To fair <hi>Bellimante</hi> the same tale I told,</l>
               <l>And I vow'd and I swore her fair Eyes</l>
               <l>No Heart-Ravisht mortal cou'd ever behold</l>
               <l>But he panting and languishing Dys,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98886:26"/>
And while I was vowing, the ardor of youth</l>
               <l>Made myself even believe what I swore was all truth.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I confess to you, my dear <hi>Lysander,</hi> that it was
a great while before I cou'd make myself be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by <hi>Bellinda,</hi> or gain any credit upon her
heart, she had a great deal of Wit and cou'd see
farther into the designs of her Lovers than those
who had not so much, or had had so many vows
pay'd them: I perceiv'd well enough, I was not
hated by her, and that she had not a heart whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insensible; so that I never quitted her till I had
gain'd so much upon her to accompany me to
<hi>Permission,</hi> where for some time we pass our days
very pleasantly; and having so good fortune with
<hi>Bellinda,</hi> I had now a great desire to try my
power over <hi>Bellimante:</hi> and where indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my expectation, I was not so happy:
But she went from me to <hi>Denial;</hi> and I was for
that hour oblig'd to return again to <hi>Bellinda,</hi> it
was some time I searcht her in vain, but at last found
her at a little Village, extreamly agreeable. There
are very few Inhabitants, but those that are live
in perpetual union, yet do not talk much, for
they understand one another with half words: A
sign of the Hand, the Head or the Eye, a glance
or smile is sufficient to declare a great part of the
Inclination. It is here where the Lover takes all
freedoms, without controul, and says and dos
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98886:26"/>
all that soft Love can permit: And every day
they take and give a secret Entertainment, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a particular Language, which every body
does not understand, and none but Lovers can
reply too, in effect, there are as many Languages as
persons.</p>
            <p>The Governess of this Village is very charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those that are acquainted with her; and
as disagreeable to those that are not; she is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a great deal of Wit, and knows all things.
She has a thousand ways to make herself under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and comprehends all in a moment, that you
wou'd or can say to her.</p>
            <p>In this place, to divert, we make a thousand
pretty sorts of Entertainments; and we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Artifices, which signify nothing,
and yet they serve to make life Agreeable and
Pleasant.</p>
            <p>'Twas thus I liv'd at <hi>Intelligence;</hi> when I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that <hi>Bellimante</hi> was retir'd to <hi>Cruelty.</hi> This
news afflicted me extreamly, but I was not now
of a humour to swell the Floods with my tears,
or increase the rude winds with my ruder sighs;
to tear my hair and beat my Innocent breast as I
us'd in my first Amount to do. However I was
so far concern'd, that I made it my business not
to lose this insensible fair one, but making her a
visit in spight of her retreat, I reproacht her with
cruelty.</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98886:27"/>
               <l>Why, fair Maid, are you uneasy,</l>
               <l>When a slave designs to please you;</l>
               <l>When he at your feet is lying</l>
               <l>Sighing, languishing, and dying?</l>
               <l>Why do you preserve your charms</l>
               <l>Only for offensive Armes?</l>
               <l>What the Lover wou'd possess</l>
               <l>You maintain but to oppress.</l>
               <l>Cease, fair Maid, your cruel sway,</l>
               <l>And let your Lover dy a nobler way.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Who the Devil wou'd not believe me as much
in love now as I ever was with <hi>Silvia:</hi> My heart had
learn'd then all the soft Language of Love which
now it cou'd prattle as naturally as its Mother
Tongue; and sighing and dying was as ready for
my mouth as when it came from my very heart;
and cost me nothing to speak; Love being as
cheaply made now by me as a barter for a Horse
or a Coach; and with as little concern almost:
It pleas'd me while I was speaking, and while I
believ'd I was gaining the vanity and pleasure of
a conquest over an unvanquisht heart. However
I cou'd yet perceive no Grist come to my Mill;
no heart to my Lure; young as it was, it had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98886:27"/>
a cunning that was harder to deceive than all
<hi>Bellinda's</hi> Wit: And seeing her persist still in her
Resolution I left her with a heart, whose pride
more than Passion resented the obduratness of this
Maid, I went as well compos'd however as I cou'd
to <hi>Intelligence;</hi> and found even some pleasure in
the cruelty and charming resistance of <hi>Bellimante,</hi>
since I propos'd to myself an infinite happyness
in softning a heart so averse to Love, and which
I knew I shou'd compel to yeild some time or
other with very little pains and force.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh! what Pleasure 'tis to find</l>
               <l>A coy heart melt by slow degrees;</l>

               <l>Yet her fear a ruin sees.</l>
               <l>When her tears do kindly flow,</l>
               <l>And her sighs do come and goe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh! how charming tis, to meet</l>
               <l>Soft resistance from the fair;</l>
               <l>When her pride and wishes meet</l>
               <l>And by turns increase her care.</l>
               <l>Oh! how charming 'tis to know,</l>

               <l>When confus'd 'twixt Love and Shame,</l>
               <l>Still refusing (though she burn,)</l>
               <l>The soft pressures of my Flame.</l>
               <l>Her Pride in her denyal lies,</l>
               <l>And mine is in my Victories.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I feigned nevertheless abundance of Grief to
find her-still persist in her rigorous Cruelty; and I
made her believe, that all my absent hours I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
myself to sorrows and despairs; though
<hi>Love</hi> knows I parted with all those things in <hi>Silia's</hi>
Arms. But whatever I pretend, to appear at <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi>
and before <hi>Bellimante;</hi> at <hi>Intelligence</hi> I was all
Galliard and never in better Humour in my Life
than when I went to visit <hi>Bellinda:</hi> I put on the
Gravity of a Lover, and beheld her with a Solemn
Languishing Look: In fine, I accustomed myself
to counterfeit my Humour, whenever I found it
convenient for my Advantage: Tears, Vows, and
Sighs cost me nothing, and I knew all the Arts to
jilt for Love, and could act the dying Lover,
whenever it made for my Satisfaction.</p>

He that wou'd precious time improve,</l>
            <l>And husband well his hours,</l>
            <l>Let him complain and dye for Love,</l>
            <l>And spare no Sighs or Showers.</l>
            <l>To second which, let Vows and Oaths</l>

            <p>In fine, after I had sufficiently acted the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Lover, for the accomplishment of all my
Wishes, I thought it time to change the Scene,
and without having recourse to Pity, I followed
all the Counsels of my <hi>Cupid;</hi> who told
me, that in stead of dying and whining at her Feet,
and damning myself to obtain her Grace, I should
affect a Coldness, and an Unconcern; for, <hi>Lycidus,</hi>
assure yourself, said he, there is nothing a Woman
will not do, rather than lose her Lover either
from Vanity or Inclination. I thanked <hi>Love</hi> for
his kind Advice; and to persue it, the next day I
drest myself in all the Gayety imaginable: My
Eyes, my Air, my Language, were all changed;
and thus fortified with all the put-on indifference
in the World, I made <hi>Bellimante</hi> a Visit; and after
a thousand things all cold and unconcerned, far
from Love or my former Softness, I cried laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <l>The Slave has broke his Servial Chains,</l>
               <l>And spight of all your Pride is free</l>

            <lg>
               <l>I must confess you're wondrous fair,</l>

               <l>Is worth an Age of sad despair,</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98886:29"/>
But you're unjust as well as fair,</l>
               <l>And Love subsists not with despair,</l>
               <l>No more than Lovers by the Air.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I've spar'd no Sighs nor Floods of Tears,</l>
               <l>Nor any thing to move your Mind,</l>
               <l>With sacred Vows I sed your Cares;</l>
               <l>But found your rebel Heart unkind,</l>
               <l>And Vanity had made you blind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>No more my Knees shall bow before</l>
               <l>Those unconcern'd and haughty Eyes,</l>
               <l>Nor be so sensless to adore</l>
               <l>That Saint, that all my Prayers despise:</l>
               <l>No, I contemn your Cruelty</l>
               <l>Since in a Humor not to dye.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Having said all this with an Air of Disdain, I,
smiling, took my leave, with much less Civility
and Respect than I used to do; and hasting to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,</hi>
I past my time very well with <hi>Bellinda,</hi>
to whom I paid all my Visits, and omitted nothing
that might make <hi>Bellimante</hi> know I had forgot her:
But at the end of some days by a very happy change,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98886:30"/>
she finding more inclination to Love than to Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
banishing all Obstacles in Favour of a Lover,
she came to <hi>Intelligence;</hi> where at first sight she
made me some little Reproaches, and that in so
soft a manner, that I did not doubt but I had toucht
her Heart: I swore a thousand times, that all I had
done, was only put on to see if it were possible
she could resent it, and force from her Heart some
little concern for my supposed loss. At this time I
had abundance of Intreagues upon my hands, for
it was not with <hi>Bellinda</hi> and <hi>Bellimante,</hi> with whom
I lived in this manner; and indeed it is impossible
to remain at <hi>Intelligence</hi> and to make a Court but
to two Persons only, where there are so many of the
Fair and the Young. I writ every day several Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets;
and received every day as many: I had every
day two or three Rendezvous; and one ought to
manage matters very discreetly, that neither Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
might come to the knowledge of the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern;
and one ought to be a Man of great Address
and Subtilty to love more than one securely; and
though this gave me some pain, it was nevertheless
an <hi>Ambaras</hi> very agreeable, and in which I could
have lived a great while; if Envy, which cannot
suffer any Body to be happy in <hi>Intelligence,</hi> had
not arrived there and told a great many things
which discovered my Intreagues; so that <hi>Bellinda,</hi>
with whom I had lived there with great Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a long time, and <hi>Bellimante,</hi> with whom I was
but just beginning to be happy, were both obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to quit this delightful place, where we enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so many happy hours; and they retired till the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98886:30"/>
noise was a little over; and with them all those
who had afforded me any hope: If any one of
these had stayed, I had been contented well enough
and one might have consol'd me for the loss of the
other, but in one day to lose all that made my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
put me into such a Melancholy, I knew not
for the present what to do for myself; but <hi>Coquet
Love</hi> conducted me to a Village, that gave a me new
Pleasure: The scituation of it is marvellous, the
Fields and the Groves all about it the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in the World; the Meadows enamel'd with
Rivulets, which run winding here and there, and
lose themselves in the Thickets and the Woods.
In going, <hi>Love</hi> said to me: In absence it is in vain to
abandon yourself to sorrow. Alas! What signifies
it to sigh night and day; the Absent does not hear
us; nor can the most tender Affliction or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
render a Lover happy, unless the Fair One
were present to hear all his Moans, then perhaps
they might avail. There was reason in what he
said, and I was pleas'd and calm'd; and we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the same time at this Village: All the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were fine, and pleasant, we saw all the Graces
there by Fountains and by Flowery Springs, and
all the Objects that could be imagined agreeable;
and the least amiable ones, we saw, gave us a Joy!
All the World that inhabit there contribute to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
and this place is called <hi>Amusement:
Amusement</hi> is a young Boy, who stops and gazes at
every thing that meets his Eyes, and he makes his
Pleasure with every Novelty.</p>
            <p>As soon as I arrived at this Village I thought to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98886:31"/>
divert myself, as others did; and to hinder my
Thoughts from fixing on the loss of my two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
and to banish from my mind the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grins
their Absence gave me; withdrawn from
the fair Eyes of <hi>Bellimante,</hi> and the Charming
Wit of <hi>Bellinda,</hi> and to give my sighing Heart a
little case; upon a thousand Objects I formed my
desires, and took a thousand Pleasures to divert
my Melancholy: And all the time I lived at this
dear place, I passed my time without any inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
for every day afforded me new Objects to
give me new Wishes. And I now expected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much impatience, the return of <hi>Bellinda</hi> and
<hi>Bellimante;</hi> nor did I tire myself with writing to
'em every day; and when I did write, to save the
expence of thought, the same Billet served both;
a thousand little tender things I said of course to
both: And somtimes, especially while I was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
I thought I had rather have seen them than
have lived at <hi>Amusemcnt,</hi> but since it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they should be absent, I bore it with all the
Patience I could; somtimes we were in a fit
of writing very regularly to one another, but on
a sudden I received no Letters at all; the reason
of this was, they both understood I lived at <hi>Amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and had retired themselves to the Palace of
<hi>Spight:</hi> I no sooner received this News, but I
rendered myself there also; it is a place where
there is alwaies abundance of Tumult, Outrage,
Quarrels and Noise: And <hi>Spight</hi> is a Person who
eternally gives occasion of Discontent and Broil;
causing People often to fall out with those they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98886:31"/>
love most, and to caress those they hate: But
the Quarrels she occasions us with those we love,
last but a very short season, and Love reconciles
those differences that <hi>Spight</hi> obliges us to make:
Thô 'tis somtime pleasant enough to see those we
Love extreamly, and violently, fall into the highest
rage, and say a thousand things injurious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
and to swear all the Oaths that angry
Love and Fury can inspire, never to see or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with one another again, and in a moment
after to grow calm, weep, and reunite; to be
perjured on both sides, and become more fond
than ever they were.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>A Lovers Rage and Jealousie</l>
               <l>One short moment do's confess:</l>
               <l>How can they long angry be</l>
               <l>Whose Hearts are full of tenderness?</l>
            </lg>
            <p>In this Place there wou'd be eternal War, but for
a person who inhabits there, and is always the
Mediator for Peace, tis he that assists to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
and bring the Lovers together. This is a
very honest person, call'd <hi>Right Vnderstanding,</hi> he
brought me to <hi>Bellinda,</hi> whom I found accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with a Man that made her a thousand ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses,
at my approach she made as if she knew
me not, which I took in such disdain, that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
myself to <hi>Spight,</hi> with a design to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
on this Haughty scorner. In this humour
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98886:32"/>
I made a visit to <hi>Bellimante</hi> but found her as
Implacable as <hi>Bellinda,</hi> whom no excuses, no
reason, cou'd reduce to the temper I had once
seen her; in a rage, ten times more than I was
before, fill'd with disdain and revenge I complain'd
of this treatment to my little <hi>Love,</hi> who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
led me into a Grove, where the Beauties
and the Graces us'd to walk, to consult upon
what return to make for my affront; from one
place to another we past on till we came to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Thicket, on the other side of which, by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Rivulet we cou'd hear, but not see, two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
discoursing, they were women, and one seemed
in a violent Rage against her Lover, who had
newly offended her, whilst the other strove in
vain to reconcile her, but she went on, vowing
to revenge herself with the next object she shou'd
Incounter that had but Wit, Youth, and fortune
enough to Justifie her Love, and make her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
glorious; her resolution agreeing so with
mine, and her manner of speaking, gave me new
hope and pleasure, and a great curiosity to see her
face; I found by her Resentment she was young
and of Quality, and that alone was enough to
make me resolve upon Addressing myself to her,
and the other person had no sooner left her, but I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards her, with as good a grace as I cou'd
put on, she was a little surprised, and blushing at
first, but I soon reconcil'd her to my conversation.
I found her handsom enough to ingage me, and
she was as well pleased with me as I was with her,
both having the same design which was that of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98886:32"/>
revenge, and you may Imagin, our business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same, our entertainment was not at first
extraordinary, but as my cause of Anger was more
reasonable than hers, I began to find myself to
soften into liking of this new fair one, who was
called <hi>Cemena,</hi> and who, to spight her former
Lover, endeavor'd to be seen with me in all the
publick places she cou'd, which gave him Infinite
torments of Jealousie. One day as I was walking
with this <hi>Cemena</hi> in a place where the young and
the fair frequent, <hi>Bellinda</hi> and <hi>Bellimante</hi> often
passed by us, and saw us both well pleas'd and
in good humour, I cou'd perceive their colour
goe and come, and that they were as uneasy at
this object, as my heart cou'd wish, and by their
quitting of the place immediatly after, I was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of all my hope, and believed I had gained
my Point; at the end of two or three days, one
Morning walking alone in the same place I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered
<hi>Bellimante,</hi> who hapned to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with her Woman onely, she chang'd colour
at my approach, and wou'd have passed me by
but I stay'd her by the Robe; and said a thousand
things to her that angry Love inspir'd me with,
while she on her side did the same, till we had
talk'd ourselves by degrees into reason, and good
understanding. I found her Resentment to be only
the excess of Love, and all those faults are easily
forgiven, I immediatly threw myself at her Feet,
and made her a thousand protestations of my
fidelity, and she, in her turn, excused herself
with all the tenderness imaginable, she made me
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98886:33"/>
a thousand new vowes and caresses and forgot
nothing that might persuade me, that all she did
was by the Counsel of <hi>Spight.</hi>

               <l>Oh! how soft it is to see</l>

               <l>How unjust are all our fears;</l>

               <l>Wiping from our Eyes the tears.</l>
               <l>And a thousand Favors pay</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98886:33"/>
I found this accommodement extreamly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and it was in these transports the Lovely
<hi>Bellimante</hi> detain'd me for some days without quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, but I found too much Joy in a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
not to endeavor to make one also with
<hi>Bellinda;</hi> as soon then as <hi>Bellimante</hi> grew a little
off my heart by so long a conversation with one
and the same Woman, I, on pretence of some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
left her extreamly charm'd and satisfi'd, and
hasted to <hi>Bellinda,</hi> who, methought, was now a
new Beauty; at least I found her too consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to lose the Glory of ingaging her intirely;
tis possible that both these Ladys, being agitated
with as little faith as myself, deceiv'd me with the
same design I did them, to make their pleasure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and thô this very often came into my thoughts,
yet it gave me no great inquietude, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembl'd
well, and I cou'd not see it, I had the
satisfaction and the vanity of 'em, that was as much
as I desir'd from any of the fair since <hi>Silvia</hi> toucht
my heart, they both swore they lov'd and both
fear'd to displease, if they were unfaithful they
had a thousand stratagems to hide their infidelity,
and took a great deal of care to keep me, which
shew'd a value in me above all the rest of my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
and I beheld myself with some Pride and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
for having so much power; when ever they
offended me they had all the Arts to mollify me,
and who wou'd be so critically in love as not to
be willing to be so well abus'd? For my part, I
will not be so nice, as to penetrat into their
thoughts, to find what wou'd but displease me if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98886:34"/>
found; but content myself with all I see and find
that looks like Love at least and good humour.
Nay even in their worst I find a thousand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
those of their quarrels which somtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
twenty times a day, when every reconciliation
is like a new Mistress, so well they strive to please
and be reconcil'd.</p>
            <p>But all these pleasures did not satisfy me, there
were greater yet behind which I had not arriv'd
to with these fair charmers, and however I liv'd
at <hi>Amusement,</hi> making a thousand Amours with a
hundred of the most Beautiful, still I had a desire
to subdue intirely to my pleasure these two the
most hard to gain, but now I was pretty well se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
of both their hearts and yet neither knew,
they were each others Rivals in mine. They knew
one another, converst, and play'd and walkt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
yet so discreet I was in this Amour that
neither was jealous of the other, nor suspected
I lov'd both with an equal Ardor; when I hapned to
be with 'em both I carried myself so equally Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
that both commended my conduct and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
I did it to hide the secret passion I had for
herself, and so many little Arts my Coquet love had
taught me I cou'd with ease manage abundance
of intregues at one and the same time.</p>
            <p>But as I said, this did not suffice, nor cou'd the
fires, that some more willing Beauties allay'd, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from wishing and burning and persuing
those two fair persons with an Ardor that had no
appearance of decay from any others goodness to
me, but in my daily visits to'em, I eternally so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98886:34"/>
them to suffer me to accompany them to
that charming place call'd <hi>Favors,</hi> which is a very
Beautiful Castle rais'd in a Vally. I confest to
you that my <hi>Coquet Cupid</hi> advis'd me not to go,
for fear of attaching myself too much to a place
so extreamly agreeable; the Mountains, that inviron
this Castle, are very high and full of hollow
Rocks, which made the scituation very sullen. The
Castle itself was delicately built, and surrounded
with tall Trees, so thick that one cou'd hardly see
the Edifice, nor cou'd the Sun-bearns dart throw
the gloomy shade; and eternal Night seem'd to
sit there in awful state and pleasure: For the more
obscure this place is and secret from all Eyes, the
better and more acceptable it is to all that enter
there, and thô this Vally have many inhabitants,
it appears to have none at all; because they love
solitude, and, banishing all Publick society, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves only to be but two in company
together, if there be more they are receiv'd with
a very ill welcome, for a third Person in this place
wou'd destroy the Pleasure and the harmony.
The Inhabitants of this Castle never shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
but to those that are very importune, and then
not every day, the Ladies that command there
are many Sisters all of the name of the Castle;
and all very fair, and still one more fair than the
other, and when you visit'em you see'em not all
at once but by degrees and the last you behold
is the fairest, and by the pleasure you have in
seeing one, you desire to see'em all. For there are
no limits to be given to desire, and as they are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98886:35"/>
never seen by any body altogether, it happens
very often that you see but one, and you must
have address and great assiduity, abstinence, and
good fortune to obtain one of these <hi>Favors;</hi> but
the last will cost you much more trouble than all
the rest put together, so very fair, so very nice
and coy she is: But when once obtain'd she brings
you to the Palace of intire Pleasure; which is
neighbouring to the Castle of <hi>Favors;</hi> but I, who
wou'd very fain, at once, have brought to this
delicate place both <hi>Bellinda</hi> and <hi>Bellimante,</hi> found
myself extream uneasy, because, as I said, only two
can be well entertain'd at a time! I found it against
my humour and against the advice of <hi>Love</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
all, and retire with one only, for in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and good manners, those, who go to this
Castle of <hi>Favors,</hi> are oblig'd to continue there
some time; and I found, I shou'd be extreamly
shagrin after a little while with one alone; but
both were obstinate and wou'd not suffer a third:
and having been so very importune with both, I
was asham'd to repent and recant all those things
I had said, to persuade them to go, thô in my
heart I was very ill satisfi'd I had not persu'd the
counsel, <hi>Love</hi> had given me not to go to <hi>Favors</hi>
at all; he soreseeing an inconveniencie in such
a retreat, which I, with all my young desires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
me and fond of novelty, c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u'd not, so well
as he, diseern, however I had propos'd it with some
ardency and wou'd not go back, but resov'd to
make the best advantage of my voyage, and wou'd
not declare my regreet till I cou'd no longer hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98886:35"/>
it: So that <hi>Bellimante,</hi> yeilding to my Implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
consented next day to go with me to this
retreat of <hi>Favors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the next morning we set out for
this amiable place; where we arrived, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
myself all alone, without interruption or fear,
with this very fair Creature, I advanced to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
Freedoms which she, with some resistance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me to take: I was all Joy and Transport at
every advance, and still the nearer I approached
to the last Favour, the more blest I imagined my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
I grew more resolved, and she more feeble:
and at last, I was the Victor and <hi>Bellimante</hi> the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim;
I remained some days with her, and one
would have imagined I should have been intirely
happy in this place with one so young and fair:
But behold the fickleness of Youth, and Man's
nature.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Thô my Heart were full of Passion,</l>
               <l>And I found the yeilding Maid</l>
               <l>Give a loose to inclination</l>
               <l>While her Love her Flame betray'd;</l>
               <l>Yet thô all she did impart,</l>
               <l>Pain and Anguish prest my Heart.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98886:36"/>
Thô I found her all o'r Charming,</l>
               <l>Fond and sighing in my Arms;</l>
               <l>Yet my Heart a-new was warming</l>
               <l>For <hi>Bellinda</hi>'s unknown Charms;</l>
               <l>Thought, if Beauty pleas'd me so,</l>
               <l>What must Wit and Beauty too?</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And though next day I found myself an hundred
times more in Love with <hi>Bellimante</hi> than before,
yet unless I could possess <hi>Bellinda</hi> too, I thought
myself miserable: Yet every time she charmed me
a-new I was upon the point of renouncing eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Bellinda,</hi> and sacrificing her to my Passion for
<hi>Bellimante:</hi> But I did not remain long in that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
but every day grew more and more unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in that point; and as <hi>Bellimante</hi> grew more
fond I grew more cold; not but I had learnt to say
so many kind and soft things in the time of my real
Passion with <hi>Silvia,</hi> that I found it easie to speak
every day such endearing Words as gave her no
doubt of my Heart; nor was willing she should
see to the bottom of it, where she would most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have found <hi>Bellinda;</hi> yet with such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Passion for herself, that it would have been
hard to have distinguished, which had had the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant
there; only my desire at present was the
most considerable for the fair Object I had not yet
possest, and whom I long'd to Vanquish; perhaps,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98886:36"/>
as much for the Glory, as the Pleasure, though my
Heart did not at this moment think so.</p>
            <p>After some time that I had lived here with <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi>
I made some pretext to leave her for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while; she, who was extreamly charmed with
that Solitude, resolved to wait there my return,
so that I had some pain in contriving how I should
bring <hi>Bellinda</hi> to the same Castle as I wished to do;
but it had in it many Mansions and Apartments,
and, as I said, so retired from one another, that
it was difficult to come at any time together or to
meet: This consideration made me resolved, and
very pressing with <hi>Bellinda,</hi> to go to this place,
assuring her of such Diversion as she never met
with in any other part of the World: She loved
and was not long in persuading, and I had the
Glory to conduct her in spight of all her Wit and
Gayety, to this retreat of Solitude with me; where,
unperceived, I obliged her to render me all that
Love could allow, and more than Honour would
permit: And I was for some days extreamly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and possibly had continued so, (going from
one Apartment to another, and, like the Great Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
visiting by turns my Beauties,) had not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
fate prevented my Grandeur and Pleasure.</p>
            <p>It hapned one day that I had sued a repetition
of Favours from <hi>Bellinda;</hi> she seeming resolved
to grant me no more, repenting of those I had
taken, and with a charming Sorrow reproaching
me, making me a thousand times more pressing
than before: At last her force growing weaker,
her denials fainter, and my importunities more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98886:37"/>
I found her yeilding, the Lilly in her Face
gave place to the Roses, and Love and Trembling
made her Eyes more fair, and just ready to render
me all. We saw approaching us <hi>Bellimante,</hi> who,
having heard how I sometimes past my hours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to surprise me in my perfidie; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
found us in a gloomy Arbour with all the
Transports of Love in both our Faces, which it
was too late to resettle and hide from this too sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and jealous fair One: In vain I strove with all
the Arguments of Love and Tenderness to appease
her, or, if by any thing I said, I found her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to pardon me, on the other side it but served
to incense and inrage <hi>Bellinda,</hi> to whom I had
made equal Vows (at her coming to that place,)
of eternal Fidelity. I am not able to express to
you, my dear <hi>Lysander,</hi> what confusion I found
myself in, I divided my Heart and my Intreaties
between 'em, and knew not to which I most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
meant 'em; I was very sensible, that while
I treated both with equal Love and Respect, that
I should gain neither, and yet if what I said to
both had been addrest to any one of 'em, it would
have prevailed; and I found it easie to have kept
either, if I would resolve to quit the other; but
my heart not inclining to that, or if it wou'd,
not knowing which I shou'd chuse, made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
between 'em both the most out-of-countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
coxcomb, that ever was taken in the cheats of
Love, while both were on either side reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me with all the malice and noise imaginable,
so that not being able longer to endure the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98886:37"/>
clamour, I took my flight from 'em both, and ran
with all the force I cou'd to a Village call'd <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;</hi>
and where <hi>Coquet Love</hi> abandon'd me
saying that place was not proper for him.</p>
            <p>The Houses of this Village are for the most part
not half built, but all appears very desolate and
ruinous: It appertains to a Lady very fantastique
of the same name. She maks a Figure pleasant
enough, she never dresses herself, because she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
determin what habit to put on; she is ever
tormenting herself, still turning to this side and
to that, yet never stirs from the place, because
undetermin'd she knows not whither nor which
way to go: And having so many in her mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to go to neither; one always sees an Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in her Eyes, that keeps them in perpetual
motion and fixt on nothing. You see her perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
perplext with a thousand designs in her head
at once, but puts none of them in execution.</p>
            <p>I found myself in this place Ambarassed with
a thousand confusions and thoughts, for <hi>Bellinda</hi>
and <hi>Bellimante</hi> had equally shar'd my soul, and I
knew not for which I shou'd declare; nor whether
the Wit and extream good Humour of the first were
more powerful upon my heart, than the Beauty
and softness of the last, so that I was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to determin which I shou'd quit, having the
same sentiments for one as for the other, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to abandon both rather than content myself
with one: And the fear of losing one was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of my losing both, in fine I was in the most
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98886:38"/>
cruel incertainty in the World. And I cou'd not
forbear saying a thousand times to myself,</p>
            <l>When <hi>Love</hi> shall two fair objects mix,</l>
            <l>And in the Heart two passions fix:</l>
            <l>'Tis a pleasure too severe,</l>
            <l>Cruel Joy we cannot bear.</l>
            <l>Too much Love for two I own,</l>
            <l>But too little flame for one.</l>
            <p>While I was thus perplext betwixt these two vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
passions, when no reason cou'd resolve me
which to choose, as I was one day meditating what
to do in this extreamity, a Woman presented her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to me, whose Beauty was infinitely transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all I had ever beheld; she had a noble and
Majestick meen, a most Divine Air, and her
charms cast so great a Lustre that I was dazl'd with
Gazing on her; she struck me with so profound
a respect at the first sight of her Glory's, that I
cou'd not forbear throwing myself at her feet,
imploring I might be eternally permitted to Adore
her; and to become her slave. When raising
me from the ground, and looking on me with
Eyes more Majestick than kind, she said to me
in a loud voyce.</p>

Those words, repeated to me with an Air
haughty and imperious, toucht me to the very
Soul, and made me blush a thousand times with
shame to behold myself in that ridiculous state, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
reduc'd to the same tenderness for <hi>Bellinda</hi>
and <hi>Bellimante</hi> I had before had for <hi>Silvia;</hi> but
I soon found my error and in an instant became
more in Love with Glory than I had ever been
in my life. Insomuch that I resolv'd to leave
<hi>Irresolution</hi> and follow her. I confess at first it
gave my heart som little pain to withdraw and
disingage it from so long and so fond a custom,
and I was more than once forc'd to parly thus
with my imtractable and stubborn heart.</p>

               <l>Oh! fond remembrance! do not bring</l>
               <l>False notions to my easy heart.</l>
               <l>And make the foolish tender thing</l>
               <l>Think, that with Love it cannot part;</l>
               <l>Or dy when e're the charming God</l>
               <l>Forsak's his old and kind abode.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thou, my heart, be calm and Pleas'd,</l>
               <l>For better hours thou now shalt see,</l>
               <l>Of all thy Anxious torments eas'd</l>
               <l>From all thy toyles and slavery free,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98886:39"/>
From Beauties Pride and peevish scorns</l>
               <l>From Wits Intregueing false returns.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Tis Honour now thou shalt persue,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>Thus, my dear <hi>Lysander,</hi> following Glory, I
soon arriv'd at the extent of the Island of <hi>Love,</hi>
and there I incounter'd a thousand Beauties, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
Graces and Agreements; all which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd
a new, but in vain, to engage me. I past
by 'em all without any regard only sight, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
'em with the remembrance, how once the
meanest of those Beauties wou'd have charmd me.
I lookt back on all those happy shades, who had
been conscious of my softest pleasures, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times I sighing bid'em farwel, the Rivers,
Springs and Fountains had my wishes that they
might still be true and favor Lovers, as they had
a thousand times done me. These dear remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance,
you may believe, stay'd some time with
me, yet I wou'd not for an Empire have return'd
to 'em again, nor have liv'd that life over a new
I had so long and with so much pleasure persu'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98886:40"/>
After this I took a Vessel and put off from that
shore, where, thô I had met with many Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
I had also receiv'd a thousand joys: While
it was in view I found myself toucht with some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
but being fail'd out of sight of it, I sigh'd
no more, but bid adieu to fond Love for ever.</p>

                  <l>While Love did the occasion take</l>
                  <l>And hid beneath his flowres a snake</l>

               </head>
               <l>AH wretched Man! whom neither fate can please</l>
               <l>Nor Heavens indulgent to his wish can bless,</l>
               <l>Desire torments him, or fruition cloys,</l>
               <l>Fruition which shou'd make his bliss, destroys;</l>
               <l>Far from our Eyes th' inchanting objects set</l>
               <l>Advantage by the friendly distance get.</l>
               <l>Fruition shews the cheat, and views 'em near,</l>
               <l>Then all their borrow'd splendours plain appear,</l>
               <l>And we what with much care we gain and skill</l>
               <l>An empty nothing find, or real ill.</l>
               <l>Thus disappointed, our mistaken thought,</l>
               <l>Not finding satisfaction which it sought</l>
               <l>Renews its search, and with much toyl and pain</l>
               <l>Most wisely strives to be deceiv'd again.</l>

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:98886:104"/>Hurried by our fantastick wild desire</l>
               <l>We loath the present, absent things admire,</l>

               <l>And those enjoy'd we think wou'd quench the flame</l>
               <l>In vain, the Ambitious feaver still returns</l>
               <l>And with redoubled fire more fiercely burns.</l>
               <l>Our boundless vast desires can know no rest,</l>
               <l>But travel forward still and labour to be blest.</l>
               <l>Philosophers and Poets strove in vain</l>
               <l>The restless anxious Progress to restrain,</l>
               <l>And to their loss soon found their Good supream</l>
               <l>An Airy notion and a pleasing Dream.</l>
               <l>For happiness is no where to be found,</l>
               <l>But flys the searcher, like enchanted ground.</l>
               <l>Are we then masters or the slaves of things?</l>
               <l>Poor wretched vassalls, or terrestial Kings?</l>
               <l>Left to our reason, and by that betray'd,</l>
               <l>We lose a present bliss to catch a shade.</l>

               <byline>[by <hi>Damon:</hi> Nouem. 78.]</byline>
               <l>I Never knew what 'twas to mourn,</l>
               <l>Ere the too hasty glass had run</l>
               <l>Which measur'd every thought of mine:</l>
               <l>Still as I offer'd at Loves shrine</l>
               <l>My heart a bleeding Sacrifice,</l>
               <l>The conquest of <hi>Aminta</hi>'s Eyes.</l>
               <l>Those shining objects of my Love,</l>
               <l>How did the searching passion rove,</l>
               <l>O're all my soul its quickning fire</l>
               <l>Melted my heart with soft desire,</l>
               <l>While my <hi>Aminta</hi> blest this plain,</l>
               <l>I never felt another pain</l>
               <l>Than Love; which always do's belong</l>
               <l>To the gentle Amorous throng;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:98886:120"/>But now—</l>
               <l>Oh! wonder not, great God of Love,</l>
               <l>If the strong passion cease to move</l>
               <l>Within my soul; <hi>Aminta</hi>'s gone,</l>
               <l>And left me here to sigh alone.</l>
               <l>How vain do's the vast Globe appear</l>
               <l>No sweetning pleasures can live here,</l>
               <l>While bright <hi>Aminta</hi> is not neer.</l>
               <l>No warbling notes which fill the Wood,</l>
               <l>Nor murmurs which the streams afford,</l>
               <l>Can raise in me that harmony</l>
               <l>Which ravisht with such extasie.</l>
               <l>When the fair she approacht, each charm</l>
               <l>Guarded my humble soul from harm,</l>
               <l>Nothing can now transport or cheer</l>
               <l>A tortur'd soul that's fill'd with fear;</l>
               <l>Since lov'd <hi>Aminta</hi> quits the place,</l>
               <l>Which she with Innocence did Grace.</l>
               <l>Then will I wander to some Grove</l>
               <l>Where I'le lament my absent Love,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:98886:120"/>And with cold Winter still complain</l>
