            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of those that feare thee, and the onely
rest of those that prize thee; In respect of which
the transitory pleasures of the world are lesse
then nothing, in comparison of which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
wisdome of the world is folly, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the earth but drosse, and dung; How dare
my boldnesse thus presume to presse into thy

but thy just wrath and heavy indignation?
O what returne can the tainted breath of my pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
lipps deserve, but to bee bound hand and
foot, and cast into the flames of Hell? But
Lord, the merits of my Saviour are greater then
the offences of a sinner, and the sweetnesse of
thy mercy exceeds the sharpnesse of my mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
The horrour of thy judgments have seized
upon mee, and I languish through the sense of
thy displeasure; I have forsaken thee the rest
of my distressed soule, and set my affections
upon the vanitie of the deceitfull world. I
have taken pleasure in my foolishnesse, and
have vaunted my selfe in mine iniquitie, I have
flattered my soule with the hony of delights,
whereby I am made sensible of the sting of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61359:11"/>
my affliction; wherefore I loath, and utterly
abhorre my selfe, and from the bottome of my
heart repent in dust and ashes. Behold O Lord,
I am impure and vile, and have wallowed in
the puddle of mine owne Corruptions; The
Sword of thy displeasure is drawne out against
mee, and what shall I plead O thou preserver
of mankind? Make mee a new Creature O my
God, and destroy the old man within mee. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
my affections from the love of transitory
things, that I may runne the way of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
Turne away mine eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
vanitie, and make thy Testimonies my
whole delight Give me strength to discerne the
emptinesse of the creature, and inebriate my
heart with the fulnesse of thy joyes. Bee thou
my portion O God, at whose right hand stand
pleasures for evermore. Bee thou my refuge and
my shield, and suffer me not to sinke under the
corruptions of my heart; let not the house of
mirth beguile mee, but give mee a sense of the
evill to come. Accept the free-will offerings of
my mouth, and grant my petitions for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of thy Name, then will I magnifie thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
O God, and praise thy Name for ever and

more uncapable of thy indignation? There is
nothing in mee to move thy mercy but in
misery. Thy goodnesse is thy selfe, and hath

Touch thou my conscience with the feare of

spirit of meeknesse, and teach mee to overcome
evill with a patient heart: moderate and curb
the exorbitances of my passion, and give mee
temperate use of all thy creatures. Replenish
my heart with the Graces of thy Spirit, that
in all my wayes I may bee acceptable in thy

minde, and upon all occasions grant mee a
gratefull heart, that honoring thee here in
the Church militant before men, I may bee
glorified hereafter in the Church Triumphant

glory according to the measure of Grace thou

Angels and Archangels praise thy Name for

high Rebellion; I have turn'd thy blessings

wantonnesse: Yet hast thou been my God even
from the very wombe, and didst sustaine mee
when I hung upon my mothers breast: Thou
hast washed mee O Lord from my pollution,
but like a Swine I have returned to my mire.
Thou hast glaunced into my breast the blessed

been partners in my sinne, and turne their

               <p>MOst great and most glorious God, who for
the sinne of our first parents hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
our fraile bodies to the punishment of
labour, and hast commanded every one a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and a Trade of life, that hatest idlenesse as
the root of evill, and threatnest povertie to the
slothfull hand; I thy poore suppliant convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thy judgements and conscious of my own
transgression, flie from my selfe to Thee, and
humbly appeale from the high Tribunall of
thy Justice, and seeke for refuge in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
of thy Mercy: Lord, I have led a life dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to thee, and have been a scandall to
my profession; I have slighted those Blessings
which thy goodnesse hath promised to a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
calling, and have swallowed downe the
Bread of idlenesse; I have impaired the Talent
thou gavest me, and have lost the opportunity
of doing much good: I have filled my heart
with idle imaginations, and have layd my felse
open to the lusts of the flesh: I have abused thy
favours in the misexpending of my pretious
time, and have taken no delight in thy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths;
I have doted too much on the pleasures
of this world, and like a Droane have fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hony of Bees. If thou O God shouldst

thy indignation, and powre the vialls of thy
wrath upon mee; looke therefore not upon
my sinnes, O Lord, but through the merits of
my Saviour, who hath made a full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for all my sinnes: What through my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
I have fail'd to doe, the fulnesse of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
hath most exactly done: In Him O
God in whom thou art well pleased, and for
his sake bee gracious to my finne; Alter my
heart and make it willing to please thee, that
in my life I may adorne my profession: Give me
a care and a conscience in my calling, and
grant thy blessing to the lawfull labours of my
hand; Let the fidelitie of my vocation improve
my Talent, that I may enter into my Masters
joy: Rouze up the dulnesse and deadnesse of my
heart, and quench those flames of lust within
mee. Assist mee O God in the redemption of my
time, and deliver my soule from the evilnesse of
my dayes; Let thy providence accompany my
moderate endeavours, and let all my imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
depend upon thy providence, that when
the labours of this sinfull world shall cease, I
may feele and enjoy the benefit of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and obtaine the rest of new Jerusalem in
the Eternity of glory.</p>

who tryest without a witnesse, and condemnest
without a Jury; O! I confesse my very actions
have betray'd me, thy word hath brought in
evidence against mee, my owne conscience hath
witnessed against me, and thy judgement hath
past sentence against mee: And what have I now
to pleade but mine owne misery, and whither
should that misery flee but to the God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
And since O Lord the way to mercy is to
leave my selfe, I here disclaime all interest in
my self, and utterly renounce my selfe: I that
was created for thy glory, have dishonored thy
Name; I that was made for thy service, have
profaned thy Sabbaths; I have sleighted thy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
&amp; turned my back upon thy Sanctuary;
I have neglected thy Sacraments, abused thy

               <p>O God that art the onely searcher of the
Reines, to whom the secrets of the heart of
man are onely known, to whom alone the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our thoughts, our words and deeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
and to whose sentence wee must stand or
fall, I a presumptuous sinner that have thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy place and boldly have presumed to execute
thy office, doe here as humbly confesse the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of mine attempt, and with a sorrowfull
heart repent me of my doings; and though my
convinced conscience can look for nothing from
thy wrathfull hand but the same measure which
I measured to another, yet in the confidence of
that mercy which thou hast promised to all
those that truely and unfeignedly beleeve, I am
become an humble suitor for thy gratious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
Lord, if thou search mee but with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
eye, I shall appeare much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
in thy sight, then this my uncharitably
condemned brother did in mine; O looke not
therefore, Lord, upon mee as I am, lest thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
me; but through the merits of my blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
cast a gratious eye upon mee; Let his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
satisfie for my presumption, and let his
meritorious sufferings answer for my vile uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse;
let not the voyce of my offence
provoke thee with a stronger cry, then the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61359:56"/>
of his Intercession. Remove from mee
O God all spirituall pride, and make me little
in my owne conceite; Lord light mee to my
selfe, that by thy light I may discerne how dark
I am; Lighten that darkenesse by thy holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that I may search into my owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And since O God all gifts and graces are
but nothing, and nothing can bee acceptable in
thy sight without charity; quicken the dulnesse
of my faint affections, that I may love my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as I ought: Soften my marble heart that it
may melt at his infirmities; Make me carefull in
the examination of my owne wayes, and most
severe against my owne offences: Pull out the
beame out of mine owne eye, that I may see
clearely, and reprove wisely. Take from mee O
Lord all grudging, envy, and malice, that my
seasonable reproofes may winne my brother.
Preserve my heart from all censorious thoughts,
and keepe my tongue from striking at his name:
Grant that I make right use of his Infirmities,
and reade good Lessons in his failings, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him in thee, and thee in him according to
thy command, wee may both bee united in thee
as members of thee, that thou mayst receive
honour from our communion here, and wee
eternal glory from thee hereafter in the world
to come.</p>

for vengeance, but the blood that was shed for
me sues for mercy; Lord heare the language of
this blood, and by the merits of this voyce be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled

recalled, O give mee power to redeeme, and in

Suppresse the violence of my headstrong passion,
and establish a meeke spirit within mee. Let the

of all disgrace, and let the Crowne of my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

may exercise it against my selfe. Grant that I
may love thee for thy selfe, my self in thee and

               <p>O God by whom Kings raigne, and kingdoms
flourish, that settest up where none can bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
downe, and pullest downe where none can
countermand, I a most humble Sutor at the
Throne of Grace acknowledge my selfe unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the least of all thy mercies, nay worthy of
the greatest of all thy judgements: I have sinned
against thee the Author of my beeing, I have
sinned against my conscience, which thou hast
made my accuser, I have sinned against the
peace of this Kingdome, whereof thou hast
made me a member: If all should doe O God as
I have done, <hi>Sodom</hi> would appeare as righteous,

upon this sinfull nation. But Lord thy mercy is
inscrutable, or else my misery were unspeakable,
for that mercy sake be gratious to mee in the free
pardoning of all my offences. Blot them out of
thy remembrance for his sake in whom thou
art well pleased: Make my head a fountaine of
teares to quench that brand my sinnes have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

kingdome: Blesse this kingdome O God; Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it in pietie, honour, peace, and plenty. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
all her crying sinnes, and remove thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
farre from her. Blesse her governour, thy
servant, our dread Soveraigne: Endue his soule
with all religious, civill and princely vertues;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61359:65"/>
Preserve his royall person in health, safetie and
prosperitie, prolong his dayes in honour, peace
or victory, and crowne his death with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
glory. Blesse him in his royall Consort;
unite their hearts in love and true Religion.
Blesse him in his Princely issue; Season their
youth with the feare of thy Name. Direct thy
Church in doctrine and in discipline, and let her
enemies bee converted, or confounded; Purge
her of all superstition and heresie, and root
out from her, whatsoever thy hand hath not
planted: Blesse the Nobilitie of this land, endue
their hearts with truth, loyaltie, and true policy.
Blesse the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> with pietie, learning,
and humilitie. Blesse the Magistrates of this
kingdome; give them religious and upright
hearts, hating covetousnesse. Blesse the Gentry
with sinceritie, charitie, and a good conscience.
Blesse the Commonaltie with loyall hearts,
painefull hands, and plentifull encrease. Blesse
the two great Seminaries of this Kingdome, make
them fruitfull and faithfull nurseries both to the
Church and Common-wealth. Blesse all thy
Saints every where, especially those that have
stood in the gappe betwixt this kingdome, and
thy judgements, that being all members of that
Body, whereof thou Christ art head, we may all
joyne in humiliation for our sinnes, and in the
propagation of thy honor here, and be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of thy glory in the kingdome of glory.</p>
