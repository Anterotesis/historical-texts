            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But be it for one or all these reasons, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that in our age as well as in times by-past, the deerest children of God haue tasted of this triall, and haue been forced to endure very horrible imputations &amp; staining aspersions, which the venomous tongues of vngodly men haue striued to cast vpon them. It were no hard matter to name very strange calumniations which haue been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by the vassals of Antichrist, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the adorers of the beast in diuers books (which are no better than defamatory

libels) against Gods seruants of the highest ranke vpon earth, because they ouer-turned the strong holds of idolatry, and gaue free passage to the Gospell of Christ Iesus. But I forbeare to giue such particular instances, and rather leaue to the consideration of the wise, whether it may euer be hoped, that such irreligious creatures (who haue solde themselues to Sathan the accuser of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) will make spare to lash and scourge such single persons as stand in their way, &amp; hinder their designes; when they make no conscience to brand our holy faith, and the generalitie of our profession, with reports most odious, and such as must needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for abominable, if they should be true: but in sooth are in the sight of God, of Angels and men, before heauen &amp; earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but plaine fictions and forgeries, conteining in them no parcell of veritie.

and as poison ordinarily hasteneth to the heart, so doth enuie let driue at the head, at those who be most eminent in the State and Common-wealth.

most vnspotted touching the crimes layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him) yea being a man after Gods own heart, yet was accused and charged with many hainous iniquities; which caused him to complaine both before and after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crowne: as vnto <hi>Saul</hi>: <note n="t" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.</note>

               <hi>Deliuer my soule O Lord from lying lips, and from a deceitfull tongue.</hi> These things, and that the <note n="z" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal</hi> 69.12.</note> drunkards did make songs vpon him, did many times exceedingly grieue him, that he who laboured to seeme innocent, should be reproched as nocent; that he who was but the Patient, should be held for the Agent; that the man wronged, should be reported
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19361:7"/>
to do wrong vnto other; that he whose life was sought, should be termed by <hi>Shimei,</hi>

For it is the property of innocency and integritie, that if it may finde no other reward, yet it would gladly shine in the simplicitie and sinceritie of it selfe. But when there was no other helpe to be freed from those slanders, <hi>Dauid</hi> had one assured remedie; that was, to retire himselfe to the Lord, &amp; commend his cause to his Maker: As he excellently doth in the three and fortieth Psalme, where being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the malice of his aduersaries, and complaining of it in the first verse: <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 43.1.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Many men haue been desirous to haue their fame cleered from the reproches of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19361:7"/>
their enemies, and haue sought meanes to haue their hearts eased from the disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and distempers whereinto false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue put them. <hi>Zeno</hi> is much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that with such calmnesse he could turne aside those bitter taunts which some bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him: for being asked, how he did bear himselfe against euil speeches: <note n="d" place="margin">

               <hi>I do,</hi> saith he, <hi>as if an Embassadour should be sent vnto me, and I should returne him without an answer.</hi> This for a Philosopher, who was but an heathen man, was an excellent resolution. But in these words of <hi>Dauid,</hi> there is a way more noble than <hi>Zeno</hi> could conceiue; that is, to looke vp to our great God, and commit all to him, expecting his good leasure. It is not enough when a man being priuy to his owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie doth not boile within himselfe, or fret against the wicked (which are things <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.1.</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden vnto vs) but he must goe a step far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and propose to his owne heart some more notable example. And in this case who is rather to be imitated by a Christian, than our Sauior Chirst? Concerning whom <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> said well: That <note n="f" place="margin">

               <hi>when he cast out diuels, and did innumerable good things, and yet was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19361:8"/>
ill spoken of; against those men who said, that he had the Diuell, he did not send any thunderbolt, he did not ouerthrow those blasphemous mouthes, he consumed not with fire those vnchaste, vngratefull, vnworthie tongues of theirs: but only with these words put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side those euill speeches; I haue not the Diuell, but I honour him who sent me.</hi> This is most truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of our Sauiour: but there was in him somewhat els, which is better obserued by <hi>S. Peter:</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23.</note> 
               <hi>VVhen he was reuiled, he reuiled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; when he suffered, he threatened not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to him that iudgeth righteously.</hi> And this, committing it to him that iudgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, was the course which Dauid vsed: to wait patiently on the Lord, to cast vp his eies to heauen, and commending to God the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his waies, to leaue all to his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. And this is the very Lesson which hee teacheth both himselfe and other. For in the seuen and twentieth Psalme, hauing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.12.14.</note> aduersaries, of false witnesses which rose vp against him, and such as speak cruelly, he concludeth with this document, <hi>Hope in the Lord; bee strong, and hee shall comfort thine heart, and trust in the Lord.</hi> Which is the most sound instruction, that any creature
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19361:8"/>
can haue: to looke vp to his Creator (to whom all hearts are open, and no priuie thing can be secret) and to commend to his prouidence, to his fatherly care and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the vnspottednesse of his waies, and the simplicity of his conuersation. And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly that God who is the God of truth, will bee the patron and protectour of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie in his seruants. It is a strong conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which Dauid giueth in this case; <note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.5.6.</note> 
               <hi>Commit thy way vnto the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall bring it to passe. And hee shall bring foorth thy righteousnesse as the light, and thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the noone day.</hi> But it followeth: <hi>Wait patiently vpon the Lord, and hope in him</hi>: As if that must bee the meanes to attaine thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: not to run before thy Maker, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him the time when thy integrity shall bee cleered, and the dimming clouds of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie shall be blowen from thy estimation; but to leaue that to his managing, to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose and direction. For as <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> telleth vs; <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Chrys. in Psal.</hi> 129.</note> 
               <hi>If it be in the power of God to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, it is also in his power to giue when himselfe pleaseth.</hi> It is said of him, that hee doth all things in <note n="l" place="margin">

               <hi>measure, number and waight.</hi> But if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19361:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before the number bee full, or the measure be vp, thou wilt limit him the time when thy innocencie must appeare: thou takest on thee to be wiser than the Lord, and in a sort mounting vp into his throne in heauen, thou doest iustle him out of his seat of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty and eternity. If thou wilt set downe the decree for time or place, or the maner of purging thy selfe, or how the wickednes of thine enemies must be displaied, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thy selfe the Iudge, and the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth shall be but thy executioner. Leaue the maine then to him (which doth not fore-close thee, but that thou mayst vse all honest meanes to lay open thy vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse) and thou shalt haue reason with <hi>Dauid</hi> to thanke him, and say: <note n="m" place="margin">

               <hi>He is my present helpe and my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in truth it is strange to see the Lords worke in this behalfe, how, when the fame of his seruants hath beene vniustly denigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by false accusations, hee taking the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his hands hath in his good time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all mists of slander. Heereof <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe had singular experience. For when <hi>Saul</hi> was informed that <hi>Dauid</hi> sought his life,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19361:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and by the often ingeminations of maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men this was taken for a truth, and <hi>Dauid</hi> was accordingly persecuted, and in danger to be murdered, God put <hi>Saul</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4. <hi>c.</hi> 26.7.</note> two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times into the hands of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee might haue slaine him: which being entertained as an inuincible argument of <hi>Dauids</hi> fidelity, <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe by the irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable euidence of truth was forced to crie out, <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.18.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rendered me good, and I haue rendered thee euill.</hi> And a second time: <note n="p" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.21.</note> 
               <hi>I haue sinned: come againe my sonne Dauid, for I will doe thee no more harme, because my soule was precious in thine eies this day: behold I haue done foolishly, and haue erred excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.

               <hi>Narcissus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who was a vertuous and worthy man, and yet by three persons was accused of a hainous crime. The story doth not cleerely deliuer what it was: but by circumstances it may be gathered to bee incontinency. These three to giue the more reputation to that accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherewithall they charged him, did vse diuers imprecations and execrations on themselues, if those things were not true
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19361:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which they obiected against him. As the one wished that himselfe might be burnt, the second that he might die of a loathsome disease, the third that he might lose the sight of his eyes. This constant and consenting crimination so affected <hi>Narcissus,</hi> though priuy to his own vprightnesse, that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himselfe from his abode, and liuing priuately commended his righteous cause to God: which had such effect, that not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long after, the first of his accusers was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed consumed with fire, the house being burnt in which he remained: the second di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the same disease which he wished vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himselfe: and the third being much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the punishment of his fellows, had remorse of his sinne, and came and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly acknowledged the conspiracy of them three against innocent <hi>Narcissus</hi>: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he had such feeling of his owne iniquity, that powring out continuall teares, hee lost the sight of his eyes with the rheume that descended. A most memorable narration to their comfort, who, being wronged by men in their fame or good name, commend their cause to God. Like to which is that of

               <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who reporteth, that <hi>Eustathius</hi> the Patriarke of <hi>Antioch</hi> had many combats with the <hi>Arrians</hi> for defence of Christs truth: and when he still preuailed against them, they out of their malice suborned a harlot to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of fornication, and openly to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that a childe was his which she held in her armes: by which meanes hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to flie to the same succour that <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissus</hi> formerly had done; which had such force with Almighty God, that within a while after the harlot was stricken with a grieuous sicknesse, which wrought in her so powerfully, that shee freely confessed the combination of the <hi>Arrians</hi> against the holy man: and how shee was suborned to accuse him wrongfully, whereof she was now sory. But whereas she had said that <hi>Eustathius</hi> was the father of her childe; that indeed was true of another <hi>Eustathius,</hi> but not of the Bishop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Wherein we may beholde, that euen so long agone Equiuocation was in vse, but it was with leaud persons, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes and harlots: but withall Gods worke appeareth, that he will not euermore suffer innocencie to be oppressed, and truth to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19361:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wronged; but at the last veritie shall breake forth, as the Sunne which was darkned with a cloud. And this mercifull fauor of God to his seruants was not onely in the ages past, but our dayes haue experiments of the very like occurrents; as in a famous case lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at <hi>Edenborough</hi> may sensibly be discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: whereof, because I was an eye-witnesse at my late being there by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Maiestie, I haue thought it my dutie, in honor to God and loue to his truth, to declare what I saw and heard; that this following Treatise penned by an honorable personage of <hi>North-Britaine</hi> might not goe forth vnaccompanied with the Declaration of one of <hi>South-Britaine,</hi> for so much as hee beheld.</p>
            <p>There are few in this Iland of any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but haue heard of the traiterous and bloodie attempt of the Earle <hi>Gowrie</hi> and his brother against the person and life of our most blessed Souereigne. Wherein albeit there were such euidences and arguments, as that any man who would haue taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, might haue been sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed therein euen at the very first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19361:11"/>
by the cleere depositions (for most pregnant circumstances) and ample attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of many persons of honour and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Parliament of that Kingdome tooke full knowledge thereof, and accordingly proceeded to the forfaiting of the whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of that Earle, and of his heires for euer: yet some humorous men, whom in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I may iustly terme vnthankfull vnto God, and vndutifull to their King, out of fond imaginations, or rather, if you will, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious suppositions of their owne, did both at home and abroad, by whisperings and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret buzzings into the eares of the people (who were better perswaded of them than indeed there was cause) imploy their wits and tongues to obscure the trueth of that matter, and to cast an imputation where it was least deserued. Which when God had permitted for the space of some yeeres to ranckle and foster in the bowels of those who were the Authours of it; the same God in his wisdome at last meaning to cure them if they would be cured of that maladie, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, that in the same treason, although caried neuer so secretly, there were other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19361:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confederates, of whom hitherto the world had taken no kinde of knowledge. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit two of the persons interested in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse were lately dead, and departed vnto far greater torment than all the earth could lay vpon them (vnlesse they died repentant) yet it was apprehended that a third partie remained, who had fore-knowledge of that conspiracie, and was able to vtter much of the secrets of it; one <hi>George Sprot,</hi> a Notarie inhabiting at <hi>Aye-mouth,</hi> a place well knowen in that countrey. Which matter, or some part thereof, being made knowen to an <note n="s" place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Dunbar.</hi>
               </note> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable person, a most faithfull seruant to his Maiestie, first by some words that fell from <hi>Sprot</hi> himselfe, and afterwards by some papers found vpon him, it was so wisely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and so prudently brought about, by the great care and diligence of that noble man (God Almightie blessing the businesse) that so much was reueiled as followeth in this Treatise, vpon the Acts to be seene; which are here set downe at large, word for word as they agree with the processe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and other examinations, that such as haue beene auerse may at last receiue satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Touching all which, I shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but only report that which befell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of his death, when hee suffered for that treason. Hauing then the sentence passed on him vpon Friday the twelfth of August 1608 in the fore-noone, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely being warned to prepare himselfe to his end, which must be that after-dinner, he most willingly submitted himselfe vnto that punishment, which (as he then acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) he had iustly deserued. And being left to himselfe til dinner-time was expired, then came to him into that priuate place where hee remained, some of the <note n="*" place="margin">Archb. of <hi>Glasc.</hi> Bis. of <hi>Brickh.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19361:13"/>
say, hee did in a sort deiect and cast downe himselfe to the gates of hell, as if he should there haue beene swallowed vp in the gulfe of desperation: yet presently laying holde vpon the mercies of God in Christ, he raised himselfe, and strangely lifted vp his soule vnto the Throne of Grace, applying ioy and comfort to his owne heart so effectually, as can not well be described. In the admitting of this consolation into his inward man, he burst out into teares, so plentifully flowing from him, that for a time they stopped his voice. The sight &amp; hearing wherof wroght so forcible an impression in those persons of honour and learned men who beheld him, that there was scant any one of them, who could refraine teares in the place, as diuers of themselues that day did witnesse vnto me. The effect of his prayer was the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating of his crime in concealing the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the Kings Maiestie; into which, hee said, <hi>God did most iustly suffer him to fall, by reason of his former wickednesse which he had so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately multiplied in despight of God and his holy VVord.</hi> And thereupon going on with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sensible speeches and most feeling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19361:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hee insisted on the fearefull and dreadfull danger wherein hee was, if the Lord in iudgement should looke vpon him. Notwithstanding, at last he proceeded: <hi>Yet most mercifull father,</hi> whereat he made a stay, and repeating the word <hi>father</hi> with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous loud and shrill voice, he added, <hi>why should I call thee father, that haue so many wayes and so horribly transgressed thy commandements, in all the course of my life, but especially in concealing this vile, fearefull and diuellish treason against my most gracious Soueraigne? Lord, Lord, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belongeth to me but wrath and confusion:</hi> and so went on in a strange vnaffected current of words, liuely expressing the sorrow of his heart. Yet there he stayd not, but spake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this purpose: <hi>Notwithstanding, Lord thou hast left me this comfort in thy VVord, that thou hast sayd, Come vnto me all ye that are weary and laden, and I will refresh you. Lord I am weary, Lord I am heauily laden with my sinnes, which are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable: I am ready to sincke Lord euen to hell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thou in thy mercy put to thy hand and deliuer me. Lord thou hast promised by thine owne word, out of thine owne mouth, that thou wilt refresh the weary soule.</hi> And with that he thrust out one of his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19361:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hands, and reaching as high as hee could, with a louder voice and a strained, cried, <hi>I challenge thee Lord, by that word, and by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which thou hast made, that thou performe and make it good to mee, that call for ease and mercie at thy hands. Lord heare mee, Lord pardon mee, Lord comfort me by thy holy spirit: assure my conscience of the forgiuenesse of my sinnes, &amp; say to my soule, that thou art reconciled.</hi> And so after many zealous petitions vttered to the like effect, he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himselfe the mercies of God in Christ Iesus, in whom he assured himselfe of Gods fauour, with earnest request, that he might continue in that assurance to the end, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he nothing doubted.</p>
            <p>Afterward, being brought to the scaffold, where he was to die, he vttered many things, among which I obserued these: <hi>He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to the people, that he was come thither to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer most deseruedly; That hee had beene an offender against Almightie God in very many respects; But that none of his sinnes was so grieuous vnto him, as that for which he must die: wherin, notwithstanding he was not an Actor, but a Concealer only. That he was ingyred in it by the Laird of</hi> Rastalrig <hi>and his seruant the Laird of</hi> Bour, <hi>both which,</hi> hee sayd,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19361:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were men <hi>that professed not religion.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he exhorted men <hi>to take heed how they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with such as are not religious; because,</hi> sayd he, <hi>with such as make not profession of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is no faith, no trueth, no holding of their word, as himselfe had tried and found.</hi> But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the treason for the concealing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was condemned, he added, <hi>That he was preserued aliue to open that secret mysterie which so long had layen hidde; That God had kept him since that attempt of the Earle</hi> Gowrie <hi>from very manie dangers, but notedly from one, when being in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hazzard of drowning, he was strangely deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: which,</hi> said he, <hi>was Gods worke, that I might remaine aliue vnto this happie and blessed day, that the trueth might be made knowen. And now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my fault to the shame of my selfe, and to the shame of the Diuell; but to the glorie of God. And I doe it not either for feare of death, or for any hope of life, (for I haue deserued to die, and am vnworthie to liue) but because it is the trueth, which I shall seale with my blood. My fault,</hi> sayth hee, <hi>is so great, that if I had a thousand liues, and could die ten thousand deaths, yet I might not make satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I should conceale such a treason against so gracious a King.</hi> These and the like words,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19361:15"/>
when hee had spoken vpon one side of the scaffold, hee turned him to the second side, and afterward to the third, (that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might heare) where he spake to the same purpose as formerly he had done. And here it may not be forgotten, that in the vttering of these things his tongue serued him verie well, with words readie and significant, his memorie was perfect, his countenance rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably erect and full of alacritie, without all feare of death, his voice was loud and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible on euery part: which was the more strange, because at the times of his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as also that very fore-noone, at the houre of his arraignment, his speech was low and weake; but now so strong, as if God of purpose had giuen him power to deliuer his words in such a maner, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might heare and vnderstand.</p>
            <p>When this aboue-mentioned declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had beene made, <hi>Sprot</hi> returned to that part of the scaffold where he first began to speake, and there falling on his knees, he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a prayer to the same purpose as is set down in this ensuing Treatise. And hauing ended the same, one of the Ministers praied
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19361:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againe, and the prisoner ioyned with him, <hi>That God would forgiue his sinnes, and receiue his soule to mercie.</hi> After which, <hi>Sprot</hi> standing vp made diuers requests: First that what he had deliuered by this Confession on the scaffold, might be put into his Processe, that the world might take notice of it. Secondly, that such as were present (as they might haue opportunity) would be suters vnto the King, that his Maiestie would forgiue him this offence, for the which, he sayd, <hi>he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued pardon of God, of his Souereigne, and the world.</hi> And thirdly, hee desired those of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie which were present, that wheresoeuer they, came they would proclame in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit his confession of his crime, his sorow for the same, and his full hope that God would pardon him. And to the end that this might be performed, hee tooke the hands of such Ministers as stood neere about him, so bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a promise on them. And heere, being told by the said Ministers and other persons of qualitie, that being so neere his departure out of the world, it concerned him to speake nothing but the trueth, and that vpon the perill of his soule: he answered, that to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19361:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
end that they should know, that hee had spoken nothing but the veritie, and that his Confession was true in euerie respect, hee would (at the last gaspe) giue them some apparent token for the confirmation of the same. Then fitting himselfe to the ladder, the Executioner commeth to him, and, as the maner is, asking forgiuenesse of him; <hi>VVith all my heart,</hi> saith hee, <hi>for you doe but your office, and it is the thing I desire; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause suffering in my bodie, I shall in my soule be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto my Sauiour.</hi> Ascending vp to the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he desired the people to sing a Psalme with him, which they did with many a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eye. Hee named the sixt Psalme, and beginning it or taking it vp himselfe, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie verse or line thereof hee went before the people, singing both lowd and tunably vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very end. Then once againe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and auowing his former confession, he couered his owne face, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his soule to God, hee was turned off the ladder; where hanging by the necke some little while, hee three seuerall times gaue a lowd clap with his hands, that all the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by might heare: which was the signe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19361:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or token (as it seemeth) which he a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had sayd that hee would giue at his last gaspe, for the ratification and auowing of those things, which by his confession hee had so many times declared and deliuered. These things were done in the open sight of the Sunne, in the Kings Capitall towne, at the Market-crosse in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> in the presence of diuers thousands of all sorts: of the Nobilitie, of the Clergie, of the Gentrie, of the Burgesses, of women and children, my selfe with the rest of the English Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters standing by and looking on, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing GOD the glorie, that after so long a space as eight yeeres and eight dayes (for so it was by iust computation after the attempt of <hi>Gowrie</hi>) he was pleased to giue so noble a testimonie vnto that, which by some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligners had beene secretly called in question without any ground or reason. I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at length those particulars which I heard and saw, which that honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, who wrote this Treatise following doth somewhat more briefly deliuer, but yet both of vs very truly, as thousands can witnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:19361:17"/>Out of both these narrations there may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> diuers obseruations be gathered. As first, how hainous a thing it is in the sight of God himselfe, for subiects of what nature or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie soeuer, to enter into conspiracie against the life and person of the Lords Anointed: for Almightie God hath threatned to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer these traiterous enterprises; and if no other way, yet by some strange and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fashion. Hee who spake against cruell imaginations of the heart, <note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.20.</note> 
               <hi>Curse not the King, no not in thy thought: for the fowle of the heauen shall carie the voice, and that which hath wings shall declare the matter;</hi> what will he do, when acts of hostilitie in rebellious maner shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into? And doth his Diuine Maiestie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close it, and will he not also punsh it? The example of that Earle <hi>Gowrie</hi> among thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of others may be a sufficient instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this behalfe, who for his Soueraignes loue and gracious fauour testified in many respects, and intended many more wayes vnto him, returning nothing but vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and traiterous resolutions, digged a pit for another, but by Gods iudgement fell into it himselfe: and did not only lose in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19361:17"/>
one day his fidelitie, estimation and life, but ouerthrew his house and all the honour of his familie, thorow succeeding generations. Therefore farre be it at all times from any noble heart to walke in his wayes, or vpon any occasion to entertaine such discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as may grow to vndutifulnesse: for when the wrath of God shall ouertake men offending in this kinde, and the iustice of a King shall once proceed against them, what horror must there needs be in their bowels and conscience? what trembling &amp; affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their very soule? If this poore man <hi>Sprot,</hi> for concealing that odious combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, found such touches in himselfe, and such remorse in his heart, what quaking and dreadfulnesse may we thinke will fall on him who is guiltie of the highest act of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and rebellion?</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee heere may see the Lords <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> protection ouer Christian Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whom as hee placeth next himselfe in maiestie and authoritie, and calleth them by his owne name, <hi>I haue said,</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.6.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are Gods</hi>; so he blesseth and vpholdeth them as his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Vice-gerents, men representing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19361:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himselfe, especially if sincerely they serue and feare and loue him. He is a God of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and loueth subordination in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Countreys, where if hee grace, countenance and protect inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, what will hee doe to the heads and chiefe gouernours of his people, who are next to his owne greatnesse? Hee hath set them aboue other in honour and glorie, which causeth them to be more obserued according to their state: but withall, the prayers of their subiects are powred out for their welfare, day &amp; night, and at all times; which concurring with their owne requests to God, do find acceptance with the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to their noted prosperitie and eminent felicitie. It preserueth from many perils, to haue at all houres and seasons the prayers and supplications of faithfull men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men houering ouer their heads, which may be perpetuall Remembrancers for them to their heauenly Father, if by humane fragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and vnauoidable imperfections they should forget themselues.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we may note more particularly the sauing health of God vpon our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19361:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Souereigne; to whom as the Lord hath giuen many blessings and much happinesse beyond all his Progenitours, so hee hath mainteined and protected his person in a maruellous and strange maner, not onely from his cradle vnto this day, but (as it is very well knowen) from before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world. And how did the Lord free his seruant euen from the brincke of the pit, and from the gates of the graue at the time of <hi>Gowries</hi> attempt? as also since that day, when those wicked sonnes of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi> the staine of the Land and Countrey wherin they were borne, intended that Powder-treason? Which as on the one side it expecteth at the hands of his Maiestie a greater thankfulnesse to God the King of kings, so on the other side it calleth for of vs who sit peaceably vnder his shadow, euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting tokens of gratefulnesse to so mercifull a Lord, and heartie obedience to our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne, whom God hath raised vp, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, protected, maintained, vpheld with his extraordinarie fauour to no common end; but to the enlarging of his Church, to the further ruine of Antichrist; to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19361:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Kingdomes, to the comfort of all the godly dispersed thorow <hi>Europe.</hi> And happy is hee, not who can finde deuices, and cast imaginarie perils to hinder such a worke, but who in his poore place can with a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart giue furtherance to the same.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, as many blessings from heauen haue been powred on the head of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, so it is not the least, that <hi>tanquam è postli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio,</hi> after so many yeeres, and that as from the bones of a dead man, when liuing men would not beleeue it, God hath giuen far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light to the opening of the conspiracie of that vngodly Earle <hi>Gowrie</hi>; which some few persons, affected more to a rebell that is dead, than to their liuing Souereigne, did endeuour to disguise and maske at their owne pleasure. The strange conceits of whom I can neuer sufficiently woonder at; that men professing conscience and zeale to the trueth, should vpon no kind of ground or shew of probabilitie, suffer such vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thoghts to enter into their hearts; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against his sacred person, whose life hath beene so immaculate and vnspotted in the world, so free from all touch of vicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19361:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and staining imputation, that euen malice it selfe (which leaueth nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searched) could neuer finde true blemish in it, nor cast any probable aspersion on it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his sacred person, whom as they must acknowledge to be zealous as <hi>Dauid,</hi> learned and wise as the <hi>Salomon</hi> of our age, religious as <hi>Iosias,</hi> carefull of spreading Christs faith as <hi>Constantine the Great</hi>; so if they will speake trueth, they must confesse to be iust as <hi>Moses,</hi> vndefiled in all his wayes as <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechias,</hi> full of clemencie as another <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> farre from spilling the blood of any of his Nobilitie, but rather sparing those who haue lift vp their hand against him. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, when preposterous affection had so blinded these men, that they would not see this truth, the Lord hath giuen light yet once more to the rectifying of their iudgements. A singular example of Gods vnlimited and vnbounded wisdome, who will doe things as he liketh. That when as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> sayth, <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.11.</note> 
               <hi>Qui sordescit, sordescat adhuc,</hi> He that lift to be peeuish and refractarie and selfe-conceited, did thinke hee might haue persisted and died in that peeuishnesse and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19361:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
refractarie conceit, and supposed that neuer any thing in this world should haue beene able to reforme him, may see before his face so illustrious a testimony of his misconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fancie, and almost vnsatisfiable vnduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, that vnlesse his face be hardened and his heart obdurated against both hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, he must cease to be peruerse. God is the God of truth: and he who is the protectour of innocency in the poorest, will certainly be the mainteiner and defender of integritie and sinceritie in his noblest and dearest seruant. It is fit that he should haue his owne will, to put off and prolong his mercies till the time which seemeth good to himselfe, that men may wait vpon him, and patiently expect, and still tarie the Lords leisure: yea that his power may be knowen, who can bring light out of darknesse, and good out of euill, and truth out of treason; who can giue hope beyond hope. But when hee is once resolued that things acted in secret shall be preached vpon the house top, that iniquitie shalbe opened, that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie shall be cleered, and innocencie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened of scandalous imputations, if
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19361:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men would not speake, or children sound out the trueth in the streets, <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 19.40.</note> yet the verie stones shall crie, as our Sauiour once answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the maligning Pharisees. Blessed be the GOD of iustice, who cleereth vp the fame of his holy ones, when malice would obscure it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, heere may be a warning to men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of mine owne profession, I meane the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospell, that in cases of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est nature between a King and his rebell they conceiue not things to the woorst, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will be opposite to him whom most of all they should honor) by buzzings and whisperings, and secret suggestions, without all ground of trueth, labour to sow sedition in the eares of women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or in the mindes of men either weake or ill disposed. For as the <note n="y" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7.</note> lips of the Priest should alwayes preserue knowledge, so should they preserue trueth. And we are to go before our flocks and Congregations in obedience and obsequiousnesse vnto the Christian Magistrate, not in sowing sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or making of mutinies, to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the State. Who should sticke clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19361:21"/>
to <hi>Moyses</hi> welding so huge a charge, than <hi>Aaron</hi> and his tribe? And who should rather labour to doe his Prince all right, than the Minister of the Gospell, who next after tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching men their dutie to GOD, is made to teach obedience and respectiuenesse vnto Kings? And who more deserueth to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised than he, if he wilfully transgresse?</p>
            <p>These things I thought not amisse to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to thee, Christian Reader, before thou come to the perusing of this plaine and true narration, touching the examination, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment and death of the person here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.

                     <p>MY Lord, my most humble dutie and seruice hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily remembred. At the receit of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Letter I am so comforted, that I can neither vtter my ioy, nor finde my selfe sufficiently able to requite your Lordship with due thanks. And perswade your Lordship in that matter, I shall be as forward for your Lordships honour, as if it were mine owne cause. And I thinke there is no liuing Christian that would not be content to reuenge that Machiauellian massacring of our deare friends, yea howbeit it should be, to venture and hazzard life, lands and all other thing els. My heart can binde me to take part in that matter, as your Lordship shall finde better proofe thereof. But one thing would be done: namely. That your Lordship should be circumspect and earnest with your brother, that hee be not rash in any speeches touching the purpose of <hi>Padua.</hi> My Lord, you may easily vnderstand, that such a purpose as your Lordship intendeth, can not be done rashly, but with deliberation. And I thinke for my selfe, that it were most meet to haue the men your Lordship spake of, readie in a boat or barke, and addresse them as if they were taking pastime on the sea, in such faire Summer time. And if your Lordship could thinke good either your selfe to come to my house of <hi>Fast-Castle</hi> by sea, or to send your brother, I should haue the place very quiet,

and well prouided after your Lordships aduertisement, where we should haue no scant of the best Venison can be had in <hi>England.</hi> And no others should haue accesse to haunt the place, during your Lordships being heere, but all things very quiet.

And perswade your Lordship you shall be as sure and quiet heere, while we haue setled our plot, as if you were in your owne chamber: for I trust and am assured we shall heare word within few dayes from them your Lorship knoweth of; for I haue care to see what ships comes home by. Your Lordship knoweth I haue kept the <hi>L.

I hope (if all things come to passe, as I trust they shall) to haue both your Lordship and his Lordship at one good dinner afore I die. <hi>Haeciocosè,</hi> to animate your Lordship: I doubt not my Lord but all things shall be well. And I am resolued, wherof your Lordship shall not doubt, of any thing on my part, yea to perill life, land, honor and goods; yea the hazzard of hell shall not affray me from that, yea although the scaffold were alreadie set vp. The sooner the matter were done, it were the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the Kings bucke-hunting will be shortly: and I hope it shall prepare some daintie cheere for vs to dine against the next yeere. I remember well my Lord, and I will neuer forget, so long as I liue, that merrie sport which your Lordships brother tolde me of a Noble-man at <hi>Padua:</hi> for I thinke that a <hi>parasceue</hi> to this purpose.

best.

To whom <hi>Bour</hi> answered: You may doe as you please Sir, but it is not my counsell, that you should be so sudden in that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter.

And <hi>Sprot</hi> inquiring how that could be; <hi>Bour</hi> sayd they had another pie in hand nor the selling of any land: but prayed <hi>Sprot,</hi> for Gods sake, that hee would let be, and not trouble himselfe with the Lairds businesse; for he feared, within few dayes, the Laird would either be landlesse or lifelesse.</p>

Aduocate, as before, asked act and instrument. And in respect thereof protested in case the said Inquest clensed him of the said crimes, for wilfull and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest errour. And therefore the whole fornamed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Inquest remoued all together forth of Court to the Inquest house, where they being inclosed, by pluralitie of votes elected and made choice of the said <hi>Harbert Maxwell</hi> of <hi>Cauens</hi> to be Chanceller or Fore-man. And hauing with great deliberation grauelie considered the effect and whole circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the said Inditement, and constant iudiciall confession made by the partie pannelled, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said L. Iustice and his Assessors, as thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in presence of the Inquest themselues, they all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the whole effect of the said Inditement. And being ripelie and well aduised therewith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred againe in Court, where they all in one voice by the mouth of the said Chanceller or Foreman, found, pronounced, and declared the said <hi>George Sprot</hi> (according to his owne confession iudicially made in their presence and audience) to be guiltie, culpable, filed and conuict of arte and parte of the said most hainous, detestable and treasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie conteined in his Inditement aboue-written, and of the knowledge and concealing thereof. For the which cause the said Iustice, by the mouth of the Dempster of Court, by his sentence and doome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and ordeined, The said <hi>George Sprot</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Market Crosse of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and there to be hanged vpon a gibbet till he be dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after his head to be stricken from his bodie, and his bodie to be quartered and demeaned as a Traitour,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19361:30"/>
and his head to be affixed and set vp vpon a pricke of iron vpon the highest part of the Towlebewth of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> where the Traitour <hi>Gowrie,</hi> and others of the Conspiratours heads stand; and his whole lands, heritages, tacks, stedings, roomes, possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, goods and geere to be forfeited and eschet to our Souereigne Lord his vse, for his treasonable and detestable crimes aboue specified. Which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced for doome.</p>
            <q>Extractum de libro Actorum Adiornalis S. D. N. Regis per me D. Iohannem Coh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne de Ormestoun militem, Clericum Iustitiariae eiusdem generalem. Sub meis signo &amp; subscriptione manualibus.</q>
            <p>The doome being pronounced, the said <hi>George</hi> was conuoyed to a priuie house, where he remained at his secret meditation, and afterwards in conference with the Ministers and others, vnto the time all things was prouided necessarie for his execution: and being brought to the place where he was to die, he in publike audience of the whole people, at the three sides of the scaffold, ratified the former deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by him concerning the treasonable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises intended and deuised betwixt <hi>Gowrie</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalrig,</hi> for the murthering of our most gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne, and bereauing his Highnesse of his life, and his owne knowledge and concealing of their guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For the which he humbly craued God and his Maiestie forgiuenesse, being most sorie and grieued that he had offended God and the Kings Maiestie in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19361:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concealing such a vile, detestable and vnnaturall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, enterprised by them against his gracious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne, who hath beene euer so good and gracious to his subiects, protesting that if he had a thousand liues to render, and were able to suffer ten thousand deaths, it were not a sufficient satisfaction and recompense for his offence. And that God had preserued him from many great perils, when his life was in extreme danger, to bring him to this publike declaration of that detestable and horrible fact in presence of all the people, vttered by him in these words following: <hi>To my owne shame, and to the shame of the diuell, but to the glorie of God.</hi> And for satisfaction of the consciences of all those (if any be) that haue or can make any doubt of the trueth of this so cleere a matter, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that his haunting with <hi>Restalrig,</hi> who was a man without religion, and subiect to manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices, as also his continuall being in companie with the Laird of <hi>Bour,</hi> who likewise was irreligious and without feare of God, and his being ingyred by them into their matters after his first sight of <hi>Restal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigs</hi> letter written by him to <hi>Gowrie,</hi> brought him from one sinne to another, and consequently vpon this grieuous crime, for the which most iustly, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and willingly he is now to render his life. And thereupon he desired all the people there present to beware of euill companie, and namely of the societie of those who are void of religion. And farther desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this his declaration might be inserted in his Processe, and that the Ministers of Gods word would publish the same from their Pulpits to the people: for which purpose also he tooke diuers of them there
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19361:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
present by the hand, with their promise to doe the same, saying to them, That this was the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous day that euer his eyes did see. In the middest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of these speeches, he did prostrate himselfe and fell vpon his knees in presence of the whole people, making a verie pithie prayer, in the forme following.</p>
            <q>
               <floatingText xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>
                           <hi>O</hi> Father, how should I call thee Father, that am so vnworthy to be called thy sonne? I haue wandred astray like a lost sheepe, and thou of thy mercie hast brought me home vnto thee, and hast preserued my life from many dangers vntill this day, that I might reueile these hidden and secret mysteries, to mine owne shame, and thy glorie. Thou hast promised, that whensoeuer a sinner from his heart will repent and call to thee, that thou wilt heare him, and grant him mercie.</p>

            <p>And thus he continued a good space in a most fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayer, to the great admiration of all the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by. Afterward ganging vp the ladder with his hands loose &amp; vntied, being on the vpper part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he desired libertie to sing the sixt Psalme, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested the people to accompanie him in the sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. Which being granted, he tooke vp the Psalme himselfe with a very loud and strong voice, far by his accustomed forme, being before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the scaffold a weake spirited man, of feeble voice and vtterance; and was assisted with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a thousand persons at the least, who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him in singing that Psalme. After the ending whereof he openly repeated and ratified his said for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer confession: and with that, recommending his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19361:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
soule to God, hee fastened a cloth about his owne eyes, and was cast ouer the ladder, so ending this mortall life.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgotten that, which in this action of his death was strange, and in a maner maruellous. For being vrged by the Ministers and other of good ranke vpon the scaffold, that now at his end he should declare nothing but the trueth (touching the matter for which he suffered) on the perill of his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or condemnation of his soule; hee for the greater assurance of that his constant and true depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, promised (by the assistance of God) to giue them an open and euident token before the yeelding of his spirit. Which hee accomplished thereafter. For before his last breath, when he had hung a pretie space, hee lift vp his hands a good heigth, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them together aloud, three seuerall times, to the great woonder and admiration of all the beholders. And verie soone thereafter he yeelded his spirit.</p>
            <p>By this Narration afore-going, each man may learne, that the contriuing and plotting of treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Kings and Princes, is a thing odious in the sight of God, and therefore ordinarily is disclosed by him, at first or at last, by one meanes or another: and that it is not good to conceale any such conspiracie intended by enemie or friend, because the life and safetie of a Christian King, who is the common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Countrey, ought to be dearer to all good men, than the loue or acquaintance of any whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: who howbeit hee make shew of manie faire
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19361:32"/>
things in him, yet in this alone, That hee purposeth euill against the Lords Anointed; sufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himselfe to be of a rebellious and vngodly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. And how wofull the fruit is either of such traitourous resolutions, or of the concealing of them, may be seene (as in a glasse) both in the sudden end of the Earle <hi>Gowrie,</hi> and in the execution of this <hi>George Sprot</hi> with more deliberation.</p>
