            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Captaine <hi>Drake</hi> in the <hi>Paſcha</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi> of 70. tonnes his Admirall, with the <hi>Swanne</hi> of the ſame Port of 25. tonnes his Vice-Admirall, in which his brother <hi>Iohn Drake</hi> was Captaine (hauing in both of them of men and boyes ſeauenty three, all voluntarily aſſembled, of which the eldeſt was fifty, all the reſt vnder thirty: ſo deuided that there were forty ſeauen in the one ſhip, and twenty ſix in the other: both richly furniſhed, with victualles and apparell for a whole yeare: and no leſſe heedfully prouided of all manner of munition, Artillery, Artificers, ſtuffe and tooles, that were requiſite for ſuch a Man of warre in ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but eſpecially hauing three dainty Pinnaſes, made in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> taken a ſunder all in peeces and ſtowed aboard, to be ſet vp as occaſion ſerued:) ſet ſayle from out of the Sound of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> with intent to land at <hi>Nombre da Dios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The winde continued proſperous and fauorable at Northeaſt, and gaue as a very good paſſage, without any alteration or change:<note place="margin">Iune 3.</note> ſo that albeit we had ſight of <hi>Porto Sa to,</hi> one of the <hi>Maderas,</hi> and of the <hi>Canaries</hi> alſo within twelue dayes of our ſetting forth: yet we neuer ſtrooke ſayle, nor came to anchor, nor made any ſtay for any cauſe, neither there nor elſewhere, vntill 25.<note place="margin">Iune 28.</note> dayes after; when we had ſight of the Iland of <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupe,</hi> one of the Ilands of the Weſt Indies, goodly high land.</p>
            <p>The next morning we entred between <hi>Dominica</hi> &amp; <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> where we deſcryed two Canoas,<note place="margin">Iune 29,</note> comming from a rocky Iland, three leagues off <hi>Dominica,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10680:7"/>
vſually repayre thither to fiſh, by reaſon of the great plenry thereof, which is there continually to be found. Wee landed on the South ſide of it, remaining there three dayes to refreſh our men, and water our ſhips, out of one of thoſe goodly riuers, which fall downe off the mountaine. There we ſawe certaine poore cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, built with Palmito boughs and branches, but no inhabitants at that time ciuill nor ſauage; the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages it may be, (for we could know no certaine cauſe of the ſolitarineſſe we found there) ſeruing, not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall inhabitation, but only for their vſes that came to that place at certaine ſeaſons to fiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iuly 1.</note>The third day after about, three in the after-noone, wee ſet ſayle from thence, towards the continent of <hi>Terra firma.</hi> And the fift day after, wee had ſight of the high land of <hi>Santa Martha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iuly 6.</note> but came not neere the ſhoare by ten leagues. But thence directed our courſe, for a place called by vs <hi>Port Pheſant,</hi> for that our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine had ſo named it in his former voyage, by reaſon of the great ſtore of thoſe goodly Fowles, which he and his Company did then daily kill, and feed on, in that place. In this courſe, notwithſtanding wee had two dayes calme,<note place="margin">Iuly. 12.</note> yet within ſix dayes after we arriued at our <hi>Port Pheſant,</hi> which is a fine round Bay, of very ſafe harbor for all winds, lying betweene two high points, not paſt halfe a cables length ouer at the mouth, but within, eight or tenne cables length euery way, hauing ten or twelue faddome water more or leſſe, full of good fiſh, the ſoyle alſo very fruitfull; which may appeare by this, that our Captaine hauing beene in this place, within a yeare and fewe dayes before, and hauing ridde the place with many alleys and paths made, yet now all was ſo ouer-grown againe, as that we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10680:7"/>
doubted at firſt, whither this were the ſame place or no.</p>
            <p>At our entrance into this Bay, our Captaine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen order to his brother what to doe, if any occaſion ſhould happen in his abſence, was on his way, with intent to haue gone aland, with ſome fewe only in his company, becauſe he knew, there dwelt no Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards within thirty fiue leagues of that place. <hi>Tolou</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neereſt to the Eaſtwards, and <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to the weſtwards, where any of that Nation dwelt. But as we were rowing a ſhoare, we ſaw a ſmoake in the woods, euen neere the place, which our Captaine had afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time frequented: therefore thinking it fit to take more ſtrength with vs, he cauſed his other boat alſo to be mand, with certaine muskets, and other weapons, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſome enemy had beene a ſhoare.</p>
            <p>When we landed, we found by euident markes, that there had beene lately there, a certaine Engliſh man of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> called <hi>Iohn Garret,</hi> who had beene condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thither by certaine Engliſh Mariners, which had beene there with our Captaine in ſome of his former voyages. He had now left a plate of Lead, nailed faſt to a mighty great tree (greater then any foure men, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hands, could fathome about; on which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen theſe words, directed to our Captaine.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:10680:8"/>The ſmoake which wee ſawe, was occationed by a fire, which the ſaid <hi>Garret</hi> and his Company, had made before their departure, in a very great tree (not farre from this which had the lead nayled on it) which had continued burning at leaſt fiue dayes before our arriuall.</p>
            <p>This aduertiſement notwithſtanding, our Captaine meant not to depart, before he had built his Pinnaſes, which were yet aboard in peices, for which purpoſe hee knew this Port, a moſt conuenient place. And therfore aſſoone as we had moared our Ships, our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine commanded his Pinnaſes to be brought aſhore, for the Carpenters to ſet vp, himſelfe employing all his other company in fortifying a place, which he had choſen out, as a moſt fit plot, of three quarters of an acre of ground, to make ſome ſtrength or ſafety for the preſent, as ſufficiently as the meanes he had would afford, which was performed, by felling of great trees, and bowſing and haling them together with great Pulleis and halſers, vntill they were incloſed to the water, and then letting others fall vpon them, vntill they had raiſed with trees and boughes thirty foot in height round about, leauing onely one gate to iſſue at, neere the waters ſide, which euery night (that wee might ſleepe in more ſafety and ſecurity) was ſhut vp, with a great tree drawne athwart it. The whole plott was built in a Pentagonall forme, to wit, of fiue equall ſides and angles, of which angles two were toward the ſea, and that ſide between them was left open, for the eaſie launching of our Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the other foure equall ſides were wholely (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the gate before mentioned) firmely cloſed vp. Without, inſteed of a trench, the ground was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10680:8"/>
ridd for fifty foote ſpace, round about. The reſt was very thick with trees, of which many were of thoſe kindes, which are neuer without greene leaues, till they are dead at the roote (excepting onely one kinde of tree amongſt them, much like to our Aſh, which when the ſunne commeth right ouer them, cauſing great raines, ſuddenly caſteth all their leaues, <hi>viz.</hi> within three dayes, and yet within ſix dayes after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all greene againe.

One of them ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially was marked to haue had ſeauen of thoſe ſtaies or buttreſſes, for the ſupporting of his greatnes and height, which being meaſured with a line cloſe by the barke and neere to the ground, as it was indented or extant, was found to be aboue thirty nine yards about. The wood of thoſe trees, is as heauy or heauier then <hi>Brafill</hi> or <hi>Lingnum vitae,</hi> and is in colour white.</p>
            <p>The next day after wee had arriued,<note place="margin">Iuly 1·</note> there came alſo into that bay, an Engliſh Bark of the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> of Sir <hi>Edwaad Horſeys,</hi> wherein <hi>Iames Rauſe</hi> was Captaine and <hi>Iohn Ouery</hi> Maſter, with thirty men; of which, ſome had beene with our Captaine in the ſame place the yeere before. They brought in with them a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Caruell of <hi>Siuell</hi> (which hee had taken the day before, athwart of that place, being a Caruell of <hi>Aduiſo</hi> bound for <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi>) and alſo one Sallop with Oares, which he had taken at Cape <hi>Blanck.</hi> This Captaine <hi>Rauſe</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iuly 20.</note>Within ſeauen dayes after his comming, hauing ſet vp our Pinnaces, and diſpatched all our buſines, in prouiding all things neceſſary, out of our ſhips into our Pinnaces: wee departed from that harbrough, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſayle in the morning towards <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing our courſe till wee came to the Iles of <hi>Pinos:</hi> where being within three dayes arriued, wee found two Fregates of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> lading planck and timber from thence.<note place="margin">Iuly 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Negroes which were in thoſe Fregates, gaue vs ſome particuler vnderſtanding of the preſent ſtate of the towne: and beſides, tolde vs that they had heard a report, that certaine ſouldiers, ſhould come thither ſhortly, and were daily looked for, from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of <hi>Panama</hi> and the countrey thereabout, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the towne againſt the <hi>Symerons</hi> (A black people, which about 80. yeares paſt, fledd from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> their Maſters, by reaſon of their cruelty, and are ſince growne to a nation, vnder two Kings of their owne: the one inhabiteth to the weſt, th'other to the Eaſt of the way from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to <hi>Panama</hi>) which had neere ſurpriſed it about ſix weekes before.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine willing to vſe thoſe Negroes well (not hurting himſelfe) ſet them aſhore vpon the maine, that they might perhaps ioyne themſelues to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and gaine their liberty if they would, or if they would not, yet by reaſon of the length and troubleſomenes of the way by land to <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios,</hi> hee might preuent any notice of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, which they ſhould be able to giue. For hee was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10680:9"/>
loath to put the towne to too much charge (which hee knew they would willingly beſtowe) in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before hand, for his entertainment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee haſtned his going thither, with as much ſpeed and ſecrecy as poſibly hee could.</p>
            <p>To this end, diſpoſing of all his companies, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they inclined moſt, hee left the three Ships and the Caruell with Captaine <hi>Rauſe,</hi> and choſe into his foure Pinnaces (Captaine <hi>Rauſes</hi> Shallop made the fourth) beſides fifty three of our men, twenty more of Captaine <hi>Rauſes</hi> company, with which hee ſeemed competently furniſhed, to atcheiue what hee intended: eſpecially hauing proportioned, according to his owne purpoſe, and our mens diſpoſition, their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz</hi> ſix Targets, ſix Firepikes, twelue Pikes, twenty foure Muskets and Calliuers, ſixteene Bowes, and ſix Partizans, two Drums, and two Trompets.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing parted from our company:<note place="margin">Iuly 28.</note> wee arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the Iland of <hi>Catinaas,</hi> being twenty fiue leagues diſtant; about fiue dayes after, there wee landed all in the morning betimes: and our Captaine trained his men, deliuering them their ſeuerall weapons and armes, which hitherto hee had kept very faire and ſafe in good caske: and exhorting them after his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hee declared the greatnes of the hope of good things that was there: the weaknes of the towne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnwalled, and the hope hee had of preuailing to recompence his wrongs, eſpecially now that hee ſhould come with ſuch a crew, who were like minded with himſelfe; and at ſuch a time, as hee ſhould bee vtterly vndiſcouered.</p>
            <p>Therefore euen that afternoone, hee cauſeth vs to ſet ſaile for <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> ſo that before ſunne ſet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10680:10"/>
wee were as farre as <hi>Rio Franciſco</hi>: thence hee led vs hard aboard the ſhore (that wee might not bee deſcried of the watch houſe) vntill that being come within two leagues of the point of the Bay, hee cauſed vs to ſtrike a hull, and caſt our grappers, riding ſo vntill it was darke night.</p>
            <p>Then wee waighed againe and ſet ſayle, rowing hard aboard the ſhore, with aſmuch ſilence as wee could, till wee recouered the point of the harbor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the high land: there wee ſtayed all ſilent, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to attempt the towne in the dawning of the day, after that wee had repoſed our ſelues for a while.</p>
            <p>But our Captaine with ſome others of his beſt men, finding that our people were talking of the greatnes of the towne, and what their ſtrength might bee, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the report of the Negroes that wee tooke at the Ile of <hi>Pinos</hi>: thought it beſt to put theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits out of their heads, and therefore to take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the riſing of the moone that night, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them that it was the day dawning. By this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion we were at the towne, a large hower ſooner then firſt was purpoſed. For wee arriued there by three of the clock after midnight: at what time it fortuned that a Ship of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of ſixtie Tunnes, laden with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wines and other commodities, which had but lately come into the Bay, and had not yet furld her ſprit-ſaile, eſpying our foure Pinnaces, being an extraordinary number, and thoſe rowing with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oares, ſent away her Gundeloe towards the towne, to giue warning: but our Captaine percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, cut betwixt her and the towne, forcing her to goe to th'other ſide of the Bay: whereby wee landed without impeachment, although wee found
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10680:10"/>
one gunner vpon the platforme, in the very place where wee landed, being a ſandy pray and no key at all, not paſt twenty yards from the houſes.</p>
            <p>There wee found ſix great Peeces of braſſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, mounted vpon their cariages, ſome Demy, ſome whole Culuering: wee preſently diſmounted them, the gunner fled, the towne tooke alarme (being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ready thereto, by reaſon of their often diſquieting, by their neere neighbours the <hi>Symerons</hi>) as wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, not onely by the noyſe and cries of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but by the bell ringing out, and drums running vp and downe the towne.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine according to the directions which hee had giuen ouer night, to ſuch as hee had made choice of for the purpoſe, left twelue to keepe the Pinnaſes, that wee might be ſure of a ſafe retreat, if the worſt befell. And hauing made ſure worke of the platforme before hee would enter the towne, hee thought beſt, firſt to view the mount, on the Eaſt ſide of the towne, where hee was informed, by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry intelligences the yeare before, they had an intent to plant Ordinance, which might ſcoure round about the towne. Therefore leauing one halfe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to make a ſtand at the foote of the mount, hee marched vp preſently vnto the top of it, with all ſpeed to try the truth of the report for the more ſafety. There wee found no peice of Ordinance, but onely a very fit place prepared for ſuch vſe, and therefore wee left it without any of our men, and with all celerity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned downe the mount, Then our Captaine appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his brother, with <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> and ſixteene other of his men, to goe about, behinde the Kings treaſure-houſe, and enter neere the Eaſter end of the market-place:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10680:11"/>
himſelfe with the reſt, would paſſe vp the broad ſtreet, into the market place, with ſound of drum and trompet.</p>
            <p>The Firepikes diuided halfe to the one, and halfe to th'other company, ſerued no leſſe for fright to the enemy, then light of our men, who by this meanes might diſcerne euery place very well, as if it were neere day, whereas the inhabitants ſtood amazed at ſo ſtrange a fight, maruelling what the matter might bee, and imagining, by reaſon of our drums and trompets ſounding in ſo ſundry places, that wee had beene a farre greater number then wee were.</p>
            <p>Yet by meanes of the ſoldiers, which were in the towne, and by reaſon of the time which wee ſpent in marching vp and downe the mount, the ſoldiers and the inhabitants had put themſelues in armes, and brought their companies in ſome order, at the ſouth eaſt end of the market place, neere the gouernors houſe, and not farre from the gate of the towne, which is only one, leading towards <hi>Panama,</hi> hauing (as it ſeemes) gathered themſelues thither, either that in the gouernors ſight they might ſhew their valor, if it might preuaile, or elſe that by the gate, they might beſt take their <hi>vale,</hi> and eſcape redieſt.</p>
            <p>And to make a ſhew of farre greater numbers of ſhot, or elſe of a cuſtome they had, by the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to terrify the <hi>Symerons,</hi> they had hung lines with matches lighted, ouerthwart the weſter-end of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, betwene the church and the croſſe, as though there had beene in a readines ſome company of ſhott, whereas indeed there was not paſt two or three that taught theſe lines to dance, till they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ranne away, aſſoone as they perceiued they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10680:11"/>
were diſcouered.</p>
            <p>But the Souldiers and ſuch as were joyned with them, preſented vs with a jolly hotte volue of ſhot, beating full vpon the egreſſe of that ſtreete, in which we marched, and leuelling very lowe, ſo as their bullers oft times grazed on the ſand. We ſtood not to anſwer them in like tearmes; but hauing diſcharged our firſt volly of ſhot, and feathered them with our arrowes (which our Captaine had cauſed to be made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in <hi>England,</hi> not great ſheafe arrowes, but fine ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhafts; very carefully reſerued for the ſeruice) wee came to the puſh of pike, ſo that our fire-pikes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well armed and made of purpoſe, did vs very great ſeruice. For our men with their pikes and ſhort weapons, in ſhort time tooke ſuch order among theſe gallants, ſome vſing the but-end of their peeces in ſtead of other weapons, that partly by reaſon of our arrowes, which did vs there notable ſeruice, partly by occaſion of this ſtrange and ſuddaine cloſing with them, in this manner vnlooked for, and the rather for that at the very inſtant, our Captaines brother, with the other Company, with their fire-pikes, entred the market place by th'eaſter ſtreet: they caſting downe their weapons, fled all out of the Towne by the gate aforeſaid, which had beene built for a barre to keepe out of the Towne the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who had often aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, but now ſerued for a gap for the Spaniards to fly at.</p>
            <p>In following and returning, diuers of our men were hurt, with the weapons which the enemy had let fall as he fled: ſomewhat, for that wee marched with ſuch ſpeed, but more for that they lay ſo thicke and croſſe on the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:10680:12"/>Being returned, we made our ſtand neere the midſt of the market place, where a tree groweth hard by the Croſſe; whence our Captaine ſent of our men to ſtay the ringing of the alarme Bell, which had continued all this while: but the Church being very ſtrongly built and faſt ſhut, they could not without firing (which our Captaine forbad) get into the ſteeple where the Bell hung.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, our Captaine hauing taken two or three Spaniards in their flight, commanded them to ſhew him the Gouernours houſe, where hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood was the ordinary place of vnlading the Moyles, of all the treaſure which came from <hi>Panamah</hi> by the Kings appointment: Although the ſiluer only was kept there: the gold, pearle and jewels (being there once entred by the Kings Officer) was caried from thence to the Kings treaſure-houſe not farre off, being a houſe very ſtrongly built of lime and ſtone, for the ſafe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereof.</p>
            <p>At our comming to the Gouernours houſe, wee found the great dore (where the Moyles doe vſually vnlade) euen then opened a Candle, lighted vpon the top of the ſtaires; and a faire Gennet ready ſadled, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Gouernour himſelfe, or ſome other of his houſehold to carry it after him. By meanes of this light, we ſaw a huge heape of ſiluer, in that nether roome: being a pile of barres of ſiluer, of (as neareas we could gueſſe) ſeauenty foote in length, of ten foot in breadth, &amp; twelue foote in height, piled vp againſt the wall, each barre was betweene thirty fiue and forty pound in weight. At ſight hereof our Captaine commanded ſtraightly that none of vs ſhould touch a barre of ſiluer, but ſtand vpon our weapons, becauſe the Towne was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10680:12"/>
full of people, and there was in the Kings treaſure-houſe neere the waters ſide, more gold and jewels then all our foure Pinnaſes could carry, which wee would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet ſome in hand to breake open, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Spaniards reports of the ſtrength of it.</p>
            <p>Wee were no ſooner returned to our ſtrength, but there was a report brought by ſome of our men, that our Pinnaſes were in danger to be taken, and that if we our ſelues got not aboard before day, we ſhould be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with multitude both of Souldiers and townes-people. This report had his ground from one <hi>Diego</hi> a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro,</hi> who in the time of the firſt conflict, came and called to our Pinnaces, to knowe whether they were Captaine <hi>Drakes?</hi> &amp; vpon anſwer receiued, continued intreating to be taken aboard (though he had firſt three or foure ſhot made at him) vntill at length they fetcht him, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, that not paſt eight dayes before our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall the King had ſent thether ſome hundred and fifty Souldiers to guard the Towne againſt the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and the Towne at this time was full of people beſides: which, all the rather beleeued, becauſe it agreed with the report of the Negroes, which wee tooke before at the Ile of <hi>Pinos:</hi> and therefore our Captaine ſent his brother and <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> to vnderſtand the truth thereof. They found our men, which we left in our Pinnaces, much frighted, by reaſon that they ſawe great Troops and Companies running vp and downe, with matches light, ſome with other weapons; crying <hi>Que gente? que gente?</hi> which hauing not beene at the firſt conflict, but comming from the vtter ends of the Towne (being at leaſt as bigge as <hi>Plimouth</hi>) came many times neere vs, and vnderſtanding that we were Engliſh, diſcharged their peeces and ran away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:10680:13"/>Preſently after this, a mighty ſhower of raine, with a terrible ſtorme of thunder and lightning, fell, which powred downe ſo vehemently (as it vſually doth in thoſe Countries) that before we could recouer the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a certaine ſhade or pent-houſe, at the Weſter end of the Kings treaſure-houſe (which ſeemeth to haue beene built there of purpoſe to auoid Sunne and raine) ſome of our bow-ſtrings were wet, and ſome of our match and powder hurt: which while we were carefull of, to refurniſh and ſupply; diuers of our men, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on the reports lately brought vs, were muttering of the Forces of the Towne, which our Captaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, told them, that he had brought them to the mouth of the treaſure of the world, if they would want it, they might henceforth blame no body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And therefore as ſoone as the ſtorme beganne to aſwage of his furye (which was a long halfe houre) willing to giue his men no longer leaſure to demurre of thoſe doubts, nor yet allow the Enemy farther reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to gather themſelues together: he ſtept foreward, commanding his brother, with <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> and the Company appointed them, to breake the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-houſe; the reſt to follow him, to keepe the ſtrength of the market place, till they had diſpatched the buſineſſe for which they came.</p>
            <p>But as he ſtept forward, his ſtrength and ſight and ſpeech failed him, and he began to faint for want of blood, which as then wee perceiued, had, in great quantity, iſſued vpon the ſand, out of a wound recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his legge in the firſt encounter, whereby though he felt ſome paine, yet (for that hee perceiued diuers of the Company, hauing already gotten many good things, to be very ready to take all occaſions, of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10680:13"/>
themſelues, out of that conceited danger) would he not haue it knowne to any, till this his fainting, againſt his will, bewrayed it; the blood hauing firſt filled the very prints which our foote-ſteps made, to the great diſmay of all our Company, who thought it not credible, that one man ſhould be able to ſpare ſo much blood and liue.</p>
            <p>And therefore euen they, which were willingeſt to haue aduentured moſt, for ſo faire a booty, would in no caſe hazard their Captaines life; but (hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him ſomewhat to drinke wherewith he recouered himſelfe, and hauing bound his Scarfe about his legge, for the ſtopping of the blood) entreated him to bee content to goe with them aboord, there to haue his wound ſearched and dreſt, and then to returne a ſhoare againe if he thought good.</p>
            <p>This when they could not perſwade him vnto (as who knew it vtterly time) impoſſible, at leaſt very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that euer they ſhould (for that) returne againe, to recouer the ſtate in which they now were: and was of opinion, that it were more honorable for himſelfe, to jeopard his life for ſo great a benefit, then to leaue off ſo high an enterpriſe vnperformed:) they joyned altogether, and with force mingled with faire intreaty, they bare him aboard his Pinnace, and ſo abandoned a moſt rich ſpoile for the preſent, only to preſerue their Captaines life, as being reſolued of him, that while they enjoyed his preſence, and had him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, they might recouer wealth ſufficient; but if once they loſt him, they ſhould hardly bee able to recouer home, no not with that which they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten already.</p>
            <p>Thus wee embarqued by breake of the day,<note place="margin">Iuly. 29.</note> hauing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10680:14"/>
beſides our Captaine, many of our men wounded, though none ſlaine but one Trumpetter: whereupon though our Chyrurgeons were buſily employed, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding remedies and ſalues for their wounds: yet the maine care was reſpected by all the reſt; ſo that before we departed out of the Harbour for the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our Company, wee tooke the aforeſaid Ship of Wines without great reſiſtance. But before we had her free off the Hauen, they of the Towne had made meanes to bring one of their Culuerins, which we had diſmounted, ſo as they made a ſhot at vs, but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred vs not from carrying forth the prize to the Ile <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimientos,</hi> or <hi>The Ile of victualles</hi>; which is an Iland that lyeth without the Bay to the Weſtwards, about a league off the Towne, where we ſtayed the two next dayes, to cure our wounded men, and refreſh our ſelues, in the goodly Gardens which we there found, abounding with great ſtore of all dainty rootes and fruites, beſides great plenty of Poultry and other Fowles, no leſſe ſtrange then delicate.</p>
            <p>Shortly, vpon our firſt arriuall in this Iland, the Gouernour and the reſt of his aſſiſtants in the Towne (as wee afterwards vnderſtood) ſent vnto our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a proper Gentleman of meane ſtature, good complexion, and faire ſpoken, a principall Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of the late ſent Garriſon, to view in what ſtate wee were. At his comming hee proteſted he came to vs of meere good will, for that wee had attempted, ſo great and incredible a matter with ſo few men: and that at the firſt they feared that wee had beene French, at whoſe hands they knew they ſhould finde no mercy: but after they perceiued by our Arrowes, that we were Engliſhmen, their feare were the leſſe, for that they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10680:14"/>
knew, that though we tooke the Treaſure of the place, yet we would not vſe cruelty towards their perſons.</p>
            <p>But albeit this his affection gaue him cauſe enough, to come aboard ſuch, whoſe vertues ſo he honoured, yet the Gouernour alſo had not only conſented to his comming, but directly ſent him, vpon occaſion that diuers of the Towne affirmed (ſaid hee) that they knew our Captaine, who the laſt two yeares had beene often on their coaſt, and had alwayes vſed their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons very well. And therefore deſired to knowe, firſt, whether our Captaine were the ſame Captaine <hi>Drake</hi> or no? and next, becauſe many of their men were wounded with our Arrowes, whether they were poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned or no? and how their wounds might beſt be cured? laſtly what victualles wee wanted, or other neceſſaries? of which the Gouereour promiſed by him to ſupply and furniſh vs, as largely as hee durſt. Our Captaine although he thought this Souldier but a Spye: yet vſed him very curteouſly, and anſwered him to his Gouernours demands. That he was the ſame <hi>Drake</hi> whome they meant: it was neuer his manner to poyſon his Arrowes: they might cure their wounded by ordinary Chirurgery: as for wants hee knewe the Iland of <hi>Baſtimientos</hi> had ſufficient, and could furniſh him if hee liſted: but hee wanted nothing but ſome of that ſpeciall commodity, which that Countrey yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to content himſelfe and his Company. And therefore hee aduiſed the Gouernour to hold open his eyes, for before he departed, if God lent him life and leaue, he meant to reape ſome of their Harueſt, which they get out of the Earth, and ſend into <hi>Spaine</hi> to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all the Earth.</p>
            <p>To this anſwere vnlooked for, this Gentleman
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10680:15"/>
replyed: If he might without offence moue ſuch a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, what ſhould then be the cauſe, of our departing from that Towne at this time, where was aboue three hundred and ſixty Tunne of ſiluer ready for the Fleete, &amp; much more Golde in value, reſting in yron cheſts in the Kings Treaſure-houſe? But when our Captaine had ſhewed him the true cauſe of his vnwilling retreat aboord; he acknowledged, that we had no leſſe reaſon in departing, then courage in attempting: and no doubt did eaſily ſee, that it was not for the Towne to ſeeke reuenge of vs, by manning forth ſuch Fregates or other veſſels, as they had: but better to content themſelues and prouide for their owne defence. Thus with great fauour and courteous entertainement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch gifts from our Captaine as moſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him: after dinner hee was in ſuch ſort diſmiſſed, to make report of that he had ſeene, that he proteſted, he was neuer ſo much honored of any in his life.</p>
            <p>After his departure, the Negroe forementioned, being examined more fully, confirmed this report of the gold and ſiluer, with many other intelligences of importance, eſpecially how wee might haue gold and ſiluer enough if we would, by meanes of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> whome though hee had betrayed diuers times (being vſed thereto by his Maſters) ſo that he knew they would kill him, if they gat him: yet if our Captaine would vndertake his protection, hee durſt aduenture his life, becauſe hee knewe our Captaines name was moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and highly honored of them.</p>
            <p>This report miniſtred occaſion to further conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: for which, becauſe this place ſeemed not the ſafeſt; as being neither the healthieſt nor quieteſt. The next day in the morning wee all ſet our courſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10680:15"/>
for the Ile of <hi>Pinnos</hi> or <hi>Port Plenty,</hi> where wee had left our Ships, continuing all that day, and the next, till towards night before wee recouered it. Wee were the longer in this courſe, for that our Captaine ſent away his brother and <hi>Ellis Hixon</hi> to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to ſearch the Riuer of <hi>Chagro,</hi> where himſelfe had beene the yeare before, and yet was carefull to gaine more notice of: it being a Riuer which tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the ſouthward, within ſix leagues of <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> where is a litle towne called <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> whence all the treaſure, that was vſually brought thither from <hi>Panams</hi> by Moyles, was imbarqued in Fregates, downe that Riuer into the North ſea, and ſo to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi> It ebbeth and floweth not farre into the land, and therefore it asketh three dayes rowing with a fine Pinnace to paſſe from the mouth to <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> but one day and a night ſeruerh to returne downe the Riuer.</p>
            <p>At our returne to our Ships, in our conſultation,<note place="margin">Auguſt. 1.</note> Captaine <hi>Rauſe</hi> forecaſting diuers doubts, of our ſafe continuance vpon that coaſt, being now diſcouered, was willing to depart: and our Captaine no leſſe willing to diſmiſſe him: and therefore aſſoone as our Pinnaces returned from <hi>Chagro,</hi> with ſuch aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they were ſent for, about eight dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Captaine <hi>Rauſe</hi> tooke his leaue,<note place="margin">Auguſt. 7.</note> leaving vs in the Ile aforeſaid, where wee had remained fiue or ſix dayes. In which meane tyme, hauing put all things in a readines, our Captaine reſolued, with his two Ships and three Pinnaces to goe to <hi>Carthagene,</hi> whither in ſayling we ſpent ſome 6. dayes, by reaſon of the calmes which came often vpon vs: but all this time wee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted nothing that wee might haue done by the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10680:16"/>
way, neither at <hi>Tolou,</hi> nor otherwhere, becauſe wee would not bee diſcouered.</p>
            <p>Wee came to anchor with our two Ships in the evening in ſeauen fadome water,<note place="margin">Auguſt 13.</note> betweene the Ilands of <hi>Chareſha</hi> and Saint <hi>Barnards:</hi> our Captaine led the three Pinnaces, about the Iland, into the harbor of <hi>Carthagene</hi>; where at the very entry, hee found a Fregate at anchor, aboard which was onely one old man; who being demanded, where the reſt of his company was? anſwered, that they were gone aſhoare in their Gundeloe that euening, to fight about a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe: and voluntarily related to our Captaine that two houres before night, there paſt by them a Pinnace, with ſayle and Oares, as faſt as euer they could row, calling to him, whether there had not beene any <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Frenchmen</hi> there lately? and vppon anſwere that there had beene none: they bid them looke to themſelues: that within an houre, that this Pinnace was come to the vtterſide of <hi>Carthagene,</hi> there were many great Peeces ſhot off, whereupon one going to top, to deſcry what might bee the cauſe? eſpied, ouer the land, diuers Fregates and ſmall ſhipping, bringing themſelues within the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>This report our Captaine credited, the rather, for that himſelfe had heard the report of the Ordinance, at ſea, and perceiued ſufficiently, that hee was now deſcried: notwithſtanding, in farther examination, of this old mariner, hauing vnderſtood, that there was, within the next point, a great ſhip of Siuell, which had here diſcharged her loading, and rid now with her yards a croſſe, being bound the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for Saint <hi>Domingo:</hi> our Captaine tooke this old man into his Pinnace to verifie that which hee had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10680:16"/>
informed, and rowed towards this Ship, which as wee came neere it, hayled vs, asking whence our Shallops were? wee anſwered, from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi>: ſtraight way they raild and reuiled: wee gaue no heed to their words, but euery Pinnace, according to our Captaines order: one on the ſtarboord bough, the other on the ſtarboord quarter, and the Captaine in the midſhip on the larboord ſide, forthwith boarded her, though wee had ſome difficulty to enter, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her height, being of two hundred forty Tunne. But aſſoone as wee entred vpon the decks, we threwe downe the grates and ſpardecks, to preuent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from annoying vs with their cloſe fights: who then perceiuing that wee were poſſeſſed of their Ship, ſtowed themſelues all in hold with their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, except two or three yonkers, which were found afore the beetes: when hauing light out of our Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wee found no danger of the enemy remaining, wee cut their Cables at halfe, and with our three Pinnaces, towed her without the Iland, into the ſound right afore the Towne, without danger of their great ſhott.</p>
            <p>Meane while, the Towne hauing intelligence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by their watch, tooke th'alarme, rong out their Bells, ſhott off about thirty Peeces of great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, put all their men in a readines horſe and foote, came downe to the very point of the wood, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Caliuers, to impeach vs if they might, in going forth.</p>
            <p>The next morning our Ships tooke two Fregats,<note place="margin">Auguſt 14.</note> in which were two, who called themſelues the Kings <hi>Scriuanos,</hi> the one of <hi>Carthagene,</hi> th'other of <hi>Veragua,</hi> with ſeauen Mariners and two Negroes: who had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10680:17"/>
beene at <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and were now bound for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thagene,</hi> with double letters of aduiſe, to certifie them that Captaine <hi>Drake had beene at Nombre de Dios, had taken it, and had it not beene that hee was hurt with ſome bleſſed ſhott, by all likelihood hee had ſackt it: hee was yet ſtill vpon the Coaſt: they ſhould therefore carefully prepare for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that our Captaine had brought all his fleet together: at the <hi>Scriuanos</hi> entreaties, hee was content to doe them all fauor, in ſetting them and all their companies a ſhore; and ſo bare thence with the Ilands of Saint <hi>Barnards,</hi> about three leagues off the Towne: where wee found great ſtore of fiſh for our refreſhing.</p>
            <p>Here our Captaine conſidering that hee was now diſcouered, vpon 2. of the cheefeſt places of all the Coaſt, and yet not meaning to leaue it, till hee had found the <hi>Simerons,</hi> and made his voiage, as hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, which would require ſome length of time &amp; ſure manning of his Pinnaces, hee determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to burne one of his Ships, and make of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtorehouſe, that his Pinnaces (which could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) might be throughly mand, and ſo he might be able to abide any time. But knowing the affection of his company, how loath they were to leaue either of their Ships, being both ſo good Saylers and ſo well furniſhed, hee purpoſed in himſelfe by ſome pollicy, to make them moſt willing to effect that hee intended. And therefore ſent for one <hi>Thomas Moone</hi> (who was Carpenter in the Swanne) and taking him into his Cabbin, chargeth him to conceale for a time, a peice of ſeruice, which hee muſt in any caſe conſent to doe aboord his owne Ship: that was, in the middle of the ſecond watch, to goe downe ſecretly into the well of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10680:17"/>
the Ship, and with a great ſpike-gimlet, to boare three hoales, as neere the keele as hee could, and lay ſomething againſt it, that the force of the water en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, might make no great noiſe, nor be diſcouered by boyling vp: <hi>Thomas Moone</hi> at the hearing hereof being vtterly diſmaied, deſired to knowe what cauſe there might bee, to moue him to ſincke ſo good a Bark, of his owne, new, and ſtrong, and that by his meanes, who had beene in two ſo rich and gainefull voyages in her with himſelfe heretofore: If his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Maſter, and the reſt of the company ſhould knowe of ſuch his fact, hee thought verily they would kill him. But when our Captaine had imparted to him his cauſes, and had perſwaded him with promiſe that it ſhould not bee knowne, till all of them ſhould bee glad of it: hee vndertooke it, and did it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>The next morning our Captaine tooke his Pinnace very early,<note place="margin">Auguſt 15.</note> purpoſing to goe a fiſhing (for that there is very great ſtore on all the Coaſt) and falling aboord the Swanne, calleth for his brother to goe with him, who riſing ſuddenly, anſwereth that hee would follow preſently, or if it would pleaſe him to ſtay a very little, hee would attend him. Our Captaine perceiuing the feate wrought, would not haſten him, but in rowing away, demanded of them, why their Bark was ſo deepe? as making no great account of it: but by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this demand, his brother ſent one downe to the Steward, to know whether there were any water in the Ship? or what other cauſe might bee? The Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard haſtily ſtepping downe at his vſuall skuttle, was wett vp to the waſte, and ſhifting with more haſt to come vp againe as if the water had followed him, cryed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10680:18"/>
out that the Ship was full of water. There was no need to haſten the company, ſome to the pumpe, others to ſearch for the leake, which the Captaine of the Bark ſeeing they did on all hands very willingly, hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his brother, and certified him of the ſtrange chance befalne them that night; that whereas they had not pumpt twiſe in ſix weekes before, now they had ſix foote water in hold: therefore hee deſireth leaue from attending him in fiſhing, to intend the ſearch and remedy of the leake: and when our Captaine with his company profered to goe to helpe them, hee anſwered, they had men enough aboord, and prayed him to continue his fiſhing, that they might haue ſome part of it for their dinner. Thus returning, hee found his company had taken great paine, but had freeed the water very little: yet ſuch was their loue to the Barke (as our Captaine well knew) that they ceaſed not, but to the vtmoſt of their ſtrength, laboured all that they might till three in the afternoone: by which time, the company per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, that though they had beene relieued by our Captaine himſelfe and many of his company, yet they were not able to free aboue a foote and a halfe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and could haue no likelihood of finding the leake, had now a leſſe liking of her then before, and greater content to hear of ſome means fot remedy: wherevpon our Captaine conſulting with them what they thought beſt to bee done: found that they had more deſire to haue all as he thought fitt, then iudgement to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any meanes of remedy. And therefore hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that himſelfe would goe in the Pinnace, till hee could prouide him ſome hanſome Fregate, and that his brother ſhould bee Captaine in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10680:18"/>
and the Maſter ſhould alſo bee there placed with him, inſteed of this: which ſeeing they could not ſaue, hee would haue fired, that th'enemy might neuer recouer her: but firſt all the Pinnaces ſhould bee brought aboord her, that euery one might take out of her whatſoeuer they lackt or liked. This, though the company at the firſt marueiled at, yet preſently it was put in execution and performed that night: our Captaine had his deſire, and men enough for his Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces.</p>
            <p>The next morning, wee reſolued to ſeeke out ſome fitt place, in the ſound of <hi>Darienne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. 16.</note> where wee might ſafely leaue our Shipp at Anchor, not diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the enemy, who thereby might imagine vs quite departed from the Coaſt, and wee the meane time better follow our purpoſes with our Pinnaces; of which our Captaine would himſelfe take two to <hi>Rio Grande,</hi> and the third leaue with his brother to ſeeke the <hi>Symerons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon this reſolution,<note place="margin">Aug. 21.</note> wee ſet ſaile preſently for the ſaid ſound: which within fiue dayes wee recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, abſteining of purpoſe, from all ſuch occaſion, as might hinder our determination, or bewray our being vpon the Coaſt. Aſſoone as we arriued, where our Captaine intended, and had choſen a fit and conuenient road (out of all trade) for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; wee repoſed our ſelues there, for ſome fifteene dayes, keeping our ſelues cloſe, that the brute of our being vpon the Coaſt might ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But in the meane time wee were not idle: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch ordinary workes, as our Captaine euery month did vſually enure vs to, about the trimming and fitting of his Pinnaces, for their better ſayling
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10680:19"/>
and rowing: hee cauſed vs to ridd a large plot of ground, both of Trees and brakes and to build vs hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſufficient for all ourlodging, and one eſpecially for all our publique meetings; wherein the Negroe which fled to vs before did vs great ſeruice, as being well acquainted with the Country, and their meanes of building. Our Archers made themſelues Butts to ſhoot at, becauſe wee had many that delighted in that exerciſe, and wanted not a Fletcher to keepe our Bowes and Arrowes in order. The reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, euery one as hee liked beſt, made his diſport at Boules, Quoits, Keiles, &amp;c. For our Captaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one halfe of their company to paſſe their time thus, euery other day interchangeably, the other halfe being enioyned to the neceſſary workes, about our Ship and Pinnaces, and the prouiding of freſh victuall, Fiſh, Foule, Hogs, Deere, Conies, &amp;c. whereof there is great plenty. Here our Smithes ſet vp their Forge, as they vſed, being furniſhed out of <hi>England,</hi> which Anuill, Iron, Coales, and all manner of neceſſaries, which ſtood vs in great ſteed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Septem. 5.</note>At the end of theſe fifteene dayes, our Captaine leauing his Ship in his brothers charge, to keepe all things in order; himſelfe tooke with him, according to his former determination, two Pinnaces for <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Carthagene,</hi> but out of ſight, when wee were within two leagues of the Riuer,<note place="margin">Septem. 8.</note> wee landed to the weſtwards on the maine, where we ſawe great ſtore of Cattle. There wee found ſome Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who asking vs in freindly ſort, in broken <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> what wee would haue, and vnderſtanding that wee deſired freſh victuals in traffick; they tooke ſuch Cattle for vs, as wee needed, with eaſe and ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10680:19"/>
as if they had a ſpeciall Commandment ouer them, whereas they would not abide vs to come neere them: And this alſo they did willingly, becauſe our Captaine (according to his cuſtome) contented them for their paines, with ſuch things as they account great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of, in ſuch ſort that they promiſed, we ſhould haue there of them at any time, what we would.</p>
            <p>The ſame day wee departed thence to <hi>Rio grand,</hi> where wee entred about three of the clocke in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noone. There are two entrings into this Riuer, of which we entred the Weſtermoſt called <hi>Boca chica.</hi> The freſhet of this Riuer is ſo great, that we being halfe a league from the mouth of it, filled freſh water for our beuerage.</p>
            <p>From three a clocke till darke night wee rowed vp the ſtreame, but the current was ſo ſtrong downewards, that we got but two leagues all that time. We moared our Pinnaces to a tree that night: for that preſently with the cloſing of the euening, there fell a monſtrous ſhower of raine, with ſuch ſtrange and terrible claps of thunder, and flaſhes of lightning, as made vs, not a little to meruell at, although our Captaine had beene acquainted with ſuch like in that Countrey, and told vs that they continue, ſeldome longer then three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an houre. This ſtorme was no ſooner ceaſt, but it became very calme, and therewith there came ſuch an innumerable multitude, of a kind of Flies of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey called <hi>Muskitos</hi> (like our Gnats) which bite ſo ſpitefully, that we could not reſt all that night, nor find meanes to defend our ſelues from them, by reaſon of the heate of the Countrey: the beſt remedy wee then found againſt them, was the juyce of Lemmons.</p>
            <p>At the breake of day we departed, rowing in the eddy,

and haling vp by the trees where the eddy failed, with great labor,<note place="margin">Septemb. 9.</note> by ſpels, without ceaſing, each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their halfe houre glaſſe: without meeting any, till about three a clocke afternoone, by which time we could get but fiue leagues a head. Then we eſpied a Canow with two Indians fiſhing in the Riuer: but we ſpake not to them, leaſt ſo wee might be deſcried: nor they to vs, as taking vs to be Spaniards. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an houre after wee eſpyed certaine houſes, on the other ſide of the Riuer, whoſe channell is twenty fiue fathome deepe, and his bredth ſo great, that a man can ſcantly be diſcerned from ſide to ſide. Yet a Spaniard which kept thoſe houſes, had eſpied our Pinnaces, and thinking wee had beene his Countrey-men, made a ſmoake, for a ſignall to turne that way, as being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſpeake with vs. After that, we eſpying this ſmoak, had made with it, and were halfe the Riuer ouer, he wheaued vs with his hat, and his long hanging ſleeues to come aſhoare: But as we drew neerer vnto him, and he diſcerned that we were not thoſe he looked for, he tooke his heeles, and fled from his houſes, which we found to be, fiue in number, all full of white Ruske, dryed Bacon, that Country Cheeſe (like Holland Cheeſe in faſhion, but farre more delicate in taſte, of which they ſend into <hi>Spayne</hi> as ſpeciall Preſents) many ſortes of ſweet Meats, and Conſerues; with great ſtore of Sugar: being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to ſerue the Fleet returning to <hi>Spayne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this ſtore of Victuals we loaded our Pinnaces, and by the ſhutting in of the day we were ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; for that we haſtned the rather, by reaſon of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence giuen vs by certaine Indian Women which we found in thoſe houſes: that the Fregates (theſe are ordinarily thirty, or vpwards, which vſually tranſport

            <p>In this returne, wee deſcried a Ship, a Bark, and a Fregate, of which the Ship and Fregate went for <hi>Carthagene,</hi> but the Bark was bound to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with the winde eaſterly, ſo that wee imagined ſhe had ſome gold or treaſure going for <hi>Spaine:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee gaue her chaſe, but taking her, and finding nothing of importance in her, vnderſtanding that ſhe was bound for Sugar and Hides, wee let her goe, and hauing a good gale of winde, continued our former courſe to our Ship and company.</p>
            <p>In the way between <hi>Carthagene</hi> and <hi>Tolou,</hi> we tooke fiue or ſix Fregates, which were laden from <hi>Tolou,</hi>

            <p>This our ſtore was ſuch, as thereby wee releeued, not onely our ſelues and the <hi>Symerons,</hi> while they were with vs, but alſo two French Ships in extreame want. For in our abſence Captaine <hi>Iohn Drake</hi> hauing one of

            <p>Theſe two being very ſenſible men, choſen out by their Commander, did with all reuerence and reſpect, declare vnto our Captaine, that their Nation concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great joy of his arriuall, becauſe they knew him to be an enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not only by his late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> but alſo by his former voyages, and therefore were ready to aſſiſt and fauour his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes againſt his and their Enemies to the vttermoſt: and to that end their Captaine and Company, did ſtay at this preſent neere the mouth of <hi>Rio Diego,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what anſwere and order ſhould be giuen them: that they would haue marched by land, euen to this place, but that the way is very long, and more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, by reaſon of many ſteepe Mountaines, deepe Riuers and thicke brakes: deſiring therefore, that it might pleaſe our Captaine to take ſome order, as hee thought beſt, with all conuenient ſpeed in this behalfe. Our Captaine conſidering the ſpeech of theſe perſons, and waighing it with his former intelligences had, not only by Negroes but Spaniards alſo, whereof hee was alwayes very carefull: as alſo conferring it with his brothers informations of the great kindeneſſe, that they ſhewed him being lately with them: after he had

The ſafety of it conſiſted, not only, in that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all along that coaſt from <hi>Tolou</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> being aboue ſixty leagues, that it is a moſt goodly and plentifull Countrey, and yet inhabited not with one Spaniard, or any for the Spaniards: but eſpecially in that it lieth among a great many of goodly Ilands full of Trees, where, though there be channels, yet there are ſuch Rockes and ſhoales, that no man can enter by night, vvithout great danger, nor by day vvithout diſcouery, vvhereas our Ship might lye hidden vvithin the Trees.</p>

               <note place="margin">Sept. 22.</note> before we were quiet in this new-found Road,<note place="margin">Sept. 23.</note> which wee had but newly entred, when our two men and the former Troupe of <hi>Simerons,</hi> with twelue other whom they had met in the Mountaines, came in ſight ouer againſt our Shippe, on the maine: whence wee fet them all aboard, to their great comfort and our content: they rejoycing that they ſhould haue ſome fit opportunity, to wreake their wrongs on the Spaniards: wee hoping that now our voyage ſhould be bettered.</p>
            <p>At our firſt meeting when our Captaine had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, to ſhew him the meanes which they had to furniſh him with gold and ſiluer: they anſvvered
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10680:23"/>
plainely, that had they knowne gold had bin his deſire, they could haue ſatisfied him with ſtore, which for the preſent they could not doe, becauſe the Riuers, in which they had ſuncke great ſtore, which they had taken from the Spaniards, rather to deſpite them then for loue of gold, were now ſo high, that they could not get it out of ſuch depthes for him, and becauſe the Spaniards in theſe rainy months doe not vſe to cary their Treaſure by land.</p>
            <p>This anſwere although it were ſomewhat vnlooked for, yet nothing diſcontented vs, but rather perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs farther of their honeſt and faithfull meaning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. Therefore our Captaine to entertaine theſe fiue months, commanded all our Ordinance and Artillery a ſhoare, with all our other prouiſions: ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Pinnaces to the maine, to bring ouer great Trees, to make a Fort vpon the ſame Iland, for the planting of all our Ordinance therein, and for our ſafeguard, if the Enemy in all this time ſhould chance to come.</p>

            <p>That night wee came to an Ile, which hee called <hi>Spurkite</hi> Iland, becauſe wee found there great ſtore of ſuch a kinde a Bird in ſhape, but very delicate, of which wee killed and roaſted many; ſtaying there till the next day midnoone, when wee departed thence:<note place="margin">Octo. 8.</note> And about foure a clock recouered a big Iland in our way, where wee ſtayed all night, by reaſon that there was great ſtore of Fiſh, and eſpecially of a great kind of Shellfiſh of a foote long: we called them <hi>Whelkes.</hi>

In which our Captaine would not ſuffer vs to land, notwithſtanding our importunate deſire, becauſe hee knewe, it might be dangerous: for that they are wont to ſend Soldiers thither, when they know any men of warre vppon the Coaſt: which wee found accordingly: for within three houres after, paſſing by the point of the Iland, wee had a Volly of a hundred ſhot from them, and yet there was but one of our men hurt.</p>

            <p>That afternoone, certaine horſmen came downe to the point by the Wood ſide, and with the <hi>Scriuano</hi>

forementioned, came towards our Bark with a Flag of Truce, deſiring of our Captaine ſafe conduct for his comming and going: the which being granted, hee came aboord vs, giuing our Captaine great thankes for his manifould fauors, &amp;c. promiſing that night before day breake, to bring aſmuch victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as they would deſire, what ſhift ſo euer hee made, or what danger ſoeuer hee incurd of law and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this fell out to be nothing but a deuice of the Gouernor forced vpon the <hi>Scriuano,</hi> to delay time, till they might prouid ethemſelues of ſufficient ſtrength to entrappe vs: for which this fellow by his ſmooth ſpeech, was thought a fitt meane.<note place="margin">Octo. 19.</note> So by Sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, when wee perceiued his words but words, wee put to Sea to the weſtward of the Iland, ſome three leagues off, where wee lay at Hull the reſt of all that day and night.</p>
            <p>The next day in the afternoone,<note place="margin">Octo. 20.</note> there came out of <hi>Carthagene,</hi> two Fregats bound for Saint <hi>Domingo,</hi> the one of fifty, th'other of twelue Tonne, hauing nothing in them but ballaſt: wee tooke them, within a league of the Towne, and came to Anchor with them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Saker ſhort of the Eaſt Bulwark: there were in thoſe Fregats ſome twelue or thirteene common Mariners, which intreated to bee ſet a ſhoare: to them our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gaue the great Fregates Gundelow, and diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them.</p>
            <p>The next morning when they came downe to the Weſter point with a flagge of Truce,<note place="margin">Octo. 21.</note> our Captaine mand one of his Pinnaces and rowed a ſhoare: when wee were within a Cables length of the ſhoare, the Spaniards fled, hiding themſelues in the Woods, as being afraid of our Ordinance; but indeed to drawe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10680:25"/>
vs on to land confidently, and to preſume of our ſtrength. Our Captaine commanding the Grapnell to bee caſt out of the ſterne, veered the Pinnace a ſhore, and aſſoone as ſhee touched the ſand, hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone leapt aſhore in their ſight, to declare that hee durſt ſet his foote a land, but ſtayed not among them: to let them knowe, that though hee had not ſufficient forces to conquere them, yet hee had ſufficent iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take heed of them. And therefore perceiuing their intent, aſſoone as our Captaine was aboord, we haled off vppon our Grapner and rid a while. They preſently came forth vpon the ſand, and ſent a youth, as with a meſſage from the Gouernor, to know what our intent was, to ſtay thus vpon the Coaſt? our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine anſwered hee ment to traffique with them: for hee had Tinne, Pewter, Cloth and other Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize that they needed. The youth ſwam back againe with this anſwere; and was preſently returned, with another meſſage: that, The King had forbidden to traffique with any forraine Nation for any commodities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Powder and Shotte, of which if hee had any ſtore, they would bee his Marchants; hee anſwered, that he was come from his Country, to exchange his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for Gold and Siluer, and is not purpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne without his errand. They are like (in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to haue little reſt, if that by faire meanes they would not traffique with him. He gaue this Meſſenger a faire Shirt for a reward, and ſo returned him: who rolled his Shirt about his head and ſwamme very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
            <p>We heard no anſwere all that day, and therefore toward night wee went aboord our Fregats and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our ſelues, ſetting and keeping very orderly all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10680:25"/>
that night our watch, with great and ſmall ſhott.</p>
            <p>The next morning the winde which had beene weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly in the euening, altered to the eaſtward. About the dawning of the day, wee eſpied two Sayles tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards vs, where vpon our Captaine waighed with his Pinnaces, leauing the two Fregats vnmand. But when wee were come ſomewhat nigh them, the winde calmed, and wee were faine to rowe towards them, till that approaching very nigh wee ſawe many heads peering ouer boord. For, as wee perceiued, theſe two Fregates were mand and ſet forth out of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagene,</hi> to fight with vs, and at leaſt to empeach or buſy vs, whilſt by ſome meanes or other they might recouer the Fregates from vs: but our Captaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented both their drifts. For commanding <hi>Iohn Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> to ſtay with the one Pinnace, to entertaine theſe two men of warre, himſelfe in the other made ſuch ſpeed, that hee gate to his Fregates which hee had left at Anchor, and cauſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who in the meane time had gotten aboord in a ſmall Canow thinking to haue towed them within the danger of their ſhott) to make greater haſt thence, then they did thither. For hee found that in ſhifting thence, ſome of them were faine to ſwim a land (the Canow not being able to receiue them) and had left their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, ſome their Rapiers and Targets, ſome their Flaskes and Calliuers behinde them, although they were towing away of one of them: therefore conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that wee could not man them, wee ſunck the one, and burnt the other, giuing them to vnderſtand by this, that wee perceiued their ſecret practiſes.</p>
            <p>This being done, he returned to <hi>Iohn Oxnam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Octo. 22.</note> who all this while lay by the men of warre without proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10680:26"/>
of fight. And aſſoone as our Captaine was come vp to theſe Fregates, the wind blew much from the Sea, ſo that, wee being betwixt the ſhoare and them, were in a manner forced to beare roome into the Harbor before them, to the great ioy of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> who beheld it, in ſuppoſing, that wee would ſtill haue fled before them. But aſſoone as wee were in the Harbor, and felt ſmooth water, our Pinnaces (as we were aſſured of) getting the winde, wee fought with them vpon th'aduantage, ſo that after a fewe ſhott exchanged, and a ſtorme riſing, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to preſſe no neerer. Therefore as they lett fall their Anchors, wee preſently let drop our Grapners in the wind of them, which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conſidering the diſaduantage of the winde, the likelihood of the ſtorme to continue, and ſmall hope of doing any good, they were glad to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Towne. But by reaſon of the foule and tempeſtuous weather, wee rode there foure dayes, feeling great cold, by reaſon wee had ſuch ſore raines with weſterly winde, and ſo little ſuccor in our Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Octo. 27.</note>The fift day after, there came in a Fregate from the Sea, which ſeeing vs make towards her, ranne herſelfe a ſhore, vnhanging her Rudder and taking away her Sayles, that ſhee might not eaſily bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried avvay. But when we were come vp to her, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued about a hundred horſe and foote, with their furniture, came downe to the point of the maine, where wee interchanged ſome ſhott with them. One of our great ſhort paſt ſo neere a braue Caualiere of theirs, that thereby they were occaſioned to aduiſe themſelues, and retreat into the woods, where they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10680:26"/>
might ſufficiently defend and reſcue the Fregate from vs, and annoy vs alſo, if wee ſtayed long about her. Therefore we concluded to goe to Sea againe, putting forth through <hi>Boca chica,</hi> with intent to take downe our Maſts, vpon hope of faire wether, and to ride vnder the Rocks called <hi>Las Serenas,</hi> which are two leagues off at Sea, as wee had vſually done aforetime, ſo that they could not deſerne vs from the Rocks. But there the Sea was ſo mightily growne, that wee were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take the Harbor againe: where wee remained ſixe dayes, notwithſtanding the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greeued greatly at our aboade there ſo long,<note place="margin">Nouem. 2.</note> put an other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in practiſe to indanger vs.</p>
            <p>For they ſent forth a great Shallop, a fine Gunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe, and a great Canow, with certaine <hi>Spanyards</hi> with Shott, and many <hi>Indians</hi> with poiſoned Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, as it ſeemed, with intent to begin ſome fight, and then to fly. For aſſoone as wee rowed towards them and enterchanged ſhotte, they preſently reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and went a ſhoare into the woods, where an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh of ſome ſixty ſhott were layde for vs: beſides two Pinnaces and a Fregate warping towards vs, which were mand as the reſt. They atttemed vs very boldly, being aſſiſted by thoſe others, which from out of the wood, had gotten aboord the Gundelo and Canow, and ſeeing vs bearing from them (which wee did in reſpect of the Ambuſcado) they incouraged themſelues and aſſured their fellowes of the day. But our Captaine weighing this their attempt, and being out of danger of their ſhott from the land, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his other Pinnace to be brought a head of him, and to let fall their Grapners each a head the other, enuironed both the Pinnaces with Bonnets, as for a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10680:27"/>
cloſe fight, and then wheaued them aboord him.</p>
            <p>They kept themſelues vpon their Oares at Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhott diſtance, ſpending powder apace, as wee did ſome two or three houres; we had one of our men onely, wounded in that fight: what they had is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowe to vs, but wee ſawe their Pinnaces ſhotte through in diuers places, and the powder of one of them tooke on fire: vvhereupon vvee vvaighed, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to beare roome, to ouer-run them: vvhich they perceiuing and thinking that vvee vvould haue boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, rovved avvay amaine to the defence vvhich they had in the vvood, the rather becauſe they vvere diſappointed of their helpe, that they expected from the Fregate vvhich vvas vvarping tovvards vs, but by reaſon of the much vvinde that blevv, could not come to offend vs, or ſuccour them.</p>
            <p>Thus ſeeing that wee were ſtill moleſted, and no hope remained of any purchaſe to bee had, in this place any longer, becauſe vve vvere novv ſo notably made knovvne in thoſe parts, and becauſe our victuals grevvv ſcant, as ſoone as the vveather vvexed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat better (the Wind continuing alvvayes Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that vve could not returne to our Shippes) our Captaine thought beſt to goe to the Eaſtvvard, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards <hi>Rio grand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nou. 3.</note> alongſt the Coaſt, vvhere vvee had beene before, and found great ſtore of victuals.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nou. 5.</note>But when after two dayes ſayling, we were arriued at the Villages of ſtore, where before wee had furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed our ſelues with aboundance of Hens, Sheepe, Calues, Hogges, &amp;c. Now wee found bare nothing, not ſo much as any people left, for that they by the Spaniards commandment were fled to the Mountaines, and had driuen away all their Cattle, that wee might
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10680:27"/>
not be releeued by them. Herewith being very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry becauſe much of our victuall in our Pinnaces was ſpoild, by the foule weather at Sea, and raines in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: a Fregate being deſcryed at Sea reuiued vs, and put vs in ſome hope for the time, that in her we ſhould finde ſufficient; and thereupon it may eaſily be gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, how much wee laboured to recouer her: but when we had boarded her, and vnderſtood, that ſhee had neither meate nor money, but that ſhe was bound for <hi>Rio grand,</hi> to take in prouiſion vpon bils, our great hope conuerted into greefe.</p>
            <p>Wee endured with our allowance ſeauen or eight dayes more, proceeding to the Eaſtwards, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring roome for <hi>Santa Martha,</hi> vpon hope to finde ſome ſhipping in the Roade, or Limpets on the Rockes, or ſuccour againſt the ſtorme in that good Harbor. Being arriued, and ſeeing no ſhipping, we anchored vnder the Weſter point, where is high land, and, as we thought, free ſafety from the Towne, which is in the bottome of the Bay, not intending to land there, becauſe wee knew that it was fortified, and that they had intelligence of vs. But the Spaniards knowing vs to be Men of warre, and miſliking that wee ſhould ſhroud vnder their Rockes, without their leaue, had conueyed ſome thirty or forty ſhot among the cliffes, which annoyed vs ſo ſpitefully and ſo vnreuengedly (for that they lay hidden behind the Rockes, but wee lay open to them) that wee were ſoone weary of our Harbour, and enforced, for all the ſtorme without, and want within, to put to Sea, which though theſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ours were well contented withall, yet for a farewell, as wee came open of the Towne, they ſent vs a Culuerine ſhot, which made a neere eſcape, for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10680:28"/>
it fell betweene our Pinnaces, as wee were vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of what was beſt to be done. The Company aduiſed that if it pleaſed him, they might put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a land, ſome place to the Eaſt-ward to get vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and rather hope for curteſie of the Countrey-people, then continue at Sea, in ſo long cold, and great a ſtorme in ſo leake a Pinnace. But our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine would in no wiſe like of that aduice, hee thought it better to beare vp towards <hi>Rio de Haca,</hi> or <hi>Coricao,</hi> with hope there to haue plenty without great reſiſtance, becauſe hee knewe, either the Ilands were not very populous, or elſe it were very likely that there would be found Shippes of victuall in a readines.</p>
            <p>The Company of the other Pinnace anſwered, that, they would willingly follow him through the World, but in this they coulde not ſee how, either their Pinnace ſhould liue in that Sea, without being eaten vp in that ſtorme, or they themſelues able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo long time, with ſo ſlender prouiſion as they had, <hi>viz.</hi> onely one Gammon of Bacon and thirty pound of Bisket for eighteene men. Our Captaine replyed, that they were better prouided then himſelfe was, who had but one Gammon of Bacon, and forty pound of Bisket for his twenty foure men: and therefore hee doubted not but they would take ſuch part as hee did, &amp; willingly depend vpon Gods Almightie prouidence, which neuer faileth them that truſt in him: with that he hoyſed his fore-ſayle, &amp; ſet his courſe for <hi>Coricao,</hi> which the reſt perceiuing with ſorrowfull hearts in reſpect of the weake Pinnace, yet deſirous to follow their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, conſented to take the ſame courſe.</p>
            <p>We had not ſayled paſt three leagues, but wee had eſpyed a ſayle plying to the Weſtward with her two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10680:28"/>
coarſes, to our great joy, who vowed together, that we would haue her, or elſe it ſhould coſt vs deare. Bearing with her, we found her to be a Spaniſh Ship of aboue ninty Tunne, which being wheaued a maine by vs, deſpiſed our ſummons, and ſhot off her Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at vs.</p>
            <p>The Sea went very high, ſo that it was not for vs, to attempt to board her, and therefore wee made fit ſmall ſayle to attend vpon her, and keepe her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to her ſmall content, till fairer weather might lay the Sea. Wee ſpent not paſt two houres in our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, till it pleaſed God, after a great ſhevvr to ſend vs a reaſonable calme, ſo that we might vſe our Peeces and approach her at pleaſure, in ſuch ſort that in ſhort time we had taken her; finding her laden with victuall well poudred and dryed, which at that preſent wee receiued as ſent vs of Gods great mercy. After all things vvere ſet in order, and that the Winde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed tovvards night, vve plyed off and on, till day, at vvhat time our Captaine ſent in <hi>Edward Hixom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nou. 13.</note> vvho had then charge of his Pinnace, to ſearch out ſome Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor along the Coaſt: who hauing found out a little one, ſome tenne or twelue leagues to the Eaſt of <hi>Santa Martha,</hi> where in ſounding he had good ground and ſufficient water, preſently returned, and our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine brought in his new Prize. Then by promiſing liberty, and all their apparell to the Spaniards which we had taken, if they would bring vs to water and freſh victuals, the rather by their meanes, wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the inhabitants Indians, what they had which was plentifull. Theſe Indians were clothed, and gouerned by a <hi>Spaniard</hi> which dwelt in the next Tovvne, not paſt a league off: we ſtayed there all day, watering
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10680:29"/>
and wooding, and prouiding things neceſſary, by giuing content and ſatisfaction to the Indians. But towards night our Captaine called all of vs aboard, (onely leauing the Spaniards lately taken in the Prize aſhoare, according to our promiſe made them, to their great content, who acknowledged that our Captaine did them a farre greater fauour, in ſetting them freely at liberty, then hee had done them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in taking their Ship) and ſo ſet ſayle.</p>
            <p>The ſickeneſſe which had begunne to kindle amongſt two or three dayes before, did this day ſhewe it ſelfe, in <hi>Charles Glub,</hi> one of our Quarter-Maſters, a very tall man, and a right good Mariner, taken away to the great greefe both of Captaine and Company. What the cauſe of this malady was, we knewe nor of certainety, we imputed it to the colde, which our men had taken, lying without ſuccour in the Pinnaces. But howſoeuer it was, thus it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to viſit vs, and yet in fauour to reſtore vnto health, all the reſt of our Company, that were tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with this diſeaſe, which were not a few.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nouem. 15.</note>The next morning being faire weather, though the Winde continued contrary, our Captaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Minion</hi> his leſſer Pinnace, to haſten away before him towards his Shippes at <hi>Fort Diego</hi> within the <hi>Cabeças</hi> to cary newes of his comming, and to put all things in a readineſſe for our Land journey, if they heare any thing of the Fleets arriuall by the <hi>Simerons,</hi> giuing the <hi>Minion</hi> charge if they wanted Wine, to take <hi>Saint Bernards</hi> in their way, and there take in ſome ſuch portion as they thought good, of the Wines which we had there hidden in the ſand.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nouem. 22.</note>We plyed to windwards, as neere as we could,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10680:29"/>
ſo that within a ſeauen-night after the <hi>Minion</hi> departed from vs, we came to <hi>Saint Barnards,</hi> where we ſtayed many houres, finding but twelue Botijos of Wine, of all the ſtore wee left, which had eſcaped the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearch of the Enemy (who had beene there) for that they were deepe in the ground.</p>
            <p>Within foure or fiue dayes after,<note place="margin">Nou. 27.</note> we came to our Ship, where we found all other things in good order, but receiued very heauy newes of the death of <hi>Iohn Drake</hi> our Captaines brother, and another young man called <hi>Richard Allen</hi> which were both ſlaine at one time, as they attempted the boarding of a Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate within two dayes after our departing from them.</p>
            <p>The manner of it (as wee learned by examination of the Company) was this: when they ſaw this Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate at Sea, (as they were going towards their Fort with planckes to make the Platformes) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were very importunate on him, to giue chaſe and ſet vpon this Fregate, which they deemed had beene a fit booty for them. But he told them, that they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted weapons to aſſaile, they knew not how the Fregate was prouided, they had their boat loaden with planckes, to finiſh that his brother had commanded. But when this would not ſatisfie them, but that ſtill they vrged him with words and ſuppoſals: If you will needs ſaid he aduenture, it ſhall neuer be ſaid that I will be hindmoſt, neither ſhall you report to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you loſt your voyage by any covvardiſe you found in me.</p>
            <p>Thereupon euery man ſhifted as they might for the time: and heauing their planckes ouer board, tooke them ſuch poore vveapons as they had: <hi>viz.</hi> a

            <p>The <hi>Lyon</hi> within few dayes deſcryed that ſhee was ſent for, eſpying a Fregate which ſhee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently boarded and tooke, laden with <hi>Maiz,</hi> Hens, and Pompions from <hi>Tolou,</hi> who aſſured vs of the whole truth, of the arriuall of the Fleete: in this Fregate were taken one woman and twelue men, of whome one was the <hi>Scriuano</hi> of <hi>Tolou.</hi> Theſe wee vſed very courteouſly, keeping them dilligently guarded from the deadly hatred of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> who ſought daily by all meanes they could to get them of our Captaine, that they might cut their throats, to reuenge their wrongs and injuries, which the Spaniſh Nation had done them: but our Captaine perſwaded them not to touch them, or them ill countenance, while they were in his charge: &amp; tooke otder for their ſafety, not only in his preſence, but alſo in his abſence. For when he had prepared to take his journey for <hi>Panama</hi> by land, he gaue <hi>Edward Hixom</hi> charge of his owne Ship and Company, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe Spaniards whome hee had put into the great Prize, which was haled a ſhoare to the Iland (which we termed ſlaughter Iland, becauſe ſo many of our men dyed there) and vſed as a ſtore-houſe for our ſelues, and a priſon for our Enemies.</p>
            <p>All things thus ordered, our Captaine confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with his Company and the Chiefeſt of the <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> what prouiſions were to bee prepared for this great and long journey, what kinde of weapons, what ſtore of victuals, and what manner of apparell: was eſpecially aduiſed, to cary as great ſtore of Shooes as poſſibly hee might, by reaſon of ſo many Riuers, with ſtones and grauell as they were to paſſe,

which accordingly prouiding, prepared his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for that journey,<note place="margin">Febr. 3.</note> entring it vpon Shroue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tueſday. At what time there had dyed twenty eight of our men, and a fewe whole men were left aboard with <hi>Edward Hixom,</hi> to keepe the Shippe and tend the ſicke, and guard the priſoners.</p>
            <p>At his departure our Captaine gaue this Maſter ſtraite charge, in any caſe not to truſt any meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that ſhould come in his name with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, vnleſſe hee brought his hand writing: which he knewe could not be counterfeited, by the <hi>Symerons</hi> or Spaniards.</p>
            <p>We were in all forty eight, of which eighteene onely were Engliſh, the reſt were <hi>Symerons,</hi> which beſides their Armes, bare euery one of them, a great quantity of victuall and prouiſion, ſupplying our want of cariages in ſo long a march, ſo that wee were not troubled with any thing but our furniture. And becauſe they could not cary enough to ſuffice vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, therefore, as they promiſed before, ſo by the way with their Arrowes, they prouided for vs competent ſtore from time to time.</p>
            <p>They haue euery one of them two ſortes of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, the one to defend himſelfe and offend the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the other to kill his victualls. Theſe for fight are ſomewhat like the Scotiſh Arrowe; onely ſomewhat longer, and headed with iron, Wood or Fiſhbones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Arrowes for prouiſion are of three ſorts, the firſt ſerueth to kill any great Beaſt neere hand, as Ox, Stagge, or wilde Boare: this hath a head of iron of a pound and a halfe weight, ſhaped in forme like the head of a Iauelin or Boare-ſpeare, as ſharpe as any knife, making ſo large and deepe a wound, as can
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10680:32"/>
hardly bee beleiued of him that hath not ſeene it. The ſecond ſerueth for leſſer Beaſts, and hath a head of three quarters of a pound: this hee moſt vſually ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. The third ſerueth for all manner of Birds: it hath a head of an ounce weight. And theſe heads though they bee of iron onely, yet are they ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempered, that they will continue a very good edge a long time: and though they bee turned ſometimes yet they will neuer or ſeldome breake. The neceſſity in which they ſtand hereof continually, cauſeth them to haue iron in farre greater account then Gold: &amp; no man among them is of greater eſtimation, then he that can moſt perfectly giue this temper vnto it.</p>
            <p>Euery day wee were marching by Sun-riſing: wee continued till ten in the forenoone: then reſting (euer neere ſome Riuer) till paſt twelue, wee marched till foure, and then by ſome Riuers ſide, wee repoſed our ſelues in ſuch houſes, as either wee found prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heretofore by them, when they trauelled through theſe woods, or they daily built very readily for vs, in this manner.</p>
            <p>Aſſoone as wee came to the place, where wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to lodge, the <hi>Symerons,</hi> preſently laying downe their burthens, fell to cutting of Forkes or Poſts, and Poles or Rafters, and Palmito boughes, or Plantaine leaues: and with great ſpeed ſet vp, to the number of ſixe houſes. For euery of which, they firſt faſtned deepe into the ground, three or foure great Poſtes with Forkes: vpon them, they layde one Tranſome, which was commonly about twentie foote, and made the ſides, in the manner of the roofes of our Country houſes, thatching it cloſe with thoſe aforeſaid leaues, which keepe out water long time: obſeruing alwayes

that in the lower ground, where greater heate was, they left ſome three or foure foote open vnthatcht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, &amp; made the houſes, or rather roofes, ſo many foote the higher. But in the Hils, where the ayre was more peircing &amp; the nights colder, they made our roomes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lower, &amp; Thatched them cloſe to the ground, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely one dore to enter at, and a Louer hole for a vent, in the midſt of the roofe In euery of theſe, they made foure ſeuerall lodgings, and three fires, one in the midſt, and one at each end of euery houſe: ſo that the roome was moſt temperately warme, and nothing annoyed with ſmoake, partly by reaſon of the nature of the wood, which they vſe to burne, yeelding very litle ſmoake, partly by reaſon of their artificiall making of it: as firing the wood cutt in length like our billets, at the ends, and ioyning them together ſo cloſe, that though no flame or fire did appeare, yet the heate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>Neere many of the Riuers where wee ſtayd or lodgd, wee found ſundry ſorts of Fruits, which wee might vſe with great pleaſure and ſafety temperately, <hi>Mammeas, Guayuas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Limes</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; from eating of which they diſſwaded vs in any caſe, vnleſſe wee eate very few of them, and thoſe firſt dry roaſted, as <hi>Plantans, Potatos</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>In iournying, as oft as by chance they found any wilde Swine, of which thoſe Hills and Valleys haue ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

One day as wee trauelled, the <hi>Symerons</hi> found an Otter, and prepared it to bee dreſt: our Captaine maruelling at it, <hi>Pedro</hi> (our cheefe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10680:33"/>
               <hi>Symeron</hi>) asked him, <hi>Are you a man of warre, and in want, and yet doubt whether this bee meat, that hath bloud?</hi> herewithall our Captaine rebuked himſelfe ſecretly, that hee had ſo ſlightly conſidered of it before.</p>
            <p>The third day of our iourney, they brought vs to a Towne of their owne, ſeated neere a faire Riuer, on the ſide of a Hill, enuironed with a Dike of eight foote broad, and a thicke mud wall of ten foote high, ſufficient to ſtop a ſudden ſurpriſer. It had one long and broad ſtreet, lying Eaſt and Weſt, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther croſſe ſtreets of leſſe bredth and length: there were in it ſome fiue or ſixe and fifty houſeholds, which were kept ſo cleane and ſweet, that not onely the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but the very ſtreets were very pleaſant to behold. In this Towne wee ſawe they liued very ciuilly and cleanely: for aſſoone as they came thither, they waſhed themſelues in the Riuer, and changed their apparell which was very fine and fitly made (as alſo their we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe weare) ſomewhat after the Spaniſh faſhion, though nothing ſo coſtly. This Towne is diſtant thirtie fiue leagues from <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and fortie fiue from <hi>Panama.</hi> It is plentifully ſtored with many ſorts of Beaſts and Foule, with plenty of Maiz and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Fruits.</p>
            <p>Touching their affection in religion, they haue no kinde of Preiſts, onely they held the Croſſe in great reputation: but at our Captaines perſwation, they were contented to leaue their Croſſes, an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to learne the Lords prayer, and to bee inſtructed in ſome meaſure concerning Gods true worſhip. They keep a continuall watch in foure parts, 3. miles off their Towne, to preuent the miſcheifes which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intend againſt them, by the conducting of ſome of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10680:33"/>
their owne coates, which hauing beene taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue beene enforced thereunto: wherein, as wee learned, ſometimes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ouer them, ſpecially when they liued leſſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but ſince they againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whome they kill like Beaſts, as often as they take them in the woods, hauing aforehand vnderſtood of their comming.</p>
            <p>Wee ſtayed with them that night,<note place="margin">Feb. 7.</note> and the next day till noone: during which time they related vnto vs diuers very ſtrange accidents, that had fallen out betweene them and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> namely one: A gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Gentleman entertained by the Gouernors of the Country, vndertooke the yeare laſt paſt, with a hundred and fiftie Souldiers, to put this Towne to the ſword, Men, Women, and Children. Being conducted to it by one of them, that had beene taken priſoner, and wonne by great gifts: hee ſurpriſed it halfe an houre before day, by which occaſion moſt of the men eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but many of their women and children were ſlaughtered, or taken: but the ſame morning by Sun riſing, after that their guide was ſlaine, in following another mans wife: and that the <hi>Symerons</hi> had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues in their ſtrength: they behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ſuch ſort, and draue the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that what with the diſaduantage of the woods, hauing loſt their guide and thereby their way, what with famine &amp; want, there eſcaped not paſt thirty of them, to returne anſwere to thoſe which ſent them.</p>
            <p>Their King dwelt in a City within ſixteene leagues Southeaſt of <hi>Panama,</hi> which is able to make one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeauen hundred fighting men.</p>
            <p>They all intreated our Captaine very earneſtly, to make his aboade with them ſome two or three dayes,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10680:34"/>
promiſing that by that time, they would double his ſtrength if hee thought good. But hee thanking them for their offer, told them, that hee could ſtay no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it was more then time to proſecute his purpoſed voiage: as for ſtrength, hee would wiſh no more then hee had, although hee might haue preſently twenty times aſmuch: which they tooke as proceeding not onely from kindnes, but alſo from magnanimity, and therefore, they marched forth that afternoone with great good will.</p>
            <p>This was the order of our march: Foure of thoſe <hi>Symerons</hi> that beſt knew the wayes, went about a mile diſtance before vs, breaking boughes as they went, to be a direction to thoſe that followed: but with great ſilence, which they required vs alſo to keepe. Then twelue of them were as it were our Vantgard, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twelue our Reereward: wee with their two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in the midſt.</p>
            <p>All the way was through woods very coole and pleaſant, by reaſon of thoſe goodly and high Trees, that growe there ſo thick, that it is cooler trauelling there vnder them in that hot region, then it is in the moſt parts of <hi>England</hi> in the Sommer time. This gaue a ſpeciall encouragement vnto vs all, that wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood there was a great Tree about the midway, from which, wee might at once diſcerne the North Sea from whence wee came, and the South Sea whether we were going.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Feb. 11.</note>The fourth day following wee came to the height of the deſired Hill, (a very high Hill, lying Eaſt and Weſt, like ridge a betweene the two Seas) about ten of the clock: where the chiefeſt of theſe <hi>Symerons</hi> tooke our Captaine by the hand, and prayed him to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10680:34"/>
follow him, if hee was deſirous to ſee at once the two Seas: which hee had ſo long longed for.</p>
            <p>Here was that goodly and great high Tree, in which they had cutt and made diuers ſteps, to aſcend vp neere vnto the top, where they had alſo made a conuenient Bower, wherein ten or twelue men might eaſily ſitt: and from thence wee might without any difficulty plainely ſee, <hi>th'Atlantick</hi> Ocean whence now wee came, and the South <hi>Atlantick</hi> ſo much deſired: South and North of this Tree, they had felld cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Trees, that the proſpect might be the cleerer: and neere about the Tree there were diuers ſtrong houſes, that had beene built long before, aſwell by other <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons</hi> as by theſe: which vſually paſſe that way, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inhabited in diuers places in thoſe waſte Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>After our Captaine had aſcended to this Bower, with the cheefe <hi>Symeron,</hi> and hauing as it pleaſed God, at that time, by reaſon of the brize, a very faire day, had ſeene that Sea, of which hee had heard ſuch gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den reports: hee beſought Almighty God of his goodnes, to giue him life and leaue to ſayle once in an Engliſh Ship in that Sea: and then calling vp all the reſt of our men, acquainted <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this his peticion and purpoſe, if it would pleaſe God to grant him that happines: who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it, preſently proteſted, that vnleſſe our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine did beate him from his company, hee would follow him by Gods grace.</p>
            <p>Thus all throughly ſatiſfied with the ſight of the Seas, deſcended, and after our repaſt, continued our ordinary march, through woods, yet two dayes more as before: without any great variety.<note place="margin">Feb. 13.</note> But then wee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10680:35"/>
came to march in a Champion Country, where the graſſe groweth, not onely in great length as the knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſe groweth in many places, but to ſuch height, that th'inhabitants are faine to burne it thriſe in the yeare, that it may bee able to feed their Cattle, of which they haue thouſands. For it is a kinde of graſſe with a ſtalke, as big as a great wheaten reed, which hath a blade iſſuing from the top of it, on which, though the Cattle feed, yet it groweth euery day higher, vntill the top be too high for an Oxe to reach. Then th'inhabitants are wont put fire to it, for the ſpace of fiue or ſixe miles together, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding after it is thus burnt, within three dayes ſpringeth vp freſh like greene Corne. Such is the great fruitfulnes of the ſoyle: by reaſon of the eeuennes of the day and night, and the rich dewes which fall euery morning.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Feb. 14.</note>In theſe three laſt dayes march in the Champion, as wee paſt ouer the Hills, wee might ſee <hi>Panama</hi> fiue or ſixe times a day, and the laſt day wee ſawe the Ships riding in the roade.</p>
            <p>But after that we were come within a dayes journey of <hi>Panama,</hi> our Captaine vnderſtanding by the <hi>Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> that the Dames of <hi>Panama</hi> are wont to ſend forth Hunters, and Fowlers, for taking of ſundry dainty Foule, which the Land yeeldeth, by whom if wee marched not very heedfully, wee might be deſcried; cauſed all his company to march out of all ordinary way, and that with as great heed, ſilence and ſecrecy, as poſſibly they might, to the Groue, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on foure daies before, lying within a league of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> where we might lye ſafely vndiſcouered nere the high way, that leadeth from thence to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:10680:35"/>Thence wee ſent a choſen <hi>Symeron,</hi> one that had ſerued a Maſter in <hi>Panamah</hi> before time, in ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell as the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Panamah</hi> doe vſe to weare, to bee our Eſpyall, to goe into the Towne, to learne the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine night, and time of the night, when the Carriers laded the Treaſure from the Kings Treaſure-houſe to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For they are wont to take their journey from <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> to <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> which is ſixe leagues, euer by night, becauſe the Countrey is all champion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by day very hot: but from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> to <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre de Dios,</hi> as oft as they trauell by land with their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they trauell alwayes by day and not by night, becauſe all that way is full of Woods, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very freſh and coole: vnleſſe the <hi>Symerons</hi> happily encounter them, and make them ſweate with feare, as ſometimes they haue done: whereupon they are glad to guard their <hi>Recoes</hi> with Souldiers as they paſſe that way.</p>
            <p>This laſt day our Captaine did behold and view, the moſt of all that faire City, diſcerning the large ſtreete which lyeth directly from the Sea into the Land, South and North. By three of the clocke we came to this Groue, paſſing (for the more ſecrecy) alongſt a certaine Riuer, which at that time was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dryed vp.</p>
            <p>Hauing diſpoſed of our ſelues in the Groue, wee diſpatched our Spye an houre before night, ſo that by the cloſing in of the euening, he might be in the City, as he was: whence preſently he returned vnto vs, that which very happily hee vnderſtood by companions of his: That the Treaſurer of <hi>Lima,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to paſſe into <hi>Spaine</hi> in the firſt <hi>aduiſo,</hi> (which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10680:36"/>
was a Shippe of three hundred and fifty Tunne, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good ſayler) was ready that night, to take his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> with his Daughter &amp; Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: hauing foureteene Moyles in company, of which, eight were loden with gold, and one with jewels And farther, that there were two other <hi>Recos,</hi> of fifty Moyles in each, loaden with victualles for the moſt part, with ſome little quantity of ſiluer, to come forth that night after the other. There are twenty eight of theſe <hi>Recas,</hi> the greateſt of them is of ſeauenty Moyles, the leſſe of fifty, vnleſſe ſome particular man hire for himſelfe, tenne, twenty or thirty, as hee hath need.</p>
            <p>Vpon this notice, wee forthwith marcht foure leagues; till we came within two leagues of <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> in which march two of our <hi>Symerons</hi> which were ſent before, by ſcent of his match, found and brought a Spaniard, whome they had found a ſleepe by the way, by ſcent of the ſaid match, and drawing neere thereby, heard him taking his breath as hee ſlept; and being but one, they fell vpon him, ſtopt his mouth from crying, put out his match, and bound him ſo, that they well neare ſtrangled him by that time hee was brought vnto vs. By examining him, we found all that to be true, which our Spye had reported to vs, and that he was a Souldier entertained with others by the Treaſurer, for the guard and conduct of this Treaſure, from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Souldier hauing learned who our Captaine was, tooke courage, and was bold to make two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts vnto him: the one, that hee would command his <hi>Symerons</hi> which hated the Spaniards (eſpecially the Souldiers) extreamely, to ſpare his life, which hee
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10680:36"/>
doubted not but they would doe at his charge: the other was, that ſeeing he was a Souldier, and aſſured him, that they ſhould haue that night, more gold, beſides jewels, and Pearles of great price, then all they could cary (if not, then he was to be delt with hovv they vvould) but if they all found it ſo, then it might pleaſe our Captaine to giue vnto him, as much as might ſuffice for him and his Miſtreſſe to liue vpon, as hee had heard our Captaine had done to diuers others: for which hee would make his name as famous, as any of them, which had receiued like fauour.</p>
            <p>Being at the place appointed, our Captaine with halfe of his men, lay on one ſide of the way, about fifty paces off in the long graſſe: <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> with the Captaine of the <hi>Symerons,</hi> and the other halfe, lay on the other ſide of the way, at the like diſtance: but ſo farre behinde, that as occaſion ſerued, the former Company might take the formoſt Moyles by the heads, and the other the hindmoſt, becauſe the Moyles tyed together, are alwaies driuen one after another; and eſpecially that if wee ſhould haue need to vſe our Weapons that night, we might be ſure not to enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage our fellowes. Wee had not laine thus in ambuſh much aboue an houre, but wee heard the <hi>Recos</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming both from the City to <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> and from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> to the City, which hath a very common and great trade, when the Fleetes are there: wee heard them, by reaſon they delight much to haue deepe ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Belles, which in a ſtill night are heard very farre off.</p>
            <p>Now though there vvere as great charge giuen as might be, that none of our men ſhould ſhow or ſtirre themſelues: but let all that came from <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10680:37"/>
paſſe quietly: yea their <hi>Recos</hi> alſo, becauſe wee knewe that they brought nothing but Marchandiſe from thence: yet one of our men called <hi>Robert Pike,</hi> hauing drunken too much <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> without water, forgat himſelfe, and entiſing a <hi>Symeron</hi> forth with him, was gone hard to the way, with intent to haue ſhewne his forwardneſſe on the foremoſt Moyles. And when a Caualier from <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> well mounted, with his Page running at his ſtirrop, paſt by, vnaduiſedly he roſe vp to ſee what he was: but the <hi>Symeron</hi> of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcretion puld him downe, and lay vpon him, that he might not diſcouer them any more. Yet by this the Gentleman had taken notice by ſeeing one all in white: for that wee had all put our ſhirts ouer our other apparell, that wee might be ſure to knowe our owne men in the pell mell in the night. By meanes of this ſight, the Caualier putting ſpurs to his Horſe, rode a falſe gallop, as deſirous not onely himſelfe to be free of this doubt; which he imagined, but alſo to giue aduertiſement to others that they might auoid it.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine who had heard and obſerued (by reaſon of the hardneſſe of the ground and ſtilneſſe of the night) the change of this Gentlemans trot to a gallop, ſuſpected, that he was diſcouered, but could not imagine by whoſe fault, neither did the time giue him leaſure to ſearch. And therefore conſidering that it might be, by reaſon of the danger of the place, well knowne to ordinary trauellers: wee lay ſtill in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaſurers comming, who was by this time within halfe a league, and had come forwardes to vs, but that this Horſeman meeting him, and (as we afterwards learned by the other <hi>Recoes</hi>) making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to him, what hee had ſeene preſently that night,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10680:37"/>
what hee heard of Captaine <hi>Drake</hi> this long time, and what hee conjectured to be moſt likely: <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſaid Captaine <hi>Drake,</hi> or ſome for him, diſapointed of his expectation, of getting any great Treaſure, both at <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and other places, was by ſome meanes or other come by land, in couert through the woods vnto this place to ſpeed of his purpoſe: and thereupon perſwaded him to turne his <hi>Reco</hi> out of the way, &amp; let the other <hi>Recoes,</hi> which were comming after to paſſe on. They were whole <hi>Recoes,</hi> and loaden but with victuals for the moſt part, ſo that the loſſe of them were farre leſſe if the worſt befell, and yet they ſhould ſerue to diſcouer them as well as the beſt.</p>
            <p>Thus by the rechleſneſſe of one of our Company, and by the carefulneſſe of this Traueller, we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of a moſt rich booty, which is to be thought God would not ſhould be taken, for that by all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood it was well gotten by that Treaſurer.</p>
            <p>The other two <hi>Recoes</hi> were no ſooner come vp to vs, but being ſtayed and ſeaſed on, one of the cheefe Carriers a very ſenſible fellow, told our Captaine by what meanes wee were diſcouered, and counſelled vs to ſhift for our ſelues betimes, vnleſſe vvee were able to encounter the whole force of the City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which before day would be about vs.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed vs but little, that vvee were defeated of our golden <hi>Recoe,</hi> and that in theſe we could finde not paſt ſome two Horſe-loade of ſiluer: but it greeued our Captaine much more, that hee vvas diſcouered, and that by one of his owne men. But knowing it bootleſſe to greeue at things paſt, and hauing learned by experience, that all ſafety in extremities conſiſteth in taking of time: after no long conſultation with <hi>Pedro,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:10680:38"/>
the cheefe of our <hi>Symerons,</hi> vvho declared that there vvere but two vvayes for him: the one to trauell backe againe the ſame ſecret way they came, for foure leagues ſpace into the Woods: or elſe to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the high way to <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> being two lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and make a way vvith his Sword through the Enemies. Hee reſolued, conſidering the long and weary marches that vvee had taken, and cheefely that laſt euening and day before: to take now the ſhorteſt and readieſt vvay; as chooſing rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter his Enemies vvhile hee had ſtrength remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then to bee encountred or chaſed vvhen vvee ſhould be worne out vvith vvearineſſe: principally novv hauing the Moyles, to eaſe them that vvould, ſome part of the vvay.</p>
            <p>Therefore commanding all to refreſh themſelues moderatly vvith ſuch ſtore of victuall, as vve had there in aboundance: hee ſignified his reſolution and reaſon to them all: asking <hi>Pedro</hi> by name, vvhether hee vvould giue his hand not to forſake him (becauſe hee knew that the reſt of the <hi>Symerons</hi> would alſo then ſtand faſt and firme, ſo faithfull are they to their Captaine.) Hee being very glad of his reſolution, gaue our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his hand, and vowed that hee vvould rather dye at his foote, then leaue him to the Enemies, if hee held this courſe.</p>
            <p>So hauing ſtrengthned our ſelues for the time, vve tooke our journey towards <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> vvith helpe of the Moyles, till vvee came vvithin a mile of the Towne, vvhere vvee turned away the <hi>Recoes,</hi> charging the Conducters of them, not to follow vs, vpon paine of their liues.</p>
            <p>There the vvay is cut through the Woods, about
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10680:38"/>
tenne or twelue foote broade, ſo as two <hi>Recoes</hi> may paſſe one by another. The fruitfulneſſe of the ſoyle, cauſeth that vvith often ſhredding &amp; ridding the vvay thoſe Woods grow as thicke as our hickeſt hedges in <hi>England</hi> that are oftneſt cut.</p>
            <p>To the midſt of this Wood, a Company of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, vvhich continually lay in that Towne, to defend it againſt the <hi>Symerons</hi> vvere come forth, to ſtoppe vs if they might on the vvay, if not, to retrait to their ſtrength, and there to expect vs. A Conuent of Fryers of vvhome one vvas become a Leader, joyned vvith theſe Souldiers, to take ſuch paete as they did.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine vnderſtanding by our two <hi>Symerons,</hi> vvhich vvith great heedfulneſſe and ſilence, marched novv, but about halfe a flight-ſhot before vs, that it was time for vs to arme &amp; take vs to our weapons, for they knew the Enemy vvas at hand, by ſmelling of their match and hearing of a noyſe: had giuen vs charge, that no one of vs ſhould make any ſhot, vntill the Spaniards had firſt ſpent their volly vvhich he thought they vvould not doe before they had ſpoken, as indeed fell out: For as ſoone as vve vvere vvithin hearing, a Spaniſh Captaine cryed aloud, Hóó, our Captaine anſwered him likevviſe, &amp; being aemanded, <hi>Que gente?</hi> replyed <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> But vvhen the ſaid Commander charged him in the name of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that wee ſhould yeeld our ſelues, promiſing in the word and faith of a Gentleman Souldier, that if we would ſo doe, he would vſe vs with all curteſie; our Captaine drawing ſomwhat neere him ſaid: That for the honour of the Queene of <hi>England</hi> his Miſtreſſe, hee muſt haue paſſage that way: and therewithall diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Piſtoll towards him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:10680:39"/>Vpon this, they preſently ſhot off their whole vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which, though it lightly wounded our Captaine and diuers of our men, yet it cauſed death to one onely of our Company called <hi>Iohn Harris,</hi> who was ſo poudered with haile-ſhot (which they all vſed for the moſt part as it ſeemed, or elſe quartered, for that our men were hurt with that kinde) that we could not recouer his life, though he continued all that day afterwards with vs. Preſently as our Captaine percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their ſhott to come ſlacking, as the latter drops of a great ſhewre of raine, with his Whiſtle he gaue vs his vſuall ſignall, to anſwere them with our ſhot and Arrowes, and ſo march onwards vpon the Enemy, with intent to come to handi-ſtrokes, and to haue joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them: whom when hee found retired as to a place of ſome better ſtrength, hee encreaſed his pace to preuent them if he might. Which the <hi>Symerons</hi> perceiuing, although by terror of the ſhot continuing, they were for the time ſtept a ſide: yet as ſoone as they diſcerned by hearing that we marched onward, they all ruſht forwards one after another, trauerſing the way, vvith their Arrowes ready in their Bowes, and their manner of Countrey dance or leape, very luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſinging <hi>Yó pehó, yó pehó,</hi> and ſo got before vs, where they continued their leape and ſong, after the manner of their owne Countrey warres, till they and wee ouer-tooke ſome of the Enemy, who neere the Townes end, had conueyed themſelues within the Woods, to haue taken their ſtand at vs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Symerons</hi> now throughly encouraged, when they ſawe our reſolution, brake in through the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, on both ſides of them, forcing them to flye,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10680:39"/>
Fryers and all, although diuers of our men were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and one <hi>Symeron</hi> eſpecially was runne through with one of their Pikes, whoſe courage and minde ſerued him ſo well notwithſtanding, that hee reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his owne death ere hee dyed, by killing him that had giuen him that deadly wound.</p>
            <p>Wee, with all ſpeed, following this chaſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Towne of <hi>Venta Cruz,</hi> being of about forty or fifty houſes, which had both a Gouernour and other Officers and ſome faire houſes, with many Store-houſes large and ſtrong for the Wares, which were brought thither from <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> by the Riuer of <hi>Chagro,</hi> ſo to be tranſported by Moyles to <hi>Panama:</hi> beſides the Monaſterie where wee found aboue a thouſand Bulles and Pardons newly ſent thither from Rome.</p>
            <p>In thoſe houſes wee found three Gentlewomen, which had lately beene deliuered of Children there, though their dwelling were in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> becauſe it hath beene obſerued of long time, as they reported to vs, that no <hi>Spaniard</hi> or White woman could euer bee deliuered in <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> with ſafety of their Children, but that within two or three dayes they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; notwithſtanding that being borne and brought vp in this <hi>Venta Cruz</hi> or <hi>Panama</hi> fiue or ſixe yeares, and then brought to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> if they eſcaped ſicknes the firſt or ſecond month, they commonly liued in it as healthily as in any other place: although no ſtranger (as they ſay) can endure there any long time, without great danger of death or extreame ſicknes.</p>
            <p>Though at our firſt comming into the Towne with Armes ſo ſuddenly, theſe Gentlewomen were in great feare: yet becauſe our Captaine had giuen ſtrait charge
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10680:40"/>
to all the <hi>Symerons</hi> (that while they were in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they ſhould neuer hurt any woman, nor man that had not weapon in his hand to doe them hurt, which they erneſtly promiſed, and no leſſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully performed) they had no wrong offered them, nor any thing taken from them, to the worth of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: wherein, albeit they had indeed ſufficient ſafety and ſecurity, by thoſe of his company, which our Captaine ſent vnto them, of purpoſe to comfort them: yet they neuer ceaſed moſt earneſtly intreating, that our Captaine would vouchſafe to come to them himſelfe for their more ſafety: which when hee did, in their preſence reporting the charge hee had firſt giuen, &amp; th'aſſurance of his men, they were comforted.</p>
            <p>While the Guards which wee had (not without great need) ſett, aſwell on the bridge which wee were to paſſe ouer, as at the Townes end where wee entred (they haue no other entrance into the Towne by Land: but from the waters ſide there is one other, to carry vp and downe their Marchandiſe from their Fregates) gained vs liberty and quiet to ſtay in this Towne ſome houre and halfe: wee had not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed our ſelues, but our company and <hi>Symerons</hi> had gotten ſome good pillage, which our Captaine allowed and gaue them (being not the thing he looked for) ſo that it were not too comberſome or heauy in reſpect of our trauell, or defence of our ſelues. A little before wee departed, ſome ten or tvvelue horſemen came from <hi>Panama</hi> by all likelihood, ſuppoſinge that wee were gone out of this Towne, for that all was ſo ſtill and quiet, came to enter the Towne confidently: but finding their entertainement ſuch as it was, they that could, rode faſter backe againe for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10680:40"/>
feare, then they had ridden forwards for hope.</p>
            <p>Thus wee hauing ended our buſines in this Towne, and the day beginning to ſpring, wee marched ouer the Bridge, obſeruing the ſame order that wee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There wee were all ſafe in our opinion, as if wee had beene enuironed with Wall and Trench: for that no <hi>Spaniard</hi> without his extreame danger could follow vs. The rather now, for that our <hi>Symerons</hi> were growne very valiant. But our Captaine conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that hee had a long way to paſſe, and that hee had beene now well neere fortnight from his Ship, where hee had left his Company but weake by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſicknes, haſtned his jorneys aſmuch as he might, refuſing to viſit the other <hi>Symeron</hi> Townes (which they earneſtly deſired him) and encouraging his owne Company with ſuch example and ſpeech that the way ſeemed much ſhorter. For hee marched moſt cheerefully and aſſured vs, that hee doubted not but ere hee left that Coaſt, wee ſhould all bee bountifully payd and recompenſed for all thoſe paines taken: but by reaſon of this our Captaines haſte, and leauing of their Townes, wee marched many dayes with hungry ſtomackes, much againſt the will of our <hi>Symerons</hi>: who if wee would haue ſtayed any day from this continuall journeying, would haue killed for vs victuall ſufficient.</p>
            <p>In our abſence, the reſt of the <hi>Symerons</hi> had built a little Towne within three leagues off the port where our Ship lay. There our Captaine was contented, vppon their great and earneſt intreaties to make ſome ſtay, for that they alleaged, it was onely built for his ſake. And indeed hee conſented the rather, that the want of ſhooes might bee ſupplyed by meanes of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10680:41"/>
               <hi>Symerons,</hi> who were a great helpe vnto vs: all our men complayning of the tendernes of their feete, whom our Captaine would himſelfe in their complaint ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſomtimes without cauſe, but ſometimes with cauſe indeed, which made the reſt to beare the burthen the more eaſily.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Symerons</hi> during all the time that wee were with them, did vs continually very good ſeruice, and in particular in this journey, being vnto vs inſteed of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencers, to aduertiſe vs; of guides in our way to direct vs; of purueiors to prouide victualls for vs; of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights to build our lodgings; and had indeed able and ſtrong bodies carying all our neceſſaries, yea many times when ſome of our company fainted with ſicknes or wearines, two <hi>Symerons</hi> would carry him with eaſe betwene them two miles together, and at other times when need was they would ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues no leſſe valiant then induſtrious and of good iudgement.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Feb. 22.</note>From this Towne, at our firſt entrance in the euen on Saturday, our Captaine diſpatched a <hi>Symeron</hi> with a token and certaine order to the Maſter, who had this three weekes, kept good watch againſt the enemy, and ſhifted in the woods for freſh victuall, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and recouery of our men left aboord. Aſſoone as this meſſenger was come to the ſhoare, calling to our Ship, as bringing ſome newes, hee was quickly ſett aboord, by thoſe which longed to heare of our Captaines ſpeeding: but when hee ſhewed the tooth-pike of gold, which hee ſaid our Captaine had ſent for a token to <hi>Edward Hixom,</hi> with charge to meete him at ſuch a Riuer: though the Maſter knew well the Captaines Tooth-pike: yet by reaſon of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10680:41"/>
and caueat giuen him at parting, hee (though he bewrayed no ſigne of diſtruſting the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron</hi>) yet ſtood as amazed, leaſt ſomething had befallen our Captaine otherwiſe then well. The <hi>Symeron</hi> perceiuing this, tolde him, that it was night when hee was ſent away, ſo that our Captaine could not ſend any letter, but yet with the point of his knife, hee wrote ſomething vpon the Tooth-pike, which (hee ſaid) ſhould be ſufficient to gaine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the meſſenger.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Maſter lookt vpon it, and ſawe written <hi>By me Francis Drake,</hi> wherefore hee beleiued, and according to the meſſage, prepared what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion hee could, and repaired to the mouth of the Riuer of <hi>Tortugos,</hi> as the <hi>Symerons</hi> that went with him then named it.</p>
            <p>That after noone towards three a clocke, we were come downe to that Riuer, not paſt halfe an houre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſawe our Pinnace ready come to receiue vs: which was vnto vs all a double reioycing: firſt that wee ſawe them, and next ſo ſoone: our Captaine with all our Company praiſed God moſt hartily, for that wee ſawe our Pinnace and fellowes againe.</p>
            <p>We all ſeemed to theſe who had liued at reſt and plenty all this while aboard, as men ſtrangely chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (our Captaine yet not much changed) in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and plight: and indeed our long faſting and ſore trauell might ſomewhat fore-pine and waſte vs: but the greefe wee drew inwardly, for that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without that Gold and Treaſure wee hoped for, did no doubt ſhewe her print and footeſteps in our faces.</p>
            <p>The reſt of our men which were then miſſed, could
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10680:42"/>
not trauell ſo well as our Captaine, and therefore were left at the Indian new Towne: and the next day wee rowed to another Riuer in the bottome of the Bay and tooke them all aboord.<note place="margin">Feb. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus being returned from <hi>Panama,</hi> to the great reioycing of our Company, who were throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued with the report wee brought from thence: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially vnderſtanding our Captaines purpoſe, that he meant not to leaue off thus, but would once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine attempt the ſame journey, whereof they alſo might bee partakers: our Captaine would not in the meane time ſuffer this edge and forwardnes of his men to bee dulled or rebated, by lying ſtill idly vnim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as knowing right well by continuall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that no ſicknes was more noyſome to impeach any enterpriſe then delay and idlenes.</p>
            <p>Therefore conſidering deepely the intelligences of other places of importance thereabouts, which hee had gotten the former yeares: and particularly of <hi>Veragua,</hi> a rich Tovvne lying to the Weſtvard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveene <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> and <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> vvhere is the richeſt Mine of fine Gold, that is on this North ſide: hee conſulted with his company touching their opinions, what was to bee done in this meane time, and how they ſtood affected? Some thought, that it was moſt neceſſary to ſeeke ſupply of victuals, that wee might the better bee able to keepe our men cloſe and in health till our time came: and this was eaſy to bee compaſſed, becauſe the Fregates with victuall went without great defence, whereas the Fregates and Barkes with Treaſure, for the moſt part were vvaft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith great Ships and ſtore of Souldiers. Others yet iudged, vvee might better beſtowe our time in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10680:42"/>
intercepting the Fregates of Treaſure: firſt for that our Magaſines and Storehouſes of victuall were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably furniſhed, and the Country it ſelfe was ſo plentifull, that euery man might prouide for himſelfe if the worſt befell: and victuall might hereafter bee prouided abundantly aſwell as now: whereas the Treaſure neuer floateth vpon the Sea, ſo ordinarily as at this time, of the Fleets being there, which time in no wiſe may bee neglected.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Symerons</hi> being demanded alſo their opinion, for that they were experienced in the particularities of all the Townes thereabouts, as in which, ſome or other of them had ſerued: declared that by <hi>Veragua Sinnior Pezoro</hi> ſometime their Maſter from whome they fled, dwelt not in the Towne for feare of ſome ſurpriſe, but yet not farre off from the Towne, for his better releefe: in a very ſtrong houſe of ſtone, where hee had dwelt ninteene yeares at leaſt, neuer trauelling from home, vnleſſe happily once a yeare to <hi>Carthagene</hi> or <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> when the Fleets were there: hee keepeth a hundred ſlaues at leaſt in the Mines, each ſlaue being bound to bring in dayly cleere gaine (all charges deductted) three Pezos of Gold for himſelfe and two for his women (eight ſhillings three pence the Pezo) amounting in the whole, to about two hundred pound ſterling each day: ſo that hee hath heaped a mighty Maſſe of Treaſure together, which hee keepeth in certaine great Cheſts of two foote deepe three broad, and foure long: being, notwithſtanding all his wealth, hard and cruell, not onely to his ſlaues, but vnto all men, and therefore neuer going abroad, but with a Guard of fiue or ſixe men to defend his perſon from danger,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10680:43"/>
which hee feareth extraordinarily from all creatures. And as touching meanes of compaſſing this purpoſe, they woulde conduct him ſafely through the woods, by the ſame wayes by which they fled, that hee ſhould not need to enter their Hauens with danger, but might come vpon their backes altogether vnlooked for. And though his houſe were of ſtone ſo that it could not bee burnt, yet if our Captaine would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake th'attempt, they would vndermine and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, or otherwiſe breake it open, in ſuch ſort, as wee might haue eaſy acceſſe to his greateſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine hauing heard all their opinions, concluded ſo; that by deuiding his Company the two firſt different ſentences, were both reconciled, both to bee practiſed and put in vre. <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> appointed in the <hi>Beare,</hi> to bee ſent Eſtwards towards <hi>Tolow,</hi> to ſee what ſtore of victuals would come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart his halfe, &amp; himſelfe would to the Weſtward in the <hi>Minian,</hi> lye off and on the <hi>Cabezas,</hi> where was the greateſt trade and moſt ordinary paſſage of thoſe which tranſported Treaſure from <hi>Veragua</hi> and <hi>Nicara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua</hi> to the Fleet: ſo that no time might bee loſt, nor opportunity let ſlip either for victuall or Treaſure. As for th'attempt of <hi>Veragua</hi> or <hi>Sinior Peroros</hi> houſe by land, by marching through the woods, hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not off, leaſt it might ouer weary his men by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall labor, whom he ſtudied to refreſh and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, for his next ſreuice forenamed.</p>
            <p>Therefore vſing our <hi>Symerons</hi> moſt curteouſly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing thoſe that were deſirous to their wiues, with ſuch gifts and fauors as were moſt pleaſing, and entertaining thoſe ſtill aboord his Ships, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10680:43"/>
were contented to abide with the Company remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Pinnaces departed as was determined, the <hi>Minion</hi> to the Weſt, the <hi>Beare</hi> to the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minion</hi> about the <hi>Cabeças</hi> met with a Fregate of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> in which was ſome gold, and a <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> Pilot, of which Nation there are many in thoſe Coaſts, which had beene at <hi>Veragua</hi> not paſt eight dayes before, he being very well entreated, certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our Captaine of the State of the Towne, and of the Harbor, and of a Fregate that was there ready to come forth within fewe dayes, aboard which there was aboue a million of Gold, offering to conduct him to it, if wee would doe him his right, for that he knew the channell very perfectly, ſo that hee could enter by night ſafely without danger of the ſands and ſhallowes, (though there be but little water) and vtterly vndeſcryed, for that the Towne is fiue leagues within the Harbor, and the way by land is ſo farre about and difficult through the Woods, that though wee ſhould by any caſualty be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, about the point of the Harbor, yet wee might diſpatch our buſineſſe and depart, before the Towne could haue notice of our comming. At his being there hee perceiued they had heard of <hi>Drakes</hi> being on the Coaſt, which had put them in great feare, as in all other places (<hi>Pezoro</hi> purpoſing to remoue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the South Sea) but there was nothing done to preuent him, their feare being ſo great, that, as it is accuſtomed in ſuch caſes, it excluded Counſell and bred diſpaire.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine conferring with his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and former intelligences, was purpoſed to haue returned to his Shippe, to haue taken ſome
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10680:44"/>
of thoſe <hi>Symero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> which had dwelt with <hi>Sinior Pezoro,</hi> to be the more confirmed in this point. But when the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noway</hi> Pilot was very earneſt, to haue the time gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and warranted our Captaine of good ſpeed, if wee delayd not, he dimiſſed the Fregate ſomewhat lighter to, haſten her journey, and with this Pilots ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, laboured with ſayle and oares to get this Harbor and to enter it by night accorcordingly, conſidering that this Fregate might now bee gained, and <hi>Pezoros</hi> houſe attempted hereafter notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>But when wee were come to the mouth of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, we heard the report of two Chambers, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off about a league within the Bay, two other as it were anſwering them: whereby our <hi>Geno<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aiſe</hi> Pilot coniectured that we were diſcouered: for hee aſſured vs, that this order had beene taken, ſince his laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; by reaſon of the aduertiſement and charge, which the Gouernour of <hi>Panama</hi> had ſent vnto all the Coaſt, which euen in their beds lay in great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feare of our Captaine, and therefore by all likely-hood, maintained this kinde of watch, at the charge of the rich Gnuffe <hi>Pezoro,</hi> for their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Thus being defeated of this expectation, wee found that it was not Gods will that wee ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at that time: the rather for that the winde, which had all this time beene Eaſterly, came vp to the Weſtward, and inuited vs to returne againe to our Shippe,<note place="margin">March 19.</note> where on Sheere Thurſday wee met accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to appointment with our <hi>Beare,</hi> and found that ſhee had beſtowed her time to more profit then wee had done.</p>
            <p>For ſhee had taken a Fregate in which there
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10680:44"/>
were tenne men, whome they ſet aſhoare; great ſtore of <hi>Maiz,</hi> twenty eight fat Hogs, and two hundred Hens. Our Captaine diſcharged this Fregate of her lading, and becauſe ſhe was new,<note place="margin">March 20.</note> ſtrong and of a good mould, the next day hee tallowed her to make her a Man of warre: diſpoſing all our Ordinance and prouiſions that were fit for ſuch vſe in her.<note place="margin">March 21.</note> For we had heard by the Spaniards laſt taken, that there were two little Gallies built in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> to waft the <hi>Chagro</hi> Fleete to and froe, but were not yet both lanched: wherefore hee purpoſed now to aduenture for that Fleete. And to hearten his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hee feaſted them that Eaſter-day with great cheere and cheerefulneſſe,<note place="margin">March 22.</note> ſetting vp his reſt vpon that attempt.</p>
            <p>The next day with the new tallowed Fregate of <hi>Tolow</hi> and his <hi>Beare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">March 23.</note> wee ſet ſayle towards the <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And being in great want, and deſirous to be releeued by vs, hee bare vp vnder our Lee, and in token of amity, ſhot off his Lee Ordinance which was not vnanſwered.</p>
            <p>Wee vnderſtood that hee was <hi>Tetú</hi> a French Captaine of <hi>New-hauen,</hi> a Man of warre as wee were: deſirous to be releeued by vs. For at our firſt mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the French Captaine caſt abroad his hands, and prayed our Captaine to helpe him to ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10680:45"/>
for that hee had nothing but Wine, and Cider aboard him, which had brought his men into great ſickeneſſe. Hee had ſought vs euer ſince hee firſt heard of our being vpon the Coaſt, about this fiue weekes. Our Captaine ſent one aboard him with ſome releefe for the preſent, willing him to follovv vs to the next Port, vvhere hee ſhould haue both vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and victuals.</p>
            <p>At our comming to anchor hee ſent our Captaine a caſe of Piſtols, and a faire guilt Symeter (vvhich had beene the late Kings of <hi>France,</hi> vvhome Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Mongomery</hi> hurt in the eye, and vvas giuen him by Monſieur <hi>Stroſſe</hi>) our Captaine requited him vvith a Chaine of gold, and a Tablet vvhich hee vvore.

with our Captaine for halfes: in ſuch ſort as wee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not doubt of their forces, being but twenty, nor be hurt by their portions, being no greater then ours: and yet gratifie them in their earneſt ſuite, and ſerue our owne purpoſe, which without more helpe wee could very hardly haue atcheiued. Indeed hee had ſeauenty men, and wee now but thirty one: his Ship was aboue eighty Tunne, and our Fregate not paſt twenty, our Pinnace nothing neere tenne Tunne: yet our Captaine thought this proportionable, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that not number of men, but quality of their judgements and knowledge, were to bee the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall actors herein: and the French Shippe could doe no ſeruice, nor ſtand in any ſteed to this enterpriſe which we intended, and had agreed vpon long before, both touching the time when it ſhould take begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the place where wee ſhould meet, namely at <hi>Rio Franciſco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing thus agreed with Captaine <hi>Tetu,</hi> wee ſent for the <hi>Symerons</hi> as before was decreed: Two of them were brought aboard our Shippes, to giue the French aſſurance of this agreement. And as ſoone as wee could furniſh our ſelues and refreſh the French Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which vvas within fiue or ſixe dayes (by bringing them to the Magazine which was the neereſt, where they were ſupplyed by vs in ſuch ſort, as they proteſted they were beholding to vs for all their liues) taking twenty of the French and fifteene of ours with our <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merons,</hi> leauing both our Shippes in ſafe Roade, wee mand our Fregate and two Pinnaces (wee had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſuncke our <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſhortely after our returne from <hi>Panama,</hi> becauſe wee had not men ſufficient to man her) and went towards <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> which becauſe it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10680:46"/>
had not water enough for our Fregate: cauſed vs to leaue her at the <hi>Cabeças,</hi> mand with Engliſh and French, in the charge of <hi>Robert Doble,</hi> to ſtay there without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any chaſe, vntill the returne of our Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And then beare to <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> where both Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines landed with ſuch force as aforeſaid,<note place="margin">March 31.</note> and charged them that had the charge of the Pinnaces, to be there the fourth day next following without any faile. And thus knowing that the cariages went now daily from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> vve proceeded in couert through the Woods, tovvards the high way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth betvvene them.</p>
            <p>It is fiue leagues accounted by Sea, betvveene <hi>Rio Franciſco</hi> and <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> but that vvay vvhich vvee marched by land, vve found it aboue ſeauen leagues. Wee marched as in our former journey to <hi>Panama,</hi> both for order and ſilence, to the great vvonder of the French Captaine and Company, vvho proteſted they knevv not by any meanes hovv to recouer the Pinnaces, if the <hi>Symerons</hi> (to vvhome vvhat our Captaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded was a law, though they little regarded the French, as hauing no truſt in them) ſhould leaue vs: our Captaine aſſured him, there vvas no cauſe of doubt of them of vvhom he had had ſuch former tryall.</p>
            <p>When vve vvere come vvithin an Engliſh mile of the vvay, vvee ſtayed all night, refreſhing our ſelues in great ſtilneſſe in a moſt conuenient place, vvhere vve heard the Carpenters, being many in number vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon their Shippes, as they vſually doe by reaſon of the great heat of the day in <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> &amp; might heare the Moyles comming from <hi>Panama,</hi> by reaſon of the aduantage of the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">April 1.</note>The next morning vpon hearing of that great
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10680:46"/>
number of Belles, the <hi>Symerons</hi> rejoyced exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as though there could not haue befallen them a more joyfull accident, cheefely hauing beene diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed before. Now they all aſſured vs, wee ſhould haue more gold and ſiluer then all of vs could beare away, as in truth it fell out.</p>
            <p>For there came three Recoes, one of fifty Moyles, the other two of ſeauenty each, euery of which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed three hundred pound waight of ſiluer, which in all amounted to neere thirty Tunne. Wee putting our ſelues in readineſſe, went downe neere the way to heare the Belles, where we ſtayed not long, but we ſawe of what mettall they were made, and tooke ſuch hold on the heads of the foremoſt and hindmoſt Moyles, that all the reſt ſtayed and lay downe as their manner is.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Recoes were guarded with forty fiue Souldiers or their abouts, fifteene to each Reco, which cauſed ſome exchange of Ballets and Arrowes for a time, in which conflict the French Captaine was ſore wounded with hayle-ſhot in the belly, and one <hi>Symeron</hi> ſlaine: but in the end theſe Souldiers thought it the beſt way to leaue their Moyles with vs, and to ſeeke for more helpe abroad: in which meane time wee tooke ſome paine to eaſe ſome of the Moyles, which were heauieſt loaden of their cariages. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee our ſelues were ſomewhat weary, wee were contented with a few barres and quoits of gold, as wee could well cary: burying about fifteene Tunne of ſiluer, partly in the boroughs which the great Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crabs had made in the earth, and partly vnder old Trees which were fallen thereabout, and partly in the ſand and grauell of a Riuer, not very deepe of water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:10680:47"/>Thus when about this buſineſſe wee had ſpent ſome two houres, and had diſpoſed of all our matters, and were ready to march backe, the very ſelfe ſame way that we came, wee heard both Horſe and Foote comming as it ſeemed, to the Moyles, for they neuer followed vs, after we were once entred the Woods: where the French Captaine by reaſon of his wound, not able to trauell farther, ſtayed, in hope that ſome reſt would recouer him better ſtrength.</p>
            <p>But after wee had marched ſome two leagues, vpon the French Souldiers complaint, that they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one of their men alſo, examination being made whether hee were ſlaine or no: it was found that hee had druncke much Wine, and ouerlading himſelfe with pillage, and haſting to goe before vs, had loſt himſelfe in the Woods. And as wee afterwards knew, hee was taken by the Spaniards that euening, and vpon torture, diſcouered vnto them where we had hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our Treaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">April 2.3.</note>We continued our march all that and the next day, towards <hi>Rio Franciſco,</hi> in hope to meet with our Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but when we came thither, looking out to Sea, wee ſavve ſeauen Spaniſh Pinnaces, which had beene ſearching all the Coaſts thereabout: vvhereupon vvee mightily ſuſpected, that they had taken or ſpoiled our Pinnaces, for that our Captaine had giuen ſo ſtraight charge, that they ſhould repaire to this place this after-noone from the <hi>Cabecas</hi> vvhere they rode, vvhence to our ſight, theſe Spaniards Pinnaces did come.</p>
            <p>But the night before, there had fallen very much raine, with much weſterly winde, which as it enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to returne home the ſooner, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10680:47"/>
of the ſtorme: ſo it kept our Pinnaces, that they could not keepe th'appointment, becauſe the wind was contrary, &amp; blewe ſo ſtrong, that with their Oares they could all that day get but halfe the way. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they had followed our Captaines direction in ſetting forth ouer night, while the winde ſerued, they had arriued at the place appointed with farre leſſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but with farre more danger, becauſe that very day at noone, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Shallops mand out of purpoſe from <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> were come to this place to take our Pinnaces: imagining where wee were, after they had heard of our intercepting of the Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine ſeeing the Shallops, feared leaſt hauing taken our Pinnaces, they had compelled our men by torture, to confeſſe where his Fregate and Ships were. Therefore in this diſtreſſe and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the company miſdoubting that all meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their Country were cut off, and that their Treaſure then ſerued them to ſmall purpoſe: our Captaine comforted and encouraged vs all, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: wee ſhould venter no farther then hee did: it was no time now to feare: but rather to haſte to preuent that which was feared: if the Enemy haue preuailed againſt our Pinnaces, which God forbid, yet they muſt haue time to ſearch them, time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Mariners; time to execute their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after it is determined: before all theſe times bee taken, wee may get to our Ships if yee will, though not poſſibly by land, becauſe of the Hills, Thickets and Riuers, yet by water. Let vs therefore make a Raft with the Trees that are here in readines, as offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues being brought downe the Riuer, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily this laſt ſtorme, and put our ſelues to Sea. I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10680:48"/>
will bee one, who will bee the other? <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> offered himſelfe, and two Frenchmen that could ſwimme very well, deſired they might accompany our Captaine, as did the <hi>Symeron</hi> likewiſe (who had beene very earneſt with our Captaine to haue march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by land though it were ſixteene dayes journey, and in caſe the Ships had beene ſurpriſed, to haue aboade alwaies with them) eſpecially <hi>Pedro,</hi> who yet was faine to bee left behinde, becauſe hee could not rowe.</p>
            <p>The Raft was fitted and faſt bound; a Sayle of a Bisket ſack prepared; an Oare was ſhaped out of a young Tree to ſerue in ſteed of a Rudder, to direct their courſe before the winde.</p>
            <p>At his departure hee comforted the Company, by promiſing, that if it pleaſed God, hee ſhould put his foote in ſafety aboard his Fregate, hee would, God willing, by one means or other get them all aboard, in deſpite of all the <hi>Spa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iards</hi> in the Indies</p>
            <p>In this manner putting off to the Sea, hee ſayled ſome three leagues, ſitting vp to the waſte continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in water, &amp; at euey ſurge of the waue to the armepits, for the ſpace of ſixe houres, vpon this Raft, what with the parching of the Sunne and what with the beating of the ſalt water, they had all of them their skins much fretted away.</p>
            <p>At length God gaue them the ſight of two Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces turning towards them with much winde, but with farre greater joy to him, that could eaſily coniecture, and did cheerefully declare to thoſe three vvith him, that they vvere our Pinnaces, and that all vvas ſafe, ſo that there vvas no cauſe of feare. But ſee, the Pinnaces not ſeeing this Raft, nor ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10680:48"/>
any ſuch matter, by reaſon of the vvinde and night growing on, were forced to runne into a coue behinde the point, to take ſuccour for that night: which our Captaine ſeeing, and gathering, becauſe they came not forth againe, that they would Anchor there, put his raft a ſhore, and ranne by land about the point, where hee found them, who vpon ſight of him, made as much haſt as they could to take him and his Company aboard. For our Captaine, of purpoſe to try what haſt they could and would make in extremity: himſelfe ranne in great haſte, and ſo willed the other three with him, as if they had beene chaſed by the Enemy: which they the rather ſuſpected, becauſe they ſaw ſo fewe with him. And after his comming aboard, when, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, how all his Company did? hee anſwered coldly, well: they all doubted, that all went ſcarce well. But hee willing to ridd all doubts, and fill them with ioy, tooke out of his boſome a Quoit of Gold, thanking God that our voyage was made. And to the Frenchmen hee declared, how their Captaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was left behinde, ſore wounded and two of his Company with him: but it ſhould bee no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to them.</p>
            <p>That night our Captaine with great paine of his Company, rowed to <hi>Roo Faanciſco:</hi>
               <note place="margin">April 4.</note> where hee tooke the reſt in, and the Treaſure which wee had brought with vs: making ſuch expedition, that by dawning of the day, we ſet ſayle backe againe, to our Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and from thence directly to our Ships: where aſſoone as wee arriued, our Captaine deuided by weight, the Gold and Siluer into two euen por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, betwene the French, and the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:10680:49"/>About a fortnight after, when we had ſet all things in order, and taking out of our Ship all ſuch neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as wee needed for our Fregate, had left and giuen her to the <hi>Spa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iards,</hi> whome wee had all this time detayned, wee put out of that Harbor, together with the French Ship, riding ſome fewe dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Cabezas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time our Captaine made a ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with the <hi>Symerons,</hi> that twelue of our men and ſixteene of theirs, ſhould make another voyage, to get intelligence in what caſe the Country ſtood, and if it might be, recouer Monſieur <hi>Tortú</hi> the French Captaine, at leaſt-wiſe to bring away that which was hidden in our former ſurprize and could not then bee conueniently caried.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Oxnam</hi> and <hi>Thomas Sherwell</hi> were put in truſt for this ſeruice, to the great content of the whole Company, who conceiued greateſt hope of them next our Captaine, whome by no meanes they would condiſcend to ſuffer to aduenture againe this time: yet hee himſelfe rowed to ſet them aſhore at <hi>Rio Franciſco:</hi> finding his labor well imployed both other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and alſo in ſauing one of thoſe two French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that had remained willingly to accompany their wounded Captaine.</p>
            <p>For this Gentleman hauing eſcaped the rage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was now comwing towards our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, vvhere hee fell dovvne on his keees, bleſſing God for the time, that euer our Captaine vvas borne, vvho novv beyond all his hope, vvas become his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer. Hee being demanded vvhat vvas become of his Captaine and other fellovv, ſhevved that vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in halfe an houre after our departure, the <hi>Spiniards</hi> had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10680:49"/>
ouergotten them, and tooke his Captaine and other fellovve: hee onely eſcaped by flight, hauing caſt avvay all his carriage, and among the reſt one Box of Ievvells, that hee might fly the ſvvifter from the purſuers: but his fellovv tooke it vp and burthened himſelfe ſo ſore, that hee could make no ſpeed, as eaſily hee might othervviſe, if hee vvould haue caſt downe his pillage, and layd aſide his couetous minde: as for the ſiluer, which we had hidden thereabout in the earth and the ſands, he thought that it was all gone; for that he thought there had beene neere two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Spaniards and Negroes there, to dig and ſearch for it.</p>
            <p>This report notwithſtanding, our purpoſe held, and our men were ſent to the ſaid place, where they found that the earth, euery way a mile diſtant had beene digged and turned vp in euery place of any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, to haue any thing hidden in it. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, for all that narrow ſearch, all our mens labour was not quite loſt: but ſo conſidered, that the third day after their departure, they all returned ſafe and cheerefull, with as much ſiluer as they and all the <hi>Symerons</hi> could finde, (<hi>viz:</hi> thirteene barres of ſiluer, and ſome fewe quoits of gold) with which they were preſently embarqued without empeachment, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with no leſſe ſpeed then joy to our Fregate.</p>
            <p>Now was it high time to thinke of homewards, hauing ſped our ſelues as wee deſired: and therefore our Captaine concluded to viſit <hi>Rio grand,</hi> once againe, to ſee if he could meet with any ſufficient Ship or Bark, to cary victuall enough to ſerue our turne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in which wee might in ſafety and ſecurity em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque our ſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:10680:50"/>The French-men hauing formerly gone from vs as ſoone as they had their ſhares at our firſt returne with the Treaſure, as being very deſirous to returne home into their Countrey, and our Captaine as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to diſmiſſe them, as they were to be diſmiſſed; for that hee foreſawe they could not in their Shippe auoid the danger of being taken by the Spaniards, if they ſhould make out any Men of warre for them, while they lingred on the Coaſt, and hauing alſo beene then againe releeued with victuals by vs: Now at our meeting of them againe, were very loath to leaue vs, and therefore accompanied vs very kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as farre vp as Saint <hi>Barnards,</hi> and farther would, but that they durſt not aduenture ſo great danger, for that wee had intelligence, that the Fleete was ready to ſet ſayle for <hi>Spaine,</hi> riding at the entry of <hi>Carthagena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus wee departed from them, paſſing hard by <hi>Carthagena,</hi> in the ſight of all the Fleete, with a Flagge of Saint <hi>George</hi> in the maine top of our Fregate, with ſilke ſtreamers and ancients downe to the water, ſayling forward with a large winde, till wee came within two leagues of the Riuer, being all lowe land, and darke night: where to preuent the ouer-ſhooting of the Riuer in the night, we lay off &amp; on bearing ſmall ſayle, till that about mid-night the winde vee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Eaſtward, by two of the clocke in the morning, a Fregate from <hi>Rio grand</hi> paſſed hard by vs, bearing alſo but ſmall ſayle. We ſaluted them with our ſhot and Arrowes, they anſwered vs with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but wee got aboard them, and tooke ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they were content againſt their willes to depart a ſhoare and to leaue vs this Fregate which was of twenty fiue Tunne, loaded with Maiz, and Hens
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10680:50"/>
and Hogs, &amp; ſome Honey, in very good time fit for our vſe: for the Honey eſpecially was a notable releeuer and preſeruer of our craſed people.</p>
            <p>The next morning as ſoone as wee ſet thoſe Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards a ſhoare on the maine, wee ſet our courſe for the <hi>Cabeças</hi> without any ſtop, whither wee came about fiue dayes after. And being at anchor, preſently wee houe out all the Maizaland, ſauing three Buts which we kept for our ſtore: and carying all our prouiſions a ſhoare, wee brought both our Fregates on the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and new tallowed them.</p>
            <p>Here wee ſtayed about ſeauenight, trimming and rigging our Fregates, boarding and ſtowing our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions, tearing abroad and burning our Pinnaces, that the <hi>Symerons</hi> might haue the yron-worke.</p>
            <p>About a day or two before our departure, our Captaine willed <hi>Pedro</hi> and three of the cheefeſt of the <hi>Symerons</hi> to goe through both his Fregates, to ſee what they liked, promiſing to giue it them whatſoeuer it were, ſo it were not ſo neceſſary as that hee could not returne into <hi>England</hi> without it. And for their wifes hee would himſelfe ſeeke out ſome ſilkes or lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen that might gratifie them: which while hee was chooſing out of his Trunckes, the Cymeter which Captaine <hi>Tetú</hi> had giuen to our Captaine, chanced to be taken forth in <hi>Pedros</hi> ſight, which hee ſeeing grew ſo much in liking thereof, that hee accounted of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in reſpect of it, and preferred it before all that could be giuen him: yet imagining, that it was no leſſe eſteemed of our Captaine, durſt not himſelfe open his mouth to craue or commend it: but made one <hi>Francis Tucker</hi> to be his meane to breake his minde, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to giue him a fine quoit of gold, which yet hee
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10680:51"/>
had in ſtore, if he would but moue our Captaine for it; and to our Captaine himſelfe, hee would giue foure other great quoits, which hee had hidden, intending to haue reſerued them till another voyage.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine being accordingly moued by <hi>Francis Tucker,</hi> could haue beene content to haue made no ſuch exchange, but yet deſirous to content him, that had deſerued ſo well, hee gaue it him with many good words, who receiued it with no little joy, affirming that if hee ſhould giue his wife and children (which hee loued dearely) in liew of it, hee could not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recompence it, (for hee would preſent his King with it, who hee knew would make him a great man, euen for this very guifts ſake) yet in gratuity and ſteed of other requitall of this jewell, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired our Captaine to accept theſe foure peeces of gold, as a token of his thankefulneſſe to him, and a pawne of his faithfulneſſe during life.</p>
            <p>Our Captaine receiued it in moſt kinde ſort, but tooke it not to his own benefit, but cauſed it to be caſt into the whole aduenture, ſaying, if hee had not beene ſet forth to that place, he had not attained ſuch a commoditie, and therefore it was juſt that they which bare part with him of his burthen in ſetting him to Sea, ſhould enjoy the proportion of his benefit whatſoeuer at his returne.</p>
            <p>Thus with good loue and liking wee tooke our leaue of that people, ſetting ouer to the Ilands of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
