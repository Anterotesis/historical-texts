            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>BEcause Dr. <hi>Russel,</hi> or some <hi>Friend</hi> of his, did a while since disgrace the Press, with some scraps of their <hi>Narrative,</hi> stuff'd with Nonsense and Partiality; nay, and by its Title did delude the Vulgar with an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that it contained the true State of the <hi>Portsmouth Disputation;</hi> and the same, how Unjust soever, being Cheap, hath been scatter'd throughout most parts of the Kingdom: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Advice of our Brethren, from various Parts, we have offered (so far as this small Tract would admit) the strength of Arguments then urged on both Sides, omitting Names and Personal Reflections, apprehending this way may be most Grateful to Persons seriously Inquisitive. We have also annex'd a few Arguments, which with others, were then ready to be urg'd, had the Company's Satisfaction requir'd, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Evening, admitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103948:3"/>If this fall into the hands of the Learned, we request them to remember, That it is design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Persons of meaner Capacities, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understand, Ornaments of Speech, nor affect Terms of Logick.</p>
            <p>If it fall into hands more Illiterate, yet willing to receìve Divine Truths, we request of them, that they would weigh it in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Scripture and Sanctified Reason; yea, and we request of God, that they may.</p>

               <hi>QUESTION I.</hi> Whether, according to the Commission of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Adult Believers only, are the Proper Subjects of Baptism, and not Infants? Asserted by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedo-Baptists.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Controversy is, Whether Christ's Ministers ought (1.) To deny Baptism to the Infants of professed Christians. (2.) To Baptize those at Mature Age, who by vertue of descent from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians, were Baptized with a small quantity of Water, in Infancy?</p>
            <p>The first Argument offer'd at the Disputation by the <hi>Anti-paedo-Baptists,</hi> I consider last, because there it will come to be more fairly Answered.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-poedo-Baptist.</speaker>
               <p> I prove then, That no Infants can be the Subjects of Baptism according to <hi>Christ's</hi> Commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. No Infants can be made Disciples by the Ministry of Men; therefore no Infants can be the Subjects of Baptism, according to Christ's Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go teach,</hi> &amp;c. (or, <hi>Disciple) all Nations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paedo-Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> I deny your whole Argument; and (1.) I assert, If they could not be made Disciples by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Men, yet this Text would not exclude them from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103948:4"/>
Baptism. And then, (2.) I assert, That they be made Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by the Ministery of Men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-Paed.</speaker>
               <p> Christ puts Teaching before Baptism; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it goes before, and consequently Infants are Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paedo-Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> This is a weak way of Arguing. The word is placed before in Scripture, therefore the thing signified must go before. Were this true, then Baptism must go before Confession of Sin in the Adult, because it's said, <hi>They were Baptized, Confessing their sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Mat. 3. 6. Nay, Sanctification and Preservation in <hi>Christ,</hi> must go before Calling, <hi>Iude</hi> 1. But the contrary is evident to all.</p>
               <p>But farther, Infants may be Disciples, and therefore, by your own Argument, may be Baptized; they may be Taught in their Parents, as well as the <hi>Kohathites</hi> keep the Charge of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in their Parents, from a Month old, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 28. Or <hi>Levi</hi> pay Tithes in <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 7. 9. Or the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>David's</hi> time rejoice in their Ancestors on the Banks of the <hi>Red Sea, Ps.</hi> 66. 6. <hi>There did we rejoice.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> as considered in our Parents.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-Paed.</speaker>
               <p> But how can this be by the Ministery of Men?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paedo-Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> (1.) By the Preaching of Men, Parents may be constrain'd to resign their <hi>All</hi> to God, and so their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. (2.) They are immediately Discipled by Men's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, when Parents and Ministers concur in their Solemn Dedication to God by Baptism.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-Paed.</speaker>
               <p> But Teaching and Learning, make the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Master and Scholar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paedo-Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> The contrary is most true; the Master doth care for and command; the Scholar is subject, in order to Instruction; and Resignation of the Scholar, or his Parents for him, and Acceptance of the Master, constitutes the Rela<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion; and by virtue hereof, the Scholar is as much obliged to submit to his Master, according to his Capacity, before he touches a Book, as when he hath learned Seven Years. If Teaching were the ground of this Relation, then Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons long since Dead, might be our Governors. <hi>Iob</hi> 8. 8; 10. <hi>The former Age, and their Fathers shall teach thee.</hi> Nay the Beasts of the Field may be our Masters too, <hi>Iob</hi> 35. 11. <hi>Who teacheth us more than the Beasts of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103948:4"/>
We may learn of them, and yet be our own Governors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But <hi>Christ's</hi> Disciples are resigned to him, in order to their being both Governed, Taught, and Disposed of by him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Capacity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-Paed.</speaker>
               <p> Argum. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> did declare the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God, and yet did never declare the Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; therefore Infant-Baptism is no part of the Counsel of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paedo-Bapt.</hi> Neither ever did <hi>Paul</hi> declare, That the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Believers Children ought to be delay'd, till they can Personally profess their Faith; therefore thir Practice being such, is no part of the Counsel of God. Take the Argument to your self, and make the most of it.</p>
               <p>2. But I hope to prove Infant-Baptism from <hi>Paul's</hi> Words. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. But pray, Is nothing part of the Counsel of God, but what stands on Record as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Paul?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-Paed.</speaker>
               <p> Nothing; and therefore not Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paedo-Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> If nothing, then how great a part of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Old World, of the succeeding Patriarchs, of the Ceremonial Law, of Prophecies, Gospel-History, and other Sacred Matters in Holy Writ, is no part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God?</p>
               <p>The Truth therefore is, <hi>Paul</hi> might declare Infant-Baptism an hundred times, in his vast number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Pious Discourses, and yet the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> might not see fit to insert it, as delivered by him, this Doctrine being sufficiently Established in other <hi>New-Testament</hi> Texts.</p>
               <p>But farther, These words were spoken to the Church of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> And all that remains on Record of what he spake to them in two Years, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 9, 10, 11. is but the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and this in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. And dare any say, That he never declared<note place="margin">* See our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count p. 70, 71. for further Answer.</note> it to them, because it's not herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>Here, because some <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> from Dr. <hi>Russel's</hi> false Narrative do report, That we pretended at the Disputation, that six Leaves of <hi>Paul's</hi> Writings containing Infant-Baptism, may be lost, therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103948:5"/>
we will (tho otherwise 'twere impertinent) give a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of that Matter. The Doctor's weak Evasions, did force us to make our Answers evident beyond all Contradiction: And thus we Argued. If there were a Controversy, whether such an Author did use such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and his Writings were produc'd, if six Leaves of these Writings were lost, none could determine that he had no such Expression, because it might be contained in those six Leaves. The Controversy is, Whether <hi>Paul</hi> ever did by Preaching, Writing, or Discourse, declare Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. We cannot say we have all his Writings; we dare say, we have not the Hundredth part of his Sermons and Discourses: Who can then determine, that he never did any way declare Infant-Baptism to these <hi>Ephesians.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-Paed.</speaker>
               <p> Arg. 3. <hi>Christ</hi>'s Commission doth <hi>expresly</hi> shew, who are to be Baptized: But it doth not <hi>expresly</hi> shew that Infants are to be Baptized: Therefore Infants are not to be Baptized.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Paedo-Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> 1. Pray take your Argument back again, and get rid of it as well as you can. <hi>Christ</hi>'s Commission doth <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi> shew, who are to be Baptized: But it doth not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi> shew, That Adult Persons, if Baptized in Infancy, are to be Baptized again: Therefore Adult Persons, if Baptized in Infancy, are not to be Baptized again.

               <p> 1. For the same reason that the Baptism of the Israelitish Parents in the <hi>Cloud</hi> and in the <hi>Sea,</hi> was not imputed to their Infants; <hi>All that were under the Cloud</hi> (and therefore Infants) <hi>were Baptized,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2. This was a Type of the Gospel-Baptism.</p>
               <p>2. Because Infants are capable of Baptism, the Subject being therein Passive. But they are not capable of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal act of Faith; if they were, it would be expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103948:6"/>But further; You may as well conclude, that no Infant shall be Saved, because <hi>Believing</hi> goes before the word [<hi>Saved</hi>], as that no Infant must be Baptized, because <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> goes before the word [<hi>Baptized.</hi>] But the weakness of this Argument, drawn from placing the words, I have shewn before.</p>

               <p> A Person already Taught, must profess his Faith before he be Baptized; therefore an Infant that cannot profess his Faith, must not be Baptized. Says <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>If thou believest with all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p> This Instance shews indeed, That an Adult Jewish Proselyte must confess his Faith before Baptism; but neither this, nor any one word of God, doth shew, that Infants must be deny'd Baptism, because they cannot do what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Adult Persons. <note n="*" place="margin">See our Account, p. 73, 74.</note> This Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch was probably a Proselyte of the Covenant, and therefore a Member of the Jewish Church. The Infants of all such Proselytes (if they had any) were Church-Members with themselves. Now, must these poor Infants, immediately upon their Parents Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, be shut out of God's Church, of which they were Members before, because they make no profession of their Faith, which is impossible for Infants to do?</p>

               <p> Arg 4. If the Apostles never did Baptize Infants, then the Baptism of Infants is not according to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Commission.</p>

               <speaker>P<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> 1. I shall quickly shew, that the Scripture doth authorize the practice of Infant-Baptism, and thence 'twill follow, that they did Baptize Infants; and they might Baptize Thousands, tho the Scripture (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not the Hundredth part of what they did) doth not expresly tell us so.</p>
               <p>2. But this Argument also will fall on your selves. Thus, the Scripture doth not tell us, that the Apostles did deny Baptism to any Christian's Infant, or administer it to any Adult Person descending from a Christian, (tho from the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> to the death of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> was near 60 Years; in which time, Thousands of Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants must become Adult,) Therefore your Practice being such, is not according to Christ's Commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103948:6"/>3. But we have some probable Instances of Baptizing Infants: Whole Housholds were Baptized. I only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Jailor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33. <hi>He and all his were Baptized straitway.</hi> All his, upon his Believing.</p>

               <p>2. But I add, it might be preached to some as included in their Parents. Pray give me the like probable Instance for your practice.</p>

               <p>Now, I offer a fair Paraphrase of these Texts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with our way. <hi>Iohn</hi> Preached in the Wilderness near <hi>Iordan; Ierusalem</hi> and all <hi>Iudea</hi> came to him, and <hi>Christ</hi> among others. The Multitude being so great, he goes to <hi>Iordan</hi> (as he did another time to <hi>Enon</hi>) takes a step into the Water; those that are Baptized, do the like, (it being Refreshing rather than Afflicting in that hot Country.) and there <hi>Iohn</hi> doth <hi>Baptize</hi> or <hi>Wash</hi> them, by pouring Water on them, and then they go up <hi>out of</hi> or <hi>from</hi> the Water, which alway runs in a lower Place.</p>
               <p>This is much more probable, than that <hi>Iohn</hi> or the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. should <hi>Dip</hi> (according to your way) Hundreds, it may be Thousands in a day: That Person had need have Sinews of Brass, that could (according to your Custom) bear the weight of, lay down, and raise up so many in so little time: Besides his Limbs and Body must be soundly soak'd. I am sure the words will well bear our Sense. And Probability is much stronger on our side, than yours.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> Then I am sure, the Baptized Person must not go into the Water to his Wast. Do dead Men walk into the Grave, half bury themselves, and wait for the <hi>Sexton</hi> to bury their Head and Shoulders?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> But the whole Body is under Water, when a Person is Baptiz'd in our way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> But the Administrator dips but one half. And, Doth he speak Truth, when he tells the World, that Baptism is dipping the whole Body under Water, and that he doth, according to his sense of the Word, Baptize, <hi>i. e.</hi> dip the whole Body under Water, when he dips but one half? And dare he to affix the <hi>Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> to an Untruth? Do you think, <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> and the Apostles, did so? And if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103948:11"/>
not, then you have not the least Precept or Example, for your Practice. Is our way attended with this Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience?</p>
               <p>But further, <hi>Baptism</hi> is designed to signify the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Blood, Spirit, and Blessing; the application of this Blood, which is expressed by Sprinkling <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 44. 3. Heb. 12. 24. 1 Pet. 1. 2.</note> to signify and excite to a submissive frame of Spirit. Is your way so well adapted to all these ends? Can any be thrust into the Spirit or Blessing of <hi>Christ,</hi> or are Persons like to be so Composed (supposing them Adult) when striving for Life, especially in Frost and Snow, as when a little water on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is poured on them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> But many Learned <hi>Paedo-Baptists</hi> acknowledge, that our way is most agreeable to Scripture.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> 1. Will you stand by the Authority of these Men in other Matters? If not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why would you have us in this? (2.) Do any of these say, that <hi>to Wash,</hi> is not the <hi>New-Testament</hi> sense of the Word? Or, Do they prove us in the Wrong? We take not Men's Opinions upon Trust, but Tryal. (3.) Who of those Authors have not adhered to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> to justify their Baptizing with a little Water in these cold Countries. (4.) Will not the Opinion and Practice of your Brethren in <hi>Holland,</hi> argue as strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, as the Opinion of these Men, had their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice been Dipping also, do against us. (5.) Will not the Opinion and Practice of so many Thousand Men, great for Learning and Piety, at this day, argue more strongly for us, than these Mens Opinion only, without their Practice, do against us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> But all you can pretend to for your Way, is Probability; it may be so, and it may not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> We acknowledge, The <hi>New-Testament</hi> hath not fixed the quantity of Water, and therefore we must have recourse to a Moral Precept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice:</hi> And this carries us beyond Probability, even to a Certainty; which is this; That we must so Administer it as shall consist with the safety
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103948:12"/>
of the Subject. <hi>Christ, v.</hi> 2, 3. justifies <hi>David</hi>'s eating the <hi>Shew-Bread,</hi> from these words, tho a positive Ritual Law were therein broken. Then certainly <hi>Christ</hi> will justify the Practice of applying a little Water in these cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where Life might be endanger'd by Dipping, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when neither Gospel Precept, nor Example, doth in the least oppose us.</p>
               <p>Nay, and knowing that <hi>Christ</hi> hath appointed for the strongest Christians, a Sacrament as pleasant as Eating and Drinking, we cannot imagin, that he would appoint one so very sharp, as Plunging in Frost and Snow, for the Weakest.</p>

            <head>I proceed to offer an Argument or two more.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> I Argue from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Else were Children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> The Infants of Believers, are Holy, therefore they have a right to Baptism.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> Legitimacy is there meant by Holiness, and therefore this doth not entitle them to Baptism.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bap.</speaker>
               <p> Legitimacy cannot descend from Believers, as Believers, but from Married Persons, as such, whether they believe or no. But this Holiness descends from Believers, as Believers, and therefore it cannot be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy. (2.) I deny that ever the word Holy is so used in all the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> tho we have it many hundred times, and therefore you force this Sense upon it to serve a Turn. (3.) If Legitimacy were meant, then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle would speak false. The Words would run thus [If the unbelieving Wife be not Sanctified by the believing Husband, your Children would be Bastards.] No, their being Husband and Wife, would secure their Children
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103948:12"/>
from Bastardy: Nay, and then all the Idolaters and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers in the World, if Legitimate, would be Holy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> But Holiness is not a ground of Baptism, if it were, then Horses Bells must be Baptized, <hi>&amp;c. Zech.</hi> 12. 20.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> When you can shew, that Bells were once Church-Members, that they have Immortal Souls, capable of Pardon, through the Blood and Merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then we will baptize Bells too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> But Children are Pure, or Holy, as all things else, that a Believer hath, are pure, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Enjoyment. To the Pure all things are Pure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> Then I am sure Legitimacy is not here meant, because, if a Person that hath a Bastard, be Converted and he truly Penitent, that Bastard is also Sanctified to his Enjoyment, because all things are. But you ought to shew, that Pure and Holy are the same; Holy doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a dedication to God. But Meat, which the Apostle there speaks of, might be clean, as many Creatures under the Law, which yet were not dedicated to God.</p>
               <p>In short, the word <hi>Holy</hi> is taken, as commonly it is in other Places, and it includes a visible separation for God, and Relation to him. Thus the Body of <hi>Israel</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 7. 6.</note> and afterward of a Gospel-Church, are called Holy <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 17.</note> in many Places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. From <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. <hi>The Promise is to you, and to your Children,</hi> &amp;c. This Promise the Infants of Penitent Persons have a right to; therefore they have a right to Baptism; <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>Be Baptized,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> The Context doth exclude Infants from the Promise, and therefore from Baptism. The Promise is confin'd to those that the Lord shall Call.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> If 'twere so, then <hi>Peter</hi> just upon receiving extraordinary Wisdom from Heaven, would speak Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently: Whereas, he says, <hi>The Promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God shall call:</hi> He might have left out their Children, and they would easily have understood, that their Children if once called, should be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103948:13"/>
in those words, <hi>As many as the Lord shall call.</hi> And farther, supposing your Sense to be true, this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase may justly be put on the Words: [You grown Jews, and ye Gentiles, when Called, have a right to Church-Privileges; but your poor Infants, who for many hundred Years past have had the same, are now through the gracious efficacy of Christ's Death, strip'd of it, tho they (poor Hearts!) never did the least to forfeit it.] Do you think this would have been a good Plaister for their wounded Hearts? And can we imagine, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these, nor any tender Parents of all the Jewish Converts, would have put in the least Plea to God or Man on the behalf of their poor abject Infants; or if they had, that the Scripture would have quite buried it in Silence, when we have their Contests about Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising Infants, Recorded?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> But Children are not impertinently mention'd, for the Jews had brought the guilt of Christ's Blood upon their Children as well as themselves; <hi>His Blood be on us and our Children.</hi> He drops a word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them, with relation to these Children.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> Yes, all these Children, and therefore their poor Infants, on whom they had brought the Curse, as well as an those of riper Years. Say they, <hi>His blood be upon our children, whom we have a right in, and are concerned for.</hi> This they spake to spit their Venom against Christ, And the Apostle chargeth these Jews with it, <hi>v.</hi> 23. 36. Now, the Apostle makes the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as broad as the Wound, and assures them, That upon their Repentance, the Promise, and therefore Church-Privileges would belong to their Children, with themselves, even all on whom they brought the Curse.</p>
               <p>Supposing the Church-Membership of our Infants, to be the main thing opposed by you, I offer this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Infants of converted Jews were not cast out of God's Church; therefore the Infants of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentiles, are not kept out. I prove that God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103948:13"/>
did not cast out the former, therefore neither doth he keep out the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. God did not cast out those Infants in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, nor in Mercy; therefore not at all. Not in Judgment: For, how is it consistent with Infinite Grace to inflict so great a Judgment, as deprivation of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membership on those who never did the least to Forfeit it themselves, and whose Parents are God's peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites? Nor yet in Mercy to those Infants; for how could he in Mercy deprive them of so great a Blessing <note n="*" place="margin">The great advantages of Infant Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, see in our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, p. 8.</note> except he gave them a greater in its room? But where's that greater Blessing vouchsafed to Infants?</p>
               <p>2. Not one Privilege of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Grace,</hi> was ever taken away by the death of Christ, in whom all the Promises were, <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> Therefore the Church-membership of Jewish Infants, was not taken away by the Death of <hi>Christ:</hi> And if not by his Death then not at all.</p>
               <p>I prove, That Church-membership is a Privilege of the Covenant of <hi>Grace.</hi> It must be of the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> or of <hi>Works;</hi> but it cannot be of <hi>Works;</hi> therefore it must be of <hi>Grace.</hi> No other Covenant but that of Grace, hath set up a Church in the World, since the Fall of Man, or admitted any into it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> Have all Church-Members then a right to the Covenant of <hi>Grace?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> They have a Visible right to it. We ought so in Charity to judge, while they are rightful Members?</p>
               <p>None could justly Exclude those Jewish Infants that were regularly Circumcised from a visible Right, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Covenant of <hi>Grace:</hi> Because Circumcision made them Debtors to the whole Ceremonial Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. And God never yet divided the Promises from the Precepts of that Law, and these together made up the Covenant of <hi>Grace.</hi> Those who are visibly under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of this Covenant, have visibly a right to the promissive part of it. But the Jewish Infants were to be manag'd by it, and (as they grew up) obedient to it, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103948:14"/>
so were under the preceptive part of it. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, if no part of the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> and so neither this Privilege, which the Infants of the Jewish Converts had, were ever taken away, then such Converts were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cast out of Gods's Church, upon Christ his Death, or their Parents Believing. And from hence We may conclude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. That the Infants of Gentile Converts, are not kept out: Because Jews and Gentiles have the same Privileges in Christ. This, I suppose, no <hi>Anti-Paedo-Baptist</hi> will deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
               <p>Other Arguments might be offered, as the Reader may observe in the Abridgment of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Sermons prefix'd to our <hi>Impartial Account.</hi> But a design of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity forbids here to add them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </speaker>
               <p> But after all, the best Arguments you can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Infant-Baptism, are but Consequential. Let us have somewhat Express.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> Shew me where an Adult Person is expresly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be Baptized.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> Adult Persons making a credible profession of Faith, are Disciples of Christ; therefore brought to be Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>zed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> And what is this but Consequence? Such a one is a Disciple, therefore, by consequence, he ought to be <hi>Baptized.</hi> This Argument is convincing.</p>
               <p>I add, a Believer's Infant is, in a Scripture sense, Holy; a Church Member hath a visible right to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. a Disciple, therefore he ought to be Baptized. Is not this Arguement as convincing as the other?</p>
               <p>Pray, how would you clear up your Right to future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Anti-P.</speaker>
               <p> I would endeavour to prove myself a Believer an Holy Person. And finding Eternal Life made over to such, and not finding upon the most strict enquiry, one word in all the Book of God, to exclude such from it, I should conclude my right to future Happiness, unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103948:14"/>
               <speaker>P. Bapt.</speaker>
               <p> Well then, I have proved the Infants of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Holy Persons, Church-Members, Disciples, and this in a Scripture sense; such I have proved entituled to Baptism. And not finding upon the most strict enquiry, one word in all the Book of God, to exclude them from it, I conclude their right to Baptism unquestionable.</p>
               <p>Arguments for the Baptism of an Unbaptized Professing Christian, nay, for the true Christian's Salvation, are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential, and yet most Convincing. Why then should Arguments for the baptism of Believers Infants be slighted, because Consequential, when they are so many, and so clear from Scripture?</p>
