         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(Firſt Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſince at <hi>Bristol,</hi> Anno 1644.) Which begins thus:</p>

THE REBELS MARTYRED <hi>the moſt Reverend Father in God,</hi> William Lord Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury <hi>upon Tower hill, after they had kept him priſoner above four years:</hi> And then relating his ſpeech and Prayer on the Scaffold, it concludes in theſe words: <hi>Thus dyed the</hi> KINGS, <hi>and the</hi> CHURCHES <note place="margin">Note.</note> MARTYR; <hi>a man of ſuch Integrity, Learning, Devotion, and Courage, as had he lived in the Primitive times, they would have given him another name: whom though the cheated multitude were taught to miſconceive, (for theſe honoured him) yet impartiall posterity will know how to value him, when they hear the Rebels ſentenced him the very ſame houre that they voted down the</hi> Liturgy <hi>of the</hi> Church of <hi>England; whoſe innocency cryes to heaven for Vengeance, upon the heads of theſe</hi> deſtroyers, <hi>who pile</hi> MURTHER <hi>upon Murther to fortifie their Covenant, that upon this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may come all the RIGHTEOUS BLOOD, from him whoſe blood was first ſhed, to the pulling down this great Pillar of our Church; which if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, is</hi> THE MOST GROUNDLES, MALITIOUS, SOLEMNE STUDIED MURTHER THAT EVER WAS COMMITTED IN THIS WRET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHED <note place="margin">Note.</note> ISLAND.</p>

him, the <hi>Archeſt Enemy</hi> to, the moſt active univerſall <hi>Underminer</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed among us, that ever breathed in <hi>Engliſh ayre;</hi> and readily acknowledge, that no <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Annalls</hi> ever recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his <hi>Paralell,</hi> for multiplicity of deſperate cunning <hi>Jeſuiticall Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems</hi> ſecretly to ſubvert that Orthodox <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe pretended to profeſſe; nay, propagate and patronize.</p>
            <p>It is far below the Magnanimity of my Spirit in the leaſt meaſure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly to blaſt the <hi>Fame,</hi> or revengefully to triumph over, to trample upon the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of a <hi>Vanquiſhed Enemy,</hi> whom I never dreaded, or ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all his life, forgave and pittied both before and at his death; the <hi>Memory</hi> of whoſe <hi>Capital crimes</hi> ſhould have expired with his <hi>breath,</hi> and been eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>buried in oblivion</hi> with his <hi>Corps,</hi> by me, had not Your <hi>Honors ſuperiour Commânds</hi> neceſſitated me to revive, record them to Poſterity ſince his death (as well as to give them in evidence at his <hi>Tryall,)</hi> for Vindication of <hi>Your untainted Justice,</hi> and the <hi>Common Good,</hi> to deter all others in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages from the like <hi>Trayterous Practiſes.</hi> If any therefore deem my <hi>Expreſsions,</hi> concerning him or his actions, over-laviſh, malicious, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull, let them impartially compare them with his <hi>Criminall Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> here recorded, (which they hardly equalize, or fall far ſhort of) and then if they warrant not the <hi>harſheſt Epithites,</hi> the blackeſt <hi>Characters</hi> here beſtowed on him, let me eternally bear the blame and ſhame: but if they be ſcarce proportionate to his <hi>Treaſons,</hi> his grand <hi>Miſdemeanors,</hi> (which muſt be blazoned and ſet forth in language ſuitable to their <hi>tranſcendent Hainouſneſse,</hi> not minced, not extenuated by over-diminutive expreſſions) I hope none will or can be ſo injurious, as to charge me with <hi>Calumny,</hi> much leſſe <hi>Scurrility</hi> or <hi>Revenge,</hi> who never yet particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, received the leaſt farthing Recompence from him or any of his, for all the <hi>barbarous Cruelties, Oppreſsions, Impriſonments great Loſſes, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> I ſuſtained, eight years ſpace together, onely for diſcovering, oppoſing, countermining (to the utmoſt of my skill and power) all <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plots, Innovations, Proceedings</hi> of this Arch-Prelate and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to undermine our Religion, re-eſtabliſh Popery among us by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and ſet up an <hi>arbitrary Papall power,</hi> the better to effect the ſame: the onely reall cauſe of all my former ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Yet three things there are, I foreſee may poſſibly be objected againſt me by his complices, which need ſome Anſwer to prevent their cauſeleſſe Calumnies.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That in this <hi>Hiſtory of his Tryall,</hi> I have at large inſerted ſome particular papers, paſſages, (eſpecially in the Catalogue of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Popiſh Errours,</hi> vented in, and of the clauſes againſt them purged out of late new Printed Books) which were not actually, or at leaſt fully read at the Lords Bar; Therefore I am guilty of partiality and unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in relating the Evidence given in againſt him at the Bar, by theſe additions to it.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer. Firſt, that all the Evidence, Paſſages here at large recited (with many more) were prepared and ready by me at the Bar; yea <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> the effect of every Paper, paſſage here recorded, was in generall terms ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, preſſed at the tryall, though not all fully read and particularly urged
<pb facs="tcp:61245:4"/>
for want of time: which I have here more largely inſerted for clearing the truth, and ſatisfying the Reader, the moſt materiall paſſages being onely read at large, the reſt of like nature but briefly referred to in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to avoyd prolixity, and husband time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that I have largely recorded none of theſe Paſſages here by way of New <hi>Additionall Evidence,</hi> requiring anſwer, but onely for illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or corroboration of the old, fully given in and read.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Catalogue of new licenſed Popiſh Doctrines, and of the Purgations of Paſſages againſt Popery, Arminianiſme, arbytrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Prophaneſſe, &amp;c. wherein moſt of the new Additions, not fully read, are inſerted, make but one intire charge, not divers; and had but one generall Anſwer, defence given to them by the Arch-biſhop; to wit, that they were not licenſed nor purged out by himſelf, but only by his and the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Chaplains, who muſt anſwer for them, and that they concerned not him: therefore theſe Additions making no new charge, and receiving all the ſelfe ſame Anſwer &amp; defence, no indifferent perſons can juſtly taxe me with partiality or injuſtice for inſerting them into this Hiſtory, for the fuller diſcovery of his Popiſh intentions in this kinde, (which want of time prevented us to diſplay ſo fully at the Bar, as was deſired, where we had each particular ready in writing proved upon oath) it being not onely excuſable, but juſtifiable, yea neceſſary in a Hiſtory of this nature, which ſo much concernes Religion and the publick.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing, which perchance will be alleadged againſt me, is; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> That I have not ſo fully, ſo punctually related the Arch-biſhops ſeverall Anſwers and Replyes to all the particulars of his charge as he uttered them <hi>viva voce</hi> at the Bar in his particular and generall <hi>Defences</hi> (who ſpake as much for himſelfe as the wit of man could invent, in ſo bad a cauſe) and that I have made ſome few Additions to the Commons ſodain Replications to his Anſwers.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer: Firſt, that I uſed all poſſible diligence, both by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> intreaty and the power of Authory, to procure the Archbiſhops own Notes of his Anſwers and Defences to the Commons charge, or authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Coppies of them, from Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> his Secretary and others; that ſo I might Print them <hi>verbatim</hi> to avoyd all calumnies; but I could obtain neither from them; M <hi>Dell</hi> proteſting, that neither he, nor any other to his knowledge, had the originalls nor any coppyes of them; and <hi>that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, his Lord did burn all the Notes of his anſwers and defence before his death, of purpoſe to prevent their publication after it.</hi> So that if I have caſually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or miſtaken any part of his <hi>Anſwers</hi> or <hi>Defence,</hi> himſelf or his own creatures muſt beare the blame, not I; who have as faithfully, as exactly as I could ſupplyed this defect of his own Papers, out of the Notes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mind own fragill memory, relating all his Anſwers, Defences, as neer as poſſible in his own termes, and preſſing them fully for his beſt advantage, without the leaſt wilfull omiſſion or diminution of any one particular of moment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the Commons ſubitane Replyes to his Anſwers, I have rehearſed them as neer as I could in their own termes; and made no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereunto, but onely of ſome <hi>Authors teſtimonies</hi> concerning the
<pb facs="tcp:61245:5"/>
               <hi>unlawfulneſs of Images, Crucifixes, Altars, the placing and rayling in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars and Lords Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s altarwiſe againſt the Eaſtwall, &amp; the conſecration of Churches and Chapples;</hi> wherein the Archbiſhop much abuſed his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory with empty flaſhes and confident pretences of antiquity, which Mr <hi>Serjeant Wilde</hi> at large refuted by the Teſtimony of <hi>Fathers</hi> &amp; other orthodox Writers, and Mr <hi>Nicholus</hi> too, as far as the ſhortneſſe of time permitted; to the ſubſtance of whoſe replies in theſe particulars I have added very little, but only for learning ſake and the fuller clearing of the truth.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall further object, that J have related his Charge intirely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one continued <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> but his Anſwers &amp; the Commons Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> thereto in fractions; not in one continued Diſcourſe, as they were delivered each day ſeverally at the Bar, and ſummed up at laſt in the Lords and Commons Houſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it is truth: and I did it for theſe Reaſons. Firſt, to avoyde Prolixity, &amp; tedious Repetitions of the ſelf-ſamethings: For had I reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> his ſeverall <hi>Anſwers, Defences</hi> &amp; the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons Replies to them as they were made at the Bar each day by themſelves; and then repeated his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Anſwers, Defences in the Lords and Commons Houſe, and Mr <hi>Brownes</hi> Reply thereto diſtinctly by themſelves, I ſhould have repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſelfe-ſamethings, with very little variation, three or four times over to no purpoſe; whereas now I have contracted the ſumme of all his Anſwers, Defences to each particular Charg &amp; Proof with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Replies thereto into one, to eſchew Prolixity and Tautologies: 2ly, I did it to prevent confuſion; and for clearer Diſcovery of the truth, the pertinency of the evidence given in againſt him in each Particular: For had I contracted all his Anſwers, Defences into one, and repreſented them in one intire continued Diſcourſe by themſelves; and then have ſubjoyned the Commons Replies unto them intirely together, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der could never have clearly diſcovered the frivilouſnes, falſenes, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of his ſeverall Anſwers to each particular charge, or the ſtrength of the Commons Replies thereto; nor yet ſo well have obſerved, to what particulars he gave anſwer, to what not; whereas now by this Perſpicuous Method I have followed, in reciting his Particular Anſwers and Defence diſtinctly to each Branch of his Charge and the Evidence brought to prove it, and then annexing the Commons Replies thereunto; the Readers may with eaſe and delight (by comparing the Charge, Proofes, Anſwers, Defence and Replies together) moſt clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the truth, weight of each Charge and Proof; the weakneſſe, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, defects, and inſufficiency of all his Anſwers; the ſatisfactorines of the Commons Replies, and his undoubted Guiltineſſe of all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars charged on him. Thirdly, the Archbiſhop alledged ſundry things in his particular Anſwers and Defences each day, which he omitted in his <hi>generall Defences</hi> in <hi>both Houſes;</hi> and added ſome things in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Defences,</hi> which he omitted in his particular; by reaſon whereof I was neceſſitated to collect all his ſcattered Anſwers, Defences to each particular Charge into one, for his better advantage, and the Commons Replies thereto. Which being thus compacted together, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb facs="tcp:61245:5"/>
of any heterogenius matter in their proper places, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reaſons neceſſitating me to this method; no rationall man can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taxe me for it, as being no wayes injurious to the Archbiſhops cauſe, nor tending to his diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>Theſe Objections from the Arch-biſhops Prelaticall partie being removed, there are two things more, wherein Your <hi>Honours</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> may juſtly demand ſome ſatisfaction, to exempt me from all cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe cenſures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you may juſtly inquire the Reaſons; why this <hi>Hiſtory of the Arch-biſhops Tryall,</hi> hath ſtuck ſo long in my hands before its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing it was expected many moneths ſince?</p>
            <p>Secondly, why it comes forth by parcels onely, not compleat and intire, after ſo long an expectation of the whole tryall and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings?</p>
            <p>To the former demand, I anſwer: Firſt, that this task was by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Order, originally impoſed upon thoſe Members of the Commons Houſe, that managed the Evidence, not on me: who totally declining it, ſome four Moneths after the Triall and above 2 Moneths after the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, this work was delegated by the Commons unto me; at which time moſt of the <hi>Papers, Notes, Books, Evidences,</hi> uſed at his tryall, were laid aſide and diſperſed into ſeverall mens hands: whereby much time was ſpent before I could recollect and marſhall them into Order, to digeſt this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> out of them. Secondly, ſince the aſſignment of this task unto my care, I have been almoſt every day taken up with publike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments for the State, at the <hi>Committee of Accounts,</hi> and elſewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the dayly avocations of my particular calling (my onely ſupport ſince our unhappy Wars) ſo as I have had few vacant hours to compile it, but thoſe I have borrowed from my naturall reſt, whiles others have bin ſleeping. Thirdly, I have ſince this undertaking, been neceſſitated to write &amp; publiſh ſundry other Impreſſions (uncapable of delay) in defence of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction of Parliaments, Civill Magiſtrates;</hi> and concerning <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures and Church-Government,</hi> againſt <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Anabaptiſts,</hi> others; yea to Vindicate the <hi>Parliaments juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi> with mine own Innocency, againſt the ſeditious <hi>Anti-parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Libels,</hi> of that notorious impudent Libeller and Lyat, <hi>L. Col. Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> who ſtill <note n="*" place="margin">See his late Libell intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Innocency and Truth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</hi>
               </note> perſevers in his treſpaſſes, to the diſhonour and ſcandall of publike juſtice. All which conſidered, I ſuppoſe Your <hi>Honours</hi> and others will eaſily beleeve, I wanted no diligence, but leiſure onely for the ſpeedier accompliſhment of this work: wherein notwithſtanding I have not been negligent, witneſſe my publication of the <hi>Breviate of the Archbiſhops life,</hi> and of <hi>A neceſſary Introduction of his Tryall,</hi> (amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a large Volume) ſufficient to aſſoyle me from the leaſt imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of idleneſſe or negligence in this very ſubject. Fourthly, Adde hereunto the voluminouſneſſe of this <hi>Firſt Part of the Archbiſhops Tryal</hi> onely, with the variety of the matter, charges therein conteined; the trouble I had in digeſting, the Labour in compiling, writing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiwing, fitting it for and Correcting, Reviſing it at the Preſſe, with the
<pb facs="tcp:61245:6"/>
coldneſſe of this laſt winters Vacation, when neither pen, nor Preſſe could worke, for ſundry weekes together: and compare this with the former reaſons (and the Printers ſlackneſſe which hath delayed it very much) and then I doubt not but your <hi>Honours</hi> and all others will rather wonder, how I could poſſibly compleat this <hi>Voluminous Part</hi> ſo ſpeedily, then queſtion or quarrell with me, why it comes forth ſo ſlowly? it being work enough to have ſwallowed up all my time ſince the <hi>Order,</hi> had I had no other imployments to divert me.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond demand, I muſt returne this Anſwer: Firſt, that I <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2.</note> publiſhed this Hiſtory thus in parcells, for want of time to compleat and print it all together in due ſeaſon. Secondly, that the long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Tryall, and mens calling for it every day, induced me to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their longing appetites, with theſe <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> of it, <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion;</hi> (the thing moſt looked, moſt inquired after, both at home and abroad) till the full crop be ripened for the harveſt, which will require ſome <hi>warmer moneths</hi> to concoct it, ere it can attain to maturity. Thirdly, The great Charge of the <hi>Stationer</hi> in Printing this firſt Part, (the voluminouſneſſe and price whereof hath, I fear, out-ſwelled moſt Chapments purſes in theſe Indegent times) with the ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the incertainty of my life and future opportunity, in theſe dayes of War and mortality, to finiſh the remainder of this Worke (which God willing I intend to compleat and publiſh with all convenient ſpeed) have induced me, rather to gratifie your Honours and the World with theſe Firſt fruits for the preſent, then to hazard the depriving you of it, or the whole Hiſtory, if deferred till all were compleated.</p>
            <p>Having anſwered theſe demands, I ſhall now crave liberty and your Noble Patience to raiſe ſome profitable Obſervations from the <hi>Subject matter of this Hiſtory,</hi> not unworthy your <hi>Honours</hi> ſaddeſt thoughts.</p>
            <p>If you conſider the meane obſcure Parentage of this <hi>Arch-Prelate,</hi> his grand Preferments, the great miſchiefes he did in Church, State, and his Execution after all; it may ſuggeſt theſe profitable contemplations to your minds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That God by his power and all-diſpoſing providence can raiſe up Perſons of the loweſt place or Parentage, to the higheſt Pinacles of worldly Honour: according to that in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 7, 8. <hi>He raiſeth up the Poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the Beggar from the dunghill, to ſet them among the Princes, and make them inherite the Throne of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That God can make the moſt vile and deſpicable perſons in the world, grand Peſts or Puniſhments to whole Kingdomes, Nations, when he pleaſeth; <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 21, 22. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 26. c. 12. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> c. 13. &amp; 14. (even as he made <hi>Frogs, Lice, Caterpillers</hi> (the vileſt creatures) a very ſore plague to King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the whole <hi>Kingdome of Egypt,</hi> Exod. c. 7. 8. and 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That perſons ſodainly advanced from the loweſt degree of men, to the higheſt pitch of honour, proove commonly the moſt inſolent, violent, domineering, imperious, tyrannicall, and miſchievous of all
<pb facs="tcp:61245:6"/>
ſuch preferments, being unable to weld or mannage the greatneſſe of their fortune. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48. to the end, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 10. 8. to 16. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 1. 6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 6. to 13. <hi>Iob.</hi> 21. 7. to 20.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That grand preferments without great grace to mannage, improve them to Gods glory, and the common good, are greater judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than bleſſings, and for the moſt part, the immediate occaſions of mens greateſt ruin by their evill Councells, or ill managing of their greatneſſe to the publike prejudice, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. 3. to 21. <hi>Iob</hi> 21. 7. &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 1. 2. <hi>Eſter c.</hi> 3. to 8.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That miſchievous Councellours and wicked Inſtruments in Church, State; though never ſo great in power or Favour with their Princes for a ſeaſon, ſeldome eſcape condigne exemplary puniſhment at the laſt: and that no greatneſſe whatſoever is able finally to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect miſchevous Grandees, from the hand of publike juſtice: <hi>Eſter</hi> 7. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 28. to 35.</p>
            <p>Let all great ones then ſeriouſly conſider this, and remember <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> leſt they dye and fall like him.</p>
            <p>If we again obſerve his Preferments, Actions, Proceedings and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable end as a Clergy man, we may raiſe theſe profitable obſervations from this Hiſtory of his Tryall, which all Prelates, Clergy men may do well to conſider, is oft as they thinke of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that when Clergy men caſt aſide or neglect their callings, and turne meer Stateſmen, they commonly prove the very worſt and moſt oppreſſive Perſons of all others. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 13. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That one over potent Prelate backed with a Kings Royall power and favour, is able to unſetleReligion where it is beſt eſtabliſhed, and embroyle, ruine the moſt flouriſhing Churches, Kingdomes in few yeares ſpace. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 2. to 18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That there are no ſuch deſperate underminers, perſecutors, ſuppreſſors of Gods true Religion, Saints, people, as over potent wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Prelates: And that diſſembling Potent Proteſtant Prelates, Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are greater Enemies to the Proteſtant Religion for the moſt part, then profeſſed Papiſts: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 5. 11. 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 22. 30. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 70, 71.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the fouleſt Practiſes, Conſpiracies againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion may be and uſually are guilded over with the moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences for its Advancement. And therefore it concernes us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to weigh and judge of men by their Actions, not their Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2. to 18.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That the moſt hopefull deſignes, the moſt ſucceſſefull Plots, Proceedings againſt the true Religion and Saints of God, do alwayes prove abortive in concluſion; and that the prevailing contrivances, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of many yeares travell in this kinde are uſually, by a divine over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling providence, oft times, like ſo many Cobwebs, ſwept down, daſhed in pieces, and wholy diſappointed in a moment, when they are neareſt accompliſhment in all humane probability <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21. 11, 12. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 3. &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 19 to 31. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 8. 9. 10.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That God in his infinite wiſedome and juſtice can turne all the Plots, Coutrivances of wicked men to ruine his truth, Church, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:61245:7"/>
to be the proper immediate inſtruments of their contrivers ruine. <hi>(He taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Job. 5. 12, 13, 14.) and to the advancement of his Goſpel, Cauſe, people, as he did in the caſes of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Mordecay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, That great Eccleſiaſticall or temporall Preferments and Court Favours, ſeldome make men better but worſer then before: <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12. <hi>c.</hi> 8. 10. 19. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>c.</hi> 31. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Eightly, That thoſe who are Superſtitious or Preſumptuous in their life time, are ſeldome penitent, but for the moſt part obſtinate, ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe or deſperate at their deaths; and have commonly a greater care to ſupport their crackt credits, by juſtifying or denying their evill actions, then to ſave their ſouls, by confeſſing or bewailing their guilt.</p>
            <p>This was the condition of this Arch-Prelate who lived to ſurvive and behold the downfall of all his Popiſh Plots, Innovations, Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Canons, the High Commiſſion and Prelacy it ſelfe, the grand I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls he endeavoured to ſet up and perpetuate among us; Yet all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, Idolatries, Romiſh Errors, Tyrannous oppreſſions he had maintained, practiſed in his life, he moſt obſtinately juſtified, without the leaſt remorſe, or acknowledgment of guilt, of error, both at his Tryall and Death. Yea though he were ſo conſcious to himſelfe of all the crimes wherewith he was charged, that he procured a <hi>Pardon</hi> from <hi>Oxford</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Kings</hi> own hand and <hi>great Seale,</hi> ſoon after the beginning of his Tryall (which made him ſo bold, ſo peremptory at the Barr;) yet leſt it ſhould imply or argue a guiltineſſe in him, he choſe rather to conceal this <hi>Pardon,</hi> and ſtand upon his plenary juſtification, till after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, then produce or plead it; not ſending it to your <hi>Honors</hi> till he was ordered <hi>to be hanged at Tyburne:</hi> upon which occaſion he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both <hi>Houſes</hi> with it, to deprecate and exchange that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a more <hi>Honourable kind of execution</hi> on the <hi>Scaffold at Tower hill,</hi> where his head was chopped off, inſtead of a Hanging at <hi>Tyburne.</hi> And although all ingenious men would have imagined, that the blood of the many Soules he had ſtarved, ſeduced, deſtroyed all his time by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing preaching, ſuſpending, ſilencing, cenſuring, baniſhing godly Miniſters, Lecturers without any reall Cauſe, preſſing the <hi>Booke of Sports,</hi> introducing Popiſh, Arminian Soul-deſtroying Errors, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, Innovations, Prophanations; with the blood of the bodies of divers thouſands ſhed in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Warrs (originally occaſioned and ſtirred up by him) might have been prevalent enough to relent his Adamantine heart, and draw forth teares of repentance, of compunction from his eyes and ſoule, yet ſuch was his deſperate Obſtinacy &amp; Impenitency on the ſcaffold, that he never ſo much as confeſſed or bewayled at his death theſe bloody crimes, nor any of thoſe <hi>Trayterous Offences</hi> for which he was juſtly condemned; but with a brow of braſſe and heart of ſtone, impudently juſtified his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, nay Crimes to the utmoſt, without demanding Pardon of them from God or Man, though he tooke this enſuing Pardon from the King (a ſufficient evidence of his guilt) which I have <hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> tranſcribed out of the Originall paſſed under the Great Seale at <hi>Oxford.</hi>

            <p>By this Arch-Prelates embracing and the Kings granting of this large <hi>Univerſal Pardon, of all Treaſons</hi> &amp;c. himſelf his Prelaticall Partie, together with his Majeſtie and his Adherents of all ſorts, are eternally concluded to plead his <hi>Innocency,</hi> proclaim him a <hi>Martyr,</hi> or Canonize him for a <hi>meritorious Saint,</hi> as they have done. Yea, his <hi>Majeſties Royall care</hi> and ſerious endeavour to reſcue ſuch an <hi>Arch Traytor</hi> as He (impeached of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> and other <hi>grand Crimes</hi> by two whole Kingdomes) from the hands of common <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the Supremeſt Judicatory in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by this Regall Charter of Pardon, when as he could not effect it by his Army Royall and force of Armes, diſcovers both His own unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and our Kingdomes too in this, that he hath hitherto affected not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but <hi>Traytors</hi> to our Church and State, more then his faithfuleſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>most loyall Subjects:</hi> which dangerous Errour, I pray God his Majeſty after all his various miſcarriages, diſappointments, loſſes, by ſuch miſchevous perſons, may now at laſt diſcern, reject, and never henceforth favourany ſuch <hi>Traytors, ill Councellors, Prelates,</hi> or <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> more, whoſe extirpation <hi>root and branch,</hi> your <hi>Honours</hi> have already voted.

            <p>A very ſtrange ſpeech of a Saint-ſeeming Proteſtant Arch-Prelate.

Secondly, hence thou maieſt learne the truth of <hi>Solomons</hi> Obſervation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 30. <hi>There is no wiſdome, nor underſtanding, nor counſell againſt the Lord.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all ſuch wiſdome, counſell as this imployed againſt God, his Ordinances, Goſpell, people, though never ſo accurately managed, ſo politickly contrived, ſo powerfully backed, ſo ſucceſſefully advanced for a time will in concluſion <hi>be brought to nought, and made of none effect,</hi> Pſ. 33. 10.

            <p>Thirdly, Let all Gods people learne from hence, never to fear the force, threats or power of the greateſt Perſecutors breathing, ſince they are but mortall men, who ſhall themſelves be troden down and brought to Judgement in Gods due time: During my many yeares heavy preſſures under this Arch-Prelates Tyranny, my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was exceedingly elevated even to a magnanimous contempt, and holy ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all his overſwaying power, menaces, proceedings, as moſt deſpicable, with the conſideration of theſe two Scriptures, which were ever freſh in my thoughts. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 51. 12. 13. <hi>I, even I am he that comforteth you, who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, or of the ſonne of man that ſhall be made as graſſe?

But thou O Lord art moſt high for evermore: For loe thine enemies, O Lord, loe thine enemies ſhall periſh: and all the Workers of iniquity shall be ſcattered.</hi> Certainly he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves theſe ſacred Texts and meditates ſeriouſly on them, will never dread the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny, or menaces of any mortall, in a good cauſe or quarrell.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Meditate from hence, the vanity, inſtability and danger of greatneſs without goodneſſe: the impotency of the greateſt humane power, honour, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to exempt or ſecure evil Counſellors, or publike Malefactors from the ſword of Juſtice; The unhappy fatall ends of <hi>Wicked Royall Favourites,</hi> who by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring their Princes in unjuſt oppreſſive courſes, uſually in the concluſion, do but deſtroy themſelves, and prejudice their Princes moſt of any, as this Arch-Prelate hath done: The certain ruine of all bloody Perſecutors of Gods people: together with the infinite wiſdome and power of Almighty God, who can wiſely order, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the miſchievous Plots, &amp; malicious contrivances of his moſt deſperate Enemies to advance his own Honour, Cauſe, Goſpell, People; to effect the quite contrary to what they intended, and to bring about his own ends and their downfalls.</p>
            <p>Many ſuch cordiall meditations, and ſweet contemplations will this Hiſtory afford thee for thy comfort, thy incouragement in thy conſtant Chriſtian profeſſion in times of greateſt danger and hotteſt perſecution. The good Lord ſo ſanctifie it and them to thy Soul, that this Archbiſhop, who by his Life and Doctrine wrought ſo much miſchiefe and ſorrow to our Church for a ſeaſon, but no preſent good at all; may bring much conſolation, Edification to it, and thee, by this his Triall and Death:</p>

               <hi>It is this day Ordered, that the Lord Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>(being accuſed of high Treaſon by the houſe of Commons in their owne names, and in the name of the whole Kingdome of</hi> England) <hi>be committed to the ſafe cuſtody of the Gentleman Vſher attending this high Court, and that he be ſequeſtred from the ſaid Houſe, untill his Grace ſhall cleare himſelfe of the Accuſations that ſhall be laid againſt him by the ſaid Houſe.</hi>

            <p>This proud imperious <hi>Arch-Prelate,</hi> who had cloſe-impriſoned others for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry yeares in remote Caſtles in forraigne Iſlands, meerely for oppoſing his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Innovations, excluding not only their Friends, but Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the leaſt acceſſe unto their Priſons, or the Iſles wherein they were exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for their comfort or reliefe; was yet ſo impatient of reſtraint himſelfe, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after his Commitment to Maſter <hi>Maxwels</hi> houſe at <hi>Chearing,</hi> Croſſe, though he had convenient lodgings, more liberty by farre then he demeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all his friends free acceſſe to viſit him, yet hee became an humble ſuiter to the Houſe of Peers (even in the wet cold winter ſeaſon, when a warme lodging in moſt mens judgment was more wholeſome for him, then cold moiſt walkes, that he might have liberty to goe abroad with his Keeper to take the Ayre,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61245:13"/>
which liberty himſelfe would never indulge to any Priſoner committed by him, for the leaſt offence, eſpecially under the Notion of a <hi>Puritan:</hi> O ſtrange impatience, worthy admiration that he who had cloſe Impriſoned many Godly Chriſtians, Miniſters, mobſcure holes and Dungeons, without the leaſt pity or indulgence, divers yeares; even for well doing, or petty offences againſt himſelfe, ſhould not be able to endure a few weekes impriſonment, (when charged with high <hi>Treaſon</hi> it ſelfe, againſt the King and Kingdome,) without Petitioning for liberty to take the Ayre. A requeſt ſo unſeaſonable, that no wiſe Man in his condition would have demanded it, and the Parliament in <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Honour</hi> could not condeſcend to it. But this ſuit of his being deemed unſeaſonable, was rejected.</p>
            <p>And here behold the common <hi>Genius</hi> of Tyrannicall domineering ſpirits, none ſo inexorable, mercileſſe, inſenſible of others unjuſt oppreſſions as they in the ruffe of their proſperity, none more degenerous, puſilanimous, querulous, impatient, or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly baſe then they in the ſtormes of adverſity. Let this Arch-Prelates ſuddaine downe-fall from the Pinnacle of Honour, Power, into a reſtrained deſpicable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and his impatience under it, be a future admonition to all Lording Prelates, and Tyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

3.

                        <p n="4">4. That the ſaid <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> hath traiterouſly and corruptly told uſtice to thoſe who have had cauſes depending before him, by colour of his Eccleſiaſticall juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as Archbiſhop, High Commiſſioner, Referree, or otherwiſe, and hath taken unlawfull gifts, and bribes of His Majeſties Subjects, (and hath as much as in him lies) endeavoured to corrupt the other Courts of juſtice, by adviſing and procuring His Majeſtie to ſell places of Judicature, and other Offices contrary to the Laws and Statutes in that behalfe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5.

And the ſaid Archbiſhop hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and endeavoured to aſſure and confirme the unlawfull and exorbitant power, which he hath uſurped and exerciſed over His Majeſties Subjects, by a wicked and ungodly oath in one of the ſaid pretended Canons, injoyned to be taken by all the Clergie, and many of the Laitie of this Kingdome.</p>

And to that end, hath declared and maintained in Speeches, and printed books, diverſe popiſh doctrines, and opinions contrary to the Articles of Religion eſtabliſhed by Law.

                        <p n="10">10. Hee hath traiterouſly and wickedly endeavoured to reconcile the Church of England with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and for the effecting thereof hath conſorted, and confederated with diverſe Popiſh Prieſts, and Jeſuites; and hath kept ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by himſelfe his Agents and inſtruments, treated with ſuch as have from thence received authoritie, and inſtruction, hee hath permitted, and countenanced a Popiſh Hierarchie, or Eccleſiaſticall government to bee eſtabliſhed in this Kingdome: by all which trayterous and malicious practiſes this Church and Kingdome hath beene exceedingly indangered, and like to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyrannie of the Roman See.</p>

                        <p n="12">12.

                        <p n="13">13. Hee hath malitiouſly and traiterouſly plotted, and endeavoured to ſtirre up warre and enmity betwixt his Majeſties two Kingdomes of England and Scotland, and to that purpoſe hath laboured to introduce into the Kingdome of Scotland di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Innovations both in Religion, and Government all or the moſt part of them tending to Popery, and ſuperſtition, to the great grievance, and diſcontent of his Majeſties Subjects of that Nation: and for their refuſing to ſubmit to ſuch Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hee did trayterouſly adviſe his Majeſty to ſubdue them by force of Armes, and by his owne Authority and Power contrary to Law did procure ſundry of his Majeſtyes, Subjects &amp; inforced the Clergie of this Kingdome to contribute towards the maintenance of <note n="*" place="margin">Which Doctor <hi>Pierce Biſhop of Bath and Wels</hi> in his ſpeech to his Clergy to ſet on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>that what ever his Majeſty had expreſſed in his Declarations to be the cauſe of this warre,</hi> yet in truth this warre is FOR VS, Biſhops.</note> that war: And when his Majeſty with much wiſdom &amp; Juſtice had made a Pacification betwixt the two Kingdomes, the ſaid Archbiſhop did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly cenſure that pacification, as diſhonourable to his Majeſty, and by his councells and endeavours, ſo incenſed his Majeſty againſt his ſaid Subjects of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he did thereupon (by advice of the ſaid Archbiſhop) enter into an offenſive warre againſt them, to the great hazard of his Majeſties perſon, and his Subjects of both Kingdomes.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. That to preſerve himſelfe from being queſtioned for theſe, and other his tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous courſes, he hath laboured to ſubvert the rights of Parliament and the ancient courſe of Parliamentary proceeding, and by falſe and malitious ſlanders to incenſe his Majeſty againſt Parliaments.</p>
                        <p>By which words, counſels and actions, he hath traiterouſly, and contrary to his

               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THere is an expreſſion in the Scripture, which I will not preſume either to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or to interpret; yet to a vulgar eye it ſeemes to have an aſpect ſomething ſutable to the Perſon and Cauſe before you: It is a deſcription of the evill Spirits, wherein they are ſaid to be <hi>ſpirituall wickedneſſes in high places.</hi> Crimes acted by the ſpirituall faculties of the Soule, the Will and the Vnderſtanding, exerciſed about ſpirituall matters, concerning Gods Worſhip, and the Salvation of Man; ſeconded with power, authority learning, and many other advantages, do make the party who commits them, very ſutable to that deſcription, <hi>Spirituall wickedneſſes in high places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe crimes (My Lords) are various in their Nature, heynous in their quality, and univerſall in their extent. If you examine them <hi>Theologically,</hi> as they ſtand in oppoſition to the truth of God, they will be found to be againſt the rule of Faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of godlineſſe, againſt the meanes of Salvation.</p>
            <p>If you examine them <hi>Morally,</hi> as they ſtand in oppoſition to the light of Nature, to right reaſon, and the principles of humane ſociety, you will then perceive pride without any moderation: ſuch a Pride as that is which <hi>exalts it ſelfe above all that is called God.</hi> Malice without any provocation; Malice againſt vertue, againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, againſt piety, injuſtice without any meanes of reſtitution, even ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice as doth robbe the preſent times of their poſſeſſions; the future, of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities.</p>
            <p>If they be examined (My Lords) by Legall Rules in a <hi>Civill</hi> way, as they ſtand in oppoſition to the Publique Good, and to the Lawes of the Land; Hee will be found to be a Traytor againſt his Majeſties Crown, an Incendiary againſt the Peace of the State; he will be found to be the higheſt, the boldeſt, the moſt impudent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour, that ever was; an Oppreſſor both of King and People.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Charge</hi> (my Lords) is diſtributed and conveyed into 14. ſeverall Articles, as you have heard; and thoſe Articles are only generall: It being the intention of the Houſe of Commons (which they have commanded me to declare) to make them more certaine and particuler by preparatory Examinations to be taken with the helpe of your Lordſhips houſe, as in the Caſe of my Lord of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now runne through them with a light touch, only marking in every of them ſome ſpeciall point of venome, virulency and malignity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Article (my Lords) doth containe his endeavour to introduce into this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61245:16"/>
Kingdome an Arbitrary power of Government, without any limitations or Rules of Law. This (my Lords) is againſt the ſafety of the Kings Perſon, the honour of his Crowne, and moſt deſtructive to his people.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Cauſes which are moſt perfect have not only a power to produce effects, but to conſerve and cheriſh them. The Seminary vertue, and the Nutritive vertue in vegetables, do produce from the ſame principles. It was the defect of juſtice, the reſtraining of oppreſſion and violence that firſt brought Government into the World, and ſet up Kings, the moſt excellent way of Government. And by the maintenance of juſtice all kinds of Government receive a ſure foundation and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. It is this that hath in it an ability to preſerve, and ſecure the Royall power of Kings, yea, to adorne and encreaſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the ſecond Article, your Lordſhips may obſerve, abſolute and unlimited power, defended by Preaching, by Sermons, and other diſcourſes, printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon that ſubject. And truly (my Lords) it ſeemes to be a prodigious crime, that the truth of God, and his holy Law ſhould be perverted to defend the lawleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men. That the holy and ſacred function of the Miniſtry, which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for inſtruction of mens ſoules in the wayes of God, ſhould be ſo abuſed, that the Miniſters are become the Trumpets of Sedition, the promoters and defenders of violence and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the third Article (my Lords) you have the Judges, who under his Majeſty are the diſperſers and diſtributers of Juſtice, frequently corrupted by feare, and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; you have the courſe of Juſtice in the execution of it, ſhamefully obſtructed And if a wilfull Act of in juſtice in a Iudge be ſo high a crime in the eſtimate of the Law, as to deſerve death, under what burthen of guilt doth this man lye, who hath been the cauſe of great numbers of ſuch voluntary and wilfull acts of injuſtice?</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the fourth Article, hee will be found in his owne perſon to have ſold juſtice in Cauſes depending before him. And by his wicked councell endeavouring to make his Majeſty a Merchant of the ſame commodity, only with this difference, that the King by taking money for places of judicature, ſhould ſell it in groſſe; whereas the Archbiſhop ſold it by retaile.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the fift Article there appeares a power uſurped of making Canons, of laying obligations on the Subjects in the nature of Law, and this power abuſed to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Canons as are in the matter of them very pernitious, being directly contrary to the prerogative of the King, and the liberty of the people. In the manner of preſſing of them, may be found fraud and ſhuffling, in the concluſion vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and conſtraint; men being forced by terrour and threatning to ſubſcribe to all: which power thus wickedly gotten, they labour to eſtabliſh by perjury, injoyning ſuch an Oath for the maintenance of it, as can neither be taken nor kept with a good conſcience.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the ſixth Article, you have the King robbed of his Supremacy: you have a Papall power exerciſed over his Majeſties Subjects in their conſciences, and in their perſons: You have Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction claimed by an Incident right, which the Law declares to proceed from the Crowne.</p>
            <p>And herein your Lordſhips may obſerve that thoſe who labour in civill matters to ſet up the King above the Lawes of the Kingdome, doe yet in Eccleſiaſticall matters endeavour to ſet up themſelves above the King. This was firſt procured by the Arch-biſhop to be extrajudicially declared by the Judges, and then to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in a Proclamation. In doing whereof he hath made the Kings Throne but a footſtoole for his owne and their pride.</p>
            <p n="7">7. You have (my Lords) in the ſeventh Article, Religion undermined and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: you have Popery cheriſhed and defended: you have this ſeconded with power and violence, by ſevere puniſhment upon thoſe which have oppoſed this miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous intention: and by the ſubtile and eager proſecution of theſe men, hath the power of Eccleſiaſticall Commiſſioners, of the Starre-Chamber and Councell Table beene often made ſubſervient to his wicked deſigne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61245:17"/>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. You may obſerve in the eighth Article, great care taken to get into his owne hand the power of nominating to Eccleſiaſticall Livings and promotions: you have as much miſcheivous, as much wicked care taken in the diſpoſing of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, to the hinderance and corruption of Religion. And by this meanes (my Lords) the Kings ſacred Majeſtie, inſtead of Sermons, fit for ſpirituall inſtructours, hath often had invectives againſt his people, incouragement to injuſtice, or to the overthrow of the Lawes. Such Chaplaines have beene brought into his ſervice, as have as much as may be, laboured to corrupt his owne houſhold and beene eminent examples of corruption to others, which hath ſo farre prevailed, as that it hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly tainted the Vniverſities, and beene generally diſperſt to all the chiefe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the greateſt Townes and Auditories of the Kingdome. The grievous effects whereof is moſt manifeſt to the Commons Houſe, there being diverſe hundred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints there depending in the Houſe againſt ſcandalous Miniſters, and yet (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) the hundred part of them is not yet brought in.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ninth Article ſets out the like care to have Chaplaines of his owne, that might bee promoters of this wicked and trayterous deſigne: Men of corrupt judgments, of corrupt practice, extreamely addicted to ſuperſtition: and to ſuch mens cares hath been committed the Licencing of Bookes to the Preſſe; by meanes whereof many have beene publiſhed that are full of falſhood, of ſcandals; ſuch as have beene more worthy to be burnt by the hand of the Hangman in Smithfield (as I thinke one of them was) than to be admitted to come into the hands of the Kings people.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the tenth Article it will appeare, how he having made theſe approaches to Popery, comes now to cloſe and joyne more neerely with it; he confederates with Prieſts and Jeſuites. He, by his inſtruments negotiates with the Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath correſpondence with them that he authorized from <hi>Rome</hi> here. He hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Roman Hierachie to be ſet up in this Kingdome. And though he hath bin ſo carefull that a poore man could not goe to the neighbour Pariſh to heare a Sermon, when he had none at home, could not have a Sermon repeated, nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uſed in his own Family, but he was a fit ſubject for the High Commiſſion Court; yet the other hath beene done in all parts of the Realme and no notice taken of it, by any Eccleſiaſticall Judges or Courts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. You may perceive preaching ſuppreſſed in the eleventh, divers godly and Orthodox Miniſters oppreſſed in their perſons and Eſtates; you have the Kings loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubjects baniſhed out of the Kingdome, not as <hi>Elimelecke</hi> to ſeeke for bread in forraigne Countries, by reaſon of the great ſcarcity which was in <hi>Jſrael;</hi> but travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling abroad for the bread of life, becauſe they could not have it at home, by reaſon of the ſpirituall Famine of Gods Word, cauſed by this man and his partakers. And by this meanes you have had the trade, the Manufactury, the induſtry of many thouſands of his Majeſties ſubjects carried out of the Land.</p>
            <p>It is a miſerable abuſe of the ſpirituall Keyes to ſhut up the doores of heaven, and to open the gates of Hell, to let in prophaneneſſe, ignorance, ſuperſtition, and errour. I ſhall neede ſay no more: Theſe things are evident, and abundantly knowne to all.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In the twelfth Article (my Lords) you have a diviſion endeavoured betweene this and the forraine reformed Churches. The Church of Chriſt is one body, and the Members of Chriſt have a mutuall relation, as members of the ſame body, Vnity with Gods true Church every where is not only the beauty, but the ſtrength of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: of which beauty and ſtrength he hath ſought to deprive this Church by his manifold attempts to breake this union. To which purpoſe hee hath ſuppreſſed the priviledges granted to the Dutch and French Churches. He hath denyed them to be of the ſame Faith and Religion with us, and many other wayes hath he declared his malice to thoſe Churches.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61245:17"/>
13. In the thirteenth Article, as he hath ſought to make an Eccleſiaſticall diviſion or religious difference betweene us and forraine Nations, ſo he hath ſought to make a Civill difference betweene us and his Majeſties ſubjects of the Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And theis he hath promoted by many innovations, there preſt, by himſelfe and his owne authority, when they were uncapable of ſuch alterations, He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed his Majeſty to uſe violence. He hath made private and publique Collections towards the maintenance of the Warre, which he might juſtly call his owne warre. And with all impudent boldneſſe, hath ſtruck Tallies in the Exchequer for divers ſummes of money procured by himſelfe, <hi>Pro defenſione Regni;</hi> when by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels the King was drawne to undertake not a Defenſive, but an Offenſive Warre.</p>
            <p n="14">14. He hath laſtly, thought to ſecure himſelfe and his party by ſeeking to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Parliaments, and thereby hath laboured to bereave this Kingdome of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power, which can only be uſed in Parliaments: and that we ſhould be left a Kingdome without that which indeed makes and conſtitutes a Kingdome; and is the only Meanes to preſerve and reſtore it from diſtempers and decayes. He hath hereby endeavoured to bereave us of the higheſt Judicatory, ſuch a Judicatory, as is neceſſary and eſſentiall to our government. Some Caſes of Treaſon, and others concerning the Prerogative of the Crowne, and liberty of the People. It is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Judicatory to which all difficult Caſes reſort from other Courts. He hath fought to deprive the King of the Love and Counſell of his People, of that aſſiſtance which he might have from them, and likewiſe to deprive the People of that reliefe of grievances which they moſt humbly expect from his Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament is the Cabinet wherein the chiefeſt Jewells both of the Crowne and Kingdome are depoſited. The great Prerogative of the King, and libertie of the People are moſt effectually exerciſed and maintained by Parliaments. Here (my Lords) you cannot paſſe by this occaſion of great thankes to God and His Majeſty for paſſing the Bill, whereby the frequent courſe of Parliaments is eſtablished; which I aſſure my ſelfe, he will by experience finde to bee a ſtrong foundation both of his honour, and of his Crowne.</p>
            <p>This is all (my Lords) I have to ſay to the particulars of the <hi>Charge.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons deſire your Lordſhips that they may have the ſame way of Examination that they had in the caſe of the Earle of <hi>Strafford:</hi> That is, to examine members of all kindes, of your Lordſhips Houſe and their owne, and others, as they ſhall ſee cauſe. And thoſe examinations to be kept ſecret and private, that they may with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be made uſe of when the matter comes to tryall.</p>
            <p>They have declared that they reſerve to themſelves the power of making Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Articles, by which they intend to reduce his <hi>Charge</hi> to be more particular and certaine, in reſpect of the ſeverall times, occaſion, and other circumſtances of the offences therein Charged. And that your Lordſhips would bee pleaſed to put this cauſe in ſuch a quicke way of proceeding, that theſe great and dangerous crimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the offendors may be brought to a juſt judgment.</p>

                        <head>The Charge of the Scottiſh Commiſſioners againſt the Prelate of Canterburie.</head>
                        <p>NOvations in Religion, which are Vniverſally acknowledged to bee the maine cauſe of commotions in Kingdomes and ſtates, and are knowne to be the true cauſe of our preſent troubles, were many and great, beſide the bookes of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Homilies, 1. Some particular alterations in matters of Religion, preſſed upon us without order and againſt Law, contrary to the forme eſtabliſhed in our Kirk. 2. A new booke of Canons and Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſticall. 3. A Liturgie or booke of Common-Prayer, which did alſo carrie with them many dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in matters of Doctrine. Of all which we challenge the Prelate of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> as the prime cauſe on earth.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, that this Prelate was the Author and urger of ſome particular changes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61245:18"/>
which made great diſturbance amongſt us, we make manifeſt: 1. By fourteene letters ſubſcribed, <hi>William Cant.</hi> in the ſpace of two yeares, to one of our pretended Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>Bannatine,</hi> wherein he often enjoyneth him and other pretended Biſhops, to appeare in the Chappell in their Whites, contrary to the cuſtome of our Kirke, and to his promiſe made to the pretended Biſhop of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> at the Coronation, that none of them after that time, ſhould be preſſed to weare theſe garments, there, by moving him againſt his will to put them on for that time, wherein he directeth him to give order for ſaying the Engliſh Service in the Chappell twice a day, for his neglect, ſhewing him that he was diſappointed of the Biſhopricke of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> promiſing him upon the greater care of theſe novations, advancement to a better Biſhopricke, taxing him for his boldneſſe in preaching the ſound Doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirkes, againſt Maſter <hi>Mitchell,</hi> who had taught the errours of <hi>Arminius</hi> in the point of the extent of the merit of Chriſt, bidding him ſend up a liſt of the names of Councellours and Senatours of the Colledge of Juſtice, who did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the Chappell in a forme which was not received in our Kirke, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him when he found him obſequious to theſe his commands, telling him that he had moved the King the ſecond time for the puniſhment of ſuch as had not received in the Chappell: and wherein he upbraideth him bitterly, that in his firſt Synod at <hi>Aberdein,</hi> he had only diſputed againſt our Cuſtome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of faſting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the Lords Day, and preſumptuouſly cenſuring our Kirke, that in this wee were oppoſite to Chriſtianitie it ſelfe; and that amongſt us there were no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons at all. More of this ſtuffe may be ſeene in the Letters themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by two papers of <hi>memoirs</hi> and inſtructions from the pretended Biſhop of Saint <hi>Androis,</hi> to the pretended Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> comming to this Prelate, for ordering the affaires of the Kirke and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as not only to obtaine Warrants, to order the Exchequer, the Privie Counſell, the great Commiſſion of Surrenders, the mater of <hi>Balmerino's</hi> proceſſe, as might pleaſe our Prelates, but war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants alſo for ſitting of the High Commiſſion Court once a weeke in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and to gaine from the Noblemen, for the benefit of Prelates, and their adherents, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacies of <hi>Kelſo, Arbroith,</hi> St. <hi>Androis,</hi> and <hi>Lindors,</hi> and in the ſmalleſt matters to receive his Commands, as for taking downe Galleries, and ſtone-walls, in the Kirks of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and Saint <hi>Androis,</hi> for no other end but to make way for Altars, and adoration towards the Eaſt: which beſides other evills made no ſmall noyſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance amongſt the people deprived hereby of their ordinary accommodation for publike worſhip.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Novation which troubled our peace, was a booke of Canons, and conſtitutions Eccleſiaſticall, obtruded upon our Kirke, found by our Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to be deviſed for eſtabliſhing a tyrannicall power, in the perſons of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, over the Worſhip of God, over the Conſciences, Liberties, and goods of the People, and for aboliſhing the whole diſcipline and government of our Kirke, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and provinciall Aſſemblies, Presbyteries, and Kirke Seſſions, which was ſetled by Law, and in continuall practiſe ſince the time of Reformation; that <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> was Maſter of this Worke is manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>By a Book of Canons ſent to him, written upon the one ſide only, with the other ſide blank, for corrections additions, and putting all in better Order at his pleaſure, which accordingly was done, as may appeare by interlinings, marginalls, and filling up of the blanke page with directions ſent to our Prelates; and that it was don by no other than <hi>Canterbury,</hi> is evident by his Magiſteriall way of preſcribing, and by a new copy of theſe Canons all written with Saint <hi>Androis</hi> owne hand, preciſely to a Letter, according to the former caſtigations ſent backe for procuring the Kings warrant unto it, which accordingly was obtained, but with an addition of ſome other Canons, and a Paper of ſome other corrections: According to which the Booke of Canons thus compoſed, was publiſhed in Print, the inſpection of the Bookes, Inſtructions; and his Letters of joy, for the ſucceſſe of the worke and of others Letters of the Prelate of <hi>London,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sterling,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61245:18"/>
all which we are ready to exhibite, will put the mater out of all debate.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this generall, there be ſome things more ſpeciall worthy to be adverted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for diſcovering his Spirit. 1. The fourth Canon of Cap. 8. Foraſmuch as no Reformation in Doctrine or Diſcipline can be made perfect at once in any Church; therefore it ſhall, and may be lawfull for the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> at any time to make remonſtrance to his Majeſty, or his ſucceſſours, &amp;c. Becauſe this Canon holdeth the doore open to more Innovations, he writeth to the Prelate of <hi>Roſſe</hi> his privy Agent in all this Worke, of his great gladneſſe, that this Canon did <hi>ſtand behinde the Curtaine,</hi> and his great deſire, that this Canon <hi>may be Printed fully, as one that was to be moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> Secondly, The title prefixed to theſe Canons by our Prelates, Canons agreed upon to <hi>be proponed to the ſeverall Synods of the Kirke of Scotland,</hi> is thus changed by <hi>Canterbury;</hi> Canons and Conſtitutions <hi>Eccleſiaſticall, &amp;c.</hi> ordained to be obſerved <hi>by the Clergy.</hi> He will not have Canons come from the Authority of Synods, but from the power of Prelates, or from the Kings Prerogative. Thirdly, the formidable Canon, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. 3. threatning no leſſe than Excommunication againſt all ſuch perſons, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall open their mouthes againſt any of theſe Bookes, proceeded not from our Prelates, nor is to be found in the Copy ſent from them, but is a thunder-bolt forged in <hi>Canterburies</hi> owne fire. Our Prelates in divers places witneſſe their diſlike of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. A Miniſter ſhall be depoſed, if he be found negligent to convert Papiſts, Chap. 18. 15. The adoration of the Bread is a ſuperſtition to be condemned, Cap. 6. 6. They call the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſme an errour of Popery. Cap. 6. 2. But in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries</hi> Edition, the name of Papiſts and Popery is not ſo much as mentioned. 5. Our Prelates have not the boldneſſe to trouble us in their Canons, with Altars, Fonts, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, reading of a long Liturgy before Sermon, &amp;c. But <hi>Canterbury</hi> is punctuall, and peremptory in all theſe. Although the words of the tenth Canon Chap. 3. be faire. yet the wicked intentions of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Roſſe,</hi> may be ſeene in the poynt of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a ſinner before God, by comparing the Canon as it came from the Prelates, and as it was returned from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Printed; our Prelates ſay thus: <hi>Jt is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the ſuperſtition of former ages, hath turned into a great prophaneneſſe, and that people are growne cold for the moſt part in doing any good, thinking there is no place to good workes, becauſe they are excluded from juſtification. Therefore ſhall all Miniſtere, as their Text giveth occaſion, urge the neceſſity of good workes, as they would be ſaved, and remember that they are</hi> Via Regni, <hi>the way to the Kingdome of Heaven, though not</hi> cauſa regnandi, <hi>how be it they be not the cauſe of Salvation.</hi> Here Roſſe giveth his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that he would have this Canon ſimply commanding good workes, to be Preached, and no mention made, what place they have, or have not in juſtification.</hi> Vpon this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo agreeable to <hi>Canterburies</hi> mind, the Canon is ſet downe as it ſtandeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſtinction of <hi>Via Regni,</hi> or <hi>cauſa Regnandi,</hi> or any word ſounding that way, urging only the neceſſity of good workes. 7. By comparing <hi>Canterburie</hi> 9. Cap. 18. As it was ſent in writing from our Prelates, and as it is Printed at Canterburies command, may be alſo manifeſt, that he went about to eſtabliſh Auricular confeſſion, and Popiſh Abſolution. 8. Our Prelates were not acquainted with Canons for afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Arbritrary penalties: But in <hi>Canterburies</hi> Booke whereſoever there is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty expreſly ſet downe, it is provided that it ſhall be arbitrary, as the ordinary ſhall thinke fitteſt By theſe and many other the like, it is apparent, that tyranicall power he went about to eſtabliſh in the hands, of our Prelates, over the worſhip, and the ſoules and goods of men, overturning from the foundation, the whole order of our Kirke, what ſeeds of Popery he did ſow in our Kirke, and how large an entry hee did make for the groſſeſt novations afterward, which hath beene a maine cauſe of all their combuſtion.</p>
                        <p>The third and great novation was the Booke of Common Prayer, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other parts of Divine ſervice, brought in without warrant from our Kirke, to be univerſally received, as the onely forme of divine Service, under all higheſt paines both civill and Eccleſiaſticall; which is found by our nationall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, beſides the Popiſh freme, and formes in divine worſhip, to containe many Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61245:19"/>
errors, and ceremonies, and the ſeeds of manifold and groſſe ſuperſtitions, and Idolatries, and to be repugnant to the Doctrine, Diſcipline, and order of our reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the confeſſion of Faith, conſtitutions of generall Aſſemblies, and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, eſtabliſhing the true Religion: that this alſo was <hi>Canterburies</hi> worke we make manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>By the memories, and inſtruction ſent unto him from our Prelates; wherein they gave a ſpeciall account of the diligence they had uſed, to doe all which herein they were enjoyned, by the approbation of the Service Booke ſent to them; and of all the marginall correction, wherein it varieth from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Booke, ſhewing their deſire to have ſome few things changed in it, which notwithſtanding was not granted: This we finde written by Saint <hi>Androis</hi> owne hand, and ſubſcribed by him, and nine other of our Prelates.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>Canterburies</hi> owne Letters, witneſſes of his joy, when the Booke was ready for the Preſſe, of his prayers that God would ſpeed the worke, of the hope to ſee that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſet up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of his diligence to ſend for the Printer, and directing him to prepare a blacke letter, and to ſend it to his ſervants at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> for Printing this booke. Of his approbation of his proofes ſent from the Preſſe. Of his feare of delay, in bringing the worke ſpeedily to an end, for the great good, (not of that Church,) but of the Church. Of his encouraging <hi>Roſſe,</hi> who was entruſted with the Preſſe, to goe on in this peece of Service without feare of Enemies, All which may be ſeene in the Autographs; and by letters, ſent from the Prelate of <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Roſſe,</hi> wherein as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth at the ſight of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Canons; which although they ſhould make ſome noyſe at the beginning, yet they would be more for the good of the Kirke, than the Canons of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> for the good of the Kingdome. So concerning the Liturgy he ſheweth, that <hi>Roſſe</hi> had ſent to him, to have an explanation from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of ſome paſſage of the Service Booke, and that the Preſſe behoved to ſtand till the explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which therefore he had in haſt, obtained from his Grace, and ſent the diſpatch away by <hi>Canterburies</hi> owne conueyance.</p>
                        <p>But the Booke it ſelfe, as it ſtandeth interlined, margined, and patcht up, is much more than all that is expreſſed in his Letters, and the changes and ſupplements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, taken from the Maſſe Booke, and other Romiſh Ritualls by which he maketh it to vary from the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> and are pregnant teſtimonies of his Popiſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and wicked intentions which he would have put in execution upon us, then can be denyed. The large declaration profeſſeth, that all the variation of our Booke, from the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> that ever the King underſtood, was in ſuch things as the Scottiſh humour would better comply with, than with that which ſtood in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſervice. Theſe Popiſh innovaſions therefore have beene ſurreptitiouſly inſerted by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings knowledge, and againſt his purpoſe. Our Scottiſh Prelates doe petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, ſomething may be abated of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ceremonies, as the Croſſe in Baptiſme, the Ring in marriage, and ſome other things. But <hi>Canterburie</hi> will not only have theſe kept, but a great many more, and worſe ſuperadded, which was nothing elſe, but the adding of fewell to the fire. To expreſſe and diſcover all, would require a whole booke, we ſhall only touch ſome few in the matter of the Communion.</p>
                        <p>This Booke inverteth the order of the Communion in the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> as may be ſeene by the numbers, ſetting downe the orders of this new Communion, 1. 5. 2. 6. 7. 3. 4. 8. 9. 10. 15. Of the divers ſecret reaſons of this change, we mention one onely; In joyning the ſpirituall praiſe and thankſgiving, which is in the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> pertinently after the Communion, with the Prayer of Conſecration before the Communion, and that under the name of Memoriall, or Oblation, for no other end, but that the memoriall and Sacrifice of Praiſe mentioned in it, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood according to the Popiſh meaning. <hi>Bellar. de Miſſa, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. Not of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſacrifice, but of the oblation of the body of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>It ſeemeth to be no great matter, that without warrant of the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> the Presbyter going from the North-end of the Table, ſhall ſtand during the time of conſecration, at ſuch a part of the Table, where he may with the more eaſe and decency
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61245:19"/>
uſe both hands; yet being tryed, it importeth much, as, that he muſt ſtand with his hinder parts to the People, repreſenting (ſaith <hi>Durand)</hi> that which the Lord ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt ſee my hinder parts.</hi> He muſt have the uſe of both his hands, not for any thing he hath to doe about the Bread and Wine, for that may be done at the North end of the Table, and be better ſeene of the people: but (as we are taught by the Rationaliſts) that he may by ſtretching forth his Armes, to repreſent the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of Chriſt on the Croſſe, and that he may the more conveniently lift up the Bread and Wine above his head, to be ſeen and adored of the people: who in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke of the generall confeſſion, a little before, are directed to kneele humbly on their knees, that the Prieſts elevation ſo magnified in the Maſſe, and the peoples adoration may goe together. That in this poſture, ſpeaking with a low voyce, and muttering (for ſometimes he is commanded to ſpeake with a loud voyce, and diſtinctly) he be not heard by the people, which is no leſſe a mocking of God, and his people, then if the words were ſpoken in an unknowne language. As there is no word of all this in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service; ſo doth the Booke in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time give to every Presbyter his liberty of geſture, which yet gave ſuch offence to <hi>Bucer,</hi> (the cenſurer of the Booke and even in <hi>Caſſanders</hi> owne judgment, a man of great moderation in matters of this kind) that he calleth them, <hi>Nunquam ſatis execrandos Miſſa geſtus,</hi> and would have them to be abhorred, becauſe they confirme to the ſimple and ſuperſtitious <hi>ter impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; exitialem Miſſae fiduciam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The corporall preſence of Chriſts body in the Sacrament is alſo to be found here: for the words of the Maſſe-booke ſerving to this purpoſe, which are ſharpely cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Bucer,</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Liturgy, and are not to be found in the Booke of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are taken in here; Almighty God is in called, that of his Almighty Goodneſſe he may vouchſafe ſo to bleſſe and ſanctifie with his Word and Spirit, theſe gifts of Bread and Wine, that they may bee unto us the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The change here is made a worke of Gods Omnipotency: the words of the Maſſe, <hi>ut fiant nobis,</hi> are tranſlated in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Booke, <hi>That they be unto us,</hi> which are againe turned into Latine by <hi>Aleſius, Vt fiant nobis</hi> On the other part, the expreſſions of the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> at the delivery of the Elements of <hi>feeding on Chriſt by faith,</hi> and of <hi>Eating and drinking in remembrance that Chriſt dyed for thee,</hi> are utterly delea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Many evidences there be in this part of the Communion, of the bodily Preſence of Chriſt, very agreeable to the Doctrines taught by his Sectaries, which this paper cannot containe. They teach us that Chriſt is received in the Sacrament, <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter,</hi> both <hi>objective</hi> and <hi>ſubjective, Corpus Chriſti eſt objectum quod recipitur, &amp; corpus noſtrum ſubjectum quo recipitur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Booke of <hi>England</hi> aboliſheth all that may import the oblation of any unbloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifice, but here we have beſides the preparatory oblation of the Elements, which is neither to be found in the Booke of <hi>England</hi> now, nor in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Booke of old the oblation of the body and blood of Chriſt, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth, <hi>Sacrifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Laudis, quia Deus per illud magnopere laudatur.</hi> This alſo agreeth well with their late doctrine. We are ready when it ſhall be judged convenient and we ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, to diſcover much more matters of this kind as grounds laid for <hi>miſſa ſicca,</hi> or the halfe Meſſe, the privat Meſſe without the people of communicating in one kinde, of the conſumption by the Prieſt, and conſummation of the Sacrifice, of receiving the Sacrament in the mouth, and not in the hand, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Our ſupplications were many againſt theſe Bookes, but <hi>Canterbury</hi> procured them to be anſwered with terrible Proclamations. We were conſtrained to uſe the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Proteſtation; but for our Proteſtations, and other lawfull meanes, which we uſed for our deliverance, <hi>Canterbury</hi> procured us to be declared Rebells and Traitors, in all Pariſh Kirkes of <hi>England:</hi> when we were ſeeking to poſſeſſe our Religion in peace, againſt theſe devices, and novations <hi>Canterbury</hi> kindleth warre againſt us. In all theſe it is knowne that he was, although not the ſole, yet the principall Agent and adviſer.</p>
                        <p>When by the Pacification at <hi>Barwicke,</hi> both Kingdomes looked for Peace and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61245:20"/>
quietneſſe, hee ſpared not openly in the hearing of many, often before the King, and privately at the Counſell Table, and the Privy Jointo, to ſpeake of us as Rebells and Traitors, and to ſpeake againſt the Pacification as diſhonourable, and meere to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Neither did his malignancy and bitterneſſe ever ſuffer him to reſt, till a new war was entred upon, and all things prepared for our deſtruction.</p>
                        <p>By him was it that our Covenant, approven by National Aſſemblies, ſubſcribed by His Majeſties Commiſſioner, and by the Lords of his Majeſties Counſell, and by them commanded to be ſubſcribed by all the Subjects of the Kingdome, as a Teſtimony of our duty to God, and the King, by him was it ſtill called ungodly, damnable, Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; by him were Oaths invented, and preſſed upon diverſe of our poore Country men, upon the paine of impriſonment, and many miſeries, which were unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Law, and contrary to their Nationall Oath.</p>
                        <p>When our Commiſſioners did appeare to render the reaſons of our demands, hee ſpared not in the preſence of the King, and Committee, to raile againſt our Nationall Aſſembly, as not daring to appeare before the World, and Kirkes abroad; where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his actions were able to endure tryall; and againſt our juſt and neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as the moſt malicious and Treaſonable Contempt of Monarchicall Government that any bygone age heard of: His hand alſo was at the Warrant for the reſtraint and impriſonment of Our Commiſſioners, ſent from the Parliament, warranted by the King, and ſeeking the peace of the Kingdomes.</p>
                        <p>When we had by our Declarations, Remonſtrances, and Repreſentations, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth of our intentions, and lawfulneſſe of our actions, to all the good Subjects of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> when the late Parliament could not be moved to aſſiſt, or enter in Warre againſt us, maintaining our Religion, and Liberties, <hi>Canterbury</hi> did not only adviſe the breaking up of that high and honourable Court, to the great griefe and hazard of the Kingdome, but (which is without example) did ſit ſtill in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and make Canons and Conſtitutions againſt us, and our juſt and neceſſary defence; ordaining under all higheſt paines, that hereafter the Clergie ſhall preach foure times in the yeare, ſuch doctrine as is contrary not onely to our proceedings, but to the doctrine and proceedings of other Reformed Kirkes, to the judgment of all ſound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and Politiques, and tending to the utter ſlavery and ruining of all Eſtates and Kingdomes, and to the diſhonour of Kings and Monarchs. And as if this had not beene ſufficient, he procured, ſix Subſedies to be lifted of the Clergie, under paire of deprivation to all that ſhould refuſe. And which is yet worſe, and above which Malice it ſelfe cannot aſcend, by his meanes a Prayer is framed, Printed, and ſent through all Paroches of <hi>England,</hi> to be ſaid in all Churches in time of Divine Service, next after the Prayer for the Queen, and Royall Progeny, againſt our Nation <hi>by name of tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Subjects, having caſt off all Obedience to Our Annoynted Soveraigne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in all rebellious manner to invade England,</hi> that ſhame may cover our faces, as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and the King.</p>
                        <p>Whoſoever ſhall impartially examine what hath proceeded from himſelfe, in theſe Books of Canons and common Prayer, what Doctrine hath beene publiſhed and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe yeares by-paſt in <hi>England,</hi> by his Diſciples and Emiſſaries, what groſſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in the moſt materiall points we have found, and are ready to ſhew in the poſthume writings of the Prelate at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Dublane,</hi> his owne creatures, his neereſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars, and moſt willing inſtruments to advance his counſells, and projects, ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that his intentions were deepe and large againſt all the reformed <hi>Kirkes,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, which in his Majeſties dominions was panting, and by this time had rendred up the Ghoſt, if God had not in a wonderfull way of mercy preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us; And that if the Pope himſelfe had beene in his place, he could not have beene more Popiſh, nor could he more zealouſly have negotiated for <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirkes, to reduce them to the Hereſies in doctrine; the Superſtitions and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latty in worſhip, and the tyranny in Government, which are in that See, and for which the Reformed Kirkes did ſeparate from it, and come forth of <hi>Babell.</hi> From him certainly hath iſſued all this deluge, which almoſt hath overturned all. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61245:20"/>
confident that your Lordſhips will by your meanes deale effectually with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that this great firebrand be preſently removed from his Majeſties preſence, and that he may be put to tryall, and put to his deſerved cenſure, according to the Lawes of the Kingdome; which ſhall be good ſervice to God, honour to the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, terrour to the wicked, and comfort to all good men, and to us in ſpeciall who by his meanes principally, have been put to ſo many and grievous aflictions, wherein we had periſhed, if God had not beene with us.</p>
                        <p>Wee doe indeed confeſſe that the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> have beene of very different humours, ſome of them of a more moderate temper, ſome of them more, and ſome of them leſſe inclinable to Popery: yet what knowne truth, and conſtant experience hath made undenyable, we muſt at this opportunity profeſſe, that from the firſt time of Reformation of the Kirke of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not only after the comming of <hi>King James</hi> of happy memory into <hi>England,</hi> but before, the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> have bin by all means unceſſantly working the overthrow of our diſcipline and Government. And it hath come to paſſe of late, that the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> having prevailed, and brought us to ſubjection in the point of Government, and finding their long waited for opportunity and a rare congruitie of many ſpirits and powers, ready to co-operate for their ends, have made a ſtrong aſſault upon the whole externall worſhip, and doctrine of our Kirk. By which their doing they did not aime to make us conforme to <hi>England,</hi> but to make <hi>Scotland</hi> firſt (whoſe weakneſſe in reſiſting they had before experienced, in the Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Government, and of ſome points of worſhip) and thereafter <hi>England</hi> conform to <hi>Rome,</hi> even in theſe matters, wherein <hi>England</hi> had ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> ever ſince the time of Reformatior. An evill therefore which hath iſſued, not ſo much from the perſonall diſpoſition of the Prelates themſelves, as from the innate quality and nature of their Office, and Prelaticall Hierarchie, which did bring forth the Pope in Ancient times, and never ceaſeth till it bringeth forth popiſh Doctrine and worſhip, where it is once rooted, and the Principles thereof ſomented and conſtantly followed. And from that antipathy and inconſiſtency, of the two formes of Eccleſiaſticall Government, which they conceived, and not without cauſe, that one Iſland united alſo under one head, and Monarch, was not able to beare: the one being the ſame in all the parts and powers, which it was in times of Popery, and now is in the Roman Church: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being the forme of Government, received, maintained and practiſed by all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirks wherein by their owne teſtimonies, and confeſſions, the Kirks of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had amongſt them no ſmall eminencie. This alſo we repreſent to Your Lordſhips moſt ſerious conſideration, that not only the fire-brands may be removed, but that the fire may be provided againſt, that there be no more combuſtion after this.</p>

               <hi>My Lords, it new appeares to your Lordſhips, how unwilling the Archbiſhop is (out of a conſciouſneſſe of his owne guilt) to come to his Tryall, that in all this ſpace from his firſt impeachment, he hath not ſo much as put in any Anſwer to the Originall Articles, though he had long ſince Councell aſſigned him for that purpoſe: My Lords, this is none of the Commons fault, but his owne; for your Lordſhips well know, that the Commons can take no notice what is done in the Houſe of Peeres in a Parliamentary way, but by a Meſſag from your Lordſhips, who after our Articls exhibited, were to cal upon the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop for an anſwer to them; &amp; your Lordſhips ſending us ſeveral Meſſages heretofore that the Archbiſhop had put in his Anſwer to the Articls, &amp; that you were ready to heare our Charge against him, and appointing this day for his Tryall, the Commons thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>

The third part touching Religion, (contained in the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Originall, and 6, and 7, Additionall Articles) was carried on and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Iohn Wilde</hi> Serjeant at Law, of the Commons Houſe, for 4 whole dayes, (to wit, <hi>May</hi> 20, 27. <hi>Iune</hi> 6. 11.) and then by reaſon of Mr. <hi>Serjeants</hi> ſickneſſe and infirmity, purſued by Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> 5 intire dayes more, <hi>(viz. Iune</hi> 17. 20, 27. <hi>Iuly</hi> 20, 24.) The fourth and laſt part of the evidence, (in proof of the 14 Originall and 1 and 10 Additionall Articles) was given in by Maſter <hi>Nicholas,</hi> on the 29 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and concluded the ſame day. So as the very evidence it ſelf (which was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well preſſed by theſe learned Gentlemen) took up ſeventeen whole days, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening: beſides 12 dayes attendance more, whereon other preſſing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires enforced the Lords to adjorn the tryall, when both the Committee of Commons were ready with their witneſſes, and the Arch-biſhop preſent with his Councell, ready to receive his charge.</p>
            <p>After all the evidence anſwers and replyes thereto fully given, the Arch-biſhop had liberty granted to make a Recapitulation of his whol defence before the Lords, which accordingly performed on the ſecond of <hi>September</hi> 1644. To which <hi>Samuel Brown</hi> Eſquire, a member of the Houſe of Commons, replyed, on the 11 of <hi>September,</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up the principall parts of the evidence given againſt him at the Lords Bar. On the 11 of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1644. the Arch-Biſhops Councell were heard at the Lords Bar, on this point of Law, to which they were formerly directed to ſpeak; <hi>Whether in all or any of the Articles charged againſt him, there were any Treaſon contained?</hi> Which Mr. <hi>Iohn Hern</hi> onely argued as the mouth of the reſt of his Councell. Soon after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons having drawn an Ordnance of Attainder of high Treaſon againſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, upon the Evidence given in againſt him: on the ſecond of <hi>Novemb.</hi> following the Arch-biſhop (after its ſecond reading) was brought to the Commons Bar, where Mr. <hi>Sam. Brown</hi> in his preſence ſummed up the evidence given in againſt him before the Lords: to which the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> by order gave his anſwer <hi>Vivâ voce</hi> at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Bar, <hi>Nov.</hi> 11th: whereunto Mr <hi>Brown</hi> replyed, the 13th. of the ſame <hi>Novemb.</hi> after which the very ſame day the Ordinance for his attainder of High Treaſon paſſed the Commons Houſe, without any diſſenting voyce but one, and that not upon the matter of his charge High Treaſon, of which all Voted him guilty, but manner of proceeding onely. This Ordinance being tranſmitted to the Houſe of Peeres, becauſe ſome of the Lords were not preſent at all the evidence given in againſt him during his long Tryall, thereupon <hi>Decemb.</hi> 4. 1644. they Ordered, <hi>That all Books, Writings, Docquets, and evidences concerning the Arch-biſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>his tryall before the Lords in Parliament, ſhould be brought in to the Clerk of the Parliament by</hi> 9 <hi>of the Clock in the morning, on Saturday next:</hi> which being done accordingly, the Lords among themſelves, ſeriouſly re-examined all the heads and principall parts of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence formerly urged againſt him at the Bar, debating, weighing, and then voting each particular as they went; after this moſt ſerious review, their Lordſhips upon moſt mature deliberation voted him guilty of all the Articles and matters of fact charged againſt him, and alſo that of High Treaſon to (notwithſtanding the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Archbiſhops Councel) upon a conference with the Houſe of Commons, which ſatisfied them in the point of Law. Whereupon they paſſed the Ordinance for his Attainder of high Treaſon; by vertue whereof he was ſoon after executed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more fully in its due place. Thus you have the ſumme of the Lords and Commons
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61245:27"/>
moſt deliberate, fair, moderate juſt, (though tedious) proceedings againſt this <hi>Arch-Traytor,</hi> (not to be preſidented in any preceding Age, nor fit to be imitated for the future in regard of length and expence of time) againſt which calumny and malice it ſelfe can take no juſt exceptions on his behalfe; the rather, becauſe himſelfe would have tried, condemned, executed above an hundred <hi>Paritans</hi> in halfe the time wherein he was but trying, without the leaſt mercy or moderation, had they beene brought before his Tribunall, for farre more pettie Treaſons then thoſe of which hee was attainted and voted guilty, upon moſt full and pregnant evidence. Having given the world this briefe account of the fairenes and deliberateneſſe of his Tryall ſo long delayed, partly by his own neglect in not pleading to his Articles of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not once petitioning to be brought to Tryall during all the time of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine; partly by his owne forementioned Petitions to the Lords for longer time, when the Commons preſſed to expedite his hearing; partly by the death of Mr <hi>John Pym,</hi> and ſome other Members of the Commons Houſe, who were truſted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and mannage the evidence againſt him, part whereof miſcarryed by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; but principally by reaſon of the great intervening urgent affaires, diſtractions, and bloody Wars in the Kingdomes of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> occaſioned by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties deſerting the Parliament, and this Arch-Prelates plots to ſet up Popery; not through any neglect or default in the Lords or Commons: We ſhall next endeavour to yeeld you a full, ſatisfactory, true account of the proceedings and evidence given in againſt him at his Tryall, which will really render him the Archeſt Traytor, the moſt peſtilent Malefactor in all kindes of Villany, Tyranny, Oppreſſion, Miſchiefe, that was ever arraigned, condemned in any Parliament; <hi>Pierce Graveſtons, Archbiſhop Arundles, Cardinall Wolſes, Empſons, Dudlies,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Conſpiracies, Oppreſſions and grand Miſdemeanours, layd together, being far inferiour to his, both in he inouſneſſe, multiplicity, and variety, as ſhall be undeniably demonſtrated to all the world, by ſubſtantiall proofes.</p>
            <p>On Thurſday the 12. of <hi>March,</hi> 1643. (the day deſigned for the comencement of this great Tryall) about three of the Clocke in the afternoon, the <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> was brought Priſoner by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower of London,</hi> and Uſher of the blacke <hi>Rod,</hi> to the Bar in the Lords Houſe: where, after he had kneeled down on his knees for a litle ſpace, the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Warke,</hi> then Speaker of that honourable Houſe, commanded him to riſe up; which done, the Committee of the Houſe of Commons appointed to mannage the evidence at his Tryall demanded, that the ſeverall Articles of their Impeachment againſt him might be read: whereupon one of the Clerkes of the Lords Houſe, read both the Originall and Additionall Articles fore-mentioned; and after that his Anſwer, Plea, and Demurrer to them.</p>
            <p>All which being read, the Archbiſhop then deſired the Lords, that the Houſe of Commons might give in all their Charge and Evidence to all the Articles againſt him together, before he ſhould be put to give his Anſwer to any particular Charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ancient, his memory very ſhort, and the Articles Generall; and that he might anſwer all his Charge together, not each dayes Evidence by Peece-meale.</p>
            <p>To which Maſter <hi>Maynard,</hi> in the behalfe of the Commons, anſwered: 1. That if the Archbiſhops memory were ſo bad as he pretended, it would be far worſe for him to charge it with anſwering many particulars and the whole evidence againſt him together, then to anſwer every particular Charge each day, as it ſhould be given in againſt him whiles it was freſh in memory. 2ly. That it might and would be a great inconvenience to have witneſſes croſſe-examined, upon other dayes then thoſe, whereon they gave in their teſtimony againſt the Priſoner. 3ly. That the Lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would finde it difficult to paſſe their judgements upon all the Charge together without hearing his punctuall anſwer to every particular proof as it ſhould be given in evidence, whiles it was freſh in their memories. 4ly. Becauſe elſe all the witneſſes, which were very many, muſt of neceſſity attend, and be kept in Town from the firſt to the laſt day of his Tryall; which would be a very great Charge and inconvenience. 5ly. In the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> caſe, this very Parliament, he was put to anſwer every day, to the particular Evidence given againſt him on the ſame day; Upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> reaſons the Houſe of Peers ordered, that the Archbiſhop ſhould make his particular Anſwer to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61245:27"/>
every particular Charge on the ſame day it was given in againſt him.</p>
            <p>Then the Archbiſhop deſired, that the Houſe of Commons would ſever the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which were Treaſon, from thoſe other Articles which were matters of crime, and Miſdemeanour only, but not Treaſon; that ſo he might know which of them were Treaſon and which not.</p>
            <p>To which Maſter <hi>Maynard</hi> anſwered, That this they might not doe, becauſe they were now onely to try the matters of fact, not Lavv, and becauſe all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles taken together, not each or any particular Article by it ſelf made up the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherewith he was charged; to wit, his endeavours to ſubvert and deſtroy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the fundamentall Lawes of the Land and government of the Realme, and to bring in Popery, and an arbitrary tyrannicall Government againſt Law.</p>
            <p>After which Maſter <hi>Serjeant Wilde</hi> (by way of Introduction to the Archbiſhops charge) with abundance of elegancy and zeale, related the Heads of his Offences to the Houſe of Peeres in theſe enſuing ſtraines.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>For if all the oppreſſions, all the pernitious practiſes and machinations, which have beene in each time to ruinate our Religion, Lawes and Liberties were loſt; I thinke here they might bee found and drawne out againe to the life. So that your Lordſhips who have beene the great Aſſertors of our Liberties, and ſtood ſo faſt to the rules and principles of your Noble Progenitors (which others have ignobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted) may after a long conflict with ſo many great and marchieſſe difficulties, ſay now as a great Commander once did upon an extraordinary danger, <hi>Tandem par animo meo periculum video.</hi> Here is a cauſe proportionable to your ſelves, apt and proper for the juſtice and power of this honourable Court.</p>
                        <p>Had they beene faults of common frailty, error or incogitancy, which this man hath committed, wee ſhould gladly have ſtepped backe, and caſt a Cloake over them; but being ſo wilfull, ſo univerſall, ſo diſtructive to the Lawes of God and man, ſo comprehenſive of all the evills and miſeries which now we ſuffer; the ſin would lye upon our owne heads, if wee ſhould not call for juſtice: which that it hath beene ſo long uncalled for, (not deferred or delayed) I ſuppoſe no man will thinke ſtrange who conſiders the preſent diſtractions, the death and diſperſion of our witneſſes, the loſſe of ſome of our Members who have beene imployed and taken paines in this buſineſſe; the multitude of diverſions which we have had, and have daily occaſioned by the Acts and influences of this Meteor.</p>
                        <p>But the truth ſurvives, and matter enough ſurvives, ſo copious and ſo full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, that if all the particulars ſhould be examined, for his three yeares impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he complaines off there would be three yeares time of tryall and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heavy charge that lyes againſt him. A charge of High Treaſon: Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in all and every part: Treaſon in the higheſt pitch and altitude: for what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Treaſon can there be then to betray the whole Realme, and to ſubvert the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foundations, leaving nothing for poſterity, but a curſe upon him that ſhall goe about to build again?</p>
                        <p>That which of it ſelfe is ſo haynous, is much more enhanced and aggravated by the quality of the perſon: A Church-man; a great Prelate; a man in great truſt, place and Authority in Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>A man indued with ſo great guifts of nature, and ſo many of grace and favour from His Majeſty, and for al theſe to be perverted to a contrary end, even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the publike, and the ruine of the Wombe that bare him, how deepe a dye, doe theſe impoſe upon this foule crime?</p>
                        <p>How Church-men in all ages (as hath beene often obſerved) ſhould come to be:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61245:28"/>
the Archeſt Seedſmen of miſchiefe, and principall Actors in all the great diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and alterations that have hapned, is a deſtinie that may ſeeme ſtrange. But the reaſon is, <hi>(ex bono Thealogo, malus Medicus)</hi> their intermedling with temporall things, and matters hererogeneall to their calling; wherein God is pleaſed to finite them with blindneſſe, and to infatuate their Councell; whereof a perfect patterne wee have in this great Prelate; who by abuſing his profeſſion, and making the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of State the cuſtomary ſubject of all his endeavours, became the Author of all the illegall and Tyrannicall proceedings in the <hi>Starre-Chamber, High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Court,</hi> and other Courts; of all the Innovations in Doctrine and Diſcipline, of the ſuppreſſing of godly Miniſters and preaching; of the advancing of others who were the promoters of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary power,</hi> and indeed of all the concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and diſtractions in Church and State, whereby <hi>Religion</hi> hath beene juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>For matter of Religion, ſurely thoſe times were happy when by the magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Princes, and the wiſdome and piety of our Predeceſſors, that Antichriſtian Yoke of <hi>Popery</hi> was ſhaken off.</p>
                        <p>And now after ſo many bloudy Maſſacres in <hi>France,</hi> ſuch fiery perſecutions here in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> dayes, ſo many treacherous conſpiracies in time of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> that execrable and horrid <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> in the late time of <hi>King James,</hi> ſuch ſtreames and Rivers of bloud in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world ever ſince, by thoſe reſtleſſe and cruell fire-brands of all miſchiefe, for any man now to goe about to rebuild theſe walls of <hi>Iericho,</hi> and to reduce us to thoſe rotten principells of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> how can it be expected better, then that the people ſhould be even ready to ſtone him, as they did him that did but Act the part of <hi>Bellerophon</hi> in <hi>Rome?</hi> But to avoyde this danger, he conveyes in this poyſon in a guilded <hi>Pill,</hi> with baites and pretences of <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> a pleaſing ſnare, <hi>Laqueus Diaboli ad miſerorum animas ad infernum detrudendas.</hi>

But ſeeing the <hi>Malignity</hi> which hath been raiſed againſt me by ſome men, I have carried my very life in my hands theſe divers yeares paſt, But yet, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if there be none of theſe things whereof they accuſe me, though I may not in this <hi>Caſe,</hi> and from this <hi>Barre</hi> appeale unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> yet to your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Iustice</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> I both may, and do; not doubting, but that God of his goodneſſe will preſerve my innocency.</p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Iob</hi> in the midſt of his affliction ſaid to his <hi>miſtaken Friends,</hi> ſo ſhall I to my <hi>Accuſers; God forbid I ſhould juſtifie you; till I die I will not remove my Integrity from me, I will hold it faſt and not let it go, my heart ſhall not reproach me as long as I live,</hi> Iob 22. 5.</p>
                        <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> the Charge againſt me is brought up in <hi>ten Articles,</hi> but, the maine heads are two: <hi>An endeavour to ſubvert the Lawes of the Land, and the Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed;</hi>
                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:61245:29"/>
Six Articles, (the five, firſt and the laſt) concerne the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and the other 4. <hi>Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the Lawes, firſt, I thinke I may ſafely ſay, I have beene, to my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as ſtrict an obſerver of them all the dayes of my life, ſo farre as they concerne me as any man hath; and ſince I came into place, I have followed them, and byn as much guided by them as any man that ſate where I had the honour to ſitte. And of this I am ſory I have loſt the teſtimony of the <hi>Lord Keeper Coventry,</hi> and other Perſons of Honour ſince dead.</p>
                        <p>And the Councell which attended at the Councell Board can witneſſe, ſome of them here preſent, that in all references to the <hi>Board,</hi> or debates ariſing at the <hi>Board,</hi> I was for that part of the cauſe, where I found Law to be: and if the Councell deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have the cauſe left to the Law, well I might move in ſome caſes, <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> to them; but I left them to the <hi>Law,</hi> if thither they would goe; And how ſuch a carriage as this through the whole courſe of my life in private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, can ſtand, with an intention to overthrow the Lawes, I cannot yet ſee.</p>
                        <p>Nay more, I have ever beene of opinion, <hi>That Lawes binde the conſcience,</hi> and have accordingly made conſcience of obſerving them: and this doctrine I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly preached as occaſion hath beene offered me; and how is it poſſible, I ſhould ſeek to overthrow thoſe Lawes which I held my ſelfe bound in conſcience to keep and obſerve?</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Religion</hi> I was borne and bred up in and under the <hi>Church of England</hi> as it ſtands eſtabliſhed by Law; I have, by Gods bleſſing, growne up in it to the yeares which are now upon me, and to the place of preferment which I now beare.</p>
                        <p>I have ever ſince I have underſtood ought in my profeſſion, <hi>kept one conſtant tenor in this my profeſſion, with out variation or ſhifting from one opinion to another, for any worldly ends:</hi> And if my conſcience would have ſuffered me to doe ſo, I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely have ſlid through all the difficulties which I have preſt upon me in this kinde, But of all diſeaſes I have ever held <hi>a Palſey in Religion moſt dangerous;</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and remembring, that diſeaſe often ends in a <hi>dead Palſie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ever ſince I came in place, I have laboured nothing more then that the externall publique worſhip of God (ſo much ſlighted in divers parts of this Kingdome) might be preſerved &amp; that with as much decency &amp; uniformity as might be: for I evidently ſaw, that the publique neglect of Gods ſervice in the outward face of it, and the naſty lyeing of many places dedicated to that ſervice, had almoſt caſt a dampe upon the true and inward worſhip of God, which while we live in the body needs exteriall helps, and all little enough to keepe it in any vigor. And this I did to the uttermoſt of my knowledge, according both to Law and Canon, and with the conſent and likeing of the people; nor did any command iſſue out from mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the one, or without the other.</p>
                        <p>Further my <hi>Lords,</hi> give me leave, I beſeech you, to acquaint you with this alſo, that I have as little acquaintance with <hi>Recuſants,</hi> as I beleeve, any man of my place of <hi>England</hi> hath, or ever had ſithence the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and for my kindred, no one of them was ever a <hi>Recuſant,</hi> but Sir <hi>William Web,</hi> grandchild to my Vnkle Sir <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam VVeb,</hi> ſometimes Lord Major of <hi>London,</hi> and ſince which ſome of his Children I reduced back againe to the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On this, one thing more I humbly deſire may be thought on, That I am fallen into a great deale of obloquie in matter <hi>of Religion,</hi> and that ſo farre (as appeares by the Articles againſt me) that I <hi>have indeavored to advance and bring in Popery:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my Lords, I am not ignorant what party of men have raiſed theſe ſcandalls upon me, nor for what end, nor perhapps by whom ſet on; but howſoever, I would faine have a good reaſon given me, if my conſcience ſtood that way and that with my conſcience I could ſubſcribe to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> what ſhould have kept me heere before my impriſonment to indure the libelling, and the ſlaunder, and the baſe uſage that hath beene put upon me, and theſe to end in this queſtion for my life? I ſay, I would know a good reaſon for this.</p>

Firſt, my <hi>Lords,</hi> is it becauſe of any pledges I have in the world to ſway me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my conſcience? No ſure, for I have neither <note n="*" place="margin">Therefore the fitter to make a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſt, Prelate, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall.</note> Wife nor Children to cry out upon me to ſtay with them; And if I had, I hope the calling of my conſcience ſhould be heard above them.</p>
                        <p>Is it becauſe I was loth to leave the honour and profit of the place I was riſen too? Surely no, for I deſire your Lordſhips and all the world ſhould know, I do much ſcorn the one and the other, in compariſon of my conſcience. Beſides, it cannot be imagined by any man, but that if I ſhould have gone <note n="*" place="margin">He knew he could not have done them half the ſervice by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over from hence to <hi>Rome</hi> as by ſtaying here to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; and that made him ſtay.</note> over to them, I ſhould not have wanted both <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>profit;</hi> and ſuppoſe not ſo great as this I have here, yet ſure would my conſcience have ſerved my ſelf of either, leſſe with my conſcience would have prevailed with me, more than greater againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                        <p>Is it, becauſe I lived here at eaſe, and was loth to venture the loſſe of that? not ſo neither; for whatſoever the world may be pleaſed to think of me, I have led a very <note n="*" place="margin">In ſecular imployments inconſiſtent with, not in preaching and paines in his Calling.

                        <p>Not to trouble your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> too long, I am ſo <hi>innocent in the buſineſſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo free from all practiſe, or ſo much as thought of practiſe for any alteration unto Popery, or any blemiſhing the true Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in</hi> England, <hi>as I was when my</hi>

                        <p>Laſtly, if I had any purpoſe to blaſt the <hi>true Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of England,</hi> and to introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> ſure I took a wrong way to it; for, <hi>my Lords, I have ſtaid more</hi>

                  <p>To the former evidence, this further memorable teſtimony was ſubjoyned by way of corroboration and aggravation.</p>
                  <p>Miſtres <hi>Charnock</hi> (a Gentlewoman of good quality) and her Daughter joyntly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed before the Lords, that on <hi>Maundy Thurſday,</hi> about 6. yeares ſince, they being at <hi>Whitehall</hi> with ſome other of their friends, whereof one was a Papiſt, went into the <hi>Kings Chapell</hi> there to ſee it, where they ſaw an Altar with Tapers, &amp; other Furniture, on it, &amp; a Crucifix over it: whiles they were in the Chappell Dr. <hi>Browne of Saint Faiths Church</hi> under <hi>Paules,</hi> (then a Deane, &amp; one of the King's Chaplaines,) with his Curate came together into the <hi>Chappell, and bowed three ſeverall times almoſt to the ground, to the Altar and Crucifix,</hi> as they all conceived, and then kneeled down on their knees before them. A little after there came two <hi>Semenary Prieſts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chappell, and bowed downe very low three ſeverall times to the Altar and Crucifix over it (as they apprehended) juſt in the very ſame manner as Dr. <hi>Browne</hi> and his Curate did, and then kneeled downe before the Altar and Crucifix, for a little ſpace, as they had done. At which ſtrange ſight, Miſtreſſe <hi>Charnocke</hi> very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring, ſaid to thoſe in her company; <hi>J never thought to have ſeene ſuch a ſight, that our owne Miniſters and Popiſh Prieſts ſhould thus repaire one after another into the Kings Chappell, and uſe the ſelfe-ſame bowings, geſtures to the Altar and Crucifix, as if they were both agreed:</hi> Whereunto the Papiſt preſently anſwered, <hi>there is no ſuch odds and difference betweene you and us as is conceived;</hi> which one of the Semenary Prieſts over-hearing, uſed the like words; adding further, <hi>Gentlewoman, you need not wonder at our bowing and kuteling, (to the Altar and Crucifix) for you ſee that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of your owne Coate and Religion doe the like:</hi> and ſo they departed.</p>
                  <p>Now what a Capitall Crime, &amp; Treaſon this is for an Archbiſhop, intruſted with the care of Religion, to bring in ſuch Crucifixes, Ceremonies, Innovations into his Majeſties owne royall Chapell, as ſhould invite even his Majeſties Chaplaines, and Popiſh Semenary Prieſts thus openly and promiſcouſly to reſort into it to commit Idolatry with them; and there to uſe the very ſelfe ſame bowings, adorations to the Altar, Crucifix, as Prieſts themſelves uſually exerciſed, and openly upbraid us with, to the great offence and ſcandall of his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, was humbly ſubmitted to the ſaddeſt conſideration of his Iudges, and all that heard this evidence,</p>

and <hi>Dominus factetum</hi> in Church and Republik, but by his peſtiferous influence, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and example theſe Popiſh weeds ſprung up a pace by degrees in theſe choyceſt Seminaries of Piety and literature, till they quite over-ſpread them at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall begin with the <hi>Univerſity of Oxford,</hi> whereof by indirect meanes this Prelate procured himſelfe to bee elected <hi>Chancellour,</hi> upon the death of the Right Honourable <hi>Will.</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> in <hi>Apr.</hi> 1630. whoſe Noble brother (now <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi> thereof) was then really elected by moſt voyces, though miſcalculated by practiſe in the ſcrutiny by this Prelates Creatures. What alterations were there made upon his advancement, and Chancellorſhip, will appeare by theſe ſubſequent depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions given <hi>viva voce</hi> againſt him at the Lords Barre.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent</hi> depoſed; that before this Archbiſhop came to have power in this <hi>Univerſitie</hi> and to bee Chancellour thereof, there were no Copes, Altars, nor Communion Tables turned and rayled about Altarwiſe in Churches or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, nor any bowing to or towards the Altar, nor any Crucifixes but ſuch as were either defaced, or covered over with duſt, and quite neglected; but ſince his being <hi>Chancellour</hi> the Tables in al or moſt Churches, Colledges were turned into Altars, or rayled in Altarwiſe, and uſually bowed unto; the old Crucifixes repaired, adored, and new Crucifixes ſet up where there were none before; yet he never heard that the Archb. diſliked or reproved the ſame, though he was Chancellour, and ſaw theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, but liked them very well: That ſince the Archb. was <hi>Chancellour</hi> there was a New Church-Porch built to St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, (at the charge of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> ſince made a Biſhop;) where was none before, ſtanding in the very heart of the Vniverſity towards the ſtreet, to which Church all the Univerſity reſorted; in the front of which Porch was a ſtatue of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> cut in ſtone, with the Picture of a child in her Armes, commonly taken to be the Picture of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Corbet,</hi> a Fellow of <hi>Merton Colledge</hi> depoſed; that in the Yeare 1638. the Arch-Biſhop being Viſitor of that Colledge began his Viſitation there, by Sir <hi>Iohn Lambe</hi> his Deputy that one Article propounded to the Warden and Fellows was this; <hi>Whether they made due Reverence (by bowing towards the Altar or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table,) when they came into the Chappell?</hi> That himſelfe and Maſter <hi>Channell</hi> were injoyned by the Viſitors and Commiſſioners to uſe this Ceremonie; but they refuſed to do it: Whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn Lamb</hi> preſſed them very much to practiſe it; but they ſtill refuſed, propounding their reaſons againſt it; then he threatned him for it in particular. After this Dr. <hi>Frewin</hi> Vice-Chancellour of the Vniverſity told him, that he was ſent to him from the Archb. he being then Proctor, preſſing and requiring him as from the Archb. to uſe this Ceremony in regard of his place elſe it would be ill taken. Afterwards the Archb. ſent injunctions to <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge whereof this was one: <hi>Habeant debitam Reverentiam ad menſam Domini;</hi> where by hee meant this bowing to the Altar, as the Viſitors and common practiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it: the Viſitors afterwards queſtioning thoſe who bowed not; That this courſe continued till this preſent Parliament, and was generally practiſed at Saint <hi>Maries,</hi> and throughout the Vniverſitie. He further teſtified, that in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there was a <hi>Crucifix</hi> placed over the Communion Table, and Pictures in the Windowes; and a new Crucifixe ſet up in <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> none of which Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were there heard of before this Archbiſhops time.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>William Bendy,</hi> witneſſed upon Oath, that in the Yeare 1637. Since the Archbiſhop was <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> there was a ſtatue of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> With a Child in her Armes, ſet up in the front of Saint <hi>Maries Church-Porch</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the open ſtreete; which gave great offence to many: That there was a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix ſet up in <hi>Lincolne</hi> Colledge and a Picture of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> another Crucifixe in <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> another in <hi>New-Colledge,</hi> and the like in diverſe other Colledges, That Latine Prayers were injoyned to be uſed in Lent, and Studients to be preſent at them: That the Tables in moſt Churches, Colledges were turned into Altars rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Altarwiſe and bowed to: That in ſome Colledges they uſed Copes, and hee heard a ſtranger who had bin a Travailer ſay, that one of the <hi>Copes</hi> he ſaw at <hi>Oxford</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61245:38"/>
was juſt like that he had ſeene at ROME on the POPES backe.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Nixon</hi> one of the Aldermen of <hi>Oxford</hi> depoſed <hi>viva voce,</hi> that there was a Picture of Stone ſet up in the New-Church porch at Saint <hi>Maries Church</hi> towards the high Street, of a Woman holding a Babe in her Armes, which they cald the Picture of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> and Chriſt, (ſtanding almoſt oppoſit to his Houſe) which was very ſcandalous, offenſive both to him &amp; others: that himſelfe had ſeene ſome paſſengers as they rode along by it, to bow very low to their Horſes manes, and put off their Hats unto it: that hee obſerved one Paſſenger, both going and returning to bow thus unto it, and put off his Hat, who (as he heard) belonged to the Portugall Embaſſador, and was a Papiſt; that there was one who kneeled downe before this Image, and held up his hands as if he prayed unto it. He further depoſed, that not only in ſundry Colledges, but in the Pariſh Church of <hi>Carfolks.</hi> (the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Church for the City, whether the Major and Aldermen reſorted;) there was a great large Crucifix with the Picture of Chriſt upon it, ſet up in the Window by <hi>Giles Widdowes</hi> who was Parſon there, and one whom the Archbiſhop countenanced.</p>
                  <p>That this Archbiſhop was both the Author, and encourager of all theſe innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not heard of there ſince the Reformation; is evident: becauſe they ſprung up there in the time of his Chancellorſhip, and were introduced, by thoſe who were his greateſt Creatures, enjoyned by his Viſiters (as you heard before) and moſt of them preſcribed in the Vniverſity Statutes, made by himſelfe, which all were bound by Oath to obſerve.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> a Scholler and Graduate of this Vniverſity, depoſed: That Altars, Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Crucifixes were there of late ſet up in moſt Colledge Chappells, and in ſome Churches; particularly, that in <hi>Peter houſe</hi> Chappel there was a glorious new <hi>Altar</hi> ſet up, &amp; mounted on ſteps, to which the Maſter, Fellowes, Schollers bowed, &amp; were

enjoyned to bow by Doctor <hi>Coſens</hi> the Maſter, who ſet it up; that there were Baſons. Candleſtickes, Tapers ſtanding on it, and a great Crucifix hanging over it.

                     </gap> that in St <hi>Iohns Colledge, Kings Colledge, Trinity Colledge,</hi> and <hi>Peter houſe</hi> there were Altars, Candleſtickes, Tapers, and Crucifixes, newly ſet up: That in St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Houſe Chappells, there were Pictures of the Holy Ghoſt in forme of a Dove; that in <hi>Peter Houſe</hi> there was likewiſe a carved Croſſe at the end of every ſeat, and on the Altar a Pot, which they uſually called the incenſe pot: that the Maſter, Fellows, and Schollers of that houſe at their entring into, &amp; going out of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, made a low obeyſance to the Altar, being enjoyned by Doctor <hi>Coſens</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a penalty (as they reported) to doe it; and none of them might tume their backs towards the Altar going in nor out of the Chappell: That divers Schollers of other houſes uſually reſorted thither, ſome out of Curioſity only to behold, others to learne and practiſe the Popiſh Ceremonies and Orders uſed in that Chappell: and the common report both among the Schollers of that Houſe and others, was, that none might approach to the Altar in Peter houſe but in Sandalls and that there was a ſpeciall conſecrated Knife there kept upon the Altar, to cut the ſacramental bread that was to be conſecrated.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Lazarus Seman</hi> depoſed, that he left the Vniverſity of Cambridge about ten yeares ſince, and that in his time none of the forementioned Innovations were ſo much as known or uſed there; but of late times they have all beene introduced.</p>
                  <p>Many more witneſſes were ready to depoſe the like, and more then this, but the Innovations of this kinde were ſo notoriouſly knowne to all, and ſo fully proved before the Parliament in Maſter <hi>Peter Smarts</hi> Articles againſt Doctor <hi>Coſins,</hi> that the Commons thought to produce more witneſſes herein, would bee a meere miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time to no purpoſe, but to tyre out the Lords and Auditory.</p>
                  <p>But perchance the Archbiſhop will object; what are theſe Innovations in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity <note place="margin">Object.</note> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> unto me, who was neither Chancellor there to councell, or countenance them, nor immediatly introduced them? <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which was Anſwered, 1. That his publike example and practiſe in his own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell at <hi>Lambheth</hi> (formerly manifeſted) was both a preſident, precept for this their imitation and one chiefe cauſe of theſe Innovations.

His owne chiefe Favorites, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, Creatures, who were moſt intimate, frequent with him at <hi>London,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Headſhips in Colledges by his meanes, were the only active Inſtruments to bring in and promote theſe Corruptions; therefore queſtionleſſe they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, at leaſt incouragment from him for their proceedings in this kinde. 4ly. His not being Chauncellor of this Vniverſity, was rather an obſtacle to the ſpeedy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of theſe Innovations then otherwiſe, as appeares by <hi>Oxford</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them by publique Laws and Injunctions, which was not done in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> becauſe he was not Chauncellor; yet he would needs be their Immediate Viſitor, as Archbiſhop of Canterbury, conteſting with them for this Authority before his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic

Among the reſt, not raſhly and of my ſelfe, but by a Chapter<hi>-Act, I removed the Communion Table, from the middle of the Quier to the upper end, the place appointed to it, both by the Injunctions of this Church, and by the practiſe of all the Kings Majeſties Chappells, and</hi>

                  <p>So ſoone did this Prelate begin to introduce theſe <hi>Popiſh Innovations</hi> into our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedralls only at firſt, againſt Law, to the great ſcandall of well affected Proteſtants, and encouragment of Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>In the Yeares 1626: and 1627. Maſter <hi>Iohn Coſens</hi> a great acquaintance and Camrade of this Archbiſhops, ſet up a goodly ſtone Altar (rayled in Altarwiſe, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Pictures, Candleſticks, Tapers, Baſons, Altarcloths having ſuperſtitious Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon them) inſtead of a Communion Table, &amp; bowed conſtantly to it; repaiting and erecting diverſe unlawfull Images (ſome of Chriſt Himſelfe) in that Cathedrall; where the likewiſe introduced Copes and Chalices (having Crucifixes and Pictures of the <hi>HOLY GHOST</hi> upon them,) together with many other Popiſh trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, ſetting up a multitude of Candles &amp; Tapers in that Church on <hi>Candlemaſſeday,</hi> after the Popiſh manner. Againſt which Innovations Maſter <hi>Peter Smart,</hi> (the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt Prebend of that Church) preaching openly in the Cathedrall, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. after the diſſolution of that Parliament, by this Arch-Innovators means (as appeares by ſundry Letters concerning this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between Dr. <hi>Coſeus</hi> and him found in the Archbiſhops Study) he was ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought into the High Commiſſion Courts, both a <hi>Durham, Lambeth,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> for vexation; and at laſt there moſt unjuſtly deprived of all his Eccleſiaſticall livings, fined impriſoned diverſe yeares, and his livings conferred upon others by this Arch-Prelates meanes, as his owne Letters manifeſt. All which particulars having beene lately heard, proved by ſundry depoſitions before the Commons and Lords; and publiſhed in <note n="*" place="margin">See Maſter <hi>Francis Rouſe</hi> his printed Speech at the Tranſmiſſion of Maſter <hi>Smarts</hi> cauſe to the Lords.</note> Print to the World by Maſter <hi>Smart</hi> himſelfe, in his <hi>Catalogue of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Innovations</hi> brought into <hi>Durham Cathedrall.

                  <p>Theſe Innovations in theſe 3.

                  <p>No ſooner was this active Prelate promoted to the Archbiſhop ricke of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> but preſently he began to pollute the Cathedrall of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with his popiſh <note place="margin">Innovations in <hi>Canterbury</hi> Cathedrall.</note> Innovations; Firſt hee cauſed an <hi>Altar</hi> to be there erected by the Deane and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and much monies to bee expended by them upon Baſons, Candleſticks, Altar-Cloaths,

                        <p>It is ſo that Doctor <hi>Robert Weſton,</hi> ſometimes one of the Lords Juſtices for the Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Lord Chancellor of the ſame Realme, Grandfather to my deceaſed Wife, and great Vncle to the now Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe memory yet lives by being ſtiled the good Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was buried in the upper end of the Chancell in Saint <hi>Patrickes</hi> Church, whoſe Daughter Sir <hi>Iefferey Fenton</hi> maried, he having beene principall Secretary of State to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> for many yeares, and lived and died in great honour, whoſe onely Daughter I tooke to Wife, and hee was buryed in the ſame grave; My Wife drawing towards her end, made her laſt requeſt unto me, that her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, her Father, and her ſelfe might be buried together, and that I would be at the charge to erect ſome Monument in memoriall of them all; Whereupon in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of her dying deſire, who was the Mother of my fifteene Children, I propounded unto the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to the Deane and Chapter of Saint <hi>Patricks,</hi> to purchaſe a place where I might erect a Tombe over them, And they aſſigned me the ground under an Arch to make a Seller or Vault in, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive dead bodies, and three foote of the Chancell adjoyning to the Grave where the Lord Chancellor, and Sir <hi>Iefferey Fenton</hi> had beene buried, for which I payd them a Fyne, with Rent and other reſervations towards the reparation of the Church, and by their unanimous conſent have a Deed in due forme of Law, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected under their Chapter Seale, and ſo being by generall conſent legally intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted therein, I made a Vault of hewed ſtone under ground, with conveighances therein, to free the Church from the waters, with which floods, and great raynes it was before often anoyed withall, and where there was then but an earthen flower at the upper end of the Chancell, which was often overflowne, I rayſed the ſame three ſteps higher, making the Staires of hewen ſtone, and paving the ſame through out of the ſame, whereon the Communion Table now ſtands very dry and gracefully. In that Seller I have placed the Corps of my Wives Grandfather, her Father, and her ſelfe with a Daughter of mine ſince deceaſed, that was married to the Lord <hi>Digbie,</hi> and over the Vault I have cauſed a Tombe of foure ſtoryes to be erected, which reacheth two and thirtie foot from the ground, which hath coſt me a thouſand pounds at the leaſt, and is the greateſt ornament and beautie to that Church that ever was placed therein, that being ſeated under an Arch, that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time was only a paſſage into the Saint <hi>Mary</hi> Chappell, at the Eaſt end of which Chappell the high Altar ſtood; and when that Chappell (which hath two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes into it, the one on the right hand, the other on the left) fell into ruine, that Arch wherein the Tombe is placed to keepe the winde and weather out of the Chancell, was made up with ſlight timber and lathes, and plaiſtred with Clay white lymed over, whereon the Commandements were lately written. It is three yeares ſince this my worke was finiſhed, and neither during the time of the worke, nor ſince, till now of late, did I ever heare of any mouth opened againſt it, but many in commendations of it, as a great beautie and ornament to that Chancell, neither
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61245:44"/>
doth it take away, or hide any of the lights of the Chancell, for they are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this Fabricke, Neither is there any remembrance, nor can the oldeſt man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſay, that there ever was any Altar placed neere this paſſage: Yet of late it hath pleaſed my honourable Lord, the Lord Deputy, to command me <hi>to give Your Grace ſatisfaction herein,</hi> or elſe to declare, that the Tombe muſt be defaced, which to have done, would bee the greateſt diſhonour and affliction that could bee layed upon me. And the more, for that before I heard any thing of Your Graces diſtant thereof. I had in the preſence of the Lord <hi>Prymate,</hi> given order to the Deane at my ovvne charges for a ſtately Skrene to be erected within the Quire, and upon the pavement raiſed by my ſelfe, upon which the tenne Commandements are to bee engraven, to the great beautifying of Gods Houſe; Vpon that notice from the Lord Deputy, I made ſuite to the Lord <hi>Prymate,</hi> and the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> to view the place, which they vouchſafed together with the Deane and Chapter to doe. And doe humbly offer to your Grace their opinions herein, which I beſeech Your pious conſideration of, and that you will be pleaſed to returne me ſuch an anſwer, as may encourage me to proceed herein, and in other like building and charitable workes, wherein I ſpend a great part of my eſtate and time, as all that know me and my actions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>VNderſtanding from the Earle of <hi>Corke,</hi> that Your Grace hath intimated unto the Right Honourable the Lord Deputie your offence taken againſt a Tombe, lately built by his Lordſhip in the quire of Saint <hi>Patrikes</hi> Church neere this Citie <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> being informed that it ſhould be ſituate in the place, where the High-Altar anciently ſtood, and that it ſhould darken the Eaſt Window of the Quire: upon his Lordſhips earneſt requeſt unto mee, I have made bold to declare unto your Grace my knowledge thereabouts: which is, that the place where the Tombe is erected, is a ſpatious Arch, which in former times, as I conceive, ſerved for a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the <hi>Marie</hi> Chappell adjoyning, at the Eaſt end vvhereof the High Altar ſtood. This Arch was cloſed up and plaſtered, to keepe the winde, as I imagine, out of the Quire, Saint <hi>Marie</hi> Chapell being ſomevvhat decaied: upon the plaiſtering the Declalogue was fairely painted: theſe vvere done before my promotion to this See, or comming into this Kingdome. The windovves, which were of old ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat high over the Arch, are no way darkened by his Lordſhips monument, but remaine as they were formerly; and the monument is ſo wrought and contrived what in the Arch and the Wall, that vvith the grate before it, it doth not much diminiſh the length of the Quire. The Earle hath raiſed that end of the Quire three-ſteppes higher then it vvas, and hath paved it with faire hevven ſtones, being formerly a floore of earth, many times upon a freſh drovvned vvith water, where novv the Communion Table i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

repreſenting in a leſſer modell the patterne of <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey,</hi> where there is a skrine encloſing ſome monuments, and a way on each hand to the Chappell adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Your Grace may bee pleaſed alſo to underſtand, that the Earle obtained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to erect his Monument in that place by the unanimous conſent of the Deane and Chapter of that Church; and that they are Honourable perſonages whoſe memory is preſerved in that monument, the one being Lord Iuſtice, and Lord Chancellour of this Kingdome, the other principall Secretary of State, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors to his moſt pious and Vertuous Lady lately deceaſed.

                        <p>IT is moſt true, that I have taken offence at a Tombe erected by the Earle of <hi>Corke,</hi> in the Cathedrall of Saint <hi>Patrick,</hi> but I did not take that Offence <note n="*" place="margin">A notorious untruth of an Arch-Prelate.</note> lately onely, but before ever my Lord Deputy that now is, was named to the place, And I took that offence by a complaint thence ſent unto me (for I was never there) though I cannot recall who it was that complaind. And I am ſure the complaint came then unto mee with a full cry, that it was built in the place where the <hi>High-Altar firſt</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                           <hi>ſtood, and the Communion Table afterwards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your Lordſhip at the Earles entreaty hath ſignified to me your knowledge (for ſo you ſay) that the Tombe ſtands in a great Arch at the end of the Quire, which was plaiſtered up to keepe out the Winde, and that the High Altar ſtood at the end of the Lady <hi>Maries</hi> Chappell, which is beyond it, and that the Eaſt Window is at the top of the Arch, and not darkened. My Lord it will be hard for mee to ſpeake any thing contrary to Your Lordſhip, who hath beene ſo often upon that place where I never was; yet I ſhall deale freely, and tell Your Lordſhip what I thinke.</p>
                        <p>And firſt my Lord, I am ſatisfied that the Tombe darkens none of the Eaſt-Window. <hi>But I am no way ſatisfied that the Altar ſtood at the upper end of the</hi> Lady Maries <hi>Chappell. That an Altar ſtood there I eaſily grant, for in thoſe times, there were</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                           <hi>diverſe Altars in one Cathedrall, and every by Chappell had one at least.</hi> But that the High-Altar did ever ſtand in any Cathedrall in other place then the Eaſt end of the Quire, is quite out of my knowledge, nor did I ever heare it till now by Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Letters.</p>
                        <p>That the place before the Arch was an earthen Floore, and often troubled with a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61245:45"/>
freſh, I doe againe really believe Your Lordſhip. And the Earle hath done very well to raiſe it, and pave it with ſtone. But that the ſwelling of the Tombe: The Iron Grate before it: The taking in of ſome ancient Monuments on either ſide: The erecting of a Skrine, before which you ſay the Communion Table ſhould ſtand, would take off little or no Roome from the Quire; that I muſt confeſſe, I doe not very well underſtand.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordſhip addes, that when the Skrine is built, and the Communion Table placed before it, it will much beautifie the Quire, and be like other Cathedralls. To that I can ſay nothing, but muſt leave it to their eye-ſight and judgement that are upon the place. And whereas Your Lordſhip ſayes that my Lord had leave of the Deane and Chapter, <hi>with their unanimous conſent to erect a Monument in that place, if the place be fit for a Monument; the conſent was very well askt, and given. But if it appeare the place were inconvenient, then my Lord of</hi> Corke <hi>did not very well to aske a conſent,</hi> and the Deane and Chapter did very ill to grant it; and the more unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous the conſent was, the worſe. And whereas you write that there are other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſonages whoſe memory is preſerved in that Monument; to that I ſay, if the Monument ſtand where it ought, God forbid it ſhould be toucht. If it ſtand where it ought not, it may be fairely and decently removed, and ſet up in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place upon the ſide of the Quire, or elſewhere, where it will as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the memory of thoſe Honourable Perſonages which you mention, as now it doth, And God forbid any violence ſhould be offered to that, in any kinde.</p>
                        <p>And laſt of all, whereas Your Lordſhip deſires I ſhould take into conſideration the merits of that Noble Earle, I am very willing to doe that, And firſt I am very glad to heare from Your Lordſhip his zeale for the advancement of true Religion: but I may not conceale from Your Lordſhip, that I have likewiſe heard from others <hi>and that ſome yeares ſince, that hee hath gotten into his hands no ſmall proportion of the Churches meanes. And if that be ſo, any man may ſee his end in advancing true Religion, But ſuch a Zeale that poore Church hath little need of, and God bleſſe every part of the Church from it. As for his Lordſhips building of Churches, Schooles, and Hoſpitalls, I know nothing of that, and can ſay as little to it. Only this I can ſay, that if he take from the Church in one place, to build Church, Schoole, or Hoſpitall in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tis no zeale, nor the way which Chriſtian bounty uſes to tread.</hi> And if his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath done any Publike worke for ſtrength and fortification to the Kingdom, I pray God that bee not done with the Churches money too. But howſoever his Lordſhip hath get a very full eſtate in that Kingdome and hee doth very wiſely to fortifie it as well as hee can. But beſides theſe I have long ſince heard, though you now mention it not, that his Lordſhip hath done greater ſervice to the Church in ſome other particulars; as namely to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liſmore,</hi> and the Colledge of <hi>Yong-Hall,</hi> for which it is great pitty, but that his Lordſhips memory, ſhould bee preſerved in the Church.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have given Your Grace a diſtinct anſwer to all the Particulars in Your Letter. But for the Tombe which occaſioned all the reſt, I will not take upon mee to judge (unleſſe I were upon the place) how fitly, or unfitly it ſtands there, but ſhall wholly leave it to the view, and reſolution which ſhall thereupon bee taken in that place. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and reſt,</p>

                  <p>This Order being thus obtained, and afterwards publiſhed in Print by Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> in his <hi>Coale from the Altar,</hi> and <hi>Antidotum Lincolnienſe;</hi> the deſigne of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, rayling in and turning Communion Tables into Altars in Parcohiall Churches, Chappells, was much promoted by coulor of it, &amp; of the reaſon of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Cathedrall Mother Churches expreſſed in it: And to haſten this worke the more (to which the people and Church-wardens in many places were very averſe) the Archbiſhop being to keep a Metropoliticall Viſitation in all Dioceſſes and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces exempt, and not exempt with in the Province of Canterbury, by Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent</hi> his Vicar Generall &amp; others his Commiſſioners, though he made no mention in his printed Viſitation Articles of removing and rayling in Communion Tables Altar wiſe, to avoyd the peoples clamours againſt him, yet hee writ a private Letter to Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent</hi> after his departure hence, to enjoyne him to remove and raile in the Communion Tables in all Pariſh Churches, and gave him order to ſee it executed. With which practiſe the Archbiſhop being charged at the Lords Barre by <hi>Serjeant Wilde,</hi> who mannaged this part of the evidence; he peremptorily denied it, and proteſted ſolemnly before the Lords, that he never gave Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch order or directions by letter or otherwiſe; and that he could prove by ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonies, Sir <hi>Nathaniell</hi> had openly acknowledged, that this Alteration was made by Sir <hi>Nath.</hi> himſelfe of his own head, without any order from him; adding that he cold not be ſo unworthy as to deny it. Wherupon he deſired Sir <hi>Nath.</hi> might be called to teſtify the truth upon his Oath: who appearing at the Lords Bar for this purpoſe, the Archbiſhop demanded of him; whether ever hee gave him any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or direction, by word or writing in his Metropoliticall Viſitation, to remove or raile in Communion Tables at the Eaſt end of the Chauncell, telling him, hee was now upon his Oath, and wiſhing him to ſpeake nothing but the truth herein: whereunto Sir <hi>Nathaniell</hi> anſwered: My Lords upon the Oath I have taken, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an expreſſe direction &amp; command from the Archbiſhop himſelfe to do what ever I did in this or any other kind, elſe I durſt not have don it; To which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop confidently replyed; My Lords, I proteſt I never gave him any ſuch command or directions, &amp; I wonder Sir <hi>Nathaniell</hi> dares be ſo bold &amp; unworthy as to affirm it here upon Oath ſince I can prove he hath formerly denied it: To which Sir <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniell</hi> replyed: My Lords, ſince the Archbiſhop ſo confidently denies that he ever gave me any ſuch command and directions, I ſhall humbly deſire that this Letter of his ſent unto me when I was viſiting at <hi>Maidſtonin Kent,</hi> ſigned with his own hand, may be read; which will end the controverſie, and manifeſt by whoſe Authority and command I did it; whereupon a Letter under the Arch Biſhops owne hand, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Sir <hi>Nathaniell</hi> was delivered to the Clarke and openly read, to the Arch-Biſhops great ſhame, and diſparagment of all his Proteſtations, which after this (&amp; ſome other paſſages wherein he was taken tripping in like manner) were repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meere vaporing impoſtures, to delude the vulgar, voyd of truth and credit. The Letter was to this effect. <hi>Sir, I require you to command the Communion Table at</hi> Maidſton <hi>to be placed at the Eaſt or upper end of the Chauncell, and there railed in, and that the Communicants there ſhall come up to the Raile, to receive the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the like you are required to doe in all Churches, in all other placse where you are to viſit Metropolitically,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>W. Cant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This letter being read, much daunted, diſcredited the Arch-Biſhop in the opinion of all the Auditors, he having nothing to reply, but that he had forgotten he writ
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61245:47"/>
him any ſuch letter. Vpon the receipt whereof Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent</hi> confeſſed he did give order throughout his Metropoliticall Viſitation, that all the Communion Tables ſhould be removed, and railed in at the upper end of the Chauncell in all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches, and all ſeates above the Table, or equall with it in any Chancell pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe, and that the Communicants ſhould goe up to the Raile and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament kneeling; which he preſſed as ſpatingly as he might, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne judgment; and thereupon obedience was yeelded in moſt places, and ſuch as refuſed to Raile in their Tables, were queſtioned and proceeded againſt by others, but as for himſelfe he never troubled any for it.</p>
                  <p>That the Archbiſhop himſelfe gave both command and approbation for theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, was proved by this enſuing Petition, to which an Anſwer was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen by Maſter <hi>Dell,</hi> ſubſcribed with the Archbiſhops owne hand, found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Sir <hi>Iohn Lambes</hi> ſequeſted Papers, by Maſter <hi>Prynne.</hi>

                        <p>YOur Letters of <hi>Aprill</hi> 13. I have received, and I thanke you for your care and paines in Viſiting the Churches of your Arch-Deaconry within the City of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in which I have often heard there are ſome things amiſſe, and finde by your report, that the Information given me was true. And becauſe you certifie me of ſome things of greater moment then ordinary, I thought it very fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint His Majeſtie with all the contents of your Letter, and did ſo: By which <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> meanes, I ſhall with more freedome give you the fuller anſwer to the three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars mentioned by you.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, which is the raiſing of Galleries and Seates from the ground three or foure aſcents, His Majeſtie hath commanded mee to write unto you, that they be taken down, and the Seates left orderly in the Church. But you are to take care to acquaint the Miniſter and Church-wardens with it, and to ſee it done, in a faire, and peaceable manner. The like Courſe you are to take with the ſecond, for it is no way fit that any <hi>Monument whatſoever, ſhould be ſet up at the East end of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, thereby, ſtanding equall at leaſt, if not above the Communion Table, and fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to caſt it out of its proper place.</hi> Therefore if any ſuch be in any Church within your juriſdiction, you are to ſpeake with them that are next of Kinne, or <note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61245:48"/>
whom ſuch Monuments may moſt concerne. And if they will remove them, and ſet them up in any other place, on the ſides of the Church, you are to give them leave ſo to do; but if they will not, you are then to take them downe, in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, and not to ſuffer any to ſtand at the Eaſt end of the Chancell.</p>
                        <p>Your third buſineſſe, is of greater conſequence, it is, that there is another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument in Saint <hi>Georges Church,</hi> in which there is deſcribed in Capitall Letters, the <hi>GUN-POUDER TREASON,</hi> with this motto, <hi>In perpetuam Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarum infamiam, &amp;c.</hi> I hope this ſtands not at the Eaſt end of the Chancell, for if it doe, you muſt ſee it removed to ſome other place, but if it ſtand upon any ſide of either Chancell, or Church, then you are with the knowledge of the Miniſter and the Church-Wardens, or any other whom that Monument may concerne, to take ſome Painter to you and cauſe him to put out of the Monument, all that <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> concernes the Fleet in 88. becauſe that belongs to a Forreigne Nation: And though your Letters make no mention of 88. yet the Picture of the Monument, which you ſent me up doth, which I ſhewed His Majeſtie as well as Your Letter. So having here given you a cleare direction in all your three particulars, I ſhall expect your care in the execution of them according to it, So I leave you to the grace of God, and reſt,</p>

                  <p>By theſe two Letters it is apparent, that the Archbiſhop gave ſpeciall directions not only to Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent,</hi> but to the <hi>Arch-Deacon of Canterbury to take down Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries and Monuments at the Eaſt end of Chancells neare the Communeon-Tables; and to place the Tables there, at in their proper place;</hi> as likewiſe to obliterate the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our <hi>happy deliverance from the Spaniſh Armado in</hi> 88. out of that Church, where it had long continued.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it was proved by the teſtimony of Maſter <hi>Sutton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Browne,</hi> and others, that in the yeare 1640. in the new Chappell at <hi>WEST MINSTER,</hi> the Kings Armes were ſet up in the Eaſt Window, which was firſt glaſed with white Glaſſe; afterward the Archbiſhop promiſing to beſtow a new window inſtead of it, the Kings Armes were thereupon taken downe by direction of Doctor <hi>Haywood,</hi> the Archbiſhops Chaplaine, and <hi>Browne</hi> this Joyner, and placed in another obſcure window, and the Archbiſhops Arms (ſupported by Seraphins) put up in its place to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that hee was the ſole donor of this new Window, where inſtead of the white Glaſſe, there was ſet up in coloured glaſſe, the Picture of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in form of a Dove, with the <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary, Chriſt, Angells, and Ceraphins,</hi> for which the Glaſier was payd ſince the Archbiſhops commitment to the Tower by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops direction (as the Glaſier verily believed,) this new painted Window being ſet up about the beginning of this Parliament, but ſince demoliſhed by order of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which manifeſts the Archbiſhops perſeverance in his Popiſh Innovations not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Scotiſh troubles, and the many late complaints againſt them in the laſt diſſolved and preſent Parliament.</p>
                  <p>When this Arch-Prelate had in his Metropoliticall Viſitation by private inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only to his Vicar Generall and other Agents, ſet on theſe Innovations, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them into many Pariſh-Churches in moſt Dioceſſe, hee then by his ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Suffragans and <hi>Creatures,</hi> began to enforce them univerſally upon all Miniſters Church-Wardens, Pariſhes, by <hi>Viſitation Oaths and Articles,</hi> upon which ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Church-Wardens and others who oppoſed them were preſented yea proſecuted as Delinquents. Among others Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> Biſh. of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Mathew Wren,</hi> Biſh. of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Biſh. <hi>Lindſy</hi> of Peterborough, Biſh. <hi>Mountague</hi> of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Skinner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Briſtall,</hi> were the chiefe promoters of his Innovations eſpecially of rayling in Communion Tables Altarwiſe, bowing to and towards them, ſaying ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſervice at them, and comming up to the new rayles to receive the Sacrament, preſcribing

Many Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells are ſo ſeated, that it cannot appeare how the Communicants kneels and for this (in truth) the Faction hath the greateſt ſticke at it: Many Pariſhes are populous, and the Chancels large, but the Chalices very ſmall, while the Prieſt then goes to and againe, ſo far to renew the Cup, much time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is loſt.</p>

A Copy whereof he ſent to the Archbiſhop, who received it the 21th. of the ſame Moneth, as appeares by his endorſement thereof.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>When I came firſt into this Dioceſſe, I was much and often troubled by many in many parts thereof, about comming up to the Rayles, as they called it, in time of the holy Communion.</p>
                     <p>This was a novelty unto me as it ſeemed it was in it ſelfe; for I had never <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> heard of it, nor did I know what it meant. But I underſtood at length it was this; Thoſe that intend to receive the holy Sacrament, are to come up out of the Church, and to draw neere unto the Rayles, which incloſe the <hi>Altar,</hi> or Communion Table, and there to kneele as many as can, and to receive in both kindes at the Miniſters hands; when this company at the Rayles have received in both kindes, they are to riſe up, to withdraw, and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to ſucceed in their places; and after them, a third, and ſo till all bee in that ſort Communicated.</p>
                     <p>In this courſe thus obſerved, I do not underſtand whether all at once that intend to Communicate, do together come up out of the Church into the Chancell, and being there diſpoſed, ſitting or ſtanding, doe in courſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire unto the Rayles, and returne from thence; Or whether onely ſo many doe together come up out of the Church, as can kneele at the Rayles, the other remaining in the Church behinde, untill their courſe come to goe up? Nor do I know, whether they repaire, being riſen from the Rayles, whether into ſome place in the Chancell, or out of the Chancell into the Church, which may bee comberſome, and is inconvenient, it being for any thing I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61245:52"/>
know to the contrary, an ancient Tradition of the Church, for no man to go out of the Chancel, or from his place, having received it untill the <hi>Ite miſſa</hi> or diſmiſſive bleſſing upon them, which we call the Peace of God. Therefore to give that ſatisfaction which I can in this cauſe; becauſe yet never any Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of comming up to the Rayles, did unto mee refuſe to come into the Chancell, to receive upon their knees, to obſerve the Service Booke in all points, onely they cannot digeſt the going up, and comming downe, and diſquieting the Aſſembly, which neither doe I my ſelfe approve of, untill His Majeſty, or my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> appoint otherwiſe; to whom I <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> doe, and they muſt, and I hope will ſubmit themſelves. Theſe orders I have thought good for quiet, peace and conformity to direct.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, after the words or Exhortation pronounced aloud by the Miniſter, ſtanding at the Communion-Table, to the Pariſhioners as yet in the Church, draw neere, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>All intending to Communicate, are to come up out of the Church into the Chancell; and as in courſe of Civility and good order, it is ſeemely the beſt in the Pariſh to come up firſt.</p>
                     <p>All being come in, the Chancell doore is to be ſhut, and not to be opened till the Communion is done; that no Communicant departtill the dimiſſion, no <hi>non-</hi>Communicant come in amongſt them, no Boyes, Girles or gaſers be ſuffered to looke in as to a Play.</p>
                     <p>The Communicants being entred, to be diſpoſed into ſeverall ſtations, rankes, or formes; the firſt ranke to ſtand, ſit, or kneele, neere or cloſe unto the Rayles, which being the moſt eminent place, the beſt in the Pariſh may fitly be diſpoſed there.</p>
                     <p>And for order and decency though all bee Communicants alike, in that holy Communion, yet confuſion is to bee avoyded.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ranke being thus diſpoſed, behinde them a ſecond, behinde them a third ranke may be diſpoſed, leaving a ſufficient ſpace for the Prieſt to goe betweene, in giving firſt the Bread to all the ſeverall Communicants, and then the Wine afterwards, if he be ſole, and if he have an aſſiſtant, the chiefe Miniſter to give the Bread, and the Aſſiſtant to follow him with the Cup, or Challice, both going out from the <hi>Altar,</hi> when the firſt ranke is ſerved; and whereas in many Chancells, if not in all, there be Seats built up, the more is the pitty, to peſter the Chancell; it is not fit that any ſhould go into them, untill the ſeverall rankes have filled the whole Chancell.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe peradventure ſome out of zeale without knowledge or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, have ſtubbornly refuſed to come unto the Rayles neere them, as if it were impious, at leaſt ſuperſtitious to come there, as by name one Mr. <hi>Daye</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich;</hi> I doe require him to receive at the Rayles, the next Communion, <hi>ſub paena juris,</hi> and for the reſt of the refuſers, who have promiſed conformity in all things, but in riſing up, and going up and downe, which I neither will, nor do require of them; let them manifeſt their conformity by once coming up, and afterwards as it happeneth, diſpoſe themſelves in the Chancell.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>As theſe Popiſh Innovations, Ceremonies were thus ſet on and preſcribed in the Dioceſſe of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> by <hi>Mountague,</hi> and <hi>Wren:</hi> ſo were they by Doctor <hi>Divenant</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> (of whoſe direction and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination concerning the placing of the Communion Table, the Archbiſhop tooke much advantage in his Star-chamber ſpeech, pag. 13, 14.) by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincolne, Williams,</hi> and his Officers in his Dioceſſe, notwithſtanding he ſeemed afterwards to oppoſe them, and <hi>Canterburies</hi> proceedings herein, <hi>in his Holy Table, name, and thing.</hi>

                  <p>We ſhall begin with the Churchwardens of <hi>Beckington</hi> in the County of Somerſet, whoſe caſe, by the teſtimonies of Mr. <hi>John Aſh</hi> (a Member of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <note place="margin">The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens of Beckingtons caſe.</note> and Lord of that Pariſh) of M. <hi>William Long,</hi> and M. <hi>George Long</hi> (who ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the cauſe in the Churchwardens behalfe) was manifeſted to be thus. The Communion Table in the Pariſh-church of <hi>Beckington</hi> had for 70 years and more ſtood in the midſt of the Chancell, encloſed with a very decent Wainſcot-border, and a dore, with ſeats for the Communicants to receive in, round about it: In the year 1633. D. <hi>Pierce</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath and Wels</hi> (a great creature of <hi>Canterburies)</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certaine Commiſſioners to view the Churches within his Dioceſſe, &amp; certifie to him the defects thereof: who viewing the Church of <hi>Beckington</hi> certified among other things, that there was not a decent Communion Table in it, neither was it placed under the Eaſt window, nor railed in otherwiſe then with a Border about it, where <note place="margin">Nota.</note> the communicants kneel at the holy Communion, and that there were ſeats above the Communion Table. To which Certificate the Churchwardens and Sidemen of <hi>Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> were ordered by the Biſhop to return an anſwer under their hands before <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion-day</hi> 1634. which they did accordingly. After which the Churchwardens were enjoyned by the Biſhop by word of mouth, to remove and rayle in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Table Altarwiſe, againſt the Eaſt end of the Chancel: which they refuſing to doe, conceiving it to be againſt the Rubrick, Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Injunctions, and the 82 Canon: thereupon <hi>Iames Wheeler,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Fry,</hi> Churchwardens, were on the 9 of June 1635. cited into the Biſhops Court at <hi>Wels,</hi> before <hi>William Hunt</hi> the Biſhops Surrogate, and D. <hi>Duck</hi> his Chancelour; for that the Communion Table in the Chancell of <hi>Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> was not placed under the Eaſt window of the Chancel, nor rayled in otherwiſe then with a Border about it, and that there were ſeats above the ſaid Table; who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed them to repaire the ſaid defects, and to place the Lords Table againſt the Eaſt wall of the Chancell, with the ends of it North and South, as it ſtood in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church at <hi>Wels,</hi> with a rayle about it; and to certifie that they had done all this by the 6 of October following; At which day they were excommunicated in open Court by the Biſhop himſelf, for refuſing to remove and rayle in the Table and pull down the ſaid ſeats. Whereupon the Churchwardens appealed to the Arches for relief, where after much waiting and ſolicitation, they procured from Sir <hi>Iohn Lambe,</hi> Dean of the Arches, a Letter to the Biſhop to abſolve them for a time, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he did only for 27 dayes, admoniſhing them to ſubmit to what he had formerly enjoyned them; for not doing whereof he excommunicated them againe in open Court on the 12 of January following. Hereupon the Churchwardens appealed to the Arches the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and petitioned the Archbiſhop for reliefe, to which Petition this Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat under the hands of about one hundred of the Pariſhioners was annexed.</p>

                        <p>According to my promiſe in my Letter to you the laſt week, I have now ſent unto you a copy of all my proceedings in the cauſe, concerning the Chancel of the Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church of <hi>Beckington,</hi> and the placing of the Communion Table therein, together with my reaſons for the ſame, which I hope will give you full ſatisfaction in this buſineſſe; I have ſent likewiſe a copy to my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> not that I think it worthy of his reading, or that he hath leiſure to peruſe it, but that it may lye by him; that when you ſpeak with his Grace about this, among other buſineſſes, his Grace may have recourſe to my papers, if he think fit.</p>
                        <p>There are in my Dioceſſe 469 Churches and Chappels, or thereabout, and the Communion Tables are placed already in above 140 of them, as the Communion Table is placed in our Cathedrall Church here: I have begun and proceeded herein <note place="margin">Note.</note> in a perſwaſive way; ſome pariſhes were no ſooner ſpoken to, but they obeyed; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pariſhes refuſed at the firſt, but they were quickly ſatisfied, and then ſubmitted; only the Churchwardens of <hi>Beckington,</hi> being encouraged and back'd by divers of the pariſh, not ſo well affected to the government and rites of the Church as they ſhould be, are become obſtinate, and will have the Chancell ordered, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table there placed as the pariſhioners ſhall think fit, who alſo bear the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of theſe Churchwardens, as they have confeſſed unto me; which was the cauſe why they haſted ſo ſpeedily to London, and ſtayed ſo long there, about this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
                        <p>If theſe men have their wils, the example will do a great deal of harme, for then many of the Pariſhes which have already conformed themſelves to the Cathedrall <note place="margin">Note.</note> will fall back, and other Pariſhes will never come on to this conformity, who are now at a ſtand to ſee what will be done in the Chancell of <hi>Beckington.</hi> I know your judgement and affection to the Church concurres with mine, and therefore I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured you will do nothing herein, but that which ſhall be for the good of the Church and preſervation of authority in all things juſt and lawfull.</p>
                        <p>I pray, If D. <hi>Duck</hi> deſire to read the coppy of the proceedings and reaſons which I have ſent you, let him borrow it of you, for it is fit my Chancelour ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

That Images placed publickly in Temples, cannot poſſibly be without danger of worſhipping and idolatry: wherefore they are not publickly to be, or ſuffered in Temples and Churches, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>We infer and ſay for the Adverſative, that all our Images of God, our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Saints, publickly ſet up in Temples and Churches, places peculiarly appointed to the true worſhip of God, be not things indifferent nor tolerable, but againſt Gods law &amp; commandment, taking their own interpretation and expoſition of it. Firſt, for that all Images ſo ſet up publickly, have bin worſhipped of the unlearned and ſimple ſort, ſhortly after they had been publickly ſo ſet up, and in concluſion of the wiſe and learned alſo. Secondly, for that they are worſhipped in ſundry places now in our time alſo. And thirdly, for that it is impoſſible that Images of God, Chriſt, or his Saints, can be ſuffered (eſpecially in Temples and Churches) any while or ſpace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out worſhipping of them, and that Idolatry which is moſt abominable before God, cannot poſſibly be eſcaped and avoided, without the aboliſhing and deſtruction of Images and Pictures in Temples and Churches, for that Idolatry is to Images, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Temples and Churches an inſeparable accident (as they tearm it) ſo that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Churches, and Idolatry, go alwayes both together, and that therefore the one cannot be avoided except the other (ſpecially in all publick places) be deſtroyed. Wherefore to make Images, and publickly to ſet them up in the Temples and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, places appointed peculiarly to the ſervice of God, is to make Images to the uſe of Religion, and not only againſt this precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt make us manner of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> but againſt this alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow downe to them, nor worſhip them:</hi> for they being ſet up, have been, be, and ever will be worſhipped, &amp;c. That it is not poſſible if Images be ſuffered in Churches and Temples, either by the preaching of Gods Word or by any other means to keep the people from worſhipping of them, and ſo to avoid idolatry, &amp;c. What can we do, I ſay, or bring to paſſe to the ſtay of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, or worſhipping of Images, if they be allowed to ſtand publickly in Temples and Churches? And if ſo many, ſo mighty Emperours, by ſo ſevere Lawes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, ſo rigorous and extreame puniſhments and executions, could not ſtay the people from ſetting up and worſhipping of Images, what will enſue thinke you, when men ſhall commend them as neceſſary books of the Laymen? Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of theſe latter dayes learn this leſſon of the experience of ancient Antiquity, That Idolatry cannot poſſibly be ſeparated from Images any long time, but that as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable accident, or as a ſhadow followeth the body when the Sunne ſhineth, ſo Idolatry followeth and cleaveth to the publick having of Images in Temples and Churches. And finally, as Idolatry is to be abhorred and avoided, ſo are Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which cannot be long without Idolatry, to be put away and deſtroyed. Beſides the which experiments and proof of time before, the very nature and origine of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages themſelves draweth to Idolatry moſt violently, and mens nature and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo is bent to Idolatry ſo vehemently, that it is not poſſible to ſever or part Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor keep men from Idolatry, if Images he ſuffered publickly, &amp;c. For if the origine of Images and worſhipping of them, as it is recorded in the eight Chap. of the Book of Wiſdom, began of a blind love of a fond father, framing for his comfort an Image of his Sonne being dead; and ſo at the laſt men fell to the worſhipping of him whom they did know to be dead: how much more will men and women fall to the worſhipping of the Image of God, our Saviour Chriſt, and his Saints, if they be ſuffered to ſtand in Churches and Temples publickly. For the greater the opinion is of the majeſty and holineſſe of the perſon to whom an Image is made, the ſooner will the people fall to the worſhipping of the ſaid Image. Wherefore the Images of God, our Saviour Chriſt the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Apoſtles, Martyrs, and other of notable holineſſe, are of all other Images moſt dangerous for the perill of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and therefore greateſt heed to be taken, that none of them be ſuffered <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61245:60"/>
to ſtand publikely in Churches and Temples. For there is no great dread leaſt any ſhould fall to the worſhipping of Images of <hi>Annas, Caiphas, Pilate,</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor, if they were ſet up.</p>
                     <p>But to the other, it is already at full proved, That Idolatry hath been, is, and is moſt like continually to be committed. Now as the Nature of mari is none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bent to worſhipping of Images (if he may have them and ſee them) then it <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 1 Cor. 4. Heb. 13.</note> is bent to whordome and Idolatry in the company of an harlot. And as a man given to the luſt of the fleſh, ſeeing a wanton harlot, ſitting by her, and imbracing her, it profitteth little for one to ſay beware of fornication, God will condemne fornicators and adulterers: for neither will he, being overcome with greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements of the ſtrumpet, give eare or take heed to ſuch godly admonition, and when he is left afterwards alone with the harlot, nothing can follow but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe: Even ſo, ſuffer Images to be ſet in Churches and Temples, ye ſhall in <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 21. 1. Cor. 10. 14.</note> vaine bid them beware of Images, as Saint <hi>John</hi> doth; and flee Idolatry as the Scriptures warn us: ye ſhall in vaine preach and teach againſt Idolatry. For a number will notwithſtanding fall headlong unto it, what by the nature of Images, and what by the Inclination of their own corrupt Nature.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore as for a man given to luſt, to ſit down by a ſtrumpet, is to tempt God. So is it likewiſe to erect an Idoll in this proneſſe of mans nature to Idolatry, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a tempting. Now if any will ſay, that this ſimilitude proveth nothing, yet I pray them let the Word of God, out of the which the ſimilitude is taken, prove ſomething. Doth not the Word of God call Idolatry ſpirituall fornication? Doth it not call a gilt or a painted Idoll or Image, A ſtrumpet with a painted face? <note place="margin">Levit. 17. &amp; 10. Numb. 25. Deut. 31. Barach 6.</note> Be not the Spirituall wickedneſſes of an Idols inticing, like the flatteries of a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Harlot? Be not men and women as prone to ſpirituall fornication (I mean Idolatry) as to carnall Fornication? If this be denyed let all Nations upon the earth which have been Idolaters (as by all ſtories appeareth) prove it true. Let the Jews and the people of God, which were ſo often and ſo earneſtly warned, ſo dreadfully threatned, concerning Images and Idolatry, and ſo extreamly puniſhed therefore, (and yet fell unto it) prove it to be true, as in almoſt all the books of the Old Teſtament, namely, the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Chronicles</hi> and the Prophets, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moſt evidently. Let all Ages and times, and men of all ages and times, of all degrees and conditions, Wiſe-men, Learned-men, Princes, Ideots, unlearned and Commonalty prove it to be true. If you require Examples; for wiſe men you have the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Indian Gymnoſophiſtes,</hi> for the wiſeſt men of the world, you have <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of all other. For learned men the <hi>Greeks</hi> and namely the <hi>Athenians,</hi> exceeding all other Nations in ſuperſtition and Idolatry, <note place="margin">Acts 17. Rom. 1.</note> as in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth them. For the Princes and Governours, you have the <hi>Romans</hi> the rulers of the roaſt, (as they ſay) you have the ſame ſornamed King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> after him, ſaving <hi>David, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and one or two more. All theſe (I ſay) and infinite others, wiſe learned Princes and Governours, being all Idolaters, have you for examples and a proof of mens inclination to Idolatry. That I may paſſe over with ſilence in the mean time, infinite multitudes and millions of Idiots and unlearned, the ignorant and groſſe people, like unto horſes and mules, <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> in whom is no underſtanding, whoſe perill and danger to fall on heapes to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by occaſion of Images, the Scriptures ſpecially fore-ſhew and give warning of. And indeed how ſhould the unlearned, ſimple, and fooliſh, ſcape the nets and ſnares of Idols and Images; in the which the wiſeſt and beſt learned have been ſo <note place="margin">Wiſd. 13. 14.</note> entangled, trapped and wrapped? Wherefore the Argument holdeth this ground ſure, that men be as inclined of their corrupt nature to ſpirituall fornication, as to carnall, which the wiſedome of God fore-ſeeing, to the Generall prohibition, that none ſhould make to themſelves any Image or ſimilitude; addeth a cauſe, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mans corrupt nature, <hi>leſt</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thou being deceived with errour, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 4,</note>

And of this ground of mans corrupt inclination, as well to ſpirituall fornication <note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> as to carnall, it muſt needs follow, that as it is the duty of the godly Magiſtrate, loving honeſty and hating whoredome, to remove all Strumpets &amp; Harlots, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of places notoriouſly ſuſpected or reſorted unto of naughty perſons for the avoiding of carnall fornication; ſo it is the duty of the ſame godly Magiſtrate, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of the godly Kings, <hi>Ezekias</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> to drive away all ſpirituall Harlots (I mean Idols and Images) eſpecially out of ſuſpected places, Churches, <note place="margin">

And as he were the enemy to all honeſty that ſhould bring Strumpets and Harlots out of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corners into the publick Market place, there freely to dwell and practiſe their filthy merchandize; So is he the enemy of the true worſhipping of God, that bringeth Idols and Images into the Temple and Church, the Houſe of God, there openly to be worſhipped, and to rob the jealous God of his honour, who will not give it to any other, nor his glory to carved Images; who is as much forſaken, and the bond of love between man and him as much broken by Idolatry, which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <note place="margin">Iſay 42. 8.</note> fornication, as is the knot and bond of mariage broken by carnall fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let all this be taken as a lye, if the Word of God enforce it not to be true; <hi>Curſed be the man ſaith God in Deuteronomy, That maketh a carved or molten Image, and placeth it in a ſecret corner. And all the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi> Thus <note place="margin">Deut. 27.</note> ſaith God, for at that time no man durſt have or worſhip Images openly, but in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only: and the whole World being the great Temple of God, he that in any corner thereof robbeth God of his glory and giveth it to ſtocks and ſtones, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by Gods Word accurſed. Now he that will bring theſe ſpirituall Harlots out of their lurking corners into publick Churches and Temples, that ſpirituall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication may there openly of all men and women without ſhame be committed with them, no doubt that perſon is accurſed of God, and twice curſed; and all good and godly men and women will ſay, Amen, and their <hi>Amen</hi> will take effect alſo. Which is thus ſeconded in the ſecond part of the <hi>Homily of the place and time of prayer, p.</hi> 130, 131. The Jewes in their time provoked juſtly the vengeance of God, for that partly they abuſed his holy Temple with the deteſtable idolatry of the Heathen, and ſuperſtitious vanities of their own inventions, contrary to Gods Commandement, &amp;c. And have not the Chriſtians of late dayes, and even in our dayes alſo, in like manner, provoked the diſpleaſure and indignation of Almighty God? Partly becauſe they have prophaned &amp; defiled their Churches with Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and Jewiſh abuſes, with Images and Idols, with numbers of Altars too too ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly and intollerably abuſed, &amp;c. Finally Gods vengeance hath been and is daily provoked, becauſe much wicked people paſſe nothing to reſort to the Church, either for that they are ſo ſore blinded that they underſtand nothing of God &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; and care not with diveliſh example to offend their neighbours; or elſe for that they ſee the Church altogether ſcowred of ſuch gay-gazing ſights, as their groſſe phantaſie was greatly delighted with; becauſe they ſee the falſe religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, and the true reſtored; which ſeemeth an unſavoury thing to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury taſte, as may appear by this that a woman ſaid to her neighbour: Alas Goſſip, what ſhould we now do at Church, ſince all the Saints are taken away, ſince all the goodly ſights wee were wont to have are gone, ſince wee cannot hear the like piping, ſinging, chaunting, and playing upon the Organs that we could before? But (dearly beloved) we ought greatly to rejoyce and give God thanks, that our Churches are delivered out of all thoſe things which diſpleaſed God ſo ſore, and filthily defiled his holy Houſe, and his place of prayer, for the which he hath juſtly deſtroyed many Nations, according to the ſaying of

For which act of juſtice and charity, <hi>Iohn Buckston</hi> the then Mayor, Maſter <hi>Wiſe</hi> the Town Clerk, and ſome other of the Aldermen of that City, were by the Archbiſhops procurement ſent for by a Purſevant, to appear before the Counſell Table as Delinquents; where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, were fully heard concerning the granting of this Annuity, before the King himſelfe and his Councell, who ſeemed fully ſatisfied, approving of their grant, and were ready to diſmiſſe them from thence, as ſeeing no juſt cauſe for their moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Whereupon the Archbiſhop moved, that they might be tranſmitted from thence to the High Commiſſion, which by his means was ordered accordingly.

and the grant ordered to be cancelled, which was done accordingly; and thereupon a 100. l. expence the reſt were diſmiſſed the Court, and M. <hi>Workman</hi> deprived of his Annuity. After which M. <hi>Workman</hi> himſelf being cenſured and put from his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and impriſoned by the High-Commiſſion, for Preaching againſt making and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Images of the Trinity, and of Chriſt and Saints in Churches; having after ſome moneths Impriſonment, with much ſolicitation obtained his Liberty, to ſupport himſelf his wife and many ſmall children from periſhing, was neceſſitated to teach children in private, having no other livelihood left him after his former Annuity, granted him by the City of <hi>Glocester,</hi> was by the Arch-biſhops potency, unjuſtly wreſted from him; of which the Arch-biſhop being informed, inhibited him to teach any children at all in publike or private, as he would anſwer the contrary at his perill; whereupon he fell to practiſe Phyſicke for his neceſſary ſupport: which being informed of to the Arch-biſhop, he thereupon prohibited him likewiſe to practiſe Phyſick: Whereupon he having no meanes of ſubſiſtance left; and being debarred to Preach, teach School, or adminiſter Phyſick to maintain himſelf and his charge, was ſo afflicted with theſe tyrannicall and unjuſt preſſures (of which he oft complained to Maſter <hi>Langley</hi> and others,) that they drew on craſineſſe and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of body upon him; and as his moſt intimate friends were verily perſwaded, ſhortned his dayes, and precured his death, to the great griefe and loſſe of that City. So zealous was this Arch-Prelate in defence of Idolatrous Images; as thus moſt unjuſtly and tyrannically to ruine a moſt godly painfull Miniſter with his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deſtroy this living ſpeaking Image of God and Chriſt, for preaching againſt dead, falſe, unlawfull, Images, and repreſentations of them according to our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of our Church.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it was then fully proved at the Lords Bar, by the oathes of Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Bourne,</hi> that the Arch-biſhop was ſo mad upon Images, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and their worſhip; That Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> having Printed by licenſe, 70. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of his, preached upon ſeverall occaſions, in one whereof he had cited a paſſage againſt worſhipping Images, out of the <hi>Homily againſt the Perill of Idolatry,</hi> in refutation of the Papiſts; the Arch-biſhop ſending for the Doctor commanded him to carry his ſaid Sermons to Doctor <hi>Bray</hi> his Chaplaine to peruſe, before they were publiſhed, leaſt there ſhould beany offenſive paſſages vented in them; which he doing accordingly, the ſaid Doctor purged out of the 788. <hi>page</hi> thereof, this enſuing clauſe therein cited out of the very <hi>Homely</hi> againſt the perill of Idolatry, as ſcandalous, and heterodox, cauſing the whole ſheet to be new Printed, which expunction was openly read at the Bar by Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> himſelf in theſe following words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And howſoever ſome of late mince the matter, and beare us in hand that the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, drawing, carving, melting, gilding, erecting, clothing, and cenſing, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and praying before Images and Pictures, is but the excreſcencie of Romiſh devotion, and no proper fruit of Idolatry and ſuperſtition: yet they who laid the firſt ſtone in the happy Reformation of our Church of England and penned the Homilies appointed by Authority to be read in all Churches condemne theſe practiſes of the Romane Church, as no leſſe idolatrous than the like of the Heathen.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Homily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Part. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The full proof of that which in the beginning in the firſt part of this Treatiſe was touched is here to be made good and performed, to wit, that our Images and the Idols of the Gentiles be all one, as well in the things themſelves, as alſo in that our Images have been before, be now, and ever will be worſhipped in like forme and manner, as the Idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were, ſo long as they be ſuffered in Churches and Temples: whereupon it followeth, that our Images in Churches have been, he, and ever will be, no other but abominable Idols. And every of theſe parts ſhall be proved in order, as hereafter followeth. And firſt that our Images and the Idols of the Gentiles are all one concerning themſelves it is moſt evident, the matter of them being gold, ſilver, or other mettle, ſtone, wood, clay or plaiſter, as were the Idols of the Gentiles: and ſo being either melten or caſt, either carved, graven, hewer or otherwiſe formed and faſhioned, after the ſimilitude or likeneſſe of man or woman, they be dead and dumb works of mens hands; having</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61245:62"/>
                     <hi>mouthes and ſpeak not, eyes and ſee not, hands and feel not, feet and go not, and ſo as well in form as matter, be altogether like the Idols of the Gentiles: inſomuch that all the titles that be given to the Idols in the Scripture, may be verified of our Images. Wherefore no doubt but the like curſes which are mentioned in Scriptures, will light upon the makers and worſhippers of them both. Secondly, that they have been &amp; be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in our time, in like forme and manner as were the Idols of the Gentiles, is now to be proved: and for that idolatry ſtandeth chiefly in the minde, (which ſhall in this part firſt be proved) that our Image-maintainers have had and have the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and judgement of Saints, whoſe Images they have made and worſhipped, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile idolaters had of their Gods. And afterwards it ſhall be declared that our Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maintainers and worſhippers, have uſed and uſe the ſame outward rites and manner of honouring and worſhipping their Images, as the Gentiles did uſe before their Idols: and that therefore they commit idolatry, as well inwardly as outwardly, as did the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Gentile idolaters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe two evidences of the Archbiſhops perſecuting Maſter <hi>Workman,</hi> for <note place="margin">Nota.</note> uſing the very words and expreſſions of our eſtabliſhed Homilies againſt Images; and his Chaplaines purging out of Doctor <hi>Featlies</hi> printed authorized Sermons, this paſſage of our <hi>Homilies,</hi> againſt the worſhipping of Images (no doubt by his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) it is moſt apparent, that his deſignes and intentions were to ſubvert the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed doctrine of our Church, againſt the ſetting up and adoration of Images, and to defile our Churches againe, not only with theſe Romiſh Idols, and Paganiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, but to make us all Idolaters in worſhipping and adoring them, as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh or Gentile Idolaters did their Idol-gods.</p>
                  <p>To put this out of queſtion, we ſhall only adde one irrefragable evidence more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Images and Pictures. We have proved formerly that the Archbiſhop had in his own private Study a Book of Popiſh pictures of the Life, Paſſion, and Death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> printed by <hi>Boetius à Bolſwert</hi> in forein parts, <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. Theſe very Pictures were all licenſed by the Archbiſhops own Chaplain Doctor <hi>Bray;</hi> printed by his own printer and Kinſman <hi>Badger,</hi> in the year 1638. for one <hi>Peake</hi> a Stationer (now in armes againſt the Parliament) and publickly ſold and bound up in Bibles; as was teſtified by Mr. <hi>Walley</hi> Clerk of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners Hall, and <hi>Michael Sparke Senior.</hi> Maſter <hi>Willingham</hi> likewiſe atteſted upon oath concerning theſe Pictures and Crucifixes put into the Bibles: that Captain <hi>Peak</hi> at Holborne Cundit, Bookſeller, who printed theſe pictures for Bibles, did affirme, that he printed them <hi>with the good liking, and by the ſpeciall direction of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and his Chaplaine</hi> Dr. <hi>Bray:</hi> which Dr. <hi>Bray,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>carried him divers times to the Archbiſhop, to ſhew him the prints thereof, as they were cut and finiſhed, who liked them all well, and gave his conſent for the binding them up in Bibles;</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Bibles wherein theſe pictures were bound up, they ſhould be called</hi> THE BISHOP OF <hi>CANTERB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RIES</hi> BIBLES; (ſtiling them after his own name, ſo much did he owne this fact, not the Bibles and Book of God, who abhorres ſuch Images:) and further depoſed, That he found two Bibles bound up with theſe Pictures in them, the one among Secretary <hi>Windebanks,</hi> the other among Sir <hi>John Lambes</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ducks</hi> chiefe papers and treaſure (two of the Archbiſhops boſome friends and favourites) who highly eſteemed them: both of which Bibles ſeized by Mr. <hi>Willingham,</hi> and richly bound up with theſe pictures in them, were then <note place="margin">Note.</note> produced and ſhewed to the Lords. Maſter <hi>Walley</hi> further depoſed, that theſe pictures bound up in Bibles giving great offence and ſcandall to many well affected people, himſelfe with ſome other Stationers repaired to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop and complained againſt theſe pictures, and the binding of them up in Bibles, demanding his Graces direction therein; whether they ſhould ſeize ſuch Bibles with pictures which gave offence, or ſuffer them to be ſold? To which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop anſwered, That they might doe well not to lay them out publickly upon their ſtals to be ſold as yet, leſt they ſhould give offence; but if any come to ask for them or to buy them in your ſhops, in Gods name ſell them freely to them, without
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61245:63"/>
any ſcrupple; adding the ſecond time, ſell them to ſuch in Gods name, but lay them not upon your ſtals in publick view. Upon which teſtimony the Archbiſhop deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Mr. <hi>Walley,</hi> who it was that gave him this direction concerning the ſale of thoſe Bibles with pictures? To which he readily replyed; Your Grace with your own mouth, as you may well remember. Whereunto the Archbiſhop anſwered, it was true, he did ſo; but the pictures were printed &amp; bound up with Bibles before he knew of it; and that the firſt time he ſaw one of theſe Bibles, was in a Ladies hand in the Chappell at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> which he looking upon, when he came to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> ſent for one of thoſe Bibles himſelf; after which, the Stationers comming unto him about the ſale of them, he gave them ſuch directions as aforeſaid, not to ſell them openly for fear of giving offence, but only privately in their ſhops to ſuch as asked for them: As moſt evident confeſſion of guiltineſſe. For if ſuch pictures in Bibles were good &amp; uſefull, why ſhould they not be expoſed to open ſale, &amp; the view of all men? if ill and unlawfull, why ſhould any of them be printed, or ſold to any in private, and not totally ſuppreſſed, demoliſhed, burnt? being contrary to our Statutes, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Writers, and the received Doctrine of our Church? Theſe directions then of his, ſhewes his good affection to popiſh and idolatrous pictures: he had polluted his own Engliſh Bible with an embroydred Crucifix on its cover, before theſe Pictures printed; and now he would corrupt, pollute all our Bibles and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments with theſe Romiſh Images bound up in them, to which they are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant. He would ſuffer no Engliſh Bibles to be printed or ſold with marginall Notes to inſtruct the people, all ſuch muſt be ſeized and burnt, as we ſhall prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none: but himſelf gives ſpeciall approbation for the venting of Bibles with Popiſh pictures taken out of the very Maſſe book, to ſeduce the people to popery and idolatry.</p>
                  <p>The laſt caſe we ſhall inſtance in touching the Archbiſhops perſecuting of ſuch who oppoſed his Popiſh Innovations, is the caſes of Dr. <hi>Iohn Baſtwick</hi> a Phyſitian, <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Baſtwicks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynnes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Caſes.</note> and Mr. <hi>William Prynne</hi> a Lawyer, Mr. <hi>Henry Burton</hi> a Divine: who were all brought into the Star-chamber by this Archbiſhops proſecution, and there moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely cenſured for oppoſing his popiſh Innovations, in Trinity Terme 1637. In which caſe all the injuſtice, oppreſſion, and cruelty that could be imagined, were combined both in the proceedings, ſentence, and execution, not to be parallel'd in any age, as will appear by the enſuing particulars, atteſted by the ſeverall oathes of M. <hi>Prynne,</hi> M. <hi>Burton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Belfore,</hi> M. <hi>Tomlins,</hi> M. <hi>Sappe,</hi> M. <hi>Wickins,</hi> Miſtreſſe <hi>Baſtwick</hi> and others; backed with the Orders and Decree of the Court it ſelf. Firſt M. <hi>Burtons</hi> houſe was broken open by force by a Serjeant at Armes, his Study ranſaked, his perſon appreheaded and committed cloſe Priſoners long before any in formation againſt him, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> &amp; ſo continued without Baile, during all the time of the proſecution againſt him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though the information againſt them three was joynt, and licenſe granted them to repaire to Counſell with their Keepers, by an Order of the whole Court; yet they were denied liberty to conferre one with another, even with their Counſell themſelves, or to make a joynt anſwer or defence, and ſoon after reſtrained all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to Counſell by a verball Order. Thirdly, the Counſell aſſigned to them were ſo terrified and threatned, that they durſt not draw or ſigne any anſwer for them: who thereupon petitioning the Court for liberty in their Counſels default to put in their anſwers under their own hands, according to former preſidents &amp; orders of that Court, they were abſolutely denied this right and juſtice, contrary to law and preſidents. Dr. <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> anſwer under his own hand left at the Office, and another copy of it tendred and left in open Court rejected, and he taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> for a pretended contempt in not putting in his anſwer under Counſels hand. Fourthly, Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Chamber in the Towre, by a ſpeciall direction from the Archbiſhop, was ſearched by Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Clerk of the Councell, and a Purſevant of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who ſuperviſed Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and was more active, peremptory then he, not leaving the very Cloſe-ſtoole unſearched; his inſtructions for his anſwer ſeiſed and carried away by them, himſelf ſhut up cloſe priſoner; pen, inke, and paper to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61245:63"/>
draw either his anſwer or new inſtructions for his Counſell denied him; his Clerk that ſolicited his buſineſſe ſeized on by a Meſſenger, and kept cloſe priſoner, of purpoſe to hinder him from following his Maſters buſineſſe; examined frequently by the Kings Attorney &amp; Sollicitour to pick out ſome crime or accuſation againſt his Maſter, and never admitted to returne unto him (though he tendred ſufficient baile for his forth-comming, and no accuſation was then pending againſt him) no not to attend him during his ſores after execution of the ſentence on him. Fiftly, M. <hi>Prynne</hi> was denied all acceſſe to Counſell; liberty to draw up and ſigne his own anſwer (though a Counſellor at Law) in default of Counſell; albeit he twice petitioned the Court to have leave to do it, producing ſundry reaſons and preſidents in that Court to warrant it; yea the very Clerk that writ but a Petition from his mouth by the Lieutenants permiſſion, that he might put in his anſwer under his own hand, was for this very cauſe ſeized on by a Purſevant, and moleſted divers weeks after. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when Mr. <hi>Holt,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> aſſigned Counſell) had by direction of the Court taken his fee, drawne his anſwer, and given order for the engroſſing of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to ſigne it the next morning, he was privately commanded not to ſigne it; &amp; thereupon refuſed the ſigning of it, contrary to promiſe, alleaging that he had order given him to the contrary, and that he durſt not do it for an hundred pieces: After which M. <hi>Tomlins</hi> another of M. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Counſell ſigning his anſwer, it was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both at the Star-chamber office &amp; in open Court, where it was tendred, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence it came too late, and Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> for a ſuppoſed contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous refuſall to anſwer; when as they would neither permit him to put in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer under his own hand; and ordered one of his aſſigned Counſell not to ſigne his anſwer when ingroſſed contrary to his promiſe, nor accept it, when ſigned by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Counſell, and twice tendred. Seventhly, Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> Anſwer, when drawn, engroſſed, and ſubſcribed by M. <hi>Holt</hi> (his aſſigned Counſell) by order of the Court, and accepted at the Office without any exception againſt it, was after nine dayes ſpace, when peruſed by the Archbiſhop, pretended to be ſcandalous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon referred to the two chiefe Juſtices, Sir <hi>John Bramston</hi> and Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> who gave it ſuch a purgation without calling M. <hi>Burton</hi> to it, or ſuffering his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to defend it (whom Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> threatned with pulling his Gowne over his head and putting him from the Barre) as was never heard of in any Age; expunging no leſſe then 64 whole ſheets (containing his juſtification and defence) out of it, as ſcandalous, leaving only ſome three lines in the beginning of it, and two in the end, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to a generall not guilty, when as he confeſſed and juſtified all he was charged with: And becauſe Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> would not acknowledge this purged an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, directly contrary to that he put in upon oath, and anſwer to Interrogatories grounded on it, quite contrary to his anſwer as they had altered it, whereby he muſt of neceſſity have been perjured: therefore he was likewiſe taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and cenſured for a contempt in not anſwering, though he had an anſwer in Court. What the ſcandalous matter contained in, and expunged out of his anſwer by the Judges was, is very obſervable: truly it was no other then the very <hi>Oathes of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy &amp; Allegiance,</hi> preſcribed by <hi>ſeverall Acts of Parliament;</hi> (engaging the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and others who had taken them againſt popery and popiſh Innovations;) his Majeſties <hi>Declarations before the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>to all his loving Subjects, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Anno</hi> 1628. <hi>prohibiting all back-ſliding to Popery, or any Innovations or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Religion by law eſtabliſhed among us: The Petition of Right, and his Majeſties Anſwer thereunto, for preſervation of the Subjects rights and liberties;</hi> (extending as wel to ſecure them againſt theſe illegal popiſh Innovations which the Biſhops by an Arbitrary power would obtrude upon them and their conſciences by Suſpenſions, Excommunications, Fines, Impriſonments, and other vexatious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; as to the liberty of their perſons and eſtates of which they were deprived for oppoſing their Innovations): the ſtatute of 3 <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 1. intituled, <hi>An Act for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick thanksgiving to Almighty God every year on the</hi> 5 <hi>of November, for the great deliverance of the King, Kingdome, State and Parliament, from the horrid Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

                     <hi>Treaſon,</hi> (on which day Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> preached theſe two Sermons, againſt the ſeverall Popiſh Innovations and Doctrines mentioned in it, lately brought into the Church by the Archbiſhop and his confederates, for which he was queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Star-chamber.) The ſtatute of 3 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 4. intituled, <hi>An Act for the better diſcovering and repreſſing of Popiſh Recuſants.</hi> The ſtatute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. intituled, <hi>An Act for the uniformity of Common Prayer, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments; which excludes all new Ceremonies and Innovations in Gods ſervice, introduced by the Biſhops, not comprized in the Book of Common prayer;</hi> with an enumeration of thoſe ſeverall Innovations, in point of doctrine and ceremonies, (as ſetting up Altars inſtead of Communion Tables, removing Lords Tables from their ancient ſtations, and rayling them in Altarwiſe againſt the wall, bowing downe to them, reading ſecond Service at them; licenſing, printing Popiſh and Arminian Books, altering and purging the Books for the Gunpowder Treaſon, for the publick Faſt, Coronation, and Book of Common prayer, &amp;c.) with other particulars ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified at large in his printed Sermons. All this was totally expunged as ſcandalous out of Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> Anſwer, for feare the proof thereof ſhould have made the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſcandalous. Eighthly, theſe Defendants, when they perceived they ſhould not have liberty to defend themſelves, nor to prove or juſtifie the Archbiſhops and his Confederates popiſh Innovations by their Anſwers, exhibited a croſſe Bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them under their hands, which they offered to make good at their uttermoſt perils, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> tendring the ſame both to the Lord Keeper, and in open Court, defiring it might be admitted, being both for their own juſt defence, the honour of his Majeſty, and preſervation of our Religion, and that a Court of publick juſtice which ought to be as open for, as againſt them: yet this their Bill was twice refuſed without cauſe, and delivered over to Mr. Attourney Generall to draw up a Charge againſt the defendants out of it, if poſſible, and to queſtion them for their lives for exhibiting it. Ninthly, at the hearing, the Archbiſhop and Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> though chiefe proſecutions of this cauſe, in which they were ſpecially concerned, profeſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Defendants, and challenged in open Court by Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> as unfit to ſit Judges there in their own cauſe, contrary to all law and preſidents, were yet admitted to ſit in Court as Judges; where the Archbiſhop himſelf in a tedious Oration of two houres long (larger then ever any Sermon he preached in the Pulpit) profeſſedly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified all the forementioned Innovations wherewith he was charged; as <hi>Setting up Altars, rayling in Communion Tables Altar-wiſe, reading ſecond-Service at them, bowing downe towards them, as the Monks and Popiſh Fryers did of old, becauſe there 'tis</hi> Hoc eſt corpus meum, &amp;c. <hi>standing up at Glory be to the Father, bowing at the Name of Ieſus, altering and purging the Books for the Gunpowder Treaſon and the publick Faſt, in favour of Papiſts, the licenſing of Popiſh and Arminian Books, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt him, &amp;c.</hi> And yet reviled, condemned theſe Defendants, as Libellers, and thanked the Lords for their juſtice againſt them for falſely objecting theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Innovations to him, which himſelf in his Speech confeſſed himſelf guilty of, juſtified in open Court, and after that in print to all the World; dedicating this his Speech to his Majeſty, and making him the Patron of all theſe Innovations, contrary to his own royall Proteſtations. Tenthly, theſe Defendants, for oppoſing thoſe very popiſh Innovations which himſelf thus publickly confeſſed, defended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of their proofe and juſt defence by taking them all <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> for a pretended contempt, in not anſwering the Information, (which they would not permit them to put in their Anſwers to, as you heard before) were without any proof or teſtimony at all produced to prove them guilty of ought objected againſt them, fined 5000 li. a peece unto his Majeſty, adjudged to ſtand in the Pillory at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and there to loſe their Eares, which was accordingly executed, Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> was after deprived of his Living. degraded from his Miniſtery, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſtigmatized on both cheeks, though nothing at all was charged againſt him; and all of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the liberty of pen, inke and paper; and before their wounds were healed, they were ſent away cloſe priſoners to the 3 remote Caſtles of <hi>Lanceston, Lancaſter,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61245:64"/>
and <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> and there ſhut up cloſe priſoners, neither Wife, nor Childe, nor Brother, nor any other but their Keepers having any acceſſe unto them: and ſoone after by extraordinary Letters from the Councell Table (to which the Archbiſhops hand was firſt) ſent cloſe priſoners by Sea in the Winter-ſeaſon, to the hazzard of their lives into the Iſlands of <hi>Sylly, Garneſey</hi> and <hi>Iarſey,</hi> and there mued up cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners without pen, inke, paper, or allowance of neceſſaries, their friends being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited al acceſſe unto them, &amp; D. <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Burtons</hi> Wives eſpecially reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much as to ſet footing in the Iſlands where they were cloſe impriſoned, under paine of impriſonment: ſo penall and fatall was it for them to oppoſe the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in theſe his Innovations, who detained them thus cloſe priſoners in exile till they were releaſed by this preſent Parliament. That this proſecution was by the Archbiſhops inſtigation, was evidenced. Firſt, by the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>John Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhute,</hi> then ſervant to Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> his Majeſties Atturney Generall, to whom he committed the proſecution of all Star-chamber buſineſſes; who atteſted upon oath; that the Arch-biſhop gave him direction, for drawing the Information againſt Doctor <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and that he was commanded to give an account to him of all the proceedings therein, which he did from time to time, either to himſelf in perſon, or to his Chaplains, by his direction. Secondly, by the Copies of Doctor <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> Anſwers found in his ſtudy by Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> the firſt whereof was diſalowed and would not be admitted though twice tendred; the ſecond expunged by the Arch-biſhops direction, who had drawn a line with black lead under all that which ſhould ſtand in Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as appeared by the Coppy it ſelf produced at the Bar, giving Order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge the reſidue, which was done accordingly. Thirdly, by the whole Tenor of his ſpeech in Star-chamber, eſpecially this latter clauſe thereof, pag. 77. <hi>I humbly crave pardon of your Lordſhips, for this my neceſſary length, and give You hearty thanks for Your noble patience, and your juſt and honourable cenſure upon theſe men, and your unanimous diſlike of them, and defence of the Church. But becauſe the buſineſſe hath ſome reflection upon my ſelfe, I ſhall for beare to cenſure them, and leave them to Gods mercy, and the Kings Iustice.</hi> And by his enſuing Epiſtle to his Majeſty prefixed to this Speech. Fourthly by Subſequent Motions and Warrants under his hand, for their Exile and cloſe Impriſonment, in which he was onely active and inexorable.</p>
                  <p>What great encouragement and hope of a relapſe to Popery; the Archbiſhops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of Altars, Crucifixes, and other forementioned Innovations gave to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, Papiſts, and what was his reall deſigne in promoting them, we ſhall evidence by two notable paſſages, in two late Engliſh Jeſuites printed books.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, intituled, <hi>A Paraphraſticall and devout Diſcourſe upon the Pſalme, Miſerere,</hi> written by <hi>Ch. M.</hi> (an Engliſh Jeſuite, as appears by the Jeſuites Badge in the Frontiſpiece of it) <hi>printed and licenſed at Doway</hi> 30 <hi>Maii</hi> 1635. wherein there is this paſſage in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader, Theſemy</hi> Paraphraſticall, <hi>Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and pitifull lamentations of King</hi> David, <q>
                        <hi>I intend for all ſinners in England, as well Catholicks as not Catholicks, of what religion ſoever, I being a debtor to all: and becauſe I would have them all peruſe theſe Diſcovrſes, I abſtaine from contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in religion, lest I ſhould avert any from the reading of them: only in paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the two laſt verſes of this Pſalme, occaſion being offered, I ſpeak of the unbloody and daily Sacrifice of the Altar, but ſo, that I rather touch it then handle it, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, then treat of it, ſuppoſe it, then prove it in that manner as I might; hoping that this doctrine</hi> NOW <hi>will not be diſtaſtfull</hi> (mark the Reaſon:) <hi>For ſeeing now in England in very many Churches, Altars, which heretofore were thrown down, are againe erected, according to the laudable example and pious uſe and cuſtome of the</hi>

                        <hi>Catholick and even Primitive Church, to averre a true Sacrifice will not be ill ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; becauſe to allow of Altars, is to allow of a true Sacrifice which uſeth to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on them; an Altar and a true proper Sacrifice being Co-Relatives, of which the one inferreth the other; and ſo the one cannot be averred without the other, nor the one denied without the other.</hi> Loe here we have the true reaſon why the Archbiſhop was ſo zealous for Altars; even to bring in the Papiſts unbloody and dayly ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>That the Archbiſhop (then of <hi>London)</hi> on the 16 of January 1630. being the Lords day, came in the morning about nine of the clock in a pompous manner to <hi>Creed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi> accompanied with Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Rive,</hi> Dr. <hi>Duck,</hi> and many <note place="margin">His manner of conſecrating <hi>Creed-Church.</hi>

                     <hi>Merciful God, the reſurrection and the life of all that truſt in thee, wee moſt humbly intreat thee, to vouchſafe us of thy grace, that all thoſe thy ſervants who from hence forth ſhall come into, or be intered within the Circuit of this holy and ſacred place, now by our ſervice HALLOWED unto thee, may ſo lead their lives in thy feare, that they may leave them in thy favour; and that their bodies reſting in their Sepulchres in this Church in peace, untill thy comming unto Iudgment, may riſe again unto immortall life, and live with thee for ever in thoſe glorious mantions of eternity: Heare us O Saviour for thy paſſion ſake; heare us O Father for thy Chriſts ſake; heare us O Sanctifying Spirit for thy comforts ſake, who liveſt and reigneſt one God: &amp;c. Then, The peace of God followed. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all this, the Biſhop betook himſelfe, to ſit under a cloath of State in an Iſle of the chancell neare the Communion Table, and taking a written book in his hand, (in imitation of the <hi>Roman Pontificall</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Trents</hi> Decrees therein cited <hi>pag.</hi> 247, &amp;c.) <hi>He pronounced many curſes upon all thoſe which ſhould hereafter any way prophane that holy and ſacred place, by any Muſters of Souldiers, or keeping any</hi>

                     <hi>prophane Law-courts, or carrying burdens through it;</hi> At the end of every curſe (which were ſome 20.: or 30. in number,) he bowed himſelfe lowly towards the Eaſt or Table (ſaying, <hi>Let all the people ſay, Amen).</hi> When the <hi>Curſes</hi> were ended, he then pronounced the like number of <hi>Bleſſings</hi> to all <hi>thoſe that had any hand in the culture, framing and building of that holy,</hi> ſacred and <hi>beautifull Church, and pronounced Bleſſings to all thoſe that had given any Challices, Plate, Ornaments, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſills, and</hi> that ſhould <hi>here-after give any.</hi> At the end of every Bleſſing hee alſo bowed downe himſelfe towards the Eaſt, Saying; <hi>Let all the people ſay, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this followed the Sermon, which was worthily performed by Dr. <hi>Stephen Dennyſon,</hi> he taking for his theame the 19 of Luke 46. wherein he <hi>bitterly inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſetting up Pictures and Images in Churches;</hi> ſaying, it <hi>was Popiſh and heatheniſh Superſtition and Idolatry</hi> Which Sermon after-wards when Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> came to the high chaire of <hi>Canterbury</hi> he remembred at Dr. Dennyſons cenſure in the high Commiſſion upon another occaſion, and paſſed a heavy Cenſure upon the ſaid <hi>Dr.</hi> under which he hath ever ſince groaned.</p>
                  <p>After the Sermon which was but ſhort, the Biſhop and two fat Doctors conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and adminiſtred the Sacrament, with a number of bowings, duckings and cringeings; in manner following.</p>
                  <p>(As firſt) when the Biſhop approached neare the Communion Table, he bowed with his noſe very neare the ground ſome ſix or ſeven times; Then he came to one of the corners of the Table, and there bowed himſelfe three times; then to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third and fourth corners, bowing at each corner three times; but, when he came to the ſide of the Table where the bread and wine was, he bowed himſelfe ſeven times, and then, after the reading of many praiers by himſelfe and his two fat chaplins (which were with him, and all this while were upon their knees by him, in their Sirpliſſes, Hoods and Tippits) he himſelf came neare the Bread, which was cut and laid in a fine napkin, and then he gently lifted up one of the corners of the ſaid napkin, and peeped into it till hee ſaw the bread, (like a boy that peeped after a bird-neſt in a buſh) and preſently clapped it downe againe, and flew backe a ſtep or two, and then bowed very low three times towards it and the Table: when he beheld the bread, then he came neare and opened the napkin againe, and bowed as before; then he laid his hand upon the gilt <hi>Cup</hi> which was full of wine, with a cover upon it; ſo ſoone as he had pul'd the Cupp a litle neerer to him, he lett the Cupp goe, flew backe, and bowed againe three times towards it: then hee came neere againe, and lifting up the cover of the Cupp peeped into it, and ſeeing the wine, he let fall the cover on it againe, and flew nimbly backe and bowed as before: After theſe and many other Apiſh Anticke Geſturs he himſelfe received, and then gave the Sacrament to ſome principall men onely they devoutly kneeling neere the Table, after which more praiers being ſaid, this Sceane and Enterlude ended.</p>

                     <hi>Mr. Hope</hi> likewiſe depoſed the ſame that <hi>Mr. Willingham</hi> did, in all particulars touching the manner of the Archbiſhops conſecrating Creed-Church; at which conſecration he was preſent, and tooke ſpeciall notice thereof.</p>
                  <p>Upon which evidence the Committee of the houſe of Commons obſerved and urged before the Lords. Firſt, that it appeared by the praiers uſed by the Archbiſhop, that he conſecrated this Church rather for a Churchyard or a burying place, then for an Oratory or place of praier and preaching uſing the ſame praiers in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as are preſcribed in the <hi>Roman Pontificall,</hi> at the conſecration of a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to inter dead bodies in. Secondly, that the conſecration of Churches after this ſort, is a meere Popiſh and Superſtitious Ceremony, preſcribed onely by Popes and Popiſh Councels, Canoniſts, for their owne gaines and luchre, and not by any Proteſtant Canons, Synodes, Authors: witneſſe <hi>Gratian, De Conſecratione Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</hi> 1. and the Gloſſes on it, <hi>Summa Hoſtienſis. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.

Thirdly, that the forme and manner of conſecrating Churches, was no where to be found but in the <hi>Roman Pontificall,</hi> ſet out by the Popes authority, wherein it is at large deſcribed: P. 209. to 280. Cap. <hi>De Eccleſiae Dedicatione, ſeu Conſecratione;</hi> and not extant in the Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-praier, or of the Ordinition of Miniſters, or in any other Records or Rituals of our Church; which abolliſhed the <hi>Roman Pontificall,</hi> and Ceremony of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Churches by the Statutes of 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>C.</hi> 1. 3. &amp; 4. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>C.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Eliz.

Fourthly, That the very forme the Archbiſhop uſed in conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Creed-Church, was taken from the <hi>Roman Pontificall</hi> publiſhed by command of Pope Clement the eight, (found in this ſtudy:) P. 214. 217. 219. where the Biſhop comming to the doore of the Church he is to conſecrate <hi>Percutit illud ſemel cum inferiori parte baculi paſtoralis ſuper luminare, dicens intelligibili voce.

                  <p>The firſt, they inſtanced in, was reverend <hi>Dr. Pilkington</hi> (a fugitive for Religion in <hi>Queene Maries,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> in he beginning of <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> reigne) in his Expoſition of <hi>Aggens c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2. 3. where he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines thus. <q>
                        <hi>IT IS POPISH TO BELEEVE that which the Biſhops doe teach:</hi> That place to be more holy then the reſt which they have hallowed, as they ſay, with their conjured water, Croſſings, Cenſings, Proceſſions, &amp;c. But bleſſed be that God our Lord which by the light of his Word doth confound all ſuch wicked and fond fantaſies, which they deviſe to fill their bellies and maintaine their Authority by. Although theſe Ceremonies in the old Law were given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the hardneſſe of the peoples hearts, &amp; to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exerciſed, that they fall not to the Idolatry, of the Gentiles, yet is there no mention of them in the New Teſtament, nor yet commanded now, either to us or them, but forbidden to be uſed of all both of us and them. We be no longer under ſhaddowes, but under the truth, Chriſt

                  <p>From theſe Authorities they concluded; the Arch-biſhops conſecration of Churches (eſpecially of this but newly repaired) to be both Popiſh and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, by the received Doctrine, Writers of our Church, and Statutes of our Realm, which abandon and condemne the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding this Arch-Biſhop was ſo zealouſly bent upon it, that he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in the conſecration of <hi>Creed-Church,</hi> but proceeded further to conſecrate Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church in the fields; where the caſe ſtood thus:</p>
                  <p>The Church of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> being in decay, was re-edified and part of it new built and finiſhed in Biſhop <hi>Mountaines</hi> time, Divine Service, Preaching, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration <note place="margin">His Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church.</note> of the Sacraments after its repaire having been uſed therein for 3. or 4. yeares ſpace together without any exceptions: After which Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> being advanced to the Biſhoprick of <hi>London,</hi> by a ſolemn proceſſe under his Epiſcopall ſeal interdicted this Church, and ſuſpended Divine Service, Sermons, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it for 2. or 3. weeks together, ſo as the Church doores were ſhut up even on Lords Dayes, and the Pariſhoners forced to repair to other Churches, onely becauſe the Church had not been re-conſecrated after its reparation: ſome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh oppoſed the conſecration of it in reſpect of the charge and Fees, but at laſt they were inforced by the Biſhop to ſubmit, elſe they muſt have no Divine Service, Sermons, nor Sacraments in it, after all their coſts beſtowed thereon: Whereupon the Biſhop the very next Lords Day after he had conſecrated <hi>Creed</hi> Church, repaired to Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church, and there conſecrated it in the ſelf-ſame manner, with the ſelf-ſame geſtures, bowings, prayers, ceremonies, as he conſecrated <hi>Creed</hi> Church: After which he likewiſe conſecrated the Church-yard, and a peece of ground which was bought and added to it; for conſecration whereof the Pariſh paid ten pound

fees to the Biſhop himſelf, to wit, 5 l. for conſecrating the Church, and 5 l. for hallowing the Churchyard, beſides fees to his Officers, and a Dinner which coſt the Pariſh near 30 l. more; all which was atteſted upon oath, by Maſter <hi>Hope,</hi> and ſome others: and likewiſe proved by the Archbiſhops own <hi>Diary,</hi> wherein he regiſtred this ſpeciall memoriall of this Conſecration with his owne hand, <hi>Sunday January</hi> 20. 1630. <hi>I conſecrated the Church of S.</hi> Gyles <hi>in the Fields.</hi>

                  <p>Upon which evidence the Committee of the Commons made theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Secondly, that he and his Officers extorted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable exceſſive fees from the Pariſh beſides their coſtly Dinner, for this pious work on the Lords day; himſelf taking no leſſe then 10 l. fees for conſecrating the Church and Churchyard, which is <hi>direct Symonie by the</hi>

                     <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion by the Commonlaw, there being no fees due by either law for ſuch a Conſecration. Thirdly, that this Prelate was ſo wilfull and ſuperſtitious in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, that God muſt loſe his publick worſhip in this Church, and the whole Pariſh the uſe of it for the benefit of their ſoules, for two or three whole weeks du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring its interdiction, rather then this Prelate not enjoy his popiſh ends &amp; exorbitant fees for the re-conſecration of it.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Iuly</hi> 17. 1632. he conſecrated another Church in Middleſex, in the ſame manner as he had done the former two: of which he makes this ſpeciall <hi>Memento</hi> in his own <hi>Diary: Iuly</hi> 17. 1632. <hi>I conſecrated the Church at</hi> Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Magna, <hi>in Middleſex, built by Sir</hi> John Wolſtenham.</p>
                  <p>As this Arch-prelate was thus ſuperſtitiouſly and popiſhly active in conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Churches, ſo likewiſe in conſecrating Chappels, for which theſe inſtances were produced.</p>

                  <p>Certainely were there no other Evidence to prove this Archbiſhop a direct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt in heart and practiſe, but the conſecration and Popiſh furniture of his Chappell with that forementioned in the windowes at <hi>Lambeth</hi> it were aboundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſatisfie all the world, and the greateſt Patriots of his ſincerity to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; but we ſhall proceed to further proofes.</p>
                  <p>The next Chappell we finde the Archbiſhop conſecrated, was the Chappell at <hi>Hamer-Smith;</hi> of which there was this memoriall read out of his Dairy <hi>June.</hi> 7. 1631. <hi>Tueſday J conſecrated the Chappell of Hamer-Smith;</hi> It was done with like Popiſh Ceremonies as he uſed at Creed-Church; and Sr. <hi>Nicholas Criſpe</hi> ſetting two great ſilver Flagons with wine on the Communion Table when the Chappell was conſecrated, without any intent to beſtow them on the Chappell; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop told him after the <hi>conſecration they were now dedicated unto God, and it would be Sacriledge for him to commit them to his private uſe againe:</hi> and ſo enforced him to beſtow them on the Chappell.</p>
                  <p>There was great ſuite made to the Biſhop, and a compoſition with Dr. <hi>Cluet</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Fulham</hi> and his ſucceſſors, before way would be given by him, for the building of this Chappell of caſe. At laſt all parties being agreed, and proviſions made to build the Chappell; the Archbiſhop ſolemnly layd and conſecrated the firſt ſtone thereof, uſing the enſuing praier at its conſecration; as was proved by his <hi>Booke of Praiers</hi> written with his owne hand (ſeaſed by <hi>Mr. Prynne</hi> in his Chamber at the Tower) where page 220. was written in the Margent. <hi>Hamer-Smith Chappell March</hi> 11. 1629. with this ſuperſcription and Praier.</p>

Wherein he juſtifies the conſecrating of Churches, Chappels, and the foundation-ſtone thereof, by the Biſhop in theſe words: <hi>The Biſhop with Prayer is to lay the firſt ſtone of a Church or Monaſtary, and lift up his hands to heaven, and conſecrate the place to God by prayer, and there erect the ſymbole of our Salvation, we mean the venerable and truely precious Rood. That this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of laying the firſt ſtone, hath been of ancient uſe in the Greeke Church, may be obſerved out of their</hi> Euchologue, <hi>where it is ſaid, That the Biſhop after ſome other Rites performed, ſtanding in the place where the holy Altar ſhall be ſet, ſaith a prayer, which being ended he giveth the</hi> Ita miſſa eſt, <hi>and then taking up one of the ſtones, and having cut a croſſe upon it himſelfe with his own hands layeth it upon the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke; then he pronounceth the, &amp;c. and ſo the workemen begin the building.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1636. there was a great conteſtation between the Arch-biſhop and the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> heard before his Majeſty and his Privy Councell at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, whether the Archbiſhop meerly as Metropolitan, or the King alone as King and founder of the Univerſity ſhould have the Viſitation thereof: where it was ruled for the Arch-biſhop, againſt the King and Univerſity. At which time the Arch-biſhop declared, that one principall cauſe why he deſired to viſit the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was, becauſe there were ſome Chappels belonging to Colledges where Divine Service had been uſed, and the Sacrament adminiſtred divers years, though they were never conſecrated by any Biſhop; as namely <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Speeds Hiſt.</hi> of Great Britain. <hi>p.</hi> 1067 1068.</note>

                  <p>And is it not then a far greater madneſſe, ſuperſtition, and ridiculous frenzie for this domineering Arch-Prelate to deem theſe two Chappels prophane places, unfit to adminiſter the Sacraments, and celebrate divine Service in, becauſe never yet conſecrated by a Biſhop, not onely after three, but almoſt three-ſcore yeares uſe and practiſe of divine Service, Sermons, Sacraments in them?

                  <p>The Scottiſh troubles, it ſeems, prevented his conſecration of theſe Chappels, which were ſufficiently hallowed before by the Divine Duties exerciſed in them. The laſt Chappell we finde conſecrated, was that in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> which

                           <hi>of the Dedications of Churches, commonly called the Wakes; and it ſeemes the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Aſſiize formerly made an Order to prohibit them, and cauſed it to be publiſhed in ſome or moſt of the Churches there by the Miniſter, without my Lord the Biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or privity. The pretence of this hath been, that ſome diſorders derogatory from Gods ſervice and the Government of the Common-wealth are committed at thoſe times: by which argument, any thing that is abuſed may be quite taken away. It ſeemes there hath been ſome heate ſtrucke in the Countrey about this, by the carriage of the Lord Chiefe Juſtice</hi> Richardſon, <hi>at the two laſt Aſſizes, especially the laſt, with which His Majeſty is not well pleaſed. And for the preventing of outrages, or diſorders at thoſe Feaſts, no man can be more carefull than His Majeſty; but He conceives, and that very rightly, that all theſe may and ought to be prevented by the care of the Juſtices of Peace, and not leave the Feaſts themſelves to be kept, for the Neighbourly meetings and Recreations of the people, of which he would not have them debarred under any fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilous pretences.

                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>MOſt Reverend Father in God, and my very Honourable good Lord, my humble ſervice preſented to your Grace. I received upon the 12th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> laſt, a Letter from your Grace, dated the 4th of the ſame Moneth; wherein your Grace hath required me by a commandment from His Majeſty, to ſend for ſome of the graveſt of my Clergie, and ſuch as ſtand beſt affected to the Church and Government, out of the ſeverall parts of my Dioceſſe, and by them to inform my ſelfe, how the annuall Feaſts of the Dedications of their Churches have beene kept within their ſeverall Pariſhes this laſt yeare, and how free they have beene from diſorders. Now according to His Majeſties pleaſure and Commandment herein, preſently after receipt of your Graces Letter, I ſent forth my Letters into all the ſeveral Deaneries within my Dioceſſe, for ſome of the better* ſort of Clergy out of every Diviſion, part and corner of <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> to come unto me, and ſo <note place="margin">They were the deboyſteſt and worſt in the Country;</note> they did upon certaine dayes appointed by me; And I finde by the ſeverall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of threeſcore and twelve Miniſters, Benificed men, in whoſe Pariſhes theſe Feaſts are kept, as followeth. Firſt, that they have been kept not onely this laſt yeare, but alſo for many years before, as long as they have lived in their ſeverall Pariſhes, without any diſorders. Secondly, that upon the Feaſt dayes, (which are
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61245:75"/>
for the moſt part every where upon Sundayes) the Service of the Church hath bin more ſolemnly performed, and the Church hath bin better frequented, both in the Forenoons, and in the Afternoons, than upon any Sunday in the yeare. Thirdly, that they have not known or heard of any diſorders in the Neighbouring Towns, where the like Feaſts are kept. Fourthly, that the people do very much deſire the continuance of thoſe Feaſts. Laſtly, that all theſe Miniſters are of opinion, that it is fit and convenient theſe Feaſt dayes ſhould be continued, for a memoriall of the Dedications of their ſeverall Churches, for the civilizing of people, for their lawfull Recreations, for the compoſing of differences by occaſion of the meeting of friends, for the increaſe of love and unity, as being Feaſts of Charity, for the reliefe of the poore, the richer ſort keeping then in a manner open houſe, and for many other reaſons.</p>
                        <p>This is the ſumme of their ſeverall free and voluntary Anſwers, which I have in writing under their owne hands, and will be ready to ſhew if they be required: which courſe I tooke, becauſe it might not bee given our hereafter by thoſe who condemne theſe Feaſts, that I did miſtake either their words, or their meaning. And I doe verily believe, that if I had ſent for an hundred more of the Clergie within my Dioceſſe, I ſhould have received the ſame Anſwer from them all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not one of thoſe Miniſters who appeared before me (although they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all of them as yet ſtrangers unto mee, and moſt of them ſtrangers one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) varied in the ſubſtance of his Anſwer from the reſt; nay moſt of them agree in their very phraſes and words, and yet all of them gave their Anſwers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally. So that I may liken theſe ſeventy and two Miniſters in this matter, unto the <hi>Septuag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>nt,</hi> or ſeventy two Interpreters, who agreed ſo ſoone in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> of the old Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>Now as I have made a true report of the Anſwers of theſe Miniſters, ſo I deſire to ſet downe ſome obſervations of mine owne, which I have collected out of their Anſwers.</p>
                        <p>I finde that throughout <hi>Somerſesſhire,</hi> there are not only Feaſts of Dedication, but alſo in many places Church-ales, Clerkes-ales, and Bid-ales. The Feaſts of Dedications are more generall and generally they are called Feaſt-dayes, but in divers places they are call'd Revell-dayes, they are not knowne amongſt the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people by the name of Feaſts of Dedication; but all Schollers acknowledge them to be in the memory of their ſeverall Dedications, and ſome Miniſters of late have taught them ſo: Divers Churches here are Dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and they are kept upon Trinity Sunday; but almoſt all thoſe Feaſts which are kept in memory of the Dedication of Churches unto Saints, are kept upon ſome Sundayes, either before or after the Saints dayes; becauſe (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) on the weeke dayes the people have not had leiſure to celebrate theſe Feaſts. And I finde that almoſt all the Feaſts of Dedication are kept in the Summer time, betweene our <hi>Lady-day</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> becauſe that time of the yeare is moſt convenient for the meeting of Friends from all places; in ſome places they have ſolemne Sermons Preach't by Divines of good note, and alſo Communions upon their Feaſt dayes; and in one place in this County, the Pariſh holds Land by their Feaſt: And one Miniſter (who hath been a great Travailer) hath inſerted in his anſwer, that in ſome reformed Churches, namely in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> theſe Feaſts of Dedication are obſerved.</p>
                        <p>I finde alſo that the people generally would by no meanes have theſe Feaſts ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, for when the Conſtables of ſome Pariſhes came from the Aſſizes about two years agoe, and told their neighbours that the Judges would put down theſe Feaſts, they anſwered, that it was very hard if they could not entertain their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and friends once in a yeare, to praiſe God for his Bleſſings, and to pray for the Kings Majeſty, under whoſe happy Government they enjoyed peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and they ſayd, they would endure the Judges penalties, father than they would breake off their Feaſt dayes. It is found alſo true by experience, that many
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61245:75"/>
Suits in Law have bin taken up at theſe Feaſts by mediation of friends, which could not have bin ſo ſoone ended in <hi>Weſtminster</hi> Hall.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I finde that the chiefeſt cauſe of the diſlike of theſe Feaſts amongſt the Preciſer ſort is, becaoſe they are kept upon Sundayes, which they never call but Sabbath dayes, upon which they would have no manner of Recreation, nay, <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> neither Roſt, nor Sod: And ſome of the Miniſters who were with me have inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſſed, that if the people ſhould not have their honeſt and lawfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations upon Sundayes after evening Prayer, they would go either into tipling houſes, and there upon their Ale-benches talke of matters of the Church or State, or elſe into Conventicles.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Church-ales, I finde, that in ſome places the people have bin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to leave them off, in other places they have bin put down by the Judges <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and Juſtices, ſo that now there are very few of them left: but yet I finde, that by Church-ales heretofore many poore Pariſhes have caſt their Bells, repaired their Towers, beautified their Churches, and raiſed ſtocks for the poore; and not by the ſins of the people (as ſome Humouriſts have ſayd:) but by the Benevolence of people at their honeſt and harmleſſe ſports and paſtimes; at which there hath not bin obſerved ſo much diſorder, as is commonly at Fairs and Markets.</p>
                        <p>Touching Clerke-ales (which are leſſer Church-ales) for the better maintenance of Pariſh Clerks, they have bin uſed (untill of late) in divers places, and there was great reaſon for them; for in poore Countrey Pariſhes, where the wages of the Clerke is very ſmall, the people thinking it unfit that the Clerke ſhould duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at Church, and loſe by his office, were wont to ſend him in Proviſion, and then feaſt with him, and give him more liberality then their quarterly payments would amount unto in many years. And ſince theſe have bin put down, ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have complained unto me, that they are afrayd they ſhall have no Pariſh Clerks for want of maintenance for them.</p>
                        <p>There is another kinde of publique meeting call'd a Bid-ale, when an honeſt man decayed in his eſtate, is ſet up again by the liberall Benevolence and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of friends at a Feaſt, but this is layd aſide almoſt in euery place.</p>
                        <p>But I feare I have wearied your Grace with this impertinent diſcourſe of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Feaſts: yet while I am in this diſcourſe of Feaſts, I may not forget one thing wherein I have bin deſired by a grave and learned Divine dwelling neere <hi>Taunton</hi> to move your Grace, and that is, that your Grace would be a means that the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their Lent Circuit might not ſit and condemne people on that great Feaſt day of the <hi>Annunciation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſo having carefully endeavoured to performe His Majeſties Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I caſt my ſelfe down at His Majeſties feet, humbly begging His gracious pardon if I have erred in any point: And I deſire no longer to live, than I may be able to do God, and His Majeſty ſervice in the Church; which although other Biſhops can performe with greater abilities than my ſelfe, yet none ſhall perform the ſame with more readineſſe, diligence, and fidelity than I will doe: And ſo praying for the continance of your Graces health and happineſſe, I leave your Grace to Gods bleſſed Protection, and humbly reſt,</p>

                  <p>CAnterbury, <hi>See that Our Declaration concerning Recreations on the Lords day after Evening Prayer, be Printed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all theſe Premiſed evidences, it is moſt apparent, that the Archbiſhop was the principall Actor in the publication of this Licentious Book, to Gods, and his Majeſties diſhonour, which we ſhal further evidence by this writing under his owne hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Declaration concerning Lawfull ſports on the Lords day, His Majeſty Commanded me to ſe it Printed. The motives to it were,</hi> 1. <hi>A generall and ſuperſtitious opinion conceived of that day.</hi> 2. <hi>A Booke ſet out by</hi> Theophilus Brabourne, 1628. <hi>Iudaiſme upon Chriſtian principles, and perverted many.</hi> 3. <hi>A great diſtemper in Somerſet-ſhire, upon the forbiding of the wakes, in the ſowerneſſe of this opinion; an Act of a Iudge that rid that Circuit, March.</hi> 15. 1627. <hi>And followed by another.</hi> 1630. <hi>And his Majeſty troubled with Petitions, and motions by ſome cheife men of that county on both ſides.</hi> 4. <hi>His Royall Fathers example upon the like occaſions in Lancaſhire</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the publiſhing of this Declaration, the Lord <hi>Richardſon</hi> returning from his Circuit, was by the Archbiſhops means convented before the King and Lords at the Councell Table, about the forementioned Paſſages in his Charge, in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the order againſt Wakes, according to his duty, and for revoking it in ſuch a ſlight manner, <hi>as much as in him lay;</hi> for which he was ſo ſhaken up by the Archbiſhop, that comming very dejectedly with tears in his eyes out of the Councel Chamber, the Earle of <hi>Derſet</hi> ſeeing him in ſuch a ſad condition, and demaunding him how he did? he anſwered, <hi>Very ill my Lord for I am like to bee choaked with the Archbiſhops Lawn-ſleeves.</hi> And for this cauſe alone, (as he and others conceived) he was by the Archbiſhops means (to his great griefe and loſſe) put from Riding the Weſterne, and enforced to Ride the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Circuit, reputed the meaneſt of all others, which no Chiefe Iuſtice, but the puny Iudge, or Serjeants only uſed to Ride; notwithſtanding the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> and others earneſtly moved His Majeſty, that he might ride ſome other Circuit.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Archbiſhop intending to make this <hi>Declaration for Sports,</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to inſnare; ſuſpend ſilence, and root out all conſcientious, preaching Miniſters throughout the Realm, by degrees the better to uſher in Popery, Ignorance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe; enjoyned all Miniſters to read this Declaration perſonally in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in time of Divine Service; &amp; ſuch who out of conſcience refuſed to read it were by the Archbiſhops own ſpeciall direction ſuſpended from their office and Benefice, Excommunicated, vexed in the High-commiſſion and ſome of them there ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and deprived of their livings for this pretended crime, though againſt no Law or Canon of God or man; for proofe whereof, theſe enſuing teſtimonies were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent</hi> atteſted upon Oath, that when he was appointed by the Archbiſhop as his Vicar Generall, to Viſit within the Dioceſſe of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Archbiſhop himſelfe gave him a ſpeciall charge to convent all Miniſters before him, who would not read the <hi>Booke for sports on the Lords day,</hi> and to ſuſpend
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61245:78"/>
them for it; and that he gave them particular order, by name to ſuſpend, Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> Maſter <hi>Player,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> three eminent preaching Miniſters in <hi>Kent,</hi> for not <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Culmers.</hi> Mr. <hi>Players,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons caſes.</hi>
                     </note> reading the ſayd Booke of Sports: Whereupon, he did (much againſt his will and judgement) ſuſpend them all <hi>ab Officio, &amp; Beneficio,</hi> and forced ſome of them to allow twenty pound a peice or more, to Officiate the Cure during their ſuſpenſion. After which, he received another ſpeciall command from the Archbiſhop, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> for the ſelfe-ſame cauſe, whereupon he did accordingly ſuſpend him.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Richard Culmer,</hi> depoſed at the Lords Barre upon oath, that he being Miniſter of <hi>Goodneſton</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Player</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Kenning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Hieron</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Hornhill</hi> in the ſaid County, they were all three convented by the Archbiſhops direction before Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent,</hi> for not reading the Booke for Lords-day ſports, and after that, all three of them ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from their Miniſtry and Livings in the Archbiſhops Conſiſtory, for the ſame. Whereupon, they ſoone after repaired to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to the Archbiſhop, and there joyntly Petitioned him for Abſolution from this unjuſt Suſpenſion; who reading their Petition, and underſtanding the cauſe of their ſuſpenſion, for not reading that unwarrantable Declaration, the Archbiſhop gave them this peremptory Anſwer; <hi>If you know not how to obey, I know not how to grant;</hi> whereupon they continued thus ſuſpended about three whole yeares and ſeven Moneths, not being permitted to preach or inſtruct their people, to their great griefe, and the profits of their Livings were ſequeſtred towards the maintenance of Deboiſt unedifying Curates, who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome preached. And though this Deponent did divers times afterwards Petition the ſaid Archbiſhop to take off his ſuſpenſion, yet he refuſed to do it, calling him refractory fellow, and ſaying, it ſhould continue; and ſo it did, he being not only deprived of his Miniſtry, but alſo of all the profits of his Living, having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his Wife, and 7. ſmall Children to provide for; which ſuſpenſion and ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration continued upon him till the <hi>Scotts</hi> comming in, and then the Archbiſhop Abſolved him, more out of feare of the <hi>Scots,</hi> than good will; ſo as hee might juſtly ſay, <hi>Gramercy good Scott,</hi> for his liberty.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Thomas Wilſon</hi> a godly learned Miniſter (now of the Aſſembly) depoſed <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Thomas VVilſons caſe.</hi>
                     </note> at the Barre; that the Archbiſhop himſelfe ſent for him to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, whether he had publikely read the Booke of Sports in the Church? to which he anſwered, no; whereupon the Archbiſhop replied; <hi>I Suspend you for ever from your office and Benefice till you read it:</hi> whereupon hee was ſuſpended, and his Living ſequeſtred for foure years ſpace. After which, he was brought into the high-Commiſſion at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> by the Archbiſhops means, and there Articled againſt for not reading the ſaid Booke, to his great coſt and vexation.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> atteſted, that Mr. <hi>Wrath,</hi> and M. <hi>Erbery,</hi> were brought up out of <hi>Wales,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Iones</hi> out of <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> and divers others from other <note place="margin">Mr <hi>VVraths.</hi> Mr. <hi>Erberies.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iones caſes.</hi>

                     <hi>very many places of the Dioceſſe, having therefore about</hi> 60. <hi>Bookes at hand, I cauſed them to bee propoſed to ſuch perſons, as I had moſt doubt of, but many of them refuſed to publiſh the ſame, and were ſuſpended for their refuſall: yet divers of them preſently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed conformity, and ſo were abſolved. So that now in the whole Dioceſſe (conſiſting of about</hi> 1500. <hi>Clergie men) there are not paſſing twice</hi> 15. <hi>Excommunicated or ſuſpended; whereof, ſome ſo ſtand for contumacie in not appearing at the Viſitation and Synod, and ſtill refuſe to ſubmit, ſome for obſtinate denying to publiſh the Kings Declaration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Title and anſwer of which it is moſt evident; That the Archbiſh. ſent ſeverall <hi>Articles of Inſtructions</hi> in his Majeſties name, though made by himſelfe, to all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of his Province, who were to return an Annuall account of them unto him in writing; whereof this was one: <hi>That they ſhould inquire, whether the Declaration for ſports had beene publiſhed in every pariſh Church by the Miniſter? and directed them to excommunicate or ſuspend all ſuch who refuſed to read it.</hi> Which how barbarouſly and unchriſtianly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was executed in moſt places, needs no further evidence then that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced, and what all men know.</p>
                  <p>Now wee appeale to all Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, from Chriſts Nativity till this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, whether there was ever ſuch a monſtrous impiety or perſecution as this heard of in the Chriſtian world, that Archbiſhops, and Biſhops (who profeſſe themſelves the very <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Pillars of Religion,)</hi> ſhould thus impiouſly: Firſt of

To ſuſpend, ſequeſter, excommunicate, cenſure, perſecute, deprive, even hundreds of Godly Miniſters as capitall Offenders, for refuſing (meerely out of Conſcience towards God, and love to their owne and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſoules,) to contribute their voyces or perſonal aſſiſtances to ſuch a publication, and againſt all Law, Juſtice, Piety, to ſilence Miniſters three or foure yeares together from preaching Gods Word to their people, for the ſalvation of their ſoules according to their duties becauſe they durſt not publiſh this Declaration for <hi>Lords-Day sports</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to further the damnation of their ſoules, both againſt their duties and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.

to the World, <hi>in A neceſſary Introduction to the History of the Archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury his Tryall,</hi> by ſundry forraigne and domeſtick evidences: how farre this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop was an Arch-agent in promoting this conſpiracie in point of Doctrinall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and by what Jeſuiticall Policies and degrees he proceeded in it, comes now in Order to bee proved; wherein wee ſhall ſteare the courſe of our evidence, according to the compaſſe and method of his proceedings.</p>
                  <p>It is the common Policy of all wiſe experienced Commanders, when they intend to undermine any ſtrong well-fortified defenſible Fortreſſe, not deſperately to begin their Mines at the very foundation of the Workes at firſt, for feare of diſcovery, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, prevention, but at a competent diſtance, and then to make their approaches by inſenſible degrees, till at laſt they have undermined, or blowne up the very Walls and Workes themſelves; The ſelfe-ſame Policy was uſed by this <hi>Arch-Roman Ingineer</hi> to undermine and blow up our eſtabliſhed Religion: Hee had learnt from Abbot <hi>Bernard: A minimis incipiunt, qui in maxima proruunt;</hi> and from <note n="*" place="margin">De Ordine Vitae lib.</note>

To this purpoſe combining with the Jeſuites, &amp; proſecuting their very method to ruine our Religion, he firſt bent all his force &amp; induſtry to introduce <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> (the moſt plauſible leſſe diſcernible <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> Doctrinall part of Popery, yet a ready Jeſuiticall Poſterne to let in all the reſt) and that under a ſpecious pretence of oppoſing <hi>Puritaniſme</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> onely, againſt whom he laboured to engage ſome Prelates, and the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> firſt, then next His Majeſtie.

the <hi>Anti-Arminian</hi> truths and received Doctrines of our Church came to be totally ſilenced, ſuppreſſed in Preſſe, Pulpit, Schooles, Vniverſities, and the <hi>Arminian Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> found free paſſage in them all without any or very little oppoſition; this being the higheſt conqueſt the <hi>Arminian faction</hi> could aſpire to, yea more then they could hope for in ſo ſhort a ſpace.

                     <p>THe next feare is the daily growth and ſpreading of the <hi>Arminian</hi> faction, called, a cunning way to bring in Popery. But We hold this charge as great a wrong to Our ſelfe and Our Government, as the former: For our People muſt not bee taught by a Parliament Remonſtrance, or any other way, that We are ſo ignorant of Truth, or ſo careleſſe of the profeſſion of it, that any opinion, or faction, or what <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> ever it be called, ſhould thruſt it ſelfe ſo far &amp; ſo faſt into Our Kingdomes, without Our knowledge of it: This is a meere dreame of them that wake, and would make Our Loyall and loving People thinke, We ſleepe the while. In this charge there is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61245:85"/>
great wrong done to two eminent Prelates, that attend Our Perſon; for they are accuſed without producing any the leaſt ſhew or ſhaddow of proofe againſt them; and ſhould they or any other attempt Innovation of Religion, either by that open or any cunning way, we ſhould quickly take other order with them, and not ſtay for Your Remonſtrance.</p>
                     <p>To helpe on this, Our People are made believe there is a reſtraint of Bookes, Orthodoxall. But wee are ſure ſince the late Parliament began, ſome whom the Remonſtrance calls Orthodox, have aſſumed to themſelves an unſufferable liberty in printing. Our Proclamation commanded a reſtraint on both ſides, till the paſſions <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> of men might ſubſide and calme, and had this beene obeyed as it ought, wee had not now been toſſed in this tempeſt, As for any diſtreſſing or diſcountenancing of good Preachers, Wee know there is none, if they be, as they are called good: But Our good people ſhall never want that ſpirituall comfort which is due unto them, And for the preferments which VVee beſtow, Wee have ever made it our great care to give them as rewards of deſert and paines: but as the preferments are ours ſo will wee bee Judge of the deſert our ſelfe, and not bee taught by a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance.</p>

                  <p>Firſt he produced to him, &amp; now to the Lords, the <hi>Originall printed Copy of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid anſwer, made unto a certaine Letter, &amp;c.</hi> which had all the ſymptoms of an <hi>unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Pamphlet;</hi> there being neither Authors, nor Printers name, nor place where, nor yeare when it was printed to be found in the Title, or any other part of the Book, nor the leaſt mention where, or by whom it was to be ſold.

                  <p>After this the Archbiſhops Chaplaine Doctor <hi>Haywood</hi> on the 26. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1634 licenſed Booke intituled, <hi>Collectiones Theologica,</hi> writ by <hi>Thomas Chune,</hi> and Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> himſelfe, in which hee juſtified the <hi>Arminian</hi> Errors, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, whereof there were two Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in one yeare, yet neither the Author nor Booke once queſtioned, though pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely complained of by Doctor <hi>Baſtwicke,</hi> at his Cenſure in the High-Commiſſion, where the <hi>Archb.</hi> openly juſtified it.

                     <hi>In this Evidence there are foure things very remarkable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FIrſt, That this Biſhop was ſo ſhameleſſe as to profeſſe in open Court, that in this, Proſecution of Maſter <hi>Gellibrand,</hi> hee was but the Queenes and Papiſts Agent <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> proceeding thus againſt him at their ſpeciall requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he was extraordinary violent, if not extreamely irregular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in this proſecution, making no Conſcience to ruine a Learned Pious Proteſtant, without any juſt Cauſe, to pleaſure the Papiſts, notwithſtanding hee was generally acquitted by the Court.</p>
                  <p>3ly. That when he could not have his will of this innocent Gentleman one way, he meditared preſent revenge another way &amp; proclamed it in open Court, charging him with raiſing a Faction in the High-Commiſſion Court, when as his fellow Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners would not concur with him in his Factious proſecution to gratifie the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>4ly. That hee bare an extraordinary affection to Popiſh, but an extreame inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate malice to true Proteſtant Saints and Martyers, becauſe hee was ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt Mr. <hi>Gillibrand</hi> and his Almanacke onely for omitting the names of falſe Popiſh Saints and Martyres, and placing the names of our reall Proteſtant Martyres in their ſtead: the truth whereof was then further manifeſted at the Bar

                  <p>We ſhall now proceed to other evidence. About the latter end of the yeare 1636. Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> being certainly informed of the Archbiſhops intention to procure a <hi>Decree in Starchamber</hi> prohibiting the reprinting of all old Bookes of Divinity unleſſe they were firſt reviewed, purged, new Licenced by his Chaplaines, or Agents, before this Decree was ratified, ſent for <hi>Michael Spark</hi> Senior and perſwaded him to reprint ſome three or foure old Bookes, of ſpeciall uſe, <hi>againſt Popery,</hi> ere this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> ſhould paſſe; by name, <hi>Thomas Beacons Diſplay of the Popiſh Maſſe,</hi> and his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Rome</hi> (as being then moſt ſeaſonable &amp; oppoſite to the Archbiſhops Romiſh deſignes) formerly printed <hi>cum privilegio,</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reigne, <hi>An.</hi> 1560. yea dedicated <hi>to all the Biſhops of England,</hi> and highly approved by them, Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he cauſed Miſtreſſe <hi>Anne Griffin</hi> to begge leave of the <hi>Company of Stationers</hi> (who were owners of thoſe Coppies) to reprint theſe Bookes, which being granted; ſhe printed off his <hi>Diſplay of the Popiſh Maſſe,</hi> and began to Print his <hi>Reliques of Rome.</hi> No ſooner was the firſt of them publiſhed abroad, but a Papiſt ſeeing one of them newly printed, lying to be ſold in a Book-ſellers ſhop in <hi>Paules Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard,</hi> reading the Title thereof, grew very angry at the Booke (being a very ſolid learned <hi>Treatiſe against the Popiſh Maſſe,</hi> with the Ceremonies accompaning it) and ſaid; <hi>hee wondered much that the Archbiſhop would ſuffer ſuch Bookes to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Age:</hi> adding, <hi>that perchance he knew not of it, and therefore he would goe</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61245:96"/>
morning the Archbiſhop called in this Booke very ſtrictly, ſending his Purſevants and Officers to ſeize on all of them they could meete with, and underſtanding that Miſtreſſe <hi>Griffin</hi> printed it, he ſent for her to <hi>Lambheth, where he in a very angry manner demanded of her, why ſhe did reprint this book againſt the Maſſe NOW, above all other times, &amp; whether ſhe could find no other time but this to print it? To which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe did it for want of other work to imploy her ſervants, who elſe muſt ſit ſtill, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could get no good New bookes Licenced.</hi> Then he demanded of her, <hi>how ſhee durſt reprint it without a new Licenſe?</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>She did it by leave of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Stationers, and knew of no order to the contrary.</hi> After which he threatned her with the high Commiſſion, and told her, <hi>that if ſhe printed any more old Books though formerly licenſed, without a review and new licenſing of them by his Chaplaines, he would put downe her printing Houſe, and ſhe ſhould never print againe,</hi> though there was then no Order to the contrary; whereupon ſhe durſt not proceed to print his <hi>Reliques of Rome,</hi> but gave it over. All which was fully proved by the ſeverall Oathes of Mr. <hi>Prynne, Michaell Spark ſenior,</hi> &amp; <hi>Anne Griffin:</hi> ſuch an Arch-favourer of Popery was this Prelate then grown, that he would not permit this Treatiſe againſt the verry Popiſh Maſſe it ſelfe to be reprinted, though formerly oft printed <hi>cum Privilegio,</hi> growes angry at the printing of it, cauſeth it preſently to be ſuppreſſed upon a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſte Information, and thus checks the Printer. Was not Popery grown to a ſtrong head among us, when not ſo much as one ſmall old Booke <hi>againſt the Maſſe and Idolatry of it,</hi> might paſſe the Preſſe, but it muſt preſently be ſuppreſſed by this Arch biſhops ſpeciall command, and the Printer thus threatned for it? Yet he forſooth (if wee dare believe his Proteſtations) was then as averſe from, as great an Enemy to Popery, as any mortall breathing.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, a Booke intituled, <hi>The Palſegraves Religion,</hi> containing the <hi>Faith and Confeſſion of the Churches of the Palatinate,</hi> (formerly printed, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and then reprinted in Engliſh,) was called in and ſuppreſſed by this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops order, becauſe it over-boldly refuted <hi>ſome points of Popery and Arminianiſme</hi> as was Atteſted by the Oathes of Maſter <hi>Pryune</hi> and <hi>Michaell Sparke</hi> Senior.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Walley,</hi> Clerke of Stationers Hall and Maſter <hi>Downes</hi> depoſed, that after the Decree for printing was made, there were divers old Bookes againſt Popery for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Licenced, (as the Booke of <hi>Martyres,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Jewells</hi> Workes, ſome parts of Doctor <hi>Willets</hi> Workes and others) which the Archbiſhops and Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> Chaplaines refuſed to new Licenſe; where upon they repaired to Sir <hi>Iohn Bramſton</hi> then Lord chiefe Juſtice, and deſired leave from him, <hi>that good Bookes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly licenced and printed, might be reprinted without new Licence, elſe they ſhould be undone for want of Bookes, ſeeing they could not procure theſe Chaplaines to Licenſe any good Bookes whether old or new. Who anſwered them, that he could do nothing in it but they muſt go and attend the Archbiſhop, who had the chiefe hand in making this Decree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>John Vicars</hi> Schoole-Maſter of Chriſt-Church ſoone after this Decree, repaired to Doctor <hi>Baker</hi> (the Archbiſhops great Creature, Houſe-hold Chaplaine to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London,)</hi> for a New licenſe of his <hi>History of the Gunpouder Treaſon,</hi> formerly printed by <hi>Licenſe,</hi> which he had ſince enlarged with ſome pertinent Additions: But Doctor <hi>Baker</hi> abſolutely refuſed to Licence it: Maſter <hi>Vicars</hi> admiring at it; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him the reaſon why he would not licenſe a Booke of ſuch a ſubject as this againſt the Gun-pouder Treaſon, an act ſo odious and deteſtable? who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, <hi>that we were not ſo angry with the Papiſts now, as we were about</hi> 20. <hi>yeares ſince, and that there was no need of any ſuch Bookes as theſe to exasperate them, there being</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                     <hi>now an endeavour to winne them to us by faireneſſe and mildneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe (with ſundry other inſtances of this kinde which we pretermit) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is moſt apparent; that one principall end of the Archbiſhops uſurping the power of Licenſing Bookes and publiſhing this <hi>Decree</hi> concerning the reſtraint of reprinting any Old Licenſed books againſt Popery, and the groſſeſt errors in it, was, that <hi>Popery</hi> might againe creep in among us by degrees without the leaſt oppoſition or impeachment.</p>

Secondly, As he and his inſtruments prohibited the reprinting of old Orthodox Bookes, ſo they refuſed to Licence ſundry new ones, eſpecially againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme,</hi> ſuppreſſing them when printed by Licence of others: This was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, by the forecited Remonſtrance of the Commons in Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628 by the forementioned Bookes againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> ſuppreſſed and called in by this Archbiſhops means; and by theſe enſuing Depoſitions.

                  <p>Maſter <hi>Henry Burton</hi> depoſed; That he writ a Book againſt <hi>Coſens his Devotions,</hi> which was called in by the Biſhops meanes: after which he compiled and publiſhed another Booke intituled, <hi>The Bayting of the Popes Bull,</hi> licenſed by <hi>Doctor Goade,</hi> for which hee was called before the Councell Table by this Archbiſhops inſtigation who was then preſent ſpake much againſt the Booke, and called it a Libell, although penned and written only againſt the Pope and his ſeditious dangerous Bull. That he printed by lycence, a Book called <hi>A Plea to an Appeale,</hi> in refutation of diverſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and <hi>Arminian</hi> Errors broached by <hi>Mountague</hi> in his <hi>Appello Caſarem,</hi> which Book though licenſed was yet called in and ſuppreſſed by this Biſhops procurement: After which he writ another Booke againſt Popery, Intituled, <hi>The pouring out of the</hi> 7. <hi>Vialls,</hi> for which hee was called into the High Commiſſion Court by the Biſhop, and the Booke ſuppreſſed, That hee likewiſe writ another Booke called, <hi>Babell no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thell</hi> wherin he proved <hi>the Church of Rome no true viſible Church;</hi> for which book this Prelate, being then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> ſent for him by a Purſevant; committed him immediately to priſon in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> contrary to the Petition of Right then newly paſſed, refuſing to accept any bayle, which he tendred, ſuſpended him from his living, proſecuted him in the High Commiſſion, and ſuppreſſed the Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michaell Sparke</hi> Senior, depoſed; That himſelfe, together with <hi>William Iones, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thantell Butter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bowler</hi> and others were committed to priſon and vexed ſeverall times in the High Commiſſion by this Archbiſhops means, only for printing Bookes againſt the Papiſts and Arminians, that the Biſhop and his Chaplaines refuſed to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe diverſe Bookes againſt Popery tendred to them, and purged ſundry others of the chiefe Paſſages againſt Popery, (as we ſhal prove anon) in ſo much that the Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and Printers generally complained, that they could get no good Orthodox Bookes, but only Popiſh and Superſtitious ones licenſed, ſo as they were like to bee undone for want of trading, and that this was the generall complaint of the whole Company; which other Stationers likewiſe affirmed. Particularly, the Biſhop though he pretended much friendſhip to Sir <hi>Humfrey Linde,</hi> that learned Knight, the Author of <hi>Via Tuta,</hi> and <hi>Via Deuia,</hi> which were anſwered by a Jeſuite in a ſcurrilous rayling manner; yet he abſolutely refuſed to licenſe his elaborate Reply thereunto, Intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>A Caſe for the Spectacles,</hi> upon no other pretence, but that Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> was a Lay-man; but in verity, becauſe hee was unwilling to have him vindicate himſelfe and the truth againſt a rayling Jeſuite; of which Injuſtice, Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> and others of his friends: Yet his Chaplaine could licenſe <hi>Chunaeus</hi> his <hi>Collectiones Theologicae,</hi> Dedicated to the Archbiſhop himſelfe, though compiled by a Layman of much inſtriot parts and learning to Sir <hi>Humfrey,</hi> in juſtification of <hi>Popery, A minianiſme</hi> and the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>

It is confeſſed, that private confeſſion unto a Prieſt is of very ancient practiſe in the Church, we urge it and perſwade it <hi>in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis ut ſupra:</hi> we require it in caſe of perplexity, and likewiſe before the receiving of <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> the Lords Supper, according to which Doctrine and Injunction our Biſhops do, or ſhould enquire of it in their Viſitations, touching the uſe and neglect of this ſo good an order.</p>
                              <p>VVhich he thus ſeconds in his <hi>Appeale:</hi> p. 299.

                              <p>Pag. 315. 316. (Informers) it is confeſſed that all Prieſts and none but Prieſts, have power to forgive ſinnes. And is it not ſo confeſſed, when by publique warrant in ordination that power is given unto all Prieſts to doe ſoe in thoſe ſolemne words of Ordination, whoſe ſinnes you forgive, they are forgiven, &amp;c. But with you Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, this Doctrine and practice of the Church is held to bee Popery. And here you inferre, that Prieſts have no more power to do this than Laymen, here you caſt confeſſion upon both one and other; and Laymen may heare it aſwell as a Prieſt, and therefore it is probable, you will not be very preciſe for Abſolution to conferre it on a Layman as well as on a Prieſt, But ſuch abſolution is a part of that Prieſtly power which could not be given by men or Angels, but onely and immediatly by Almighty God himſelfe; a part of that Paramount power which the God of Glory hath inveſted mortall men withall, in which reſpect it hath been ſaid and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the head of the Emperor hath beene ſubjected to the Prieſts hands. Prieſts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have this Commiſſion from Chriſt unto whom he ſaid, As my father ſent me, ſo ſend I you, and receive you the Holy-Ghoſt; whoſe ſinnes you remit, they are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

How ſtifly this Doctrine of Auricular Confeſſion and Prieſts power of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was maintained, not only in print and Pulpit, but in private Conferences by the Archbiſhops Creatures, and Heads of Houſes in the Vniverſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> will appeare by this memorable inſtance. On Sunday the 25. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1637. one Maſter <hi>Adams</hi> preaching publikely in Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church in <hi>Cambridge</hi> before the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie <note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Adams</hi> Caſe.</note> on <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Whoſoever ſinnes yee remit they are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> uſed theſe exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Popiſh aſſertions touching <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of ſinnes to <hi>Prieſts.</hi>

                                    <hi>That a ſpeciall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> unto a <hi>Prieſt</hi> (actually where time or opportunity preſents it ſelfe, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in explicite intention, and reſolution) of all our ſinnes committed after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, ſo farre forth as wee doe remember, is neceſſary unto ſalvation, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fathers, Schoolmen, and almoſt all Antiquity, not onely <hi>Neceſſitate pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti,</hi> but alſo <hi>neceſſitate medij,</hi> ſo that according to the ordinary, or revealed meanes appointed by Chriſt, there can be no ſalvation without the aforeſaid Confeſſion. That Chriſt intended this Confeſſion of our ſinnes in ſpeciall before the Prieſt, for a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary meane to bring us to ſalvation; and to fruſtrate his intention or will though miſconceits, what were it but an argument no leſſe of indiſcretion, then of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impiety? That God being an Enemy to all ſinne, will not pardon any, if we willingly conceale but one in our Confeſſion to the Prieſt. That Confeſſion is as neceſſary to ſalvation, as the Miniſtry of Baptiſme; as neceſſary to ſalvation as meat is to the Body. That ſince Chriſt ordained a Tribunall ſeat of Judgment, where ſins ſhould be remitted or retained at the diſcretion of a lawfull Miniſter, (as was evident by the Text he did) then <hi>WITHOUT DOUBT,</hi> twas his intention that the faithfull ſhould neceſſarily confeſſe all their ſins before the Prieſt, ſo farre forth as they remember, for the purchaſing of his pardon and remiſſion. This he averred to bee (as hee conceived) the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> contained in our Lyturgie. That Confeſſion is a duty of farre more antiquity and extent then ever Popery was, in regard twas inſtituted by our Saviour, practiſed by the Apoſtles, the Holy Fathers and all ſucceeding Ages; and therefore though the Papiſts uſe it, it is not, it cannot be, as ſome would have it, <hi>A point of Popery.</hi> What, ſhall their Errors in ſome Tenets prejudice the Truth in this? What ſhall we refuſe the Grape becauſe the ſtalke is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered? This were a Puritanicall, a Novatian nicity. I never heard of any thing but a fooliſh Cock that ever refuſed a Gemme, though in a Dung-hill: and ſurely thoſe that reject ſo ſpeciall a means of their ſalvation, as Confeſſion is, meerly becauſe tis practiſed by the Papiſts, may not unfit, but very properly <hi>be ſaid to weare his badge.</hi>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61245:100"/>
in the words of the aforeſaid Homily, that it is moſt evident, and plaine, that this Auricular Confeſſion hath not his warrant of Gods Word, &amp; that therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not led with the conſcience thereof, if we with feare and trembling, and with a tru contrite heart, uſe that kind of confeſſion, which God doth command in his word, (namely an unfeighned confeſſion unto Almighty God himſelfe) then doubtleſſe (as he is faithfull and true) hee will forgive us our ſinnes, and make us cleane from all our wickedneſſe, ſo in the caſe of a troubled, or doubtfull conſcience, I do conforme my opinion unto the direction of our Church, which in her Liturgie doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and require thoſe whoſe Conſciences are troubled with any weighty matter to a ſpeciall confeſſion, ſo that they who cannot quiet their owne Conſciences, are to repaire to their owne, or ſome other diſcreet and learned Miniſter of Gods word, to open to them their griefe, that ſo they may receive ſuch ghoſtly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, adviſe and comſort, as their conſciences may be relieved, and by the miniſtery of Gods word, they may receive comfort, and the benefit of abſolution, to the quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Conſcience, and the avoyding of all ſcruple and doubtfullneſſe. But it is againſt true Chriſtian liberty, that any man ſhould be bound to the numbring of his Sinnes, as it hath beene uſed heretofore in times of Ignorance and blindneſſe: This I do acknowledge to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> concerning Confeſſion, and to it I do <hi>ex animo,</hi> ſubſcribe, and am heartily ſory for what ever I have de-livered to the contrary.</p>

                              <p>BY which it is moſt apparent, that the introducing of Auricular Confeſſion was a ſpeciall deſigne of the Archbiſhops, proſecuted by his Emiſſaries and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in all places; who gave him exact accounts of their proceedings herein, the more to endeare themſelves in his favour. To what end theſe Doctrines and practiſes of Auricular Confeſſion and Prieſts abſolution were thus urged, Maſter <hi>VVilliam Tyndall,</hi> in his <hi>Practiſe of Popiſh Prelates, and Obedience of a Christian man,</hi> (with other Proteſtant VVriters) will informe us, to wit; <hi>to enſlave the Laity to the Clergie; to advance the Prieſt above the King,</hi> the <hi>Myter</hi> above the <hi>Scepter;</hi> the Eccleſiaſticall Tribunall above the <hi>Secular; to fiſh out all mens ſecrets, to awe and keepe them under bondage, and accompliſh all their owne deſignes upon them with more facility,</hi> as they doe in Popiſh Kingdomes, where ſuch Confeſſions and Abſolutions are in uſe.

Pag. 209. The ſoveraigne balſome of Confeſſion or pennance.</p>
                              <p>Pag. 428. Diſciplying the body likewiſe hath a marvellous efficacy to ſtir up in us deſire of devotion, when it is moderately uſed: Haire-Cloath tameth the fleſh very much: upon the principall dayes of pennance, one may well uſe it with the adviſe of a diſcreet Confeſſor.</p>
                              <p>Dr. <hi>Pocklingtons Altare Chriſtianum, p.</hi> 42. writes thus, The firſt Room is called the Church-Porch where penitents uſed to ſtand, or rather to caſt themſelves downe, and in humble manner to deſire the faithfull to pray for them as they went <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> into the Church: after Delinquents had perfectly fulfilled their penance, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Sacraments, and communicated: This diſtinction of places in the Church is very ancient and obſerved even from the Apoſtles times.</p>
                              <p>Pag. 44. This man after penance done for this fault was admitted into the Church againe.</p>

                              <p>P. 54. None that had fallen into any notorious crime were admitted againe into the Church before they had done open penance in Sack-cloth and Aſhes: <hi>Cerdon</hi> was not received into the Church before he had performed his penance: <hi>Exomologeſin faciens.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Pag. 55. In what ſort penitents performed their penance and made Confeſſion, the Act it ſelfe will diſcover.</p>
                              <p>This <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> giveth law both to our food and rayment, <hi>ſacco &amp; cinere incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare;</hi> and ordereth men to lye in Sack-Cloth and Aſhes to humble your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prieſt, and to fall downe upon the knees before Gods Altars, to ſue unto all Brethren for their prayers in their behalfe, <hi>Haec omnia exomologeſis:</hi> penance worketh all this.</p>
                              <p>P. 56. Feeling nothing but rough Sack-Cloth, galling the ſides, ſeeing nothing but head, hands, face, cloaths, covered over with aſhes; have nothing to be ſeene but a pale face, thinne cheekes and a meagre looke, and this continued two, three, ſometimes foure yeares together, before <hi>perfectionem ſuam reciperent.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>P. 57. Hereupon the Biſhops made an addition to the Eccleſiaſtcall Canon, that in every Church a Penitentiary ſhold be appointed to admit penitents into the Church, after they had done publike penance: A ſolemn day was ſet a part for taking of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like penance for open faults, by impoſition of hands, and ſprinkling of aſhes, namely, <hi>Aſhwedneſday,</hi> by the Canon of the Councell of <hi>Agatha in Gratian,</hi> This is the godly Diſcipline whereof our Church ſpeaketh in the Commination, of putting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſinners to open penance in the beginning of Lent, and wiſheth that it might bee reſtored againe: And as <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi> was appointed for putting notorious ſinners to open penance, ſo was <hi>MAUNDAY</hi> Thurſday ſet a part for their abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                              <p>P. 59. The godly diſcipline conſtantly practiſed in Churches and at Altars and the ſad and malencholly mention of Penance, Faſting and Prayer, with other Auſterities, which the pietie of the times have but juſt cauſe to thinke of.</p>
                              <p>P. 63. This was done 40. dayes before <hi>Eaſter</hi> namely on <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi> in Sack-Cloth and Aſhes: And for 8. dayes together before <hi>Eaſter</hi> they were to doe penance, to faſt, to refraine all manner of pleaſures though never ſo lawfull, to ſtand bare foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sack-cloth, and to watch on Good-Friday all night, or at leaſt till two a Clock in the morning. <note place="margin">NOTE</note>

Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> is very copious in this Theme, in his <hi>Altare Chriſtianum, P.</hi> 130 Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> ſaith thus: I beleeve no ſuch ſacrifice of the Altar as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, I fancie no ſuch Altars as they imply, though I profeſſe a Sacrifice and an Altar: And a little after ſpeaking of his Adverſaries, hee ſaith thus; I have ſo good opinion of your underſtanding, though weake, that you will confeſſe the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar (or Communion-table) whether you pleaſe, to be a Sacrifice, &amp;c. <hi>Pag.</hi> 135. Abuſes of Altars and ſacrifices condemned not the things themſelves: Prieſts, Sacrifices, Oblations, Altars. The Sacrament of the Altar is not aboliſhed, <hi>P.</hi> 122. The Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> did propheſie <hi>de Sacrificiis Gentium, id eſt de paue Euchariſtia &amp; poculo Euchariſtiae.</hi> It appeareth that St. <hi>Iuſtin</hi> that holy Martyr did call the Euchariſt, a ſacrifice, and hath the Prophet for his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Saint <hi>Ireneus</hi> alſo ſaith, that when Chriſt tooke the Bread and the Wine, <hi>Gratias eget,</hi> he gave thanks, and ſaid the bread was his body, and confeſſed the wine to be his bloud, <hi>et novi Teſtamenti novam docuit oblationem,</hi> and taught a new oblation of the New Teſtament; which the Church receiving from the Apoſtles, in <hi>univerſo mundo offert deo,</hi> doth offer unto God in all the world. This, ſaith he, is that pure ſacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God in every place which the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpake of, before, <hi>Pag.</hi> 124. Saint <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> How ſhall we receive this ſacred hoſt? How ſhall we partake the Lords body with a defiled tongue? For this ſacrifice, <hi>Domini ſacrificium eſt.</hi> This ſacrifice, the Prieſt ſtanding at the Altar, offereth to God for al the world, for Biſhops, for the church &amp;c. according to our Collect on Good Friday, <hi>Pag.</hi> 126. When the ſacrifice of our Mediatour is offered it cannot be denied, but the faithfull are hereby eaſed. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the ſame Father calls <hi>ſummum &amp; veriſſimum Sacrificium,</hi> and ſaith, that at the memories of Martyrs, <hi>Deo offertur ſacrificium Christianorum, ipſum vero ſacrificium corpus eſt Chriſti,</hi> which is not offered to them (for themſelves are the body of Chriſt) but unto God, <hi>Pag.</hi> 127. It appeareth by that which hath beene ſaid that there were Altars, and oblations, and ſacrifices which the Fathers allowed. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this conſtant Doctrine of the holy Fathers concerning Altars, Oblations, and Sacrifices, is confirmed by the Canons of ſundry Councells, <hi>Pag.</hi> 128. Altars, Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſacrifices were in Common uſe amongſt the moſt holy Saints of God that ever lived, <hi>Pag.</hi> 136. If there be no Chriſtian Altar, there is no Chriſtian Sacrifice, if no Chriſtian Sacrifice, there is no Chriſtian Prieſt, if there be no Chriſtian Prieſt, away with the Booke of Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons.</p>
                              <p>We ſhall cloſe up this with Doctor <hi>Peter Heylins</hi> words in his <hi>Antidotum Lincolni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſe. P.</hi> 6. 17. and 26. A Sacrifice it was in figure, a ſacrifice in fact, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, a ſacrifice in the Commemorations, or upon the Poſt-fact. A ſacrifice there was among the Jewes, ſhewing forth Chriſts death unto them, before his comming in the fleſh, a ſacrifice there muſt be amongſt the Chriſtians, to ſhew forth the Lords Death till he come in Judgement; and if a ſacrifice muſt be, there muſt be alſo Prieſts to doe, and Altars whereupon to do it, becauſe without a Prieſt and Altar, there can be no ſacrifice, yet ſo that the precedent ſacrifice was of a different nature from the ſubſequent, and ſo are alſo both the Prieſt and Altar from thoſe before; a bloudy ſacrifice then, an <hi>unbloody now:</hi> a Prieſt derived from <hi>Aaron</hi> then, from <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> now, an Altar for Moſaicall Sacrifices: then for Evangelicall now: for viſible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſacrifices, though none for bloudy and externall ſacrifices: Not an improper Altar, and an improper ſacrifice, as you idlely dream of; for ſacrifices, Prieſts, and Altars being relatives, as your ſelfe confeſſeth, the ſacrifice and the Altar being improper muſt needs inferre that even our Prieſthood is improper alſo.</p>

                              <p>Doctor <hi>Laurence</hi> in his Sermon before the King reſolves thus <hi>Page</hi> 17. 18. As I like not thoſe that ſay, <hi>he is bodily there, ſo I like not thoſe that ſay, his body is not there; becauſe Chriſt ſaith, tis there, and Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith 'tis there, and the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſaith 'tis there, and the Church of God ever ſaid tis there; and that truly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially &amp; eſſentially: and that not only by way of repreſentation or Commemoration; and yet without either con, ſub, or trans, which the antient Church ſaid not: by a reall, and nevertheleſſe a ſpirituall and myſticall and ſupernaturall preſentation and exhibition. For why ſhould our Saviour bid us take what he would not have us receive? We muſt beleeve tis there; we muſt not know what is there: our faith may ſee it, our ſence cannot; tis a miſtery, they all ſay, and twere no myſtery if twere knowne; his preſence they determined, the manner of his preſence they determined not: they ſay he is there, end they ſay the Lord knowes how. For why ſhould we ſeeke him naturally in the Communion, whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we cannot finde in the Wombe of the Virgin.</hi>

                              <p>Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> in his <hi>Altare Chriſtianum,</hi> writes thus. <hi>Page.</hi> 108. 153. The people were not ſo prophane and unchriſtian not to performe their moſt humble and lowly reverence towards the moſt holy and ſacred Altar, where Chriſt is moſt truly and really preſent in the bleſſed Sacrament, &amp;c. Altars becauſe they are the ſeates and Chaires of eſtate, where the Lord vouchſafeth to place himſelfe amongſt us, <hi>(quid eſt enim Altare, niſi ſedes corporis et ſanguinis Chriſti</hi> as <hi>Optatus</hi> ſpeaks?) have bin in all ages ſo greatly honoured, and regarded of the moſt wiſe learned and moſt bleſſed Saints of God.</p>
                              <p>Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> in his Cole from the Altar affirmes <hi>Page</hi> 15. Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> doth not only call it the Sacrament of the Altar, affirming thus, that in the Sacrament of the Altar is the naturall body and bloud of Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his <hi>Speech in Star-Chamber,</hi> hath this ſtrange Paſſage which did much amuſe the VVorld, <hi>Page</hi> 47. <q>
                                    <hi>To Almighty God, I doubt not, but yet it is, verſus Altare,</hi> towards his Altar, as the <hi>greateſt place of Gods reſidence on earth: I ſay the greatest;</hi> yea, greater than the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> For there tis <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> This is my Body; <hi>But in the Pulpit,</hi> tis at moſt, but <hi>Hoc eſt verbum meum:</hi> This is my word, (and as many men uſe the matter, <hi>Hoc eſt verbum Diaboli,</hi> This is the word of the Devill). And a greater reverence, no doubt, is due to the Body than to the VVord of the Lord: and ſo in relation anſwerably to the <hi>Throne</hi> where his <hi>Body is uſually preſent</hi> than to the <hi>Seat</hi> whence his <hi>Word</hi> uſeth to be proclaimed, &amp;c.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>Theſe words doe neceſſarily imply, a reall preſence of Chriſts <hi>Naturall Body</hi> on the Altar, not of his <hi>Sacramentall</hi> only. For this ſentence; <hi>The greateſt place of Gods reſidence on earth, I ſay the greateſt; yea greater than the Pulpit, for there tis, Hoc eſt corpus meum:</hi> &amp;C. <hi>But in the Pulpit tis at moſt, but hoc eſt verbum meum:</hi> clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that he meanes this only of Chriſts very naturall body. For firſt he ſpeakes of that Body of Chriſt, to which the Deity is hypoſtatically united, and ever preſent with:</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="204" facs="tcp:61245:106"/>
Secondly, of that body which drawes along with it the greateſt preſence and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God Himſelfe on earth.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly of that body of Chriſt, which is farre more worthy and honourable than the word of Chriſt.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly, of that body to which a greater reverence no doubt is due, than to the word of the Lord: and ſo by relation, to the Throne wherin his body is uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then to the Seat where his word uſeth to be proclaimed. Now all theſe cannot be intended of any repreſentative or Sacramentall Body of Chriſt, but onely of his Naturall body, Therfore his cleare meaning can be no other, but that Chriſts very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body is really preſent on the Altar in the conſecrated bread, when the Sacrament is there adminiſtred. And to put this out of doubt, theſe paſſages in his <hi>Conference with Fiſher, p.</hi> 286. 293, 294, 295, 296. intimate, or rather clearely expreſſe as much.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>All ſides agree in the truth with the Church of England, That in the moſt bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the worthy Receiver is by his Faith, made ſpiritually partaker of the true and reall body and bloud of Chriſt,</hi> TRVLY and REALLY. I <hi>would have no man troubled at the words,</hi> TRVLY and REALLY, <hi>&amp;c. Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doe often grant, That the TRVE and REALL BODY OF CHRIST IS IN THE EVCHARIST, and TIS MOST TRAVE. <hi>For the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, at leaſt they which follow</hi> Calvin <hi>himſelfe,</hi> do not only <hi>beleive,</hi> that the TRVE and REALL BODY <hi>of Christ is received in the Eucharist, but</hi> THAT IT IS THERE; and <hi>that we partake of it VERE ET REALITER: Nor can that place by any art be ſhifted, or by any violence wreſted from</hi> Calvines <hi>true meaning of the preſence of Christ, IN</hi> and <hi>AT the bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt. And for the Church of</hi> Engl. <hi>nothing is more plaine than that it believes and teaches</hi> The true and reall preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt; <hi>unleſſe</hi> A. C. <hi>can make a body no body, and bloud no bloud. Nay</hi> Biſhop Ridley <hi>addes yet further, That in the Sacrament</hi> IS THE VERY TRVE and NATVRALL BODY and BLOVD OF CHRIST, <hi>that which was borne of the Virgin Mary; which aſcendod into Heaven, which ſits at the Right hand of God the Father, which ſhal come from thence to judge the quick and the dead, &amp;c.</hi> All which compared with his Alterations and Additions made with his owne hand in the Booke of Common Prayer, which he would have obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> [recited at large in <hi>A Neceſſary Introduction to his Tryall, pag.</hi> 158. to 164.] ſo groſly Popiſh, that hee durſt not hazard the giving of them in evidence to this particular point, but pleaded the <hi>Act of Pacification and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion</hi> in barre thereof as ſoone as ever they were but mentioned; will undoubtedly manifeſt him a meere Papiſt in this particular, and a profeſſed Patron of the Reall preſence Tranſubſtantiation, and the Maſſe it ſelfe.</p>

Yet did not his moſt Excellent Majeſtie finde ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in ſome men and ſuch as <hi>ſhould have beene examples unto their flockes,</hi> as his moſt Chriſtian purpoſe did deſerve: there being ſome, ſo ſetled in the opinion of a Sabbath Day, (a day not heard of in the Church of Chriſt 40. yeares agoe,) that they chooſe rather to deprive the Church of their paines and miniſtrie, than yeeld unto His Majeſties juſt commands, for whoſe ſakes ſpecially, next unto my duty unto God, my Soveraigne and the Church my Mother, I have employed my time and Studdies, to compoſe this <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> that they may ſee therein in briefe, the practiſe of Gods Church in the times before them, and frame themſelves to do thereafter; caſting aſide thoſe errours in the which they are, and walking in the way which they ought to travell; which way when all is done will bee <hi>Via Regia, the Kings High way;</hi> as that which is moſt ſafe and of beſt aſſurance, becauſe moſt travellers by Gods people.

                                    <p>Yeſternight I had the view of the Acts of the late Scottiſh Aſſembly, which I could not read without much indignation, in ſeeing the only true, and ancient Government of the Church ſo diſpitefully trod upon by ignorant Factioniſts. Vpon the peruſall whereof, I begin to think it were pity and ſhame they ſhould carry it away ſo, and that ſo publike an inſolence could admit of none but a more publike remedy, and may I be bold to impart unto your Grace what my thoughts were for ſome eaſe of this wrong, and mittegation of the ſcandall under the hope of your Graces pardon, I ſhall not ſticke to diſcover them in this ſecret and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe paper, humbly leaving them to your Graces favourable cenſure, although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I ſhould have needed a larger Preface to ſo bould an attempt. Since then for his Majeſty to right the Church by the Sword, as the caſe now ſtands, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit for our hopes nor our wiſhes (which were no other in ſo deſperate a Schiſme, then to reconquer his owne with much Charge, danger and blood) we thought it might be ſeaſonable, ſafe and happie to imploy the ſpirituall ſword, the remedy which the Church hath ever wont to make uſe of in ſuch occaſions, with bleſſed ſucceſſe,) I thought therefore if through your Graces mediation it might pleaſe his ſacred Majeſty to cauſe a Generall Synod of the whole three Kingdomes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, wherein all the Reverend Biſhops and chiefe of the learned, and dignified Clergy, and the profeſſors, and ſome other eminent Doctors of all the Vniverſities in all the ſaid Kingdomes may be aſſembled to paſſe their judgment (after free and full expectation) of theſe Schiſmaticall points, determined thus proudly, and raſhly by our Northen Neighbours, it could not but ſort to excellent effect, for ſo they might bee convinced of their abſurd errours; or at leaſt publikely before all the world, cenſured and condemned for what they are: and if they have any Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſhame they ſhall be made to bluſh at their owne miſerable tranſportation.

And certainly my Lord, me thinkes there ſhould be a kinde of neceſſity in this courſe, ſince not ſome few, but the whole Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath thus broken out into Schiſme, and ſhamed both it ſelfe and the Goſpell, and without ſome timely prevention the miſchiefe may yet grow further; whereas this way it may be (at the leaſt) choakingly convinced and ſeaſonably checked. Neither neede the charge hereof be great to his Majeſties coffers, ſince the burthen of the Commiſſioners may be layd upon the ſeverall Dioceſſe from whence they are ſent.

                                    <p>I Was not only glad but almoſt proud of your Graces acceptance of my poor but bold motion, which that it found favour in his Majeſties eyes, upon your Graces recommendation, was as much above my hope, as above the poſſibility of my thankfulneſſe. I do moſt humbly reſt in the grounds of his Majeſties moſt wiſe and juſt reſolution, although that which I propounded was not in any ayme at the Reclamation of thoſe ſtiffe Spirits, but at their conviction and ſhaming, together with the ſatisfaction and ſetling of any diſtempered or wavering minds, of any contentious perſon, at home or abroad. But ſince it hath
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61245:119"/>
pleaſed his Majeſtie to lay aſide that thought, I am moſt ſubmiſſively ſilent; As for that motion (which comming from your <hi>Graces</hi> hand is no leſſe in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction then a command) of my undertaking this great taske, of writing a ſatisfactory diſcourſe in this ſubject: I beſeech your <hi>Grace</hi> to give me leave to ſay, it doth too much overvalue me. If your <hi>Grace</hi> did but know my great weakeneſſe, ſo well as I know my little ſtrength, your <hi>Grace</hi> would not have ſingled me out for ſo high and noble an undertaking. I confeſſe in an holy zeale to the cauſe, no man ſhall outſtrip me, in abilities too many: yet ſince <note place="margin">Note.</note> it hath pleaſed your <hi>Grace</hi> to honour me ſo farre, as to thinke mee capable, and worthy of ſuch an imployment, I ſhall moſt gladly (without prejudice to any more able paines) endeavour my beſt this way. But would your <hi>Grace</hi> bee pleaſed to give mee leave to ſuggeſt another <hi>Motion.</hi> I thinke I ſhould intimate that which would not a little advance the ſucceſſe of this great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

                                    <p>And ſince I have taken the boldneſſe to move ſo farre, will your <hi>Grace</hi> give mee leave (out of the zealous intention of my thoughts upon the ſpeede of this notable ſervice) to propound ſome further ſpecialty; If therefore in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Primate,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Downe,</hi> and <hi>Conner,</hi> men (as your <hi>Grace</hi> beſt knowes) of ſingular note in the Church.

                                       </gap>. In the other, I doe firſt meet with your <hi>Graces</hi> mercifull and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly proceedings with one of my ſtrayed Charge, Maſter <hi>Cox.</hi> I was in ſome hope of his relenting, ere I left him, if (as I perceive) the worke be perfected by your <hi>Graces</hi> effectuall councels, it will be happy for him, and great contentment to his friends; in regard both of his former conformity, and great Charge. He is not yet come down, an hearty Recantation will redeeme all. In the next place, I finde your <hi>Graces</hi> zealous care of the ſucceſſe of this worke, which upon your <hi>Graces</hi> motion, I have heartily undertaken; wherein for the not applying of ſo many hands, I doe humbly reſt in his <hi>Majeſties</hi> moſt wiſe determination, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Note.</note> the danger of varience might have received a prevention, ſince the whole worke muſt have had one rule, and have come under one rule and cenſure, but this courſe is both more ſure and no leſſe effectuall.</p>
                                    <p>For that which here concernes my ſelfe; I acknowledge my ſelf much bound to your <hi>Grace</hi> for your good opinion of my ability for ſo great a ſhocke, which I ſhall deferre to improve to the utmoſt; and whereas it is thought requiſite, that I ſhould ſet downe thoſe ſimple Propoſitions, which I ſhall undertake to make good in this worke: I doe moſt willingly entertaine it, and therefore ſhall make bold to acquaint your <hi>Grace</hi> with the whole plot of my intendment in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, humbly yeelding it up to your <hi>Graces</hi> Cenſure, or better adviſe.</p>
                                    <p>And firſt my purpoſe is, (wherein I doe ſomewhat pleaſe my ſelfe, if your <hi>Grace</hi> be ſo pleaſed) to take my riſe from the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Section of their laſt Synod of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> wherein Maſter <hi>George Graham</hi> is ſaid to come in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Epiſcopacie, and to profeſſe his repentance, which is there appointed to be recorded.</p>

Hereupon, I meane to take this Mr. <hi>George</hi> to taske, and ſomewhat warmely to expoſtulate the matter with him, and when I ſhall, after a fervent preface, have driven him from the refuge of conforming herein to other (which I think I ſhall do to purpoſe) I ſhall then deale with him alone, and addreſſe my ſelfe to argue the caſe with him, and the Faction (whom I ſhall make my adverſary; the Faction, and not the Church of <hi>Scotland.)</hi> And ſhall undertake to make good theſe two points, as I conceive, both full and proper for the occaſion.</p>
                                    <p>
                                       <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That Epiſcopacie is a lawfull, moſt Ancient, holy, and Divine Inſtitution,  (I meane, that which is joyned with imparity, and ſuperiority of Juriſdiction) and therefore where it hath through Gods providence obtained, cannot by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power be abdicated, without a manifeſt violation of Gods Ordinance.</p>
                                    <p>
                                       <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That the Presbiterian Government, how ever vindicated under the glorious names of Chriſts Kingdome and Ordinance, hath no true footing, either  in Scripture, or the practice of the Church in all Ages, from Chriſts time till the preſent; and that howſoever it may be of uſe in ſome ſuch Cities, or Territories, as wherein Epiſcopall Government, through iniquity of times, cannot be had: yet to obtrude it upon a Church otherwiſe ſetled, under an acknowledged Monarchy, is utterly uncongruous, and unjuſtifiable. Before the proofe of which two heads; I purpoſe to lay downe certaine cleare and undenyable <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> ſome 15. or 16 in number, as the grounds of my following Arke, ſuch as theſe; 1. That Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was of Apoſtolicall Inſtitution, cannot be denied to be of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. 2. Not onely that Goverment which was directly commanded and enacted, but alſo that which was practiſed, and recommended by the Apoſtles to the Church, muſt juſtly paſſe for an Apoſtolicall Inſtitution. 3. That which the Apoſtles by Divine inſpiration inſtituted, was not for the preſent time but for continuance. 4. The Univerſall practiſe of the Church immediatly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Apoſtles, is the beſt and ſureſt Commentary upon the practiſe of the Apoſtles, or of their expreſſions. 5. We may not entertain ſo irreverent an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints and Fathers of the Primitive Church, that they who were the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, would, or durſt ſet up a Government, either faulty, or of their owne heads. 6. If they would have been ſo preſumptuous, yet they could not have diffuſed one uniforme order of Government through the whole world, in ſo ſhort a ſpace. 7. The Ancient Hiſtories of the Church, and Writings of the eldeſt Fathers are rather to be beleeved, in the report of the Primitive of the Church Government, then thoſe of this laſt Age. 8. Thoſe, whom the Ancient Church of God, and the holy and Orthodox Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Errors, or Hereſies, are not fit to be followed as Authors of our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or practiſe for Church government. 9 The acceſſion of honourable Titles or Priviledges makes no difference in the ſubſtance of the Calling. 10. Thoſe Scriptures wherein any new forme of Government is grounded, had need to bee very cleare, and unqueſtionable, and more evident then thoſe, whereon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rejected Policy is raiſed. 11. If that Order which they ſay Chriſt ſet for the government of his Church (which they call the Kingdome and Ordinance of Chriſt) be but one and undoubted, then it would and ſhould have beene ere this agreed upon againſt them; what, and which it is. 12. If this (which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) be the Kingdome and Ordinance of Chriſt, then if any eſſentiall part of it be wanting, Chriſts Kingdome is not in that Church erected. 13. Chriſtian po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy requires no impoſſible or abſurd thing. 14. Thoſe truths which are new, and unheard off in all ages of the Church (in many and eſſentiall points) are well worthy to bee ſuſpected. 15. To depart from the practiſe of the univerſall Church of Chriſt, (ever from the Apoſtles times) and to be take our ſelves volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to a new forme lately taken up, cannot but be odious and highly ſcandalous. Upon theſe grounds laid, I ſhall come to ſubſume; and ſhall both convince the Faction in aberration from them, and fully prove the two points intended; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61245:120"/>
which, with ſome obſervations and Queries, I ſhall ſhut up in a vehement Exhortation both to them, and to our owne; if it may be for the reducing of the one, if not, yet to the ſetling of the other. If your <hi>Grace</hi> ſhall approve of this Plot-forme, I ſhall accordingly proſecute it; if your <hi>Grace</hi> ſhall thinke fit to alter or detract, or adde ought, I am as ready to ſubmit, with pardon craved for this length, and the unfained vowes of my hearty prayers, I take leave, and am,</p>

                              <floatingText type="letter">
                                 <body>
                                    <p>THe reſt of your Lordſhips Letter is fitter to be anſwered by my own hand, and ſo you have it. And ſince you are pleaſed ſo worthyly and brother-like to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with the whole plot of your intended worke, and to yeeld it up to my cenſure and better advice, (ſo you are pleaſed to write) I doe not onely thanke you, heartily for it, but ſhall in the ſame Brotherly way and with equall freedome put ſome few Animad verſions, ſuch as occure on the ſudden, to your further Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, aiming at nothing but what you doe, the perfection of the worke, in which ſo much is concerned.</p>
                                    <p>And firſt for Mr. <hi>George Graham,</hi> I leave you free to worke upon his baſeneſſe and his ignorance as you pleaſe, aſſuring my ſelf that you will not depart from the gravity of your ſelfe, or the cauſe therein. Next you ſay in the firſt head; That Epiſcopacy is an ancient, Holy and Divine inſtitution. It muſt needs be ancient and holy if divine: would it not be more full, went it thus? So ancient as that it is of divine Inſtitution. There you define Epiſcopacy by being joyn'd with impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſuperiority of Juriſdiction: This ſeemes ſhort, for every Arch-Presbyters, or Arch-Deacons place, is ſo, yea and ſo was Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> in his Chaire at <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow:</hi> unleſſe you will define it by a diſtinction of Order. I draw the ſuperiority not from that Juriſdiction which is attributed to Biſhops, <hi>Jure Poſitivo,</hi> in their Audience of Eccleſiaſticall matters, but from that which is Intrinſicall and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall in the power of Excommunication. Againe you ſay in that firſt point; That where Epiſcopacy hath obtained, it cannot be abdicated without violation of Gods Ordinance. This propoſition I conceive, <hi>eſt inter minus habentes;</hi> for never was there any Church yet, where it hath not obtained the Chriſtian faith was never yet planted any where but the very firſt feature, of the body of a Church was by, or with Epiſcopacy, and whereſoever now Epiſcopacy is not ſuffered to be, it is by ſuch an abdication; for certainely there it was <hi>a Principio.</hi> In your ſecond head you grant, that the Presbyterian Government may be of uſe, where Epiſcopacy may not be had. Firſt I pray you conſider whether this Conceſſion be not needleſſe here, and in it ſelfe of a dangerous conſequence. Next I conceive there is no place where Epiſcopacy may not be had, if there be a Church more then in title onely. Thirdly ſince they challenge their Presbyterian fiction to be Chriſts Kingdome and Ordinance (as your ſelfe expreſſeth) and caſt out Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy as oppoſite to it, wee muſt not uſe any minſing termes, but unmaske them plainely, nor ſhall I ever give way to hamper our ſelves for feare of ſpeaking plain truth, though it be againſt <hi>Amsterdam</hi> or <hi>Geneva;</hi> and this muſt be ſadly thought
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61245:121"/>
on concerning your <hi>Postulata</hi> I ſhall pray you to allow me the like freedome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which the two firſt are true, but (as expreſt) too reſtrictive. For Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is not ſo to be aſſerted to Apoſtolicall Inſtitution, as to barre it from looking higher, and from fetching it Materially and originally in the ground and intention of it, from Chriſt himſelfe, though perhaps the Apoſtles formerlyzed it. And here give me leave a litle to inlarge: The Adverſaries of Epiſcopacy are not onely the furious <hi>Aerian</hi> Hereticks (out of which are now raiſed <hi>Prynne, Baſtwicke</hi> and our Scottiſh maſters) but ſome alſo of a milder and ſubtiller Alloy, both in the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vean</hi>

thoſe Animadverſions were ſo juſt, that I had amended thoſe paſſages (divers of them) voluntarily, ere I received this Gracious Admonition, for I did onely ſend your <hi>Grace</hi> the rude draught of what I meant to poliſh in the Expreſſion; your <hi>Grace</hi> obſerves truely ſome mitigation in ſtating the Cauſe, which I confeſſe to have purpoſely uſed, out of a deſire to hold as good Termes with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches abroad, as I ſafely might; your <hi>Grace</hi> knowes well how Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Downam</hi> have handled that point, if we may make the Caſe ſure for us, with the leaſt aſperſion caſt upon them, (who honour our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cannot obtaine it) I conceived it the better, eſpecially, ſince the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> caſe ſo palpably differs; yet I would ſo determine it, as that nothing but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity can either excuſe them, or hold up the truth of their being.

or ſuppreſſion, I am altogether indifferent: for my owne judgement I doe not think it werthy or capable of the atteſtation of others, eſpecially my betters, for that I do both take my riſe from a particular occaſion and do often interſperſe polemicall diſſertations, as with M. <hi>Parker, Anti-Tilenus, Vedelius,</hi> and others, without which me thought I could not ſatisfactorily clear thoſe points,) which paſſages I have no reaſon to think others ſhould take upon them, either to own or juſtifie. It was my ſecond bold motion to your <hi>Grace,</hi> That divers ſelect Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Divines, ſhould ſhortly and fully expreſſe their judgements in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; Your <hi>Grace</hi> thought fitter (to which I ſubſcribed) that it-ſhould be done by one or two, and allowed and ſeconded by more, ſuch a diſcourſe ſhould be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſitive and ſhort: As for this, I ſuppoſe the judicious peruſers will thinke it may be of good uſe to ſettle and prepare the mindes of men, towards an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Judgement in this point, which perhaps may be otherwiſe varying: And if I may have leave to ſhoot my bolt I ſhould conceive, (if an atteſtation to our juſt Tenent be thought requiſite from many and the beſt hands) it would ſort beſt, that the ſubſtance of it ſhould be drawn up into ſome ſhort and full Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions (ſuch as theſe which I have taken the boldneſſe to incloſe) and ſent or tendred to them for their ſubſcription; wherein I ſhould hold a generality of expreſſion the ſafeſt.

                                 <item>1. God had never any Church upon earth that was ruled by a Parity.</item>
                                 <item>2. The firſt Church of God which was reduced to a publike poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note n="*" place="margin">Inſerted with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops owne hand.</note> 
                                    <hi>was among the Jewes,</hi> and by his owne appointment was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſettled imparity of High-Prieſt, Prieſts, Levites.</item>
                                 <item>3. The Evangelicall Church was founded by our Saviour in a knowne imparity; for though the Apoſtles were equall among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet they were above the 70. and all other Diſciples, and were ſpecially indued with power from on high.</item>
                                 <item>4. The ſame God and Saviour after his Aſſention did ſet ſeverall ranks and orders of the holy Miniſtry: Firſt Apoſtles: Secondly Prophets: Thirdly Teachers, &amp;c. all which acknowledged the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and authority of the Apoſtles.</item>
                                 <item>5. The Apoſtles after the Aſſention of our Saviour by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods ſpirit, did exerciſe that power and ſuperiority of ſpirituall Juriſdiction over the reſt of the Church, which was given them by Chriſt, and ſtood upon their Majority above all other Miniſters of the Goſpell.</item>
                                 <item>6. The ſame Apoſtles did not carry that power up to heaven with them, and leave the Church unfurniſhed with the due helpes of her further propagation and Government, but by vertue of this power and by the ſame direction of Gods ſpirit, ordayned in ſeverall parts ſpirituall guides and Governours of Gods people to ayde and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede them.</item>
                                 <item>7. The ſpirituall perſons ſo by them ordained were at the firſt promiſcuouſly called Biſhops and Presbyters, and managed the Church affaires, by common advice but ſtill under the Government of the Apoſtles their Ordayners and overſeers.</item>
                                 <item>8. But when the Apoſtles found that Quarrels and Emulations grew in the Church; <note n="*" place="margin">Added with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops owne hand.</note>

                                 <item>10. In the very times of the Apoſtles, and by the impoſition of their hands, there were divers ſuch perſons ſetled in the Church of God, being ſeverally ordayned and appointed to the over-ſight of thoſe populous Citties where their charge lay, to whom all the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons were ſubject.</item>
                                 <item>11. Theſe Biſhops continued their fixed ſuperiority over their Clergy all the time of their life, with the well allowed expreſſe of ſpirituall Juriſdiction, and after their death <note n="*" place="margin">This was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Arch-biſhop, and put in lieu of: <hi>were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by others of their own Order or Degree</hi>

                                    <hi>other Presbyters were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to ſucceed them,</hi> by the due impoſition of the hands of their fellow Biſhops.</item>
                                 <item>12. There was no Church of Chriſt upon earth, ever ſince the times of the Apoſtles, governed any otherwiſe then by Biſhops, thus ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively (after deceaſe) ordayned.</item>
                                 <item>13. This courſe of Government thus ſet by the Apoſtles in their life time, by the ſpeciall direction of the holy ſpirit, is not alterable by any humane Authority, but ought to be perpetuated in the Church to the end of the world.</item>
                                 <item>14. Thoſe which in the new Teſtament are called the Elders of the Church were no other then ſpirituall perſons, ſuch as had the charge of feeding the Flocke of Chriſt by Word and Doctrine.</item>
                                 <item>15.

                              <p>The Archbiſhop himſelfe was a profeſſed maintainer of the truth and viſibility of the faith and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only in his Speech in the high Commiſſion, at Doctor <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> cenſure there, and in his Speech in Star-chamber, <hi>pag.</hi> 36. but likewiſe in his late <hi>Reply to Fiſher, Epiſt.

Secondly, if the Religion of the Proteſtants be in conſcience a known falſe Religion, then the Romaniſts Religion is ſo too, for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the ſame.

                              <p>I ſhall cloſe up this with a <hi>publike Recantation,</hi> drawn up and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Godfry Goodman,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Ridler</hi> Miniſter of Little <hi>Deane,</hi> about 7. miles from that City: who having many Papiſts in his Pariſh, and preaching in a Sermon there, <hi>That Papiſts, as Papiſts were damned, and that the true Proteſtant Religion was the onely true and ſafe way to Salvation:</hi> he was upon the complaint of ſome Papiſts, convicted before this Biſhop, and by him enjoyned to make this following <hi>Recantation,</hi> preſcribed to him, in writing, in the <hi>Cathedrall Church</hi> at <hi>Glocester</hi> on <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. 1636. and for refuſing to make it, he was afterwards on the 5. of <hi>March</hi> next following ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from his living.</p>
                              <p>(IHS)</p>
                              <p>IN the Name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> Whereas I did deliver in a Sermon, lately preacht in this Dioceſſe, <hi>That if we are ſaved the Papiſts are damned;</hi> I am <note place="margin">Note.</note> right heartily ſorry that I ſhould deliver any ſuch doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I muſt acknowledge mine owne errour, and my great fault and offence.</p>
                              <p>Firſt, againſt his <hi>Majeſties Inſtructions,</hi> thus raſhly and unadviſedly to affirme, <hi>That Papiſts are damned.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Secondly, it is an offence againſt the laws of the Kingdome, <hi>For in the eye of the Law we are ſtill one with the ſame Catholike Church:</hi> for were we of a diſtinct or ſeverall Church, <hi>Then our Church could claim no right or Title to thoſe Priviledges, Charters, Foundations, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues which it enjoyes at this day, for theſe were granted to Papiſts, and for many hundred yeares poſseſſed by them;</hi> and ſince there hath <hi>beene no new Law for transferring them upon a different or contrary Church;</hi> But this is made much more manifeſt by the expreſſe words of the Statute, as it appeares by the Act of Parliament which was made upon the firſt breach with the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> the words are theſe, <hi>That they do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intend to ſeperate themſelves from Gods Catholike Church, but onely for</hi>

                                 <hi>ſome politicall reſpects, to preſerve the Kingdome from Ruine.</hi> This was made the 25. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and it is in force at this day; ſo that to make ſuch a difference between theſe <hi>two Churches, as is between damnation and ſalvation; certainly is againſt the Common Lawes, and the Statute Law of this Kingdome;</hi> beſides many acts of State, which being above my element, I will not preſume to touch upon.</p>
                              <p>

Thirdly, againſt the <hi>Church of England; It is impoſible there ſhould be any greater offence, in regard of the affinity that is between both Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for we have the ſame Holy Orders, the ſame Church Service, the ſame</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                                 <hi>Ceremonies, the ſame Fasts, the ſame Feſtivals, and we have generally the ſame Canon Lawes; and therefore through ſides of the Church of Rome they do but give deadly and mortall Wounds to the Church of England who affirme, that Papiſts are damned.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Fourthly it is an offence to <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> for we are to preach the Meanes how men may attaine Salvation, and to pteach Chriſt as a Saviour, we muſt not raſhly intrude upon his Judiciall power on every ſlight occaſion, to point out thoſe that are damned, as if we would ſhorten the mercyes of God and Monopolize them wholy to our ſelves, there is no militant Church without blemiſhes and imperfections, but as long as the foundation <hi>is ſound, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beive in Chriſt crucified, and that we believe the three Creeds, ſo long there is hope of Salvation, Severall churches, though differing in many things, yet may be contained in the bounds of the Catholique church:</hi> Thus the <hi>Greeke church</hi> and the <hi>Latine Church,</hi> may be ſaved both, though they have difference betweene themſelves; and thus the Chriſtians that lived in thoſe parts of the world, which have beene lately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered [and therefore did never partake with the reſt of the Catholike church] yet no doubt but thoſe may be ſaved.</p>
                              <p>Fiftly, there is nothing ſo proper to Chriſtians, as love and charity, and a man may be damned as well for want of charity, as for want of faith; and there cannot bee poſſible a greater want of charity, then to exclude men from Salvation: and therefore they who are apt in their owne ungodly malice to damne others, certainely themſelves are damned; Let it ſuffice that if any man ſhall aske God forgiveneſſe of his ſins, as no doubt every man doth, (for it is one part of the Lords prayer,) and theſe ſins doe imply not onely the Tranſgreſſions of our lives, but likewiſe the erour of our faith, ſo that asking God forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe no doubt but God is mercifull.</p>
                              <p>And here I muſt likewiſe expreſſe my great ſorrow and griefe, that I have ſo <hi>much offended agaiſt the memory of our forefathers and Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſuch as built our Churches, and were the meanes under God, not onely to give us life, but alſo to make us Chriſtians:</hi> when I conſider their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and their Mortification, ſhall I thinke theſe tended to nothing but onely to damne them? No, God forbid; and therefore in all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience, I doe <hi>here acknowledge my great fault, and do aſke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of God, of the Church, and of our Reverend Dioceſan,</hi> and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you all to teſtifie this my Sorrow and unfained repentance. <note place="margin">Note.</note>

Notable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages againſt popery expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of new licenſed Books by the Arch-biſhop and his Agents in imitation of the popiſh Index Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorius.</note> judgement; we ſhall next preſent you with a large Engliſh <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> of what paſſages he and they expunged out of ſundry Engliſh Writers, tendered them to licenſe, before they could paſſe the Preſſe; which will moſt clearly diſcover his and their Jeſuiticall practiſes, confederacies and deſignes to introduce the whole body of Popery among us with little or no oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall begin with purgations of this nature, made by the Biſhop himſelfe, ſome of them before he had any publike authority to licenſe Books, but moſt of them after he uſurped this power, all of them ſo remarkable, that all Proteſtant Churches, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will ſtand amazed at them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt we ſhall inſtance in, is his purgations made in Doctor <hi>Sibthorps</hi> Sermon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preached at <hi>Northampton Aſſizes,</hi> before the Judges, in the yeere 1627. intituled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Apostolicall Obedience;</hi> the whole ſcope of this Sermon, was to juſtifie <hi>The lawfulneſſe of the generall Loane</hi> (then ſet on foot by the Kings ill Councellours, to keep off Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments) <hi>and of the Kings impoſing publike Taxes by his owne regall power, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Parliament;</hi> and to prove, <hi>that the people in poynt of conſcience and religion ought cheerfully to ſubmit to ſuch Loanes and Taxes without any oppoſition.</hi> To ſweeten this ſower theame, the Doctor had cunningly inſerted ſome popular paſſages into this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon againſt evill Counſellours, the toleration of Papiſts, Popery, and the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sabbath, which this Biſhop (who procured this Sermon of his to be printed) expunged with his owne hand, as was evidenced by the Originall written Copy, found in his Study, produced at the Lords Barre, and atteſted by Maſter <hi>Prynne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt paſſage he expunged was this; <q>When not onely the Emperour extirpates the Proteſtants in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where he profeſt it, and <hi>Baveir</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> where he hath a pretext of revenge for it, or the Spaniard and Arch-dutcheſſe in their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where the Jeſuits make it a caſe of Conſcience, but even the King of <hi>France</hi> not onely at <hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Mountabon,</hi> but alſo in other his confines: and when the Pope unites all theſe in a holy League; what may we expect will become of Brittaine, if like that wiſe King in the Goſpell, ours ſends not out whileſt the enemies are yet a farre off? you know how ſpeedily this Iland hath been overrunne with but a few being once entred, and our Ilands are not now better fortified.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next was this; <q>He that <hi>Diſturbs the State, and drawes the Prince to</hi> ill, is to undergoe what he intended to others, as <hi>Haman</hi> and his complices for their plot againſt the Jewes, <hi>Ester</hi> 7, 8, 9. chapters: He that under pretence of <hi>honour to the King is an enemy to Religion,</hi> ſhould ſuffer for a Seducer, as thoſe betrayers of the Prophet. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>to</hi> 25.</q>  It is probable that this Biſhop being then newly made a Privy-Counſellour, and putting the King upon pernicious and illegall projects, to the diſturbance of the State and prejudice of Religion, grew conſcious to himſelf, that this paſſage if un-expunged, might one day riſe up in judgement againſt him and be applied to himſelfe in after times; wherefore out of a provident foreſight, he thought it a poynt of wiſdome to expunge it: But ſince divine providence hath brought it to publike light, we conceive it will be a very good preſident to direct your Lordſhips judgement in the ſentence of this <hi>Haman,</hi> this Arch-Malefactor againſt our <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The the third expunged clauſe was this; <hi>And whereas there is not onely a law of God but even of man againſt Sabbath-breaking, which concernes the fourth Commandement,</hi>

                     <hi>That ſome opinions of theirs teach rebelion: That's apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true;</hi> which opinions of theirs, are that part of their Religion, which this prayer cals <hi>Rebellion</hi> refutes his owne Objection: His third reaſon, <hi>that if you make their religion to be rebelion, then you make their religion and rebelion to be all one; and that is againſt the ground both of State and Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which never put any man to death for</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>but for Treaſon and Rebellion onely</hi> is a meere childiſh fallacy; For their Religion is not any actuall treaſon or rebellion (for which only they ſuffered death) but <hi>doctrinall</hi> and <hi>habituall rebelion</hi> prone to produce actuall rebellions, and the mother of them; in which ſenſe onely this prayer ſtiles it <hi>Rebellion;</hi> yet ſuch, for which no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt ever dyed, unleſſe he reduced it into ſome treaſonable and rebellious action; and then he ſuffered onely for the act, not the Religion or opinion which induced him thereunto; he might well then have ſpared theſe three irrationall reaſons for this Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, with this aſſertion of his p. 39. <hi>I took it my duty to lay it before you, that the King had not onely</hi> Power, <hi>but</hi> Reaſon <hi>to command it;</hi> which onely aggravate, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate or juſtifie his fact, his juſtification then reſts ſolely upon the Kings command and warrant; but this will not excuſe his guilt: For we have nothing but his own bare word in his own caſe (to which no faith can be given, having ſo often bin taken tardy in this kind) to prove; firſt that himſelfe did not move the King to command theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations to be made which is more than probable, by his aleaging the reaſons whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were made, and his activity in other changes of this nature: Secondly, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not procure the Warrant for theſe Alterations after they were made and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (being written with his own hand and having no witneſſe but himſelf to prove the date) as he hath done in other caſes: Thirdly, admit the command and warrant proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed originally from the King himſelfe, not him; yet he being by his place and office principally entruſted with the care, honour, ſafety of our Religion and Church, ſo much concerned in theſe alterations; it had been his duty to have diſobeyed this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and diſſwaded his Majeſty from ſuch a diſhonourable, ſcandalous and offenſive act, which would ſcandalize and diſguſt all his wel-affected proteſtant Subjects, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour his owne royall Father King <hi>James,</hi> our Parliaments, Church, State, who all authorized, approved, uſed this prayer for thirty yeeres ſpace together; encourage Papiſts, Prieſts, Jeſuits, to ſuch like horrid treaſons, and exceedingly animate, elevate the popiſh faction cauſing them to deride, if not to inſult over the Proteſtants and our Church which muſt now alter retract her own approved Collects to gratifie them and their Antichriſtian Religion: But ſo farre is he from this, that he readily obeyes the firſt command without the leſt diſſwaſion, reſiſtance, without adviſing with, or giving notice thereof to any other of his Brethren, the Privy-Counſell, Judges, and other publike perſons as much concerned in it as himſelfe, (to whom <hi>he ought to have given notice, and asked their leave,</hi> at leaſt opinions) <hi>herein ere he obeyed the King,</hi> though not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Burtons</hi> and Maſter <hi>Prynnes;)</hi> being more ready to obey than his Majeſty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

But what then? what if out of a charitable respect to thoſe which in that Religion are peaceable and honeſt men (as no doubt but ſome of them, whatſoever Maſter</hi> B. <hi>beleeves of them, are ſuch) they are not willing, nor think it fit to pray for the rooting up and confuſion of all Papiſts, indiſcriminatim, under thoſe harſh termes; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charitably minded Christians cannot but approve ſuch an alteration, if there were no other ground than that for it: As for any mans transferring it to Puritanes, that is as meer a ſurmiſe as it is a falſe ſlander, that any of thoſe whom he intimates doe call Rome</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>or</hi> Popery <hi>the true Catholique Religion: Yet I know not why ſuch furious cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers downe of</hi> popery <hi>(as</hi> Maſter B. <hi>hath ſhewed himſelfe) may not be accounted of a</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> loniſh and Antichriſtian Sect <hi>as well as any Jeſuit in the world, nor why we may not pray (and that with better reaſon than</hi> Maſter B. <hi>would have men to doe, and under thoſe titles againſt the Hierarchy of our church, that God would root them out of the Land,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein he makes zealous oppoſers of popery, &amp; thoſe the world then ſtiled <hi>Puritanes,</hi> more dangerous perſons, and fitter to be rooted out of the Land as a Babyloniſh &amp; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Sect, than papiſts or Jeſuits. Now thus to juſtifie this alteration in ſo daring, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent a manner, in favour of popery prieſts, Papiſts, Jeſuits, what a tranſcendent crime it is, and of what a rotten popiſh ſpirit it ſavours, let all impartiall perſons determine.</p>
                  <p>The third purgation made by himſelfe, diſcovering the hidden popery of his heart, is his purging out this notable clauſe againſt popery, in the firſt <hi>Collect</hi> of the <hi>publike book of prayers, appointed at the generall Faſt for ceaſing the Plague,</hi> in the yeere 1636. <hi>Thou haſt delivered us from Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry, wherein we were utterly drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and haſt brought us into the moſt cleare and confortable light of thy bleſſed Word, by which we are taught how to ſerve and honouor thee, and how to live orderly with our Neighbours in truth and verity.</hi> The King by his <hi>Proclamation</hi> Anno 1636. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>that the Booke</hi> of prayers for the Faſt, <hi>formerly ſet forth by authority, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, re-publiſhed, and likewiſe uſed in all Churches and places at the publike meetings during this Faſt.</hi> The Arch-biſhop inſtead of re-printing the book formerly ſet forth by authority, purgeth this clauſe out of it in the new impreſſion, though uſed in the Faſt-books upon like occaſions in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> their ſeverall reignes, and in that of 1. <hi>Caroli;</hi> and that upon theſe very grounds which ſhould have moved him to retaine it ſtill, had his heart been upright or ſincere to God and our Religion, becauſe it layes a juſt cenſure and blemiſh upon popery, by ſtiling it <hi>ſupersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                     <hi>and idolatry,</hi> and thankfully recites Gods goodneſſe to us <hi>in delivering us</hi> from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſuperstition and idolatry, wherein we were utterly drowned,</hi> and <hi>bringing us into the moſt cleare and comfortable light of his holy Word, by which we are taught how to ſerve and honour him,</hi> &amp;c. A clauſe ſo pious, ſo juſt and equitable, that it is almoſt a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, how any but a moſt inveterate Papiſt could except againſt it; yet this Arch biſhop is ſo irreconcileably angry with it, that it muſt be wholy obliterated and quite omitted out of this new impreſſion; and that without any ſpeciall order or command from his Majeſty (which he pleaded for the former alterations in the Gunpowder-treaſon book) or any ſuggeſtion from Papiſts; Prieſts or Jeſuits, who were ſcandalized with it, (for he doth not ſo much as pretend any ſuch thing in his juſtification of this purge) but by his owne papall authority, contrary to his Majeſties <hi>Proclamation,</hi> out of his own metro <hi>popiſh genius;</hi> which perſwades us, that the former alcerations in the book for the fift of Novem. proceeded originally from himſelf too as well as this however he would tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it to the K. himſelf. Moreover, in the <hi>Order for the Faſt,</hi> in the very laſt page of the book he purged out theſe words condemning the popiſh Doctrine of the <hi>meritorionſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fasting.</hi> viz. <hi>to avoyd the inconvenience that may grow by fasting; ſome esteeming it a Meritorious Work;</hi> others, <hi>a good Work</hi> and <hi>Of itſelf acceptable to God without due regard of the end,</hi> &amp;c. In briefe, whatever in this Faſt-book did in the leaſt degree reflect upon popery or ſeemingly oppugne any errors of it, this Arch-prelat out of his ardent zeal againſt Popery, and fatherly care for the maintainance of our Proteſtant Religion, did totally expunge it, <hi>non obſtante</hi> his Majeſties Proclamation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                  <p>The fifth <hi>purgations</hi> and <hi>alterations</hi> of higheſt conſequence for the introducing of ſundry <hi>Popiſh doctrines, ceremonies, Tranſubſtantiation and the Maſſe it ſelfe,</hi> were by this Arch-prelat made in that <hi>Common-prayer-booke,</hi> which he endeavoured to inforce upon the <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> all written with his owne hand; (already mentioned at large in <hi>A neceſſary Introduction to the Arch-biſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>his Tryall,</hi> page 156. to 164. to which the Reader may reſort for ſatisfaction herein;) which are ſo palpably popiſh and deſtructive to our Religion, that this Prelate had no other plea or fence againſt them when they began to be preſſed upon him, but onely the <hi>Act of Pacification and Oblivion,</hi> which he peremptorily inſiſted on, though the Committee of the Commons Houſe, who managed the Evidence, alleadged, that they were cleerly without this Act, &amp; that they inſiſted on them only as Evidences to prove his endeavours to introduce Popery, and his good affection thereunto, in maitainance of the ſeventh and tenth originall Articles of his impeachment, not to prove him an Incendiary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Kingdomes, in juſtification of the twelfth originall Article, to which he onely pleaded the Act of Oblivion.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall next proceed to other purgations made by his Chaplaines and Creatures, no doubt by his ſpeciall direction: Beginning firſt with a booke written by Sir <hi>Anthony Hungerford,</hi> who being a Papiſt in his younger dayes, and afterwards upon better conſideration, converted to our Religion, did thereupon write a Treatiſe to his Mother, then a Roman Catholike, to diſſwade her from that Religion, intituled, <hi>The Advice of a Sonne, profeſſing the Religion eſtabliſhed in the preſent Church of</hi> England, <hi>to his deare Mother a Roman Catholike; containing an acknowledgement of God his great mercy in bringing him to the profeſſion of the true religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of</hi> England, and <hi>adviſing,</hi> exhorting his children to perſevere therein; Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford</hi> his Sonne (a Member of the Houſe of Commons) depoſed upon Oath, that about the yeere 1635. he carried this Book, writ by his Father Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> to the Arch-biſhops Chaplaine, Doctor <hi>Bray,</hi> to licenſe for the Preſſe, for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and converſion of other ſeduced Romaniſts; who peruſing the ſame, took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions at ſome harſh paſſages (as he termed them) againſt Popes and Popery, in the 8. 14. 15. 17. and 62. pages thereof, which he told him muſt be quite expurged, or elſe the Treatiſe muſt not paſſe the Preſſe.</p>
                  <p>The paſſages were theſe: p. 8: <hi>Yet even thoſe truths they recommended unto us, upon as perilous and falſe a ground, as if a man ſhould therefore beleeve Chriſt Jeſus to be the ſonne of the living God, becauſe the devil did confeſſe it:</hi> page 14. 15. <hi>They will acknowledge that the Pope may be as wicked a man in life, as any other in the world, and by experience it hath been found, that ſundry of them have ſcarce had matches in this kind; as for inſtance of one,</hi> Pope Alexander <hi>the ſixth, whom</hi> Guicciardine <hi>(though</hi>

                     <hi>and am very buſie now, and have truſted my Chaplaines with thoſe things, to whom you muſt repaire:</hi> Then Sir <hi>Edward</hi> preſſing him againe, that they would not licenſe them unleſſe theſe paſſages were raſed out; the Arch-biſhop anſwered, <hi>I referre this wholy to my Chaplaines, having many other imployments my ſelfe, and therefore what they thinke fit to be done, you muſt ſubmit unto:</hi> Whereupon theſe Treatiſes were then ſtopt from printing, till Sir <hi>Edward</hi> ſome two or three yeers after got them printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the yeere 1639. without theſe expunctions, or the Arch-biſhop's privity.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Daniel Featly,</hi> depoſed upon Oath, that he having printed ſeventy Sermons of his, preached upon ſeverall occaſions, formerly licenſed for the Preſſe; when the Book was ready to be publiſhed, the Arch-biſhop having notice of it, ſent for him to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and demanded of him whether he was not about to publiſh ſome Sermons of his owne in print; who anſwered yes my Lord; then he demanded of him, whether his Sermons were licenſed, and whether any of his Chaplaines had peruſed them or not? he anſwered, that they were licenſed long ſince when himſelfe had power to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe books, and printed by vertue of that licenſe, and that none of his Graces Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines had peruſed them: Then the Arch-biſhop ſaid, he thought, being ſo neere a neighbour to him, he would not have publiſhed any thing without acquainting him firſt therewith: To which the Doctor anſwered, that he intended as ſoone as ever the book was publiſhed, to preſen: his Grace in the firſt place with one of them. Then the Arch-biſhop commanded him, before he publiſhed theſe Sermons, to carry them to Doctor <hi>Bray</hi> his Chaplaine to peruſe, to ſee if there were any offenſive or unfitting paſſages in them, to the end, that if any ſuch were, they might be corrected or expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. To which the Doctor replied, that he hoped there were no ſuch offenſive clauſes in them, and that the book was already printed off, ſo as no alterations could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be made therein, without new printing the ſheets wherein they were made: yet in obedience to his Graces command, he would attend Doctor <hi>Bray</hi> with his Sermons to the end he might licenſe them before they ſhould be publiſhed; which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: Doctor <hi>Bray</hi> having read over his Sermons, gelt them exceedingly, and and purged out all the ſmart and maſculine paſſages againſt both the Papiſts. Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its and Arminians, to his great griefe; Whereupon he expoſtulated the matter with him why theſe paſſages of his, which paſſed currently without exceptions at <hi>White. hal</hi> before King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles,</hi> the Univerſity, and other publike Auditories when they were preached, and were highly approved of in former times, might not paſſe the preſſe without an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> now; alleaging, that it would be a great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to himſelfe, and much coſt and prejudice to the Stationer to re-print ſo many whole ſheets as he had altered: But all this would not prevaile, theſe paſſages could not ſuit with the preſent times, &amp; therefore they muſt ſtand purged, or the book be totally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: Hereupon the Doctor acquainted Sir <hi>Edmund Scot</hi> therewith by way of complaint, and moved him to informe the Arch-biſhop of it; who anſwered him, that he conceived it would be to no purpoſe to complaine, for he thought the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's Chaplaines had directions from their Lord for what they did, and that his Grace would not alter any thing of this kind done by his Chaplaines; whereupon he ſubmitted and complained no further; and ſo the Stationer was enforced to re-print ſome ſixteen or eighteen ſheets anew that Doctor <hi>Bray</hi> had thus altered and purged (which Maſter <hi>Bourne</hi> the Stationer likewiſe depoſed) to his great prejudice and coſt.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Thomas White</hi> a Miniſter depoſed, that Doctor <hi>Clarke,</hi> one of the Prebends of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a very learned, pious Divine, and one of the Tranſlaters of the Bible, leaving the copyes of diverſe of his choyſeſt Sermons, written with his owne hand, in his cuſtody at his death, which he deſired him to ſee carefully printed for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good after his deceaſe; he thereupon, in diſcharge of this his truſt, repaired to Doctor <hi>Heywood,</hi> the Arch-biſhop's houſhold Chaplaine, to peruſe and authorize for the preſſe; who receiving no leſſe then forty ſhillings for his fee for peruſing and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencing them, expunged all the chiefe <hi>paſſages in them againſt the Pope, Popery, Prieſts, Jeſuits, Arminianiſme, Arminians,</hi> and did in ſome places alter and corrupt the authors

words ſo farre as to make him an <hi>Arminian</hi> in thoſe very poynts, wherein he oppoſed their Arminian opinions, and utterly refuſed to licenſe one Sermon of his, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Election, becauſe the whole ſcope of it was againſt Arminius and his errors. At which Maſter <hi>White</hi> being very much diſcontented, to ſee his deceaſed friend's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſo abuſed, demanded his intire copy and moneys again, but could procure neither of them, but the copy thus altered &amp; expunged, which muſt either be totally ſuppreſſed or printed as he had caſtrated it: Whereupon he carried ſome other of his Sermons to Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> and Doctor <hi>Baker,</hi> (the Arch-biſhops great creatures) Chaplaines to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who made the like alterations and purgations in them, as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Haywood</hi> had made in the reſt; an exact catalogue whereof amounting to 210. cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and purgations, Maſter <hi>White</hi> preſented at the Barre upon his oath, which were afterwards made uſe of and reduced under ſeverall heads.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Chetwin</hi> atteſted, that Dr. <hi>William Jones</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-Berghall</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> writ a Comentary on the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> which he carried to Dr. <hi>Samuel Baker,</hi> Chaplain to the Biſhop of <hi>London, (Anno</hi> 1636.) a great Inſtrument of the Arch-biſhop's, to licenſe for the Preſſe; who purged out all the principall clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in it againſt Altars, Images, Maſſe, Tranſubſtantiation, Popery, Papiſts, and for the ſanctification of the Lord's day; a catalogue of the moſt whereof he had collected out of the written copy, which was ſo obliterated, that he could not read the ſame in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, above 150. lines being made unlegible. That this book being printed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the expunged, altered copy, which otherwiſe could not paſſe the Preſſe, the good old Dr. upon the peruſall of it after its printing, was ſo much diſcontented at the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and purgations made therein without his privity, that he diſclaimed into be his work, ſaying, it was the Licencer's only, not his; who had made him a favourite of thoſe Papiſh opinions, by his corrupting and changing his words, which he profeſſedly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, refuted in his own genuine work; The regreete of which injury went ſo neer his heart, that he fell ſick through diſcontent, and ſoon after dyed; and is by theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations and purgations, which were generally taken notice of, the ſale of the book was extreamly hindred, to the great loſſe of the Stationer that printed it.</p>

                     <p>The ſame Doctor in his Manuſcript copy, page 236. had this paſſage cloſed with a good prayer: <hi>England that was ever rude and barbarous, is now become civill and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;</hi> and all that ever received the Beaſt's mark, have now baniſhed the Beaſt; and <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> GOD GRANT MAY NEVER CHANGE FROM THAT: The Licenſer, whoſe deſigne was conſonant to his Arch-maſters projects, to have us change to popery and receive the Beaſt and his mark againe, quite raſed out theſe words, relating parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to <hi>England</hi> (totally omitted in the printed Book, page 278.) <hi>And all that ever received the beaſt's marke, have now baniſhed the beaſt, and God grant it may never change from it.</hi> Was not this a Romiſh beaſt indeed, and no true Proteſtant, who durſt obliterate ſuch a paſſage?</p>

                     <p>Theſe words being urged by us againſt the Popes power in making lawes, which binds the conſcience, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers three things thereunto, namely:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Firſt, by the Commandements of men, are underſtood Commandements which are contrary to the law of God, but the Popes precepts are not ſo: To this we anſwer.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. All the commandements of men, in whoſe obſervation the worſhip of God is placed, is expreſly and directly condemned; for God is to be worſhipped as himſelfe preſcribes.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. All ſuch commandements are contrary to the law of God, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not adde to the word which I command thee;</hi> namely, in ſubſtantiall things, or which are impoſed as eſſentiall parts of God's worſhip.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. There is no myſticall ceremony introduced or brought into the Church by the Popes or Popiſh Clergy, which was leſſe contrary to the laws of God, then was that tradition of <hi>waſhing hands before meat,</hi> which was ordained by the Elders of the Jewes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Jeſuit anſwers, that our Saviour blames here onely unprofitable and frivolous ceremonies, onely invented by a humane braine or ſpirit; but the precepts of the <hi>Pope</hi> are no ſuch: To this we anſwer,</p>
                        <p n="1">I. If all the Jewes, both Prieſts and people, did uſe ſuch fooliſh and frivolous ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here ſaith are condemned, then why may not the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> uſe ſuch, or be guilty of the ſame error.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. All ſuch myſticall ceremonies which are brought now into the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> without the warrant of God's Word, were invented by a humane ſpirit, for the bleſſed Spirit of God never taught any other worſhip to the Church, then that which Chriſt inſtituted, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. If many, yea moſt of their ceremonies be not frivolous, fooliſh and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, I know not what is; but (as a work or ſubject not worth the inſiſting upon) I paſſe it by.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Jewes (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> were taxed by Chriſt, becauſe they eſteemed more highly of ſome humane lawes then they did of the law of God, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. but the Papiſts doe not ſo. To this I anſwer: that this was never more ſeen in the Jewes then in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as was cleerly ſhewed and proved in the laſt Qeſtion of the former verſe.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Many ſuch like paſſages are purged out of this Author, which we pretermit.</p>
                     <p>But the groſſeſt purgations of all the reſt, were made by Doctor <hi>Bray</hi> in Doctor <hi>Clarke's Sermons</hi> upon the <hi>fifth of November,</hi> and upon other occaſions, as will appeare by theſe enſuing purgations, at which every zealous Proteſtant may wel ſtand amazed.</p>

Nay, but the <hi>Pope</hi> will none of it, if the date be not out and expired in the <hi>Empire;</hi> but we will needs extend it unto theſe times too, and make the woman, the <hi>Malignant church,</hi> then it is the <hi>church of England;</hi> we are this vvoman, vve proſecute, vve execute, vve ſhed the blood of Saints, even this very <hi>church of Canterbury,</hi> both ſhed the blood of Saints, Saint <hi>Thomas Beckets blood:</hi> 'tis not the <hi>Popes of Rome,</hi> but the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens of England; King Henry was</hi> this vvoman, <hi>Queen Elizabeth, King James,</hi> all ſlaughterers of Saints; vvitneſſe Sir <hi>Thomas Moore's</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Fiſher's</hi> blood; witneſſe Saint <hi>Campions</hi> and Saint <hi>Gornets</hi> blood, a blood that vvrought miracles.

                     <p>In his Sermon upon <hi>Quadrageſſima,</hi> page 122. line 10. &amp; page 124. line 37. the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſer hath quite expunged theſe following lines. How then is the Popedome in the Devils gift, if Kingdomes be not? Satan gives it, and it is a kind of Kingdome, <hi>Regnum ſacerdotale,</hi> a prieſtly Kingdome: The Pope a Melcheſedeck, King and Prieſt, wears a Crowne, beares a ſword, both Regallities, three Crownes, <hi>multa diademata,</hi> Chriſt does, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. and he is his Vicar: two ſwords, <hi>Ecce duo gladij hic:</hi> Popes are Kings betters, Cardinals Kings Peers; is the Pope the Devils creature and not Kings? But the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61245:136"/>
Popedome is not Satans gift neither, <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> himſelfe ſometimes a Pope, writes, that one got the Popedome <hi>fraude diabolica;</hi> we beleeve it, moe then one <hi>Silvester</hi> the Nccromancer, <hi>Boniface</hi> 7. <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. all <hi>fraude diabolica:</hi> by devilliſh machinations, that does not prove the Devill made them, or conſtrue it if you will, by the Devils meanes, it will not ſerve ſo neither, ſo Kings come often to their Crownes by devilliſh meanes, and yet God gives them; God may be the author of an act, whereof Satan may be in the meanes; God gave his Sonne to death for us, yet the Devill had his hand in it; <hi>John</hi> ſayes the Devill put in <hi>Iudas</hi> heart to betray Chriſt; God deſtroyes <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but the Devill was his meanes; a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all the Prophets: God would afflict <hi>Iob,</hi> the Devill was his inſtrument, 'tis plaine in the ſtory. For the poynt, as I would not belye, ſo I would not rob the Devill of his right; the Popedome is of God, but the Papacy is of Satan: To be a Prince and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, yea I will yeeld him higheſt Biſhop too, God gives him that; but his univerſall Prelacy and preſumption over Princes, the Devill gives him that: his power is from God, but his pride is from the Devill, Satan is yet more frank.</p>
                     <p>The Pope Patriſſall playes ſatan; ſome here craves not <hi>prostraction</hi> onely, leaſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily you ſay, that's but civill reverence; and yet ſaving his reverence, 'tis more then the greateſt Monarch craves in all our Weſterne Kingdome; I ſay, he craves not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction onely, but adoration too: Worſhip, divine worſhip, what elſe meant the cry of the Cicilian Ambaſſadours proſtrate before him, <hi>Tu tollis peccati mundi, miſereri noſtri;</hi> O thou that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world, have mercy upon us: &amp;c.</p>

Fol. 154.

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is taken ſomtimes commonly; and thus his name Antichriſt belongeth to all who are enemies to Chriſt: and theſe are either 1. open &amp; profeſſed enemies, as the Iews, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Turks and Infidels, in which ſenſe the word is not uſed in Scripture; or 2. covert and cloſe enemies, who profeſſe themſelves chriſtians, and under the name and profeſſion of Chriſt, oppugne Chriſt and his truth; and thus it is taken either 1. more largely, to ſignifie the whole body of hereticks, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18. 22. or 2. more ſtrictly, and ſo it ſignifies the ſociety of them, who having made an Apoſtacy from Chriſt, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the marke of the Beaſt; and theſe we hold to be the Apoſtaticall Church of Rome. Secondly, this name Antichriſt is ſometimes taken properly, or rather peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, and ſo it belongeth to the man of ſinne, and the ſonne of perdirion (a <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3.) who after a more generall manner is the head of all hereticks, and more ſpecially of that ſociety, which hath the mark, number, and the name of the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 17. and this we hold to be the Pope of Rome (as is abundantly proved by <hi>Davaeus,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> and Maſter <hi>Squire)</hi> and that not onely becauſe he is the head of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian body but alſo becauſe he being in profeſſion the Vicar of Chriſt, is indeede <hi>Aemulus Christi, i. e.</hi> an enemy oppoſed to Chriſt in emulation of like honour, as if we ſhould ſay, a counter-Chriſt, as the word Antichriſt doth alſo ſignifie.</p>

will appeare by theſe Arguments: Firſt, if Antichriſt were in the Apoſtles time and was to remaine untill the ſecond comming of Chriſt, then Antichriſt is not one ſingular man, but a ſucceſſion of men; but Antichriſt was in the Apoſtles time, and is to continue untill the ſecond comming of Chriſt, as both Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.) and <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 18. &amp; 4. 3. &amp; 2 <hi>John</hi> 7.) teſtifie. Therefore Antichriſt is not one ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, but a ſucceſſion of men. Secondly, that in the 7. and 11. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in 13. and 17. of the Revelations, is deſcribed under the name and figure of a Beaſt, is not one ſingular thing or perſon, but a whole ſtate or ſucceſſion: But Antichriſt in theſe places is deſcribed under the name and figure of a Beaſt: Therefore Antichriſt is not one ſingular perſon, but a whole ſtate or ſucceſſion. Thirdly, the ſeven heads of that Beaſt, which ſignifieth the Roman ſtate, are not ſo many perſons but ſo many heads or ſtates of Government, whereby the Common-wealth of the Romans hath been at divers times governed; the ſixth head was the ſtate of Emperours, the ſeventh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, as the Papiſts confeſſe, the eighth (which is alſo one of the ſeventh) the ſtate of Emperours revived: whereby it evidently appeareth, not onely that Antichriſt is not one man but alſo that the Pope (who is the ſeventh head) is Antichriſt; if the Reader would ſee the two former Arguments enlarged, and another added, not here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then let him read Biſhop <hi>Downame de Antichriſto,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 20. to 32. Page 16. this clauſe is deleted: Ob. Antichriſts name ſhall not be knowne untill he come, &amp;c. Anſw. 2. Secondly, Antichriſt is already come, yea, the Pope of Rome is this Antichriſt, as is abundantly proved by many of our Divines; and therefore his riſe, ſeat and name are knowne well enough: page 14. Ob. 5. Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife (the Pope is called the adverſary, or he who oppoſeth himſelfe againſt Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11. and is juſtly ſo called, becauſe he and his Divines doe maintaine aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions directly contrary to the word of Chriſt; one example we have in this verſe, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſaith, &amp;c. page 57. Ob. 3. Chriſt ſaith, unto me is given all power, therefore (Antichriſts imp) <hi>Pererius</hi> ſaith, the Pope hath power over Infidels; And a little after Anſw. 2. all power is given to Chriſt, therefore to the Pope, is a blaſphemous and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian conſequence, diſplaying the Pope to his colours, to be the Where in making himſelfe, or ſuffering himſelfe to be made equall with Chriſt, is obliterated.</p>

                     <p>The very ſame formall words were uſed in former Patents of collections for them in King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, and in the Patent dated the 29. of <hi>Jan.</hi> in the third yeere of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign by which this Patent was drawn: The Arch-biſhop peruſing this Patent brought to him by Maſter <hi>Rulie,</hi> after it had paſſed the Seale, grew extreamly cholerick at it, rated Maſter <hi>Ruly,</hi> (who pleaded ignorance of the cuſtomes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that the Patent was drawne by the Kings Atturney, according to former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, without any directions from himſelfe, who was a meer ſtranger) chid him very ſharply, threatned to ſuppreſſe the whole collection, detained the Patent under ſeale, and carrying it the next day to the Court, complained of it to the King, checked the Lord Keeper and Secretary <hi>Cooke,</hi> for letting ſuch a clauſe paſſe in the Patent, who ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified themſelves by former preſidents, by which they were guided; and by his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, wholly cancelled the Patent after it was ſealed; then cauſed a new Patent to be drawne, wherein this former clauſe was omitted, the King telling the Lord Keeper <hi>that the Arch-biſhop would have it altered, and therefore it muſt be done;</hi> which thereupon was done occordingly. Now the cauſe of all this ſtirre and anger of his Grace-ſhip againſt this clauſe, was onely becauſe it ſtiled thoſe of the Palatinate, <hi>profeſſors of the true Religion,</hi> &amp;c. and tacitely cenſured the Pope as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in this latter clauſe; <hi>Where as theſe religious and godly perſons might have enjoyed their estates and fortunes, if with other back-ſliders in the times of tryall, they would have ſubmitted themſelves to the Antichriſtian Yoke, and renounced or diſſembled the profeſſion of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> As was punctually atteſted upon oath by Maſter <hi>Wakerly</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hartlib.</hi> Of which more fully hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Now that all the forementioned purgations of paſſages againſt the Pope, and his being Antichriſt, proceeded originally from the Archbi. himſelfe, without any other motive but his own inherent affection to his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> and the Roman party, we ſhall moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently evidence to all the world, by a Letter of his to Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> the <hi>Biſhop of Exeter,</hi> ſigned with his owne hand, and Biſhop <hi>Hal's</hi> anſwer thereunto; the Originals of which Letters, Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> ſeized in his Study at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and atteſted at the Lords Barre, where they were both acknowledged and read in theſe enſuing tearmes.</p>

Which care or conſcience would men uſe which ſet out books, we ſhould not have ſo much froth and vanity in the world, as now 'tis full of.</p>
                           <p>But whereas you writ: Firſt, that the Booke grew into greater length under your pen them you expected; I cannot be ſorry for that, ſince that which you have added concerning <hi>Parker, Anti-Tilenus</hi> and <hi>Vedelius,</hi> ſeems to me very neceſſary: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

that you are pleaſed to ſubject the work to me, and to interpret it, that you meant not perſonally to me, becauſe I could not have time for other great occaſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe it, but by way of deſputation: Theſe are to let you know, that were my occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> greater then they are, I would not ſuffer a book of that Argument, and in theſe times, to paſſe without my owne particular View: And therefore, my Lord, theſe may tell you, that both my Chaplaines have read over your book and that ſince them, I have read it over my ſelfe very carefully, every line of it; and I have now put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of my Lord the Biſhop of <hi>Ely:</hi> and this thrice reading over hath been the cauſe why I did not give you a more ſpeedy account of it.</p>
                           <p>And now, my Lord, according to the freedome which you have given one, I muſt tell you, that I have here and there in my reading of it over, made bold to alter or leave out a phraſe or two, but have as yet varied nothing that is materiall; and indeed I ſhould think it very uncivill and unjuſt too, to vary any thing that is ſubſtantiall, without firſt acquainting you with it, that ſo it may be done either by your owne pen, or at the leaſt, not without your owne conſent.</p>
                           <p>The particulars which I chiefly inſiſt upon are theſe: Firſt, you doe extreamly well to diſtinguiſh the Scottiſh buſineſſe from the ſtate of the <hi>forraigne Churches; but yet to thoſe Churches and their Authors you are a little more favourable then our caſe will now beare:</hi> But this I conceive will be eaſily helpt, <hi>and that without preſſing too</hi>

For that which is but different by degree and circumſtantially, cannot be other then <hi>Iuris poſitivi;</hi> and the ancient word in the Fathers is, <hi>Ordinatio Epiſcopi;</hi> and our ordinary phraſe is of any of our <hi>Brethren the Biſhops, he is one of our Order:</hi> and why does the Church of <hi>England</hi> ordaine or conſecrate every one that is made a Biſhop, if it be but a Degree of the ſame Order? For when a Biſhop is tranſlated or made an Arch-biſhop, theras then no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, becauſe they are <hi>Iuris poſitivi,</hi> and onely degrees: Your Lordſhip is very neere a whole leafe upon this tranſition; I beſeech you weigh it well, and then let me have it altered by your owne pen, and the ſooner ſent the better.</p>

                     <p>This Letter was thus ſuperſcribed; <hi>To the moſt Reverend and moſt Honourable, my ſingular good Lord, the Lord Arch-biſhop of Canterbury his Grace, Primate of all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Metropolitane, Chancelour of Oxford, and one of the Lords of his Mijesties moſt honourable Privy Counſell, preſent theſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after the receit thereof, thus indorſed with the Arch-biſhops owne hand: <hi>Rec. Jan.</hi> 22. 1639. L. B. Exon. <hi>concerning ſome amendments in his book for Epiſcopacy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Letter of the Arch-biſhops, and the anſwer to it, beſides the grand deſigne of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61245:142"/>
                        <hi>aſſerting Epiſcopacy of divine Right and Institution,</hi> we may obſerve theſe conſiderable particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that he blames Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> for being a little too favourable to the forraigne Proteſtant Churches, and their authors. Secondly, for paſſing by the <hi>Sabatarians</hi> (or ſtrict obſervers of the Lords day) without any touch at all, which he deſires him to rectifie and help, by ſome touches of ſhapneſſe againſt them: this is his charity to the Proteſtants and Sabatarians (or Puritans of you pleaſe) they were too candidly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and therefore muſt be more harſhly dealt withall: but now on the other hand, mark his extraordinary affection to, and care of the Popes honour and reputation. He doth in the third place, tax the Biſhop for beſtowing the title of <hi>ANTICHRIST</hi> on him three or four times in his Book poſitively &amp; determinately. This was ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent crime, that he muſt needs acquaint the King himſelfe with it of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſpoſition, without any other Monitor, and procures a ſpeciall royall command to him from his Majeſty, to expunge thoſe ſcandalous and diſhonourable clauſes againſt his Holineſſe out of his Treatiſe. Fourthly, in the reaſon which he renders for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his Majeſty herewith, and deſiring him to make this change, there are theſe conſiderable things to be taken notice of: Firſt, that King <hi>James</hi> himſelfe did in his <hi>printed</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">His Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagiance, and Anſwer to Cardinall Perron.</note> 
                        <hi>Works,</hi> at large prove and declare the Pope to be Antichriſt, by very ſtrong proofes. Secondly, that when the Spaniſh match was in agitation, and the Popes Diſpenſation required for the facilitating of it (being one of the firſt Articles in the Marriage Treaty) he was challenged by the Pope and his agents for it, but not before. Thirdly, that King <hi>James</hi> hereupon to ſatisfie the Pope, and gaine his favour was put to a hard ſhift, and enforced to coyne a new diſtinction which he never thought of till then, to excuſe the matter: <hi>That he writ thou, not concludingly, but by way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument onely; &amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, that he made this anſwer and diſtinction when King <hi>Charles</hi> went into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and acquainted him with it by word of mouth, that he thereby might ſatisfie the Pope and his party. Fifthly, <hi>that this whole paſſage was knowne to him,</hi> and he privy to this ſecret, not knowne formerly to others; therefore he was certainly one of the Cabinet-counſell, who was privy to the Kings going into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to the private inſtructions given him by King <hi>James</hi> before his departure hence; yea, very likely one who ſuggeſted this diſtinction to King <hi>James,</hi> to pleaſe the Pope and promote the Match; and therefore HE COULD NOT BUT SPEAKE WITH THE KING ABOUT IT: who hereupon commanded this Biſhop, <hi>to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> his expreſſions in theſe particulars, and ſo not differ from the knowne judgement of his pious and learned Father, from whoſe orthodox judgement notwithſtanding the Arminians might freely diſſent both with his Majeſties and this Arch-prelats approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Whereupon we find that theſe paſſages were qualified according to his deſire, although Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> poſitive opinon in ſundry paſſages was, that <hi>the Pope was Antichriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All which conſidered, we may infallibly conclude from his owne pen, that all the forementioned purgations of paſſages againſt the Papacy, Pope, and his being Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, were made by this Arch-biſhops owne ſpeciall direction, without any other ſuggeſtion but his owne Romiſh Genius and good affection to the Pope, to induce a more eaſie reconciliation with him: and this in direct oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to the ſeverall Statutes of 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. 20. 21. 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 10. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 17. which tacitely define the Pope to be the Antichriſt, who did <hi>obfuſcate and wreſt Gods word &amp; Testament a long ſeaſon, from the ſpirituall and true meaning thereof, to his worldly and carnall affections, as pompe, glory avarice, ambition and tyranny; covering and ſhadowing the ſame with his humane and politick devices, traditions and inventions, ſet forth to promote and ſtabliſh his onely dominion, both upon the ſoules and alſo the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and goods of all Christian people, excluding Chriſt out of his Kingdome and rule of mans ſoule as much as he may, and all other temporall Kings and Princes out of their Dominions, which they ought to have by Gods law, upon the bodies and goods of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; whereby he did not onely rob the Kings Majesty, being onely the ſupreame head of this his Realme of England, immediately under God, of his honour, right and pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61245:142"/>
due unto him by the law of God, but ſpoyled this his Realme yeerly of innumerable treaſure, and with the loſſe of the ſame, deeemed the Kings loving and obedient Subjects, perſwading to them by his lawes, buls, and other his deceivable meanes, ſuch dreames, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and fantiſies, as by the ſame, many of them were ſeduced and conveyed unto ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and erronious openions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, to the book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> in the ſecond part of the Sermon for Whit-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, page 316. and the 6. Sermon againſt wilfull Rebellion, page 316. which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Pope to be Antichriſt in theſe tearmes: <hi>Whereſoever you find the ſpirit of envy, hatred, contention, robbery, murther, extortion, witchcraft, neeromancy, &amp;c. aſſure your ſelves that there is the ſpirit of the devil and not of God; albeit they pretend out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the world never ſo much holineſſe, &amp;c. ſuch were all the Popes and Prelates of Rome for the moſt part, as doth well appeare by the ſtory of their lives; and therefore they are worthily accounted among the number of the falſe Prophets, and falſe Christs, which deluded the world a long while: The Lord of heaven and earch defend us from their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and pride, that they never enter into his Vine-yard againe, &amp;c. and he of his great mercy ſo work in all mens hearts by the mighty power of the holy Ghoſt, that the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Goſpel of his Sonne Chriſt may be truly preached, truly received, and truly followed in all places, to the beating downe of ſinne, death, the Pope, the devil, and ALL THE KINGDOME OF ANTICHRIST, &amp;c. The Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>understanding the bruit blindneſſe, ignorance of Gods Word, and ſuperstition of Engliſh men, ond how much they were inclined to worſhip the</hi> BABYLONISH BEAST OF ROME.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to the 80. Article of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> defining <hi>the Biſhop of Rome, to be</hi> THE MAN OF SINNE, <hi>foretold in the holy Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to the Book of Common-prayer, appointed for the fifth of <hi>Novemb.</hi> ſtiling the Pope, Papiſts and Jeſuits, <hi>A Babyloniſh and Antichriſtian ſect;</hi> and to the Kings Letters Patents, forementioned; defining Popery to be an <hi>Antichriſtian Yoake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, to the Hymne, printed in the end of all our Pſalmes and Common-prayer books. <hi>From Turke and Pope defend us Lord, which both would thruſt out of his throne our Lord Jeſus Chriſt thy deare Sonne:</hi> and the prayer for private <hi>families,</hi> bound up with our Bibles and Common-prayer-books; <hi>confound Satan and Antichriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, to the whole torrent of our Proteſtant Martyrs, Writers, who define the <hi>Pope to be Antichriſt, yea the great Antichriſt, propheſied of in Scripture.</hi> This was the direct poſition of our godly, learned Martyr <hi>Walter Brute,</hi> who maintained it in a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, recorded by Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> in his Acts and Monuments, edit. 1641. vol.

Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> upon the Revelation; Doctor <hi>Crakenthorpe,</hi> his defence of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and of the Popes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Monarchy; and generally all other our eminenteſt Engliſh Writers of any note, till this Arch-biſhops reigne, have poſitively defined the Pope and Papacy to be the great Antichriſt, and proved the ſame at large: We ſhall cloſe up this with two of the Arch-biſhops predeceſſors reſolutions in this point. The firſt is Arch-biſhop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who as he refuſed to move or ſtirre his cap to the Popes Commiſſioners, when he was converted before them for his Religion, ſo he likewiſe profeſſedly averred the Pope to be the Artichriſt in theſe very termes, recorded by Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> in his Acts and Monuments, Vol. 3. Edit. 1641. p. 653. 660. 661. <q>The Biſhop of Rome, unleſſe he be Antichriſt, I cannot tell what to make of him; wherefore if I ſhould obey him, I cannot obey Chriſt: he is like the Devill in his doings, for the Devill ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>If thou wilt fall downe and worſhip me, I will give thee all the Kingdomes of the world:</hi> thus he tooke upon him to give that which was not his owne, even ſo the Biſhop of Rome giveth Princes their Crownes, being none of his owne; for where Princes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by election, either by ſucceſſion, either by inheritance, obtaine their Crowne, he ſaith that they ſhould have it from him: Chriſt ſaith, that Antichriſt ſhall be, and who ſhall he be? forſooth he that advanceth himſelfe above all other creatures: Now if there be none already that hath advanced himſelfe after ſuch ſort beſides the Pope; then in the mean time let him be Antichriſt, &amp;c. After which, he deſired all them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to beare him witneſſe, that he tooke the traditions and Religion of that uſurping Prelat to be moſt erronious, falſe, and againſt the doctrine of the whole Scripture, which he had often times wel proved by writing and the author of the ſame to be very Antichriſt, ſo often preached of by the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, in whom did moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur al ſignes and tokens, whereby he was painted out to the world to be known; for it was moſt evident, that he had advanced himſelfe above all Emperours and Kings of the world, whom he affirmed to hold their eſtates and Empires of him, as of their chiefe, &amp;c. He hath brought in gods of his owne framing, and invented a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on full of gaine and lucre quite contrary to the holy Scriptures, onely for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Kingdome, diſplacing Chriſt from his glory, and holding his people in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſervitude of blindneſſe, to the loſſe of a great number of ſoules, which God at the latter day ſhall exact at his hand, boaſting many times in his canons and decrees, that he can diſpence, <hi>contra Petrum, contra Paulum, contra vetus &amp; novum teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and that he, <hi>plenitudine poteſtatis, tantum prteſi, quantum Deus;</hi> that is againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> againſt the old and new Teſtament, and of the fulneſſe of power, may doe as much as God. O Lord, who ever heard ſuch blaſphemy! if there be any man that can advance himſelfe above him, let him be judged Antichriſt: This enemy of God and our Redemption is ſo evidently painted out of the Scriptures by ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſignes and tokens, which all ſo cleerly appeare in him, that except a man will ſhut up his eyes and heart againſt the light, he cannot but know him; and therefore for my part I will never give my conſent to the receiving of him into this Church of England: thus <hi>Cranmer</hi> reſigned at his death.</q> This Arch-prelat therefore hath ſhut his eyes and heart againſt this ſhining truth, in his godly Predeceſſors judgement, who not onely doubts, but denies the Pope to be the Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is Arch-biſhop <hi>Whitguift,</hi> who when he commenced Doctor, and anſwered the Divinity act at <hi>Cambridge</hi> anno 1569. publikely maintained this aſſertion in the Schooles, <hi>Papa eſt ille Ancichriſtus,</hi> as Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> records in his life, p. 5. which this Arch-biſhops immediate Predeceſſor. <hi>Abbot</hi> (to omit Arch-biſhop <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Gryndall)</hi> likewiſe poſitively aſſerted; and Doctor <hi>Uſher</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> in a Letter of his to this Arch-prelat expreſly he writes, <hi>that he did undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:61245:143"/>
                        <hi>the Pope to be Antichriſt;</hi> which title Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Downame,</hi> doe likewiſe poſitively beſtow upon the Pope, in ſome of their authorized impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it cannot be but a grand offence for this Arch-prelat and his agents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſtreame of all our Martyrs, Writers, Prelats, to purge all paſſages out of theſe new-printed books, againſt the Popes being Antichriſt; in which all Proteſtant Churches, confeſſions, Writers, unanimouſly concurre, together with our owne.</p>

Or elſe, Secondly, the Croſſe is an Altar by a humane uſe, or humane Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; now this is not ſufficient, becauſe ſo any thing may be made an Altar. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, we anſwer, &amp;c. unto theſe words; that there may be a Sacrifice without an Altar; this appeares evidently thus: Firſt, the offering up of <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22. was a true Sacrifice; for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a type of Chriſt, both in his immolation or offering, and in his death, and in his life; Chriſt dyed for us, and ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> did as it were in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine figure, according to that of the Apoſtle, Heb. 11. 19. <hi>Abraham received Iſaac from the dead in a figure and ſimilitude; Iſaac</hi> lived againe from this death; ſo Chriſt roſe againe from the dead. But yet in this ſacrifice of <hi>Iſaac</hi> there is no mention at all made of an <hi>Altar,</hi> Gen. 22. <hi>Iſaac</hi> verſe 7. ſaith, <hi>Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the Lamb for the burnt Offering?</hi> where we ſee, that he requires a Lambe, but he requires not an Altar; as if the one were neceſſary unto a Sacrifice, not the other. Secondly, what is more neceſſary for a feaſt or banquent then a Table, and yet a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet may be without a Table; whence the Martyrs when they were in priſon celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lords Supper without a Table: Now the Euchariſt is a banquet, yea moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a memoriall of this one ſacrifice of Chriſt in his death; and is often called a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and yet hath been celebrated often by many of the Fathers in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without a Table; as it is ſaid of <hi>Lucian,</hi> that he conſecrated the bread of the Lord, and celebrated the Supper of the Lord when he had ſcarce his hands at liberty, uſing his owne breaſt inſtead of a Table: and therefore it is evident, that there may be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice without an Altar. Thirdly, what is more neceſſary for a Preacher when he is to preach then a Pulpit? that is, it is very requiſite and decent, and profitable for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Miniſter ſhould ſpeak unto them out of the Pulpit, as <hi>Ezra</hi> did, Ezra 9. But yet it is not ſimply neceſſary unto the eſſence of a Sermon, for a man may preach upon the plaine ground without a pulpit, as it is ſaid of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divers perſons (in his perſecution) ſtanding not in a Pulpit, but at the ſide of the Lords Table; and therefore an Altar doth not appertaine unto the eſſence of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Fourthly, we anſwer, &amp;c. unto theſe words, Chriſt himſelfe being both the Knife, Oblation, Altar and Prieſt (it is ſaid, Heb. 9. 14. that <hi>Chriſt by his eternall ſpirit offered up himſelfe unto God;)</hi> whence it appeares, that his eternall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was a Prieſt to himſelfe, and therefore might alſo be an Altar.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, yet becauſe he is cleanſed but in part, and hath but a temporary faith, and ſome flaſhes of heavenly light, it is poſſible for him with <hi>Demas, to forſake the Gospel and embrace this preſent world;</hi> with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus, to make ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience:</hi> with <hi>Julian</hi> to become an <hi>Apoſtate</hi> and a perſecuter of the truth: in a word, he may depart from the ſeeming righteouſneſſe which he hath in the eyes of men, but not in the ſight of God, as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaketh; or from the true righteouſneſſe which he had in part, and that meaſure of ſanctification which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he received.</p>

                        <hi>An.</hi> The Cardinal here proves nothing againſt us, except he will prove, that thoſe who fall from the Lord, or whoſe charity waxeth cold, were ſuch as were righteous before God by a true faith, or who had the love and faith of the elect of God, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 1. now that theſe were not ſuch, is cleare from verſe 24: of this Chapt. they <hi>would ſeduce, if it were poſſible, the very elect:</hi> and from Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Charitas quae deſert poteſt nunquam ver a fuit;</hi> that love which falleth away, was never any true love, or charity which may be forſaken, was never true Charity.</p>
                     <p>In the printed book, fol. 334. (but in the Abridgement of purgations, page 83.) it is queſtioned between us and the Papiſts, whether Election or Predeſtination to life eternall, be from Gods free grace, or a fore-ſight of mans good workes and faith?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is agreed upon betwixt us and them, that there are ſome elected and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated and this is cleare from <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. and</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is agreed betwixt us alſo, that thoſe who are elected and predeſtinated, are elected unto an eternall Kingdome, as is plaine from <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. And,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is likewiſe agreed upon betwixt us, <hi>that thoſe who are elected unto life eternall, ſhall infallibly and certainly be ſaved:</hi> and this is proved from <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 22. 24. <hi>John.</hi> 6. 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 28, 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 29.</p>
                     <p>This was aſſented unto by the beſt eſteemed Divines in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and thought to be Catholike, becauſe it was conſonant to the opinions both of <hi>Thomas, Scotus,</hi> and the moſt School-writers, and alſo to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> himſelfe could not deny it: Read the <hi>Hiſtory of the Councel of Trent,</hi> lib. 2. p. 211. 212.

                     <p>Fourthly, the Papiſts affirme, that faith and works foreſeen, were the impulſive and moving cauſe of the decree of election unto life everlaſting.</p>

with true faith, and afterwards altogether loſt it, and fell from the grace of God; but becauſe they had received the law of God, &amp;c. unto theſe words: and this is the plaine and the direct meaning of our Saviour in this place, and makes nothing againſt the preſeverance of the faithfull, or as though thoſe who were once endued with true faith, and truly freed from Satan, might loſe their faith wholly, and fall into the hands and power of ſatan and periſh eternally, becauſe nothing leſſe then this can be deduced from this place.</p>

                        <hi>How may we know whether we are brought to Chriſt or not?</hi>

                     <p>We may know it by theſe ſignes, by which we muſt ſeriouſly try and examine <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> our ſelves; namely, examine firſt, if we perpetually meditate of Chriſt, if we think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> him day and night, if we be conjoyned to him in our hearts; then it is a ſigne that we are are brought unto him: Secondly, if we alwayes ſpeak of Chriſt, and <hi>that from the abundance of the heart,</hi> then it is a ſigne that we enjoy Chriſt, for a Veſſell ſendeth forth ſuch liquor as it hath within: Thirdly, if we alwayes depend upon Chriſt, flying ſtill to him as unto our only refuge, making him our <hi>Cornu-copia,</hi> and eſteeming him to be our Phyſitian, our Fountaine, our Righteouſneſſe, our Life our Light, our Vertue, our Way our Food, yea all in all, then it is a ſigne that we enjoy him. Fourthly, if Chriſt being awakened, anſwer and <hi>help us</hi> (as he did his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.) if being called upon he heare us, then it is a ſigne that he is in us, and remaines with us; if we can confidently and truly ſay with <hi>David, I will call upon the Lord, and then I ſhall be ſafe,</hi> Pſal. 18. 3. it is an argument of Chriſts preſence. Fifthly, if we be filled with joy and comfort in our ſoules, it is a ſigne that we are brought unto Chriſt, <hi>i. e. if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord, and againe rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4. 4. <hi>delighting our ſelves in him, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him, thinking all other things as droſſe,</hi> Mat. 13. 44. &amp;c.

Pet. 18. if he be honey in our mouth, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in our eares, and a rejoycing to our hearts, then it is a good argument that he lives with us, and lodgeth within us, 1 Pet. 1. 8. Sixthly, if we have peace within, that is, firſt the ſpirit of God witneſſing unto our ſpirits that we are the ſonnes of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. &amp; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 10. and ſecondly, the providence and protection of the Lord, ſecuring us from all want and danger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. and thirdly, we from this aſſurance caſting our ſelves boldy and confidently upon the Lord as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Pſa.</hi> 11. 1. &amp; 27. 1. 3. &amp; 56. 4. 11. &amp; 18. 6, 7. then we may be ſure that we are brought home truly unto Chriſt.

and ſuppreſſing our luſts, enabling us to ſee and to be ſenſible of thoſe ſinnes that hang ſo faſt on, and cleave ſo faſt too, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. yea making us with the ſenſe of them, to cry out with Saint <hi>Paul, me miſerum, O wretched man that I am who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. Yea, with the knowledge of the ſoare, giving us a knowledge of the ſalve, with the ſenſe of the malady, the fight of the remedy; and as thoſe who being ſtung with the fiery ſerpents, looked upon the brazen Serpent, ſo Chriſt with the ſight of our ſinnes, gives us a ſight of himſelf, our Saviour; and when we look upon our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions with horrour, then he turnes our eyes towards him for comfort 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Irae impetum cohibet, ſuperbia tumorem ſedat, livoris vulnus ſanat, luxuriae fluxum reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, libidinis flammum extinguit, ſitum avaritiae temperat, totius dedecoris pruriginem fugat, Bern.

                     <p>The Papiſts command Confeſsion for theſe two ends, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that their confeſsion
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61245:148"/>
may take away ſinnes with God, and this they labour and diſpute ſtrongly for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late many fables to prove it; if the ſtudious Reader deſire a view of their Fables, he may find ſome in <hi>Antidot.

                     <p>Ibidem part 1. pag. 115. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. ſeeing that it is lawfull, and in ſome caſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that ſome perſons ſhould ſometimes confeſſe ſome ſinnes unto their Paſtors, and that the Paſtor ſhould admoniſh and adviſe them hereunto (as was ſhewed, Mat. 3. 6.) when their conſciences are troubled with any ſinne, then whether ought Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to take an oath of ſecreſie, the rather to induce men to confeſſe freely? <hi>An.</hi> There are two things here to be conſidered of for the reſolution of this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, whether it be lawfull? And 2. whether it be expedient?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, we muſt conſider whether it be lawfull to take ſuch an Oath of ſecreſie or not?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I thinke no man denies (except the <hi>Anabaptiſts)</hi> that in generall it is lawfull by Gods law to take an oath, either firſt, aſſertory; ſecondly, promiſſory (upon weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cauſe) though it be not before a Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, although the poſitive law threaten a <hi>Premunire</hi> to him who impoſeth an oath without authority, yet I know no danger to him who aſſumes it willingly and voluntarily.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, whether this particular Oath be againſt our lawes, I want skill to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; for on the one ſide concealment (in ſome caſes) makes a man acceſſary though after the fact; and what may not be performed muſt not be promiſed, eſpecially by oath: On the other ſide, the ancient Canons of the Church forbid (upon great penalty) to reveale confeſſions; and our Law 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> confirme all the Canons that are not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Word of God, as I ſuppoſe this not to be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt conſider whether it be expedient or not; to take ſuch an Oath?</p>
                     <p>This is the greater Queſtion, and muſt be reſolved by the grounds moving it: for whatſoever is lawfull in this, muſt be judged fit or unfit, <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> according to the fit or unfit circumſtances which cloth it; firſt therefore, if firſt, the confitent (being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in conſcience, and deſirous to unfold his ſore) be hindred by feare or ſhame of publike diſcovery; and ſecondly, if there be no other end in the paſtor but to free him from this feare, I ſee no reaſon why he may not by ſuch a reverend proteſtation, aſſure him of that whereto his own office and conſcience bind him; for as the Canons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands concealment ſo <hi>Zozomen</hi> (ſpeaking of the times within three hundred yeers of Chriſt) ſaith, ſuch men as are burthened in conſcience, and deſire to unfold their griefes, muſt chooſe for their Confeſſor, a man upright of life, prudent, and <hi>ſecretorum tenacem,</hi> a faithfull concealer of ſecrets. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Miniſter uſe ſuch an oath as an aſſuring bait, to draw unwilling men to confeſſe, for the ſatisfying of his own curioſity or private ends, <hi>non laudo,</hi> it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be defended, commended, nor excuſed. But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I muſt adde, that ſeeing temptations lurk ſecretly in the heart, it is ſafer to leave them to the hearts great ſearcher, then to condemne them upon ungrounded ſuſpition unleſſe made evident by ſome diſcloſing circumſtances, wherein it is both more commendable and charitable to ſuſpect a great deale too little, then a little too much; <hi>hoc eſt conſilium fidele &amp; verax, &amp;c.</hi>

and unjuſtly oppreſſeth the Church and Common-wealth, and compelleth Subjects to commit adultery, and perſecutes true Religion with fire and faggot? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, it is lawfull for Miniſters to reprehend and rebuke the ſinnes of all who are under their charge, and conſequently Kings, Princes, Peers and Magiſtrates, when they offend; as is evident both by the examples of the Apoſtles and Prophets, and alſo from theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. In which place it is ſaid, that Paſtors ſhall give account for thoſe Magiſtrates which periſh under their charge. Secondly, it is lawfull for the inferiour and ſubordinate Magiſtrates to defend the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, when the ſupreame Magiſtrate degenerates, and falleth into tyranny or idolatry: for firſt, Kings are ſubject to their Common-wealths, at leaſt unto the law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1. 8. and ſecondly, it is the office of the inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate as well as the ſuperiour, to maintaine and defend the lives and ſafety of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and therefore although the ſuperiour Magiſtrate ſhould neglect his duty, yet the inferiour muſt not neglect theirs. Thirdly, it is not lawfull for any private perſon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take up arms for the defence of the inferiour Magiſtrates before a danger come, or for their owne defence in danger, or for the avenging of themſelves after danger, if they can be defended by an ordinary power; and this we gather from <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 26. Fourthly, it is lawfull even for a private perſon to reſiſt with weapons, if a tyrant like a theefe, ſhall offer violence unto him, either by himſelfe or by another, when he can neither obtain the relief and help of publike authority and power nor eſcape by any other meanes or way, for againſt whom it is lawfull for a man to defend himſelf by the Magiſtrate, againſt the ſame it is lawful to defend himſelf by himſelf in a caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: as for example: If a King in his anger ſhould command one of his followers to kill ſuch a one, or ſhould run upon him himſelfe with his ſword drawne, intending to kill him, if that man could neither be delivered by the law or government of the Land, nor by flight could eſcape away, he might then lawfully with his ſword in his hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe even againſt the King himſelfe, but he muſt not offend the King, nor lay his hand upon the Lords anointed for the very law of nature teacheth men to defend themſelves, and to maintaine their lives againſt all the unjuſt aſſaults and practiſes of any whatſoever. Fifthly, to take away defence of himſelfe from a private perſon againſt a tyrant, is to eſtabliſh tyranny, for the law of God doth principally require the ſociety of humane converſation, and therefore thoſe things that are <hi>Caeſars</hi> are to be given to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> neither is he to be reſiſted, ſo long as he doth not oppoſe himſelfe againſt God, commanding ſome wicked Religion, or ſome wicked and unjuſt thing; for as Chriſt commands us to give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe things, ſo he commands us to give unto God thoſe things that be Gods; and God forbids us to give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe things which are not <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and therefore if <hi>Caeſar</hi> commands that which is repugnant to the command and will of God, we muſt not obey him, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 29.</p>
                     <p>In Doctor <hi>Iones</hi> his Comentary on the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> theſe ſentences are purged out, page 387. in the written, &amp; 493. in the printed copy: It is comparitively ſpoken, all the Statutes, Edicts and Commandements that proceed from Kings, are not to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>Saul</hi> commanded the Serjeants to lay violent hands on the Prieſts, but they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not a hand to doe it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> made a proclamation, that all Nations and kinreds ſhould fall downe and worſhip his golden Image, yet the three children would not doe it, they choſe rather to be caſt into the fiery furnace; <hi>Darius</hi> made a Decree, none ſhould pray to any God, and yet <hi>Daniel</hi> he feared not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, ſtill he prayed to the God of Iſrael; ſo <hi>Pharaoh</hi> gave commandement that the Egyptians children ſhould be throwne into the River, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> Parents fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, and choſe rather to obey God then man: If the Kings commandement be according to Gods commandement, then obey it, if it be repugnant, then it is an excellent demand, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. whether it be right in the ſight of God, to obey you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then God, judge ye? children, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> obey your parents in the Lord; ſo, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects obey your Kings in the Lord; what reaſon is there we ſhould obey man above God? honour Kings as Gods Vice-gerents, be thankfull to God for Kings, yea though they be wicked ones, for a tyranny is better then anarchy; pray for Kings, reverence

                     <p>Secondly we anſwer; that Baptiſme onely bindeth us to keep the Commandements of God, and ſo farre forth onely to obey men, as they command things lawfull; but we muſt not be brought in bondage to mens traditions and obſervations, ſeeing we are the Lords free men and by baptiſme are conſecrated to his ſervice; and this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme from this place, Goe and teach, baptizing them &amp;c and teaching them to obſerve all that I command you; therfore baptiſme bindeth in only to the obſervation of Gods precepts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. ye are bought with a price, be not the ſervants of men: Baptiſme is a ſigne of the death of Chriſt the price of our redemption therefore we are freed from all meere humane ſervice in the receiving of Baptiſme, and for this cauſe it is called the baptiſme of Chriſt: <hi>Augustin</hi> (Contr.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Pererius</hi> the Jeſuit ſaith, there is a three-fold pre-eminence of Baptiſme above Circumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, in the facility and eaſineſſe of it, it not being ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; ſecondly, in the univerſality of it, it being free for both ſexes and all Nations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt; and thirdly, in the efficacy thereof, becauſe Baptiſme abſolveth a man from all ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we willingly acknowledge the two firſt poynts of preheminence, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject juſtly the third, becauſe neither Circumciſion then, nor Baptiſme now hath any ſuch efficacy, actually to give remiſſion of ſinnes; for if it were ſo, then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that every one who is baptized it ſurely ſaved, his ſinnes being remitted; or elſe, that his ſinnes being remitted returne againe: But God uſeth not, where he hath once forgiven ſinnes, to remember them any more <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 22.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Baptiſme we confeſſe in ſignification and repreſentation, is more rich then circumciſion was, waſhing being a more lively reſemblance of our eleanſing in the blood of Chriſt; and beſides, it is a commemoration of a benefit performed, whereas
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61245:150"/>
Circumciſion was a type of the ſame to be exhibited: But for the efficacy there is no difference, ſeeing they both are ſeales and confirmations of faith for the remiſſion of ſinnes, and not actuall conferrers and beſtowers of grace, although they are (by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituti on of Chriſt) meanes and inſtruments of conveying grace upon the elect.</p>

                        </gap>es, fictious, and things that never were in <hi>rerum natura:</hi> Thus they teach us to worſhip Saint <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> Sanit <hi>George,</hi> Saint <hi>Katherine,</hi> and many hundreds more which cannot be proved to have been, or at leaſt, not Saints, but ſome of them grand impoſtors. Thirdly, they teach us to worſhip vile and baſe things, as peeces of rotten wood, making then beleeve they were peeces of Chriſts Croſſe, and old thred-bare garments, for ſome ſacred Veſtments, although the Prieſts themſelves knew them to be otherwiſe; yea the Euchariſticall wafer-cakes, although they have been conſecrated flightly, the Prieſt thinking of ſome other thing elſe, and not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the conſecration thereof, which (according to their owne doctrine) is not then tranſubſtantiated, and therfore is palpable idolatry to fal down to a bare piece of bread. Fourthly they teach us to place Religion in outward things, as in the obſervation of dayes, meats, apparrell, and the like, Col. 2. 17. 18. None of all which things we are taught to doe in the Word of God, and therefore we had need beware of this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuperſtition.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is a blindneſſe of prophaneneſſe, which is twofold; <hi>to wit,</hi> either <hi>Pura negationis,</hi> or <hi>Pravae dispoſitionis,</hi> i. e. either naturall, or affected ignorance: Firſt there is in us a naturall ignorance, we by nature not knowing thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the glory of God, or our owne ſalvation; and this blindneſſe is in all, even in the elect untill they be enlightned by the Spirit of God. Secondly, there is an affected ignorance, when men refuſe the meanes of knowledge, like thoſe deafe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that ſtop their eares againſt the voyce of the charmer, charme he never ſo wiſely: Now this blindneſſe of heart is alſo in every man by nature, for as naturally we know not our duty towards God, ſo naturally we deſire not the knowledge thereof, but are backward and negligent in the uſe of thoſe meanes, which God hath appointed for the curing of this blindneſſe.</p>
                     <p>And this, Ibidem page 365. Becauſe our Saviour doth acknowledge the powring of this precious oyntment upon him <hi>to be a good work,</hi> it may therefore be demanded if the Papiſts doe not well, who worſhip the Lord in great coſt and pomp? Firſt, Chriſt prayſed the precious oyntment, not as an ordinary worſhip, which ſhould alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he imitated, but onely as a ſingular miniſtery of his funerall, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>ſhee did it for my buriall:</hi> But Chriſt now is aſcended into Heaven, and is no more to be buried, and therefore this fact of <hi>Maries</hi> will he no ground for the <hi>Popiſh pompom worſhip:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>Popiſh pompous worſhip</hi> is full of <hi>ſuperstition</hi> and idolatry, but in this anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there was none, and therefore it will not ſupport their pomp: Thirdly, when Chriſt departed from the world to Heaven, he left behind him in his ſtead the poore, commanding us to honour him by our bounty toward them; and therefore if we would beſtow our liberality aright, we ſhould enrich or refreſh with our ſubſtance the poore members of Chriſt, for he doth accept <hi>of that which is done unto them, as done unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> Heb. 13. 16.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe rites which are uſed at this day by the Papiſts, contrary to the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, and practice of the Apoſtles: Now theſe rites are either before the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament, or in the time of the celebration of the Sacrament, or after the celebration thereof.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, before the celebration of the Sacrament they have theſe ceremonies: firſt, the Prieſt breathes in the child's face, that he may receive the holy Ghoſt; ſecondly, they have their exorciſmes, adjurations, or conjurations, whereby the devill is conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, adjured, and commanded to depart from the ſoule of the Infant to be baptized, and to give way unto the holy Ghoſt, who now is at hand: thirdly, then the Prieſt reads certaine prayers belonging to this adi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ration; and then fourthly, he ſolemnly conſecrates the Font, wherein the water of Baptiſme is.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the rites uſed by the Papiſts in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, are many: Firſt, the Prieſt takes the child by the ſhoulders, and turning his head towards the eaſt, dips his face once in the water, with theſe words; <hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father;</hi> Then he turnes the Infants head towards the north, dipping him againe with theſe words? <hi>And in the name of the Sonne;</hi> laſtly, he bends his head unto the ſouth, dipping him the third time, with theſe words; <hi>And the name of the Holy ghoſt:</hi> And thus by this threefold turning of the child, is formed or made the croſſe of Chriſt (into whoſe death the Infant is baptized) after the manner in the margent. Secondly, <note place="margin">TSouth. North.</note> beſides the Symboll of water in baptiſme, the Papiſts uſe ſalt, which is put into the mouth of the child baptized, which ſignifies wiſdome and prudence of ſpeech, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the advice of the Apoſſle, Let all your words be ſeaſoned with ſalt, <hi>i. e.</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdome. Thirdly, they then uſe ſpittle, wherewith firſt, the eares are touched, which ſignifies, that he that is baptized, ought to have his eares open to heare the word of God, and the the principles of Religion: And ſecondly, therewith alſo the mouth is touched, together with the word <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ta,</hi> ſignifying, that he ſhould be alwayes prompt and ready to ſpeak of Religion and the word of God. Fourthly, then they make the ſigne of the croſſe, whereof they have a manifold uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, they make a croſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the childs breſt, ſignifying thereby, that he ought to have and receive the faith of Chriſt crucified in his heart, according to that of the Apoſtle, With the heart man beleeeves unto righteouſneſſe: Secondly, they make a croſſe upon the childs forehead, which ſignifies, that he muſt not be aſhamed to confeſſe Chriſt, becauſe bluſhing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the forehead, according to that of the Apoſtle, With the mouth confeſſion in made unto ſalvation; now this croſſe is made with the Prieſts thumb: Thirdly, they
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61245:152"/>
make a croſſe upon the eares of the Infant, and this croſſe is made with ſpittle, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the eares of his heart ſhould be alwayes ſhut againſt the ſuggeſtions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan: Fourthly, they make a croſſe upon the Infants mouth, and this is made with ſpittle alſo, ſignifying, that the child ſhould have his mouth alwayes ſhut, leaſt he ſhould ſpeak evill words: Fifthly, they make a croſſe with ſpittle upon his noſe alſo, ſignifying thereby, firſt, that he ſhould ſend forth a good ſmell and ſavour of Chriſt in his life and converſation; and ſecondly, that he ſhould frequently offer unto God the fumes and incenſe of devout and holy prayers, by which the devill may be ſmoked out of doors, as <hi>Tobie</hi> did the evill ſpirit, chap. 6. ver. 16, 17: Sixthly, they make a croſſe upon the childs breſt and ſhoulder blades, with their conjuring oyle, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby, that the party baptized ſhould be ſtrong and couragious in the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of Satan, and reſolute in bringing forth the fruits of repentance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, after the Sacrament of baptiſme is adminiſtred, the Prieſt doth theſe things unto the party baptized <hi>(viz.)</hi> firſt, he anoynts him with chryme, or conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted oyle, which ſignifies the vertue or grace of the ſpirit of God, which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by, and in baptiſme: Secondly, he then gives unto him a white garment, which ſignifies a Sacramentall or Baptiſmall innocency, or that, how he is made pure, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and immaculate, both from the guilt and ſtaine of ſinne: Thirdly, he puts into his hand a wax taper, lighted, which ſignifies, firſt, the light of faith, which is given in Baptiſme; and ſecondly, that now he is tranſlated out of the kingdome of darkneſſe into the kingdome of light: Fourthly, ſometimes they give unto ſome milke and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to taſte, whereby it ſignified, a right or title to eternall life, a figure whereof was the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which flowed with milk and honey. All theſe and divers other ſuperſtitious rites the Papiſts ſuperſtitiouſly obſerve in the celebration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme, contrary to Chriſts inſtitution and the Apoſtles practice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great reaſon that they ſhould be aboliſhed. If any think I falſifie the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts by what I have ſaid, or deſire to be more throughly informed concerning their practices, additions and ſuperſtitions, ceremonies in this Sacrament of Baptiſme, then let him well conſider theſe Authors and teſtimonies which follow, and he ſhall find all and a great deal more then I have ſet down, <hi>Manipulus curatorum de Baptiſme,</hi> cap. 8. fol. 14. 15. <hi>Pupilla Oculi</hi> de Baptiſmo, cap. 7. fol. 8. 9. <hi>Tertul.</hi> fol. 329.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Papiſts affirme, the Church of Chriſt to be alwayes viſible, and would confirme it from this verſe thus: That which Chriſt ordained to be the light of the world is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <note place="margin">Obj.</note> viſible; but Chriſt ordained the church to be the light of the world in this verſe: Therefore the Church is alwayes viſible.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the major propoſition is falſe, that every light is alwayes viſible, and therefore although we ſhould grant the Church to be the light of the world, which it is, yet it <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> would not follow from thence that it is alwayes viſible, for theſe two cauſes <hi>(viz.)</hi> firſt becauſe the Sunne and Moon were ordained to be great lights <hi>(Gen.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>&amp; Pſ.</hi> 136. 8.) for the governing of day and night, and yet we ſee them often darkned, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſtrong eclipſes; ſo the Church, though it be ordained to enlighten the world, by miniſtring the doctrine of the Scriptures, yet ſometimes it may faile out of mens ſights, as hath been ſhewed elſewhere, <hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 14. Secondly, though the Church be a light, yet ſuch as walk in darkneſſe, loving that better then the light, doe not alwayes ſee it, but went either will or eyes thereto: thus the King of <hi>Aram's</hi> ſouldiers neither ſaw the Horſes nor Chariots of fire that were round about <hi>Eliſha,</hi> nor knew that they were in the midſt of <hi>Samaria</hi> untill their eyes were opened.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the minor propoſition is falſe alſo; for although the light of the Church be granted, yet it is not true, that Chriſt our Saviour ordained it is to be alwayes the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61245:152"/>
light of the world, according to this verſe, <hi>yee are the light of the world,</hi> for theſe words were ſpoken by Chriſt to his Diſciples, and his purpoſe therein was not to teach what the ſtate of the Church ſhould alwayes be, but to provoke them to conſtancy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, becauſe they ſhould be in every mans eyes, and therefore if they chanced to doe otherwiſe then well, it could be concealed no more then the light of the Sunne; now this is nothing to the Churches viſibility: If the Reader deſire to ſee this argument more fully anſwered and enlarged, let him read our cleer and lilly <hi>White,</hi> in his Way to the true Church, fol. 90 91. 92.</p>

                     <p>The Papiſts hold, that the true Catholike Church is alwayes viſible and <hi>Becanus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove it from the Parable thus; Chriſt here compares his Church to a net <note place="margin">Obj.</note> caſt into the ſea which gathers of all ſorts of fiſh ſome, now this cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but of the viſible Church, becauſe the Proteſtants, who hold two Churches, the one inviſible the other viſible, doe thus diſtinguſh them; that in the inviſible are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who are predeſtinated unto ſalvation, but in the other, namely, the viſible, are good and bad mixed together; but in the Church which our Saviour ſpeaks hereof, are good and bad commixed; and therefore he ſpeaks of the viſible Church, yea and alſo of the true Church; and therefore the true Church is viſible.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is falſe that the Proteſtants hold two diſtinct true Churches.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Becanus</hi> fights with his owne ſhadow, concluding nothing againſt us; <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that Church in which are good and bad mixed together, is not the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church, but a particular, becauſe the Catholike church is an aſſembly of men, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by an internall vocation, that is, a ſociety or company which conſiſts onely of thoſe, who are both elected and called.</p>

                     <p>The Papiſts produce theſe words, <hi>ſuper hanc Petram,</hi> upon this rock, &amp;c. to prove, <note place="margin">Obj.</note> that the true church of Chriſt is alwayes conſpicuous and viſible; arguing thus; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this rock upon which Chriſt promiſes to build his church, we underſtand Chriſt or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Peter's</hi> confeſſion; yet alwayes the foundation is ſome ſenſible thing, and therefore the church is ſenſible; becauſe although now we neither ſee <hi>Peter</hi> nor Chriſt, his Lord, yet then (when Chriſt ſpake this) both of them were obvious to ſight, and now they are ſeene in their Vicar the Pope, <hi>Bellarmine de Eccleſ. Milit.</hi> lib. 3. ca. 11.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the Cardinall changeth his tearmes, for it is one thing to be ſenſible, another <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> to be viſible: many things being ſenſible which are not viſible, as ſounds, the wind and the like.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the foundation of the church is Chriſt, and not <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore he begs the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we deny the antecedent, and his probation proves it not, becauſe Chriſt as he was the foundation of the Church, was not viſible; he not being her foundation, as he was man, but as he was God and man; yea he is a Mediator for thoſe who beleeve on him, and not thoſe who ſee him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Jeſuit playes the Sophiſter, committing a fallacy <hi>Ab hemonyma Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi> the word <hi>church</hi> being ambiguous, ſignifying either a viſible ſociety (and ſo it ſignifieth not in this place) or elſe the univerſall and myſticall body of Chriſt, and ſo it is taken by our Saviour here.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, the compariſon (in theſe words) betwixt the comming of Chriſt and the lightning, doth not reſpect the place, but the cleare and ſodaine apparition of both, &amp;c. All this is expunged.</p>

What meane our adverſaries then to ſpend ſo much in embelliſhing their churches, and ſo little in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their ſoules? to lay out ſo much coſt upon the materiall, and ſo little upon the ſpirituall Temple of God? Their rood-lofts they paint, their pillars they engrave, their timber they carve, their Images they clothe, their pictures they cover, their ſtone Altars they guild, their croſſes they ſet about with jewels and precious ſtones; they have gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Miters, golden Veſſels, golden ſhrines, golden bels, golden ſnuffers, all golden, ſave the ordinary Prieſts: who, if <hi>Boniface</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> his obſervation be true, for the moſt part are wooden or leaden.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Papiſts generally urge this place for the eſtabliſhing of their Evangelicall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels <note place="margin">Obj.</note> unto perfection.</p>
                     <p>But there are no ſuch councels as theſe, which the Papiſts would eſtabliſh from this <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> place, <hi>to wit,</hi> firſt, Free, which may be done or not done, as we pleaſe, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne: ſecondly, councels unto perfection: and thirdly, unto merit; the truth of this anſwer appeares thus <hi>(viz.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe this word Councell, is taken for the feare of God, <hi>conſilium preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit te,</hi> councell ſhall preſerve thee; read Proverbs 2. 11. &amp; 8. 12, 13, 14. &amp; 12. 15. &amp; 19. 20. Heare councell and receive inſtruction: and ſecondly, becauſe no good thing in it ſelfe is free, the Commandements of God being the rule of good, and therefore whatſoever is ſimply good, is poſitively commanded; and what is not included in the morrall law, is not in it ſelfe good, but will worſhip: and thirdly, becauſe every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of good is preſcribed and enjoyned, <hi>be ye perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect,</hi> Matth. 5. 48. ſaith Chriſt: Now although we can never attaine unto this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet we muſt endeavour thereunto: and fourthly, becauſe we deſerve nothing at Gods hands, but onely by the obedience of the Commandements, <hi>i. e;</hi> if there be any merit, it is in the obedience of the law; if Adam had merited, it had been by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was commanded, not that which was not required; for when by ſuch things we deſire to pleaſe God, he will ſay, who hath required theſe things at your hands? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 12. and therefore little hope can the Papiſts have to merit Heaven by their monaſticall vowes, whether generall or particular.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they have generall vowes, namely, firſt, the vow of poverty, and yet ſcarce any faire Mannours richer then their Monaſteries; Secondly chaſtity, which is like a painted Sepulcher, their Abbies and Nunneries being <hi>Dens of Sodomites:</hi> thirdly, obedience to humane traditions, rather then the commandements of God, whence the rules of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> or Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> or lame <hi>Loyola,</hi> are more ſtrictly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved then the rules of Chriſt or word of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they have particular vowes, as firſt, not to touch ſilver with their hands, but yet they may receive it in their hoods; ſecondly, not to touch fleſh; thirdly, to weare haire ſhirts, and the like. If the learned Reader deſire further proofe and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this particular, I referre him to <hi>Hospmian de Origine Monachorus:</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe are no Evangelicall councels, although they may truly be called <hi>Minima,</hi> things of the leaſt moment or importance, which periſh in the uſing, affording neither comfort nor true profit unto the uſer or obſerver of them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Comentary on <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. written copy, page 405. the Licencer hath gelded out this diſcourſe:</p>
                     <p>From theſe words <hi>(Teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you)</hi> I lay downe this propoſition, <hi>That there are no Evangelicall counſels of perfection unto ſuperogation:</hi> for the underſtanding of this, I thus explaine the particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>(viz.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>conſilium,</hi> or councell, is either firſt, <hi>directionis,</hi> of direction: and of this theſe ſpeak not; or ſecondly, <hi>preſcriptionis,</hi> of preſcription, for the preparing and informing of the ſoule, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18. now this the poſition underſtands, and it is twofold; namely, either firſt, this councell of preſcription is given <hi>injunctorie,</hi> by way of injunction; and thus we grant that there are Evangelicall councels: or ſecondly, theſe councels are given <hi>arbitrarie,</hi> arbitrarily, <hi>i. e.</hi> if we will doe them, we may, if we will not we may chooſe, and that without ſinne: now theſe the poſition ſpeaks, denying that there are my ſuch.</p>

                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:61245:154"/>
Secondly, <hi>Evangelium,</hi> Goſpell, is taken two manner of wayes, namely, either firſt for holy Hiſtory; and thus Goſpell is not here meant: or ſecondly, for the doctrine of Chriſt; and thus it is taken in our <hi>Theſis:</hi> thirdly perfection, perfection is two fold; namely, either firſt, infinite in God; or ſecondly, finite; and this is either firſt, <hi>Patriae</hi> of glory, and of our country; which perfection the Angels and Saints have in Heaven; or ſecondly, <hi>via,</hi> of grace, or of the way; and this is the perfection the Saints have on earth, and it is a perfection either firſt, <hi>partium,</hi> of parts and kinds; or ſecondly, <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum,</hi> of degrees; and this is either firſt, accidentall, which conſiſts in removing of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles and lets, and this we grant: or ſecondly, eſſentiall; and this perfection is either firſt, neceſſary unto ſalvation, which is a full obſervation of the morall law, either by our ſelves or by another; or ſecondly profitable, which is not ſimply neceſſary unto ſalvation, but onely neceſſary for the obtaining of a more excellent degree of glory: now this perfection the Papiſts underſtand in their Evangelicall councels unto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and this perfection in our poſition we utterly deny.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> ſupererogation is two fold, <hi>to wit,</hi> either firſt, <hi>gradualis,</hi> when we performe the precepts of the law in a higher meaſure and degree then the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and thus our Rhemiſts underſtand the word, 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 9. 16. or ſecondly, <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> when we doe other good works beſides thoſe which are commanded in the law; and thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> underſtands the word, who further alſo ſaith, firſt, that theſe works of ſupererogation, doe merit a greater degree of glory; and alſo ſecondly, that they are communicable even unto others, <hi>i. e.</hi> that both, firſt, they ſatisfie for the ſinnes of others; and alſo ſecondly, help to ſupply the defects and wants of others, Remiſt. Teſt. 2 <hi>cor.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein doe we and the Papiſts agree, and wherein doe we differ in this poynt of councels of perfection unto ſupererogation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> firſt, we agree in this, that good things are either firſt, abſolutely good, and theſe are commanded; or ſecondly, reſpectively good, in regard of ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives councell concerning marriage in the times and places of perſecution, 1 <hi>cor.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we differ in three things: firſt <hi>Re,</hi> in the thing it ſelfe; for firſt, Papiſts ſay that councels are better then commands, and that a man ſhall obtaine a higher ſtate and a greater meaſure of glory in Heaven by the obedience of councels, then by the obedience of precepts: ſecondly, we ſay that councels are inferiour to commands, and differ from them, not in obligation, but in the object; becauſe firſt, commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are concerning things abſolutely good; but ſecondly, councels are of things reſpectively good; which when they are good cannot be omitted without fault.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we and the Papiſts differ <hi>forma,</hi> in the forme of theſe Evangelicall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; for they ſay they are arbitrary; but we ſay they are enjoyned: and thirdly, we and they differ <hi>fine,</hi> in the very end of them; for firſt, the Papiſts hold, that firſt, the works of councels merit a ſingular glory and a greater degree thereof; and ſecondly, that they ſatisfie for the temporall puniſhment of ſinne: ſecondly we hold neither of theſe, but onely that they are enjoyned as the works of our office and duty, whenſoever the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances doe concurre, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ibidem written copy, page 139. this is deleted, <hi>ſweare not at all:</hi> Obj. <hi>Sextus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis;</hi> and ſome other Papiſts ſay, that Chriſt here ſets downe a councell of perfection; not forbidding all ſwearing but rather wiſhing that men could ſo live in faith, love and truth, that there might be no uſe of an oath. <hi>Anſw.</hi> firſt, this is falſe, becauſe Chriſts words are not perſwaſory, but prohibitory, expreſly forbidding ſwearing.</p>

                        </gap>. this whole diſcourſe is expunged. <hi>What went you out to ſee?</hi> &amp;c. as theſe words, <hi>what went you out to ſee, a reed ſhaken with the wind?</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred (by way of reproofe) unto the people; ſo alſo theſe, they that weare ſoft clothing are in Kings houſes; doth our Saviour then ſimply tax the pomp and glory of Princes Courts?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, certainly there is pompe and coſt, and bravery in Princes Courts, which is not unlawfull: and that both becauſe it ſerves to the beauty, glory, and ornament of the place, and alſo becauſe the vulgar ſort are kept thereby the better in obedience and feare: Secondly, yet our Saviour ſeems ex conſequenti, to reprove and condemne the life of Courtiers, or the court-life; went you out to ſee a man clothed in ſoft ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? behold they that weare ſoft cloathing are in Kings houſes: as if he would ſay, a religious life and a court-life are not alike, for although the pomp, bravery and delights of Kings Courts be not immediately evill in themſelves, yet they leſſe ſuit and agree with Religion: Whence we may note,</p>
                     <p>That a ſoft, dainty, delicate and court-like life, hinders many from true Religion, or from being truly religious; it being the nature of pleaſure, to draw the mind along with it.</p>
                     <p>What things are ordinary in a court-life?</p>
                     <p>In Kings Courts theſe vices are moſt frequent and familiar; namely, firſt pride; it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with Courtiers to look high, to deſpiſe others, to over-prize themſelves and with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to think themſelves ſome great ones, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 2. Now Religion teacheth men to be humble and lowly, and to give place one unto another, and to ſtrive one to come after another; and not as many Courtiers frequently doe, who ſtrive, quarrell, juſtle and fight about the wals and precedency, Rom. 12. 10. 46. Secondly avarice, for they which have many things, want many; and they who ſpend much, want much; and according to the Proverb, rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul, i. e.</hi> extort from others to expend upon themſelves: Now Religion teacheth men to give almes, and to be liberall; but Kings Courts (although they teach not, yet at leaſt) practice rapire, oppreſſion and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of thoſe under them: Thirdly, pleaſure and delight; as we ſee in <hi>Dives,</hi> Luke 16. and hence men become more effeminate, unconſtant and unable to ſuffer any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, injuries, wrongs, or the like; whereas Religion teacheth men to ſuffer, and to want, and to be content in all eſtates, Phil. 1. 27. 29. &amp; 4. 10. James 4. 7. &amp;c. yea, the court-life being full of pomp and pleaſure, makes men more unable to reſiſt or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the temptations of Satan, the allurement of the world, or the ſuggeſtions of their owne corrupt nature, and more proue and ready to yeeld unto them: Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam was tempted in the Wilderneſſe but could not be conquered; but the firſt being aſſaulted in Paradiſe (a place of pleaſure) was eaſily overcome: Fourthly idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Courtiers (for the moſt part) are given to eating drinking, ſleeping and gaming, yea like the Iſraelites, ſpend the moſt part of their lives in theſe, Exod. 32. 6. but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teaches us to labour and take paines, yea to earne our bread with the ſweat of our browes, Gen. 3. and how can he labour in Religion who will not labour nor take paines in ſome worldly employment: Fifthly flattery; <hi>Aio, Aio,</hi> Courtiers can fawne and ſooth yea <hi>jurare in verba Magiſtri,</hi> ſweare what their Lords ſay: Now Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>acheth men to be couragious and bold, yea not to flatter, but rather to reprove offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61245:155"/>
to their face; as Chriſt ſaith, goe and tell <hi>Herod</hi> that Fox, and <hi>John</hi> boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him; for <hi>Herodias</hi> his brothers wife, and the King being angry with him for this, and caſting him into priſon, yea afterwards beheading him, the Courtiers willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permitting it.</p>
                     <p>Who are here to be blamed?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are deceived with the delights of a court-life, for it is not what it ſeems to be, but rather is like to a painted reed, or a beautifull raine-bow, as appeares thus; Firſt, court-favour and felicity laſt not long, for it is as ſlippery as an Ele, as fading as a flower, as brittle as glaſſe, and like graſſe upon the houſe top, which quickly withers. Secondly, court-felicity and delights are evill, corrupting the manners; for firſt, ſome obſerve, that there are but few truly good in Kings Courts: and ſecondly, if they be good at firſt, yet at laſt they are corrupted, as we ſee in <hi>Tyberius, Cal-gula, Commodus: Aula vel malos invenit, vel facit,</hi> the Court finds ſome bad, and ſo leaves them; the Court finds ſome good, but makes them bad; and therefore who would praiſe that barne or field that changeth the wheat into tares? or that cask that changeth the Wine into vinegar? or that veſſell which changeth the Oyle into Lees? Secondly, they are to blame who delight in proud apparell and fantaſticall faſhions; for firſt, it was never a thing of any good report in <hi>Solomon,</hi> gorgeous attire is not reproved, but yet we ſee that his bravery, proſperity and court-delights did ſo eneruate and weaken his mind and cauſe him ſo farre to decline, that many have queſtioned, whether ever he were renewed by repentance or not: Secondly, proud and gorgeous attire is alwayes taxed and blamed in Scripture, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. Yea thirdly, the bravery and faſhions of the Court are noxious and hurtfull unto the Country, who is too ready to imitate it herein: And fourthly, it is a fooliſh thing for a man to ſeeke praiſe by his apparrell, he being in his richeſt robes, no better then the Crowe, who braved it in borrowed plumes; yea, it is a wicked thing for a man to glory or be proud of his ſhame, as all thoſe doe who are proud of their apparell, it being but a covering of their ſhame, which vaile they had never uſed nor needed if they had not ſinned. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are here faulty who accuſtome themſelves to worldly pleaſures, paſtimes, and delights, as <hi>Dives</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. for this is a ſtrong cord of vanity, Iſa. 5. 18. and many have been enſnared with lawfull things, whom the devill could never captivate or draw unto groſſe and enormious ſinnes, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objects this place to prove, that Election or Predeſtination unto life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> is from a foreſight of good works, becauſe the Text ſaith, That the Lord gave <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuique ſecundum propriam virtutem five facultatem,</hi> to every one according to his owne ability.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, this place proves not the poynt, for theſe talents which are given to every one <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, according to his owne ability, doe not ſignifie life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and the reaſons hereof are plaine, namely; firſt, becauſe theſe talents were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted and communicated to all the ſervants, both to good and bad, profitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, which cannot be affirmed of life eternall: Secondly, becauſe theſe ſervants were to give an account of theſe talents disburſed unto them, which cannot (without great abſurdity) be affirmed of life eternall: Thirdly, becauſe a reward was given to theſe ſervants who had well imployed their talents after their rendring an account of the imployment thereof; but no reward is to be hoped for or expected after life eternall: and therefore this place proves nothing for ſalvation from a foreſight of works, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Maldonate</hi> thinks theſe words (according to every mans ability) to be added onely for the making up and perfecting of the Parable, not having any ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Parable, nor any thing intended thereby; now if <hi>Maldodates</hi> expoſition of this place be true, then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument is falſly founded hereupon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by Talents temporall graces may be meant, which God communicates both to good and bad, wicked and righteous; and thus not onely Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall vocation unto the faith, but alſo <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> not onely <hi>Peter</hi> was called to the Apoſtleſhip, but alſo <hi>Judas Iſcariot;</hi> and hence <hi>Fricius</hi> expounds this place, <hi>Haec Parabola de Talent is docet, dona mortalibus a Deo conceſſa,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> This Parable tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, that the gifts which are given by God unto men, if they be be carefully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and exerciſed, then they will encreaſe and be confirmed in them, but if they be neglected, they will be loſt and utterly extirpated: whence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> to ſtirre up and exerciſe the gifts of God in him; and therefore from hence, ſalvation from a forefihgt of works cannot be proved.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Janeſenius</hi> by theſe Talents underſtands thoſe gifts, which are called <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae gratis datae</hi> and not thoſe which are called <hi>gratiae gratum facientes:</hi> and therefore (if he ſay true) <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument is grounded upon a falſe foundation.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly; <hi>Ferus</hi> expounds theſe words thus, <hi>Unicuique ſecundam propriam virtutem, neque enim omnia omnibus conveniunt,</hi> &amp;c. to every one according to his proper facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe all things are not fit for all men; the body hath many members, and every member his ſeverall office; now if all were an eye, then where ſhould the hand or the foot be? thus he; and his meaning is, that God diſtributes not his Talents, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gifts to all in the ſame meaſure, but in a divers and different, according to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and ability, which is divers, and not in all the ſame; neither is this faculty or ability from thoſe in whom it is, but from him who diſtributes the Talents unto them, and therefore nothing can be concluded from hence for a foreſight of works: If any Reader would ſee a more full expoſition of this verſe, then let him read Doctor <hi>Mayer</hi> who is large upon it, page 291. 292. 293. if he would ſee a more full anſwer to the Objection, then I referre him to Doctor <hi>Sharp,</hi> Curſ. <hi>Theolog.</hi> de <hi>Praedeſt.</hi> page 28. obj. 15.</p>
                     <p>Ibidem written copy. fol. 354. on Matth. 25. 34. this clauſe is expunged: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Obj.</note> objects this place to prove, that both election and reprobation is from a foreſight of works; arguing thus; God at the day of judgement will no otherwiſe determine of thoſe things which then ſhall be, then as he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> decreed from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty becauſe his decree is immutable, <hi>James</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 13. &amp; 46. 10. But at the laſt judgement, in the execution of Gods decree, he will ſay, <hi>come ye faithfull:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61245:156"/>
from eternity God hath decreed, <hi>i. e.</hi> elected and reprobated for theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the propoſition is true concerning the matter and ſubject of Gods decree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the decree is immutable, but not concerning the forme, becauſe there was one forme of the decree, and there ſhall be another of the execution thereof.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the meaning of the propoſition be, that God will change nothing in the decree, but as he hath decreed all and every thing, ſo according to that decree ſhall the execution of every thing be; then the propoſition is true, but ſo underſtood the argument concludes nothing <hi>(viz.</hi> againſt us) this onely thence following; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he hath decreed from all eternity to ſave for faith, and to damne for unbeliefe, ſo ſhall the execution of the decree be; which is true, but concernes not the Queſtion in controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, is followes not, Chriſt will ſay, come ye faithfull, &amp;c. come for faiths ſake as for the meritorious or impulſive cauſe: for faith is the onely inſtrumentall cauſe and he intimates the impulſive cauſe, when he ſaith <hi>Benedictos patris,</hi> ye bleſſed of my Father; where is ſhewne, that their ſalvation did proceed from the free ſavour of God, becauſe God the Father of his free grace hath loved them in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the Kingdome of God be an inheritance, then it comes or fals unto us, becauſe we are the ſonnes of God by a free adoption: But it is called an inheritance, for he ſaith here, <hi>Hereditatis jure poſſidete,</hi> poſſeſſe this Kingdome by right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: Therefore it fals not unto us for our works ſake, but becauſe we are the adopted children of God in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Ibid page 358. on Matth. 25. 39. this ſentence is purged out: It is queſtioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> us and the Papiſts, whether election or predeſtination on to life eternall be from Gods free grace, or a foreſight of mans good works and faith?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is agreed upon betwixt us and them, that there are ſome elected and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and this is cleere from <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 16. &amp; 22. 14. &amp; 24. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, it is agreed betwixt us alſo, that thoſe who are elected and predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are elected to an eternall Kingdome, as is plaine from <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. And</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is agreed upon betwixt us, that thoſe who are elected unto life eternall ſhall infallibly and certainly be ſaved, and this is proved from <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 22. 24. <hi>John</hi> 6. 29. &amp; 10. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. &amp; 11. 29. This was aſſented unto by the beſt eſteemed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> and thought to be catholike, becauſe it was conſonant to the opinion both of <hi>Thomas, Scotus,</hi> and the moſt School-writers, and alſo to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Catharinus</hi> himſelfe could not deny it; reade the <hi>History of the Councell of Trent,</hi> lib. 2. page 211. 212. Yea, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe doth affirme as much plainly, <hi>De grat. &amp; lib. arbit.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 10. which is worth obſerving becauſe elſewhere he contradicts himſelfe, teaching, that the elect may fall from faith and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and utterly and eternally loſe both.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Papiſts affirme, that faith and works foreſeen were the impulſive and moving cauſe of the decree of election unto life everlaſting.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, we ſay, that the impulſive, and moving cauſe of the decree of election is only the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and good will, and free grace of God, and this we confirme from theſe places, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ibid. page 305. on Matth. 20. 8. <hi>Every man received a penny,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Rhemiſts (upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 2.) alleage theſe words to prove, <hi>That Predestination and Election is from a foreſight of works;</hi> they argue thus; the Maſter ſaith, <hi>call the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Obj.</note> 
                        <hi>and give them their reward;</hi> therefore God from all eternity hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to give the kingdome of Heaven to thoſe whom he foreſaw ſhould bring forth good fruits and works.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, our <hi>Rhemists</hi> doe not prove the poſition controverted between us and them; for the Queſtion is not, Whether God have ordained to give Heaven to thoſe whom he foreſaw ſhould bring forth good works? for this we doubt not of, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> plainly declareth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6. 10. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. but the Queſtion is this, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this foreſight of good workes were the cauſe of predeſtination and election?</hi> for this we deny, and this if they would doe any thing they ſhould prove.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:61245:157"/>
Secondly, this place ſpeaks not of predeſtination, but of the execution of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Now it followes not, works goe before the execution of predeſtination, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before predeſtination it ſelfe: Now that our Saviour ſpeaks here of the execution of predeſtination, is plaine from the very words: for firſt, it is ſaid, that ſome of the Labourers were hired in the morning, and ſome at other houres; and then afterwards, when it was night, the Lord of the Vineyard ſaid to his Steward, Call the Workmen: Now this can no way be underſtood of predeſtination, which was long before the firſt houre of the day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this place ſheweth, that good workes are the way to Heaven, wherein we muſt walk; but not that the decree of life hath reſpect to good works, for good works goe before the poſſeſſion of Heaven, but not before the decree and ordination.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> out of this place frameth a ſtrong contrary argument, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby, that election is altogether of grace, without any reſpect to works, ſee before 2 Anſw. to Obj. 1. fol. 258. <hi>a.</hi> the laſt line, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ibidem page 302. this is deleted: Fourthly, the Papiſts are faulty here, who affirme that the decree of ſalvation came from the foreſight of works, and ſo they make them <hi>primus Motor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ibidem in the written copy, fol. 245. Although we know not the reaſon why the Lord doth it: but more particularly, firſt, we muſt acknowledge the Lord to be juſt in the election of the godly; now the order of election is laid downe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. &amp; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. from whence and ſome other places, the order may be expreſſed thus, <hi>to wit,</hi> Firſt, God decreed to make Chriſt the head of his Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. then ſecondly, he ordained and decreed that there ſhould be a Church; and here, firſt, he decreed to create man; ſecondly, to permit him to fall; and thirdly, to repaire and recover ſome from their fall; and fourthly, to endow them with grace and ſaving faith. Secondly, we muſt acknowledge the Lord to be juſt in the reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked. Becauſe the diſſention of Divines is great in this point, I will ſpeak ſparingly thereof, and only lay downe the order of it, as I conceive it to be, and ſo leave it. Firſt, God decreed to create man; and ſecondly, God foreſaw that although man were created pure and immaculate, yet if he were left unto himſelfe, he would fall; and thirdly, God leaves man unto himſelfe, and permits him to fall; and fourthly, determines to offer the meanes of riſing againe, namely, Chriſt, and mercy in him, which he foreſaw would be flighted, and by many not received; then fifthly, for this contempt he juſtly reprobates them.</p>
                     <p>Ibidem fol. 319. 320. on Matth. 22. 14. It is affirmed by ſome, that there is a univerſall election, againſt which we urge this plaine place; <hi>Many are called, but few choſen;</hi> which place ſheweth, that although the externall meanes of ſalvation be offered to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet not all of them, but ſome onely are elected and choſen unto life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Huberus</hi> hereunto anſwers, that there is, firſt, a general election, which is of all who are called to the Kingdome of God, and outwardly profeſſe obedience; and ſecondly, there is a ſpeciall election, which is of thoſe who obey their calling, and indeed perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and continue in the faith unto the end; his meaning is, that few are elected, not in reſpect of any election and ſeparation made in the counſell and decree of God, but becauſe ſome amongſt many perſevere to the end.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, there can be no ſuch generall election, for what choice is there when all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently are received? An election therefore implyeth a receiving of ſome, and a refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of others: all therefore cannot be elected: Secondly, this were to confound vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and election, and to contradict Chriſt, many are called but not many are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: to ſay therefore that all or many are choſen, when Chriſt ſaigh, that but ſome, yea few onely are choſen, were to contradict his words: Thirdly, if the ſpeciall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction depend upon mans perſeverance and continuance, and not this, rather upon thee (that if ſome are ſaid to be elected, becauſe they perſevere, and not rather to perſevere becauſe they are elected) then are men the cauſe of their own election, and they chuſe God firſt: but this is contrary to the Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20, 15. &amp; i <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. &amp; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 20. the election therefore, of none dependeth upon their owne will, but upon the good will and pleaſure of God, &amp;c.</p>

Secondly, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and affirmative meanes to be freed from all evils are theſe; namely, firſt, faith and an internall and ſpirituall covenant with God; for unto ſuch as beleeve in God, and have made a covenant with him, many gracious promiſes are made in the Word, of help and ſuccour; and ſecondly, piety and a holy life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51. 7. and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hope fixed and built upon the promiſes of the Word. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>&amp; Heb.</hi> 13. 5. and fourthly, a remembrance of the Lords aſſiſtance and ſuccour, either towards our ſelves in former times, or towards ſome other, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 18. and fifthly, prayer unto God for help and ayd, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did; <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9, &amp;c. &amp; <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. and the Apoſtles <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 14. &amp;c.

                     <p>Thirdly, in regard of their adjunct: Firſt, either as they are conſidered alone by themſelves. Secondly, or together with the merits and interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly when we ſpeak of the appeaſing of Gods wrath, God may be conſidered either, firſt, as a Judge; ſecondly as a Father.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wrath may be appeaſed two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes: Firſt negatively, by ſubtracting the fuell thereof. Secondly poſitively, by extinguiſhing, as it were, the flame thereof, with ſomething elſe caſt upon it.</p>
                     <p>According to theſe diſtinctions, the truth in this point may be delivered in theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding inſertions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, no work done by any perſon out of the ſtate of grace, produceth any of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, works done by men in ſtate of grace, as they proceed from themſelves, are not without ſome flaine, nor are they ſimply approved of God, but in ſome reſpect onely.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the good works wrought through the help of grace, if they be conſidered by themſelves, without relation to Chriſts merits and interceſſion which covereth their imperfection and giveth them efficacy and a prevailing power with God produce none of the above named effects.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, works done by men in grace, as they proceed from Gods Spirit, and are improved by the merits and interceſſion of Chriſt, are the meanes and ſecondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of procuring unto us temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, God's wrath, as he is an angry Judge, can be appeaſed by nothing but by the blood of Chriſt and his infinite ſacrifice, which alone ſatisfieth his juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the anger of God, as he is a Father, and ſometimes ſeverely chaſteneth his children for their unthankfulneſſe and other ſianes, may be ſo farre appeaſed by them, that he will take his ſcourage from them, and beſtow new favours upon them; this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be appeaſed both privately, by breaking off their ſinnes, and thereby taking away the cauſe of his diſpleaſure; and alſo poſitively, by faſting, prayer and Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds; to conclude, as the flye in <hi>Martial,</hi> upon which there fell a drop of Amber and incloſed it, grew to be precious, and was ſold at a high rate, not for the flyes ſake, but for the Ambers; ſo the good works of Gods children, which of themſelves (eſpecially ſo farre as they proceed from them) are of little worth, yet confidered, <hi>quatincta ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Chriſti,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> ſpeaketh, as dyed with Chriſts blood, and covered all over and meloſed in the Amber of his merits, become precious in the eyes of God, and are in a faire ſenſe and conſtruction, both <hi>placatoria</hi> and <hi>improtatoria,</hi>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, works are called good, either firſt, indefinitely, as they are commanded in and by the law; or ſecondly peculiarly, as they are performed by ſome ſingular perſons; as it is one thing to deſire vertue in generall and another the vertue of <hi>Alcihiades</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates;</hi> as it is one thing to commend learning in generall, another the learning of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Cicero:</hi> ſo it is one thing to ſpeak of good works in generall, another of the good works of <hi>Peter, John</hi> or <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, theſe things premiſed, we grant, that works are abſolutely called good ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken indefinitely and as they are commanded; yea this verſe proves it, which ſpeaks not of works done by any particular perſon, but of thoſe which men ought to doe; there is none of ſound judgement can deny or doubt, but that we are ſo debters unto the Law, that we ought not onely to begin, but alſo to perfect that which the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes as perfectly good, and in all the parts thereof abſolute; but he were of unſound

judgement that hence would conclude, becauſe it is our duty to doe it, therefore we doe it, for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>that he doth not onely the good which he ought,</hi> but which he would doe: Thus I ſay, if we conſider the works as they are enjoyned, it is true that they may be called abſolutely good; but if we underſtand particularly the works of this or that man, then we deny that ever the Scripture cals them abſolutely good, neither doth the <hi>Cardinall</hi> prove this, becauſe (as was ſaid before) this place ſpeaks not of what is done, but of what ought to be done, <hi>Chamier, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Pelag.) not according to perfect righteouſneſſe, but as it is agreeable to our humane frailty; or, they are good in part, though not perfectly. <hi>Becanus</hi> yet urgeth this place for the proofe of this opinion of perfection of works; diſputing thus: The Apoſtles are commanded <hi>ſo to ſhine before men, that they may ſee their good works, and glorifie their Father which is in Heaven:</hi> But how ſhall men ſee their good works, if they all be damnable? or how ſhall their heavenly Father be glorified, if all they doe be contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and defiled with ſinne? <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh between humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine judgement; men ſee mens works as they are outwardly, and can goe no further, they onely perceive what is obvious to their ſenſes, and can neither ſee the heart, nor know whether that which is done be done according to all the circumſtances that are required thereunto. Now true righteouſneſſe is proper unto the heart, and it is the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that make the work more or leſſer, good or bad: and therefore although men ſee the good works of the righteous, which outwardly they ſhew forth and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God for them, yet it followes not hence, therefore thoſe works are in Gods ſight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, &amp;c.</p>

Ibid, on Mat. 11. 29. The Papiſts generally object this place to prove the poſſibility of the laws fulfilling; What is this <hi>light burden and ſweet yoke</hi> (ſay the Rhemiſts) but the Commandements of God? and therefore they are poſſible to be kept, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> de juſtific. lib. 4. cap. 11. and <hi>Vaſques,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and <hi>Salmeron,</hi> and the <hi>Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell:</hi> and <hi>Becauus</hi> urgeth this place to prove, <hi>that actuall obedience to the whole law is not onely poſſible, but alſo very eaſie to the regenerate and juſtified perſon:</hi> They argue thus:</p>
                     <p>That burden which is light may be carried without ſhrinking under it, that yoke which is eaſie is worne without paine, and thoſe Commandements which are not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, may be obſerved without difficulty: But ſuch is the morall law, <hi>My Yoke</hi> ſaith Chriſt here, <hi>is eaſie and my burden light;</hi> therefore the morall law may be eaſily obſerved.</p>
                     <p>I will for the ſatisfying of this Objection, give onely a double anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the point which they endeavour to prove, and then to the place which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage for their proofe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to the ſubſtance or matter, or ſubject matter of the Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That the law is poſſible and eaſie to be obſerved by the regenerate: I anſwer; the law of God is impoſſible to be kepr in ſuch perfection as God requireth, and therefore <hi>no man can be juſtified by the works of the law,</hi> Gal. 2. 16. &amp; 3. 11. Here obſerve theſe particulars, <hi>to wit,</hi> Firſt, the old Pelagians did wreſt this and the like places for this end, to prove the poſſibility of the fulfilling of the law, as appeares by <hi>Hierom</hi> (adverſ. Pelagian lib. 1. cap. 1. &amp; lib. 2. cap. 2. &amp; 4.) and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (de Perfect. Juſtific. <hi>contra Coeleſtium,</hi> &amp; de <hi>Natura &amp; Gratia contra Pelagian</hi> cap. 69.) and therefore we may note by the way, from whence the Papiſts and thoſe amongſt us, who hold this erronious tenet, took or learnt it, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ibid. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, &amp;c.</hi> this is purged out; The <hi>Papists</hi> hold that a <hi>man may perfectly obey, and fulfill the Law of God,</hi> and for the proofe hereof argue thus. If a man may doe more then the Law requires, then certainly he may doe as much. But a man may doe more then the Law requires; therefore he may doe as much. The minor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proves by the example of this young man, who telling Chriſt, that <hi>he had obſerved all the Commandements, and that from his youth,</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bid him doe <hi>one thing more,</hi> and then he ſhould be perfect <hi>(if thou wilt be perfect, goe ſell that thou haſt and give it to the poore, and follow me.)</hi> Now if the yong man had done this. he had done more then the Law required, in as much as whatſoever the Law required he had formerly obſerved, as he ſaid himſelfe; <hi>Hac omnia ſervavi a juventute,</hi> All theſe things have I obſerved from my youth up &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, this word <hi>More,</hi> may two manner of wayes be underſtood; namely, either, firſt ſimply it ſignifies ſomething which is not commanded; and in this ſenſe the conſequent is naught, <hi>viz.</hi> if a man may doe any one thing which is not enjoyned by the Law, then he may doe any thing which the Law enjoynes and commands; this followes not, for it is not neceſſary that that be done which is commanded, becauſe ſomething is done which is not commanded: as for example, the Sonne which was bidden to goe into the Vineyard, went not, and yet might at that time be doing ſome houſhold worke. <hi>Adam</hi> brake the Commandement given unto him, and yet ſewed figge-leaves to cover his ſhame, which he was not commanded to doe. Secondly, this word <hi>More</hi> may ſignifie ſome good thing over and above that which is commanded in the Law, or, after the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all theſe things which are preſcribed in the Law, to doe over and above ſome other good worke which is not preſcribed. Now in this ſence we grant the Major, but as abſolutely falle we deny the Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man may performe whatſoever is commanded in the Law, and other good things beſides which are not commanded. For there is no good thing at all beyond that good is commanded in the Law; otherwiſe the Law ſhould not be perfect, which is falſe by the very letter of the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8 9. yea thoſe things which are not contained in the Law, are in themſelves neither good nor bad but indifferent; and where they are made good, it is by thoſe things which are in the Law. As for example, to Faſt is not in it ſelfe a morall good worke,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61245:165"/>
but it is good if it be done for the love of God, and for the hatred of ſinne, or both, which are commanded in or by the Law. And therefore it is utterly falſe, That a man may performe a greater good worke then the Law enjoynes. Secondly to the proofe of the Minor, we anſwer two things: firſt, the yong man ſpeakes of a part not of the whole Law; that is, of the ſecond Table, not of the firſt, as appeares by the text: He demands of Chriſt, What he muſt doe to be ſaved? Chriſt anſwers, keep the Commandements, verſe 17. He demands againe, Which? Chriſt anſwers, Theſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and recites the precepts of the ſecond Table onely; whereunto the Phariſee replies in this ſort; <hi>all theſe precepts (viz.</hi> of the ſecond Table) <hi>have I kept from my youth.</hi> Now ſuppoſe a man could abſolutely and perfectly fulfill the ſecond Table, yet it followes not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fulfils the whole Law, for he may faile in his duty towards God; and he onely fulfils the Law, who performes his duty abſolutely both to God and Man. Secondly, the Cardinall playes the Sophiſter, committing the fallacy, called <hi>petitio principit,</hi> taking that for granted which is to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that the young man kept the whole Law, for without proofe we neither can nor may beleeve it, either upon the Jeſuites or Phariſees word: We (I ſay) doe not beleeve the teſtimony of this vaine young man touching his owne righteouſneſſe, vvho boaſted of keeping the ſecond Table in the outvvard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, vvhen as yet he vvanted inward charity towards his neighbour, and love towards his God; He avouched that he had kept all perfectly, and fulfilled that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi> and thereupon is ſo bold as to aske Chriſt <hi>what lacke I yet?</hi> Chriſt to convince him of his pride and wants, puts him thus to the triall, If thou haſt ſuch perfect charity tovvards man, then certainly if God command thee to beſtovv, not a part, but all thy goods upon the poore, upon promiſe of better things to thy ſelfe, thy duty unto God, and thy ſingular charity unto men vvill make thee do ſo; Goe then ſell all that thou haſt and give to the poore, &amp;c. upon vvhich ſpeciall command his covetous minde ſhevves it ſelfe: nay, it is plaine, he loved not his neighbour ſo vvell as his riches, neither is ſo dutifull to God, or charitable to the poore, as for either of their ſakes to part vvith his poſſeſſions; by vvhich he proclaime his heart to be full of covetouſneſſe, and void of faith in God and true charity tovvads his neighbour; and conſequently vvas farre from the obſervation of the vvhole Lavv.</p>

This Chapter may well be called <hi>the cut-throat of the Maſſe;</hi> it is ſtrange that the Papiſts reading it, are not aſhamed to uphold that <hi>Idol;</hi> for as no man dyes but once, ſo Chriſt was to be offered but once for the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſinnes: It is the moſt groſſe and fantaſticall aſſertion that ever was heard of, moſt repugnant to Scripture and reaſon.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, if the bread that Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, were turned into his owne body, he muſt of neceſsity have two bodies, the one held in the hand of the other.

Now againſt this, theſe words may be thus aptly objected; <hi>Every tree which bringeth forth not good fruit, it hewen down and caſt into the fire;</hi> but Infants vvho are vvithout the Covenant, are trees obnoxious of originall ſinne, vvhich brings forth no good fruit; therefore Infants that are without the Covenant, being guilty of originall ſin, ſhall be cut down and caſt into the fire, &amp;c.</p>

The major propoſition is proved from this verſe, <hi>He will burne up the chaffe with unquenchable fire.</hi> The minor propoſition is confirmed thus: It is neceſſary that ſuch as are poluted with originall ſinne, and not purged by the blood of Chriſt are either Chaffe or Wheat (and this the Papiſts I hope will not deny:) but they are not Wheat, becauſe they are not gathered into the Garner) for they ſay that ſuch as dye before Baptiſme, are not made partakers of the joyes of Heaven:) and therefore they are Chaffe prepared for the fire.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:61245:169"/>
two-fold, namely, firſt, when men are forced to ſweare againſt themſelves: this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, no man being bound to betray himſelf; <hi>In criminalibus, licet in contractibus,</hi> not in criminall offences, but in contracts and bargaines: for an oath may lawfully be adminiſtred and given unto a man, to anſwer whether he made any ſuch bargain or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (as is aledged) or not; but it never uſed to a thiefe or murderer: for in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall offences witneſſes muſt come in againſt a man, or he is acquitted by Law, and is never put to his oath to accuſe himſelfe. Secondly, Men are injuriouſly conſtrained to take an oath, <hi>De rebus ignotis,</hi> to anſwer they know not to what. This was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſliked and diſalowed by that famous Martyr <hi>John Lambert,</hi> in his anſwer to the Biſhops fourteenth Article, <hi>Fox</hi> fol. 1119. whereunto I referre the Reader.

Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> and ſome other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay, that Chriſt here ſets downe a councell of perfection, not forbidding all ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but rather wiſhing that men could ſo live in faith, love and truth, that there might be not uſe of an oath. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

Secondly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould be very wary how they enforce or conſtraine men to ſweare; becauſe, firſt, oftentimes they thus adde fuell unto the fire of Gods wrath, by making men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear themſelves; and therefore here it ſhould be conſidered, if it were not better to loſe the thing in queſtion, then to hazard the loſſe of our Brothers ſoule, by making him to perjure himſelfe. <hi>Paul</hi> would rather never eat fleſh while he lived, then offend his brother; and therefore he is far from <hi>Paul</hi> his charity, vvho for a thing of ſmal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue or moment, vvill drive his brother to perjury. Secondly, if thou beleeve him when he ſweare, vvhy vvilt thou not beleeve him, if he take ſome ſolemn proteſtation? An honorable perſon being called into the Senat at Athens to depoſe touching ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Senators vvould not have him to take the accuſtomed oath, knowing him to be a vertuous and honeſt man, <hi>Cicero orat. pro Balto.</hi> Thus except the matter be of very vveighty importance, vve ſhould conſider, Firſt, if he vvhom we deſire ſhould be put to his oath, fear the Lord, then he dare no more lye then forſwear himſelfe, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if he fear not the Lord, then how vvill he fear to forſwear himſelfe? And thus both Magiſtrates, and thoſe vvho are vvronged ſhould be very carefull not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain any offendor to ſwear, if by any other meanes the matter may be known or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61245:170"/>
not prevaile againſt any of the members of the true Church of Chriſt: but, that ſo long as they are the true members thereof, it is impoſſible that they ſhould be hardned by Satan or hell; that is, he promiſeth to the Church, ſo long as it remaines the Church of Chriſt, that the power of death ſhall not ſo prevaile againſt it, that it come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: but he doth not underſtand by the <hi>gates of hell,</hi> the craft, deceit and fraud of Satan, whereby he labours to ſeduce and enthrall ſome. Hereunto we anſwer; firſt, whatſoever is an adverſary to the building of the Church upon the Rock, or to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant adhering of the Church unto Chriſt, that is underſtood by the prevailing gates of hell, (for in theſe words he removes the contrary of that which before he had laid downe; <hi>upon this Rock will I build my Church:)</hi> but the fraudulent and crafty temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, which are effectuall or of force, to ſeduce or enthrall the faithfull are principall enemies to this building of the Church, and conſtant adhering unto Chriſt; and therefore theſe crafty and ſubtile tentations are underſtood by the gates of hell. Secondly, whatſoever comes out of the gates of hell, or hath its beginning from thence, that is here underſtood by this phraſe of the gates of hell; but the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan are hatched in hell, and come from thence; therefore they are here ment by the gates of hell. Thirdly, if the condemnation of the faithfull onely be underſtood here, by the gates of hell, then this promiſe may ſtand with the totall failing or falling away of the Church militant; (for then he ſhould promiſe nothing to the militant members of the Church, but onely to the dead, who dye in faith:) but this is repugnant to the intention of Chriſt in this place, and to the interpretation of all Writers, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Chriſtians. Fourthly, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, unto whom our Saviour here ſpeakes, ſeems otherwiſe to interpret theſe words then <hi>Socinus</hi> doth, 1 Pet. 2, 7, 8. where the Apoſtle teacheth, that unbeleevers and diſobedient perſons, who ſtumble at Chriſt and are offended with him, doe belong unto thoſe gates, which doe impugne and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault that building which conſiſts of living ſtones, and is founded upon the corner ſtone and true rocke, Jeſus Chriſt. Fiftly, the proportion or analogy ought to be obſerved, which our Saviour here intimates and implyes, betwixt two Cities; the one of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which hath her gates and keyes, verſe 19. and the other of hell; which by the gates of her plots, practiſes and provocations doe ſeek the ruine of the heavenly city. Now in this place our Saviour promiſeth (and would have us to beleeve it upon his word, that none of the plots, projects, aſſaults or batteries of the gates of hell ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt the heavenly City, the Church. And therefore ſeeing one City is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the other, and the gates of the one to the gates of the other; and the one <hi>(viz.</hi> the Church) is conſidered in the ſtate and condition of her preſent building; it is very requiſite that the other ſhould reſpect her preſent impugning and aſſaulting of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and conſequently, the craft, deceit, and fraud of Satan, whereby he labors to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, enthrall and deceive the members of the Church.</p>

And thus the Lord hath particular conſolations for all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſorts of his ſervants: And 12. lines after; They ſtand or fall to their owne Maſter; yea, they ſhall ſtand, and none (neither ſinne or Satan) ſhall be able to plucke them out of Chriſt's hand, <hi>John</hi> 10. 18.</p>

I will not be peremptory in ſo perplex a Queſtion as is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination; I will ſay as I conceive it, and ſubmit me to your cenſure. In the great Councell in Heaven (why name I heaven? heaven was not yet) God meaning to make manifeſt both his juſtice and his grace to the world, which he purpoſed to create in time, for the glory of them, both out of the whole maſſe of man, ſelected ſome, and refuſed the reſt: whom his mercy pretermitted thoſe his juſtice predeſſigned unto dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but whom his love elected, thoſe his grace ordained to finall ſalvation: The <hi>Tragick Poet</hi> could ſay, <hi>God whom he loveth, he ſaveth;</hi> what then his grace fore-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, his power in time effecteth, and his wiſdome manages and marſhalleth all the meanes; ſalvation onely is the end intended by his grace, but the meanes are many, that might come between: Grace hath a golden chaine of many links, ſalvation the laſt, but ſo faſtened to his fellows, that it cannot fail; adoption, redemption regeneration vocation, juſtification, ſanctification: adoption to the right and title of Gods ſonnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from death, regeneration by baptiſme, vocation by the Goſpell, iuſtification by faith, ſanctification by the ſpirit, all theſe <hi>Paul</hi> hath omitted, and named but the laſt, both as the moſt comfortable, and to which all the reſt doe purpoſely tend: Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the doome decreed to the reprobate; Gods juſtice ſentenceth them, but how and in what order, I liſt not to diſcourſe, for offending of weak conſciences: For the execution of which ſentence, there was ordained death and hell, and ſatan, and the evill day; death to attend them, hell to enjoy them, ſatan to torment them, and the evill day to judge and deliver them; The Elect alſo doe deſerve that doome; Gods curſe is juſtly incurred by their ſinne, but Gods goodneſſe travelled with good, which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61245:171"/>
decreed they ſhould be ſaved: Aske me not the Queſtion why God Almighty dealt not equally with all? It is already anſwered; God is juſt as well as gracious: Had he ſaved all, where then were his juſtice? had he damned all, where then were his grace? Reply not in thy reaſon, that God had he ſo pleaſed, might have been both juſt and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and yet have ſaved all: for Chriſt who ſatisfied his Father for the Elect, might alſo have ſo done (had he pleaſed) for the Reprobates: Alas! beſides, why made God choice of thee, and not of me? I muſt anſwer with Saint <hi>Paul, O homo tu quis eſt,</hi> Who art thou O man, that preſumeſt to plead with God? hath not the Potter power to make veſſels of his clay to what uſe himſelfe liſteth? As <hi>clay is to the Potter, ſo is man to God; he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> This project of Gods gracious love hath cauſed the Scripture by elegant Antonomoſie to caſt the name of it upon the meanes of it; Chriſt called not onely <hi>a Saviour,</hi> but <hi>ſalvation; Mine eyes</hi> (ſaith old <hi>Simeon) have ſeen my ſalvation;</hi> yea not Chriſt onely, that procured it, but the Goſpel alſo that proclaimes it; it is called Gods ſalvation, Acts 28. 28. for the Goſpell is the word of it; <hi>Paul</hi> cals it ſo, and Chriſt is <hi>the horne of it,</hi> old <hi>Zachary</hi> cals him ſo, a project worthy, &amp;c.</p>

A ſuppe of the Chalice, or a kiſſe of the <hi>Pax,</hi> offering to an Image, or creeping to a Croſſe, Pilgrimage, Oyle, Holy-water, purgers of ſinne; all, I thinke, all Popery is a purge: What meane the <hi>Priers flagellant,</hi> who whip their bodies, but to purge their ſinnes with their own blood, ſet ſcourgers to be ſelfe purgers, happily they will not be beholding unto Chriſts The Prophet ſayes, <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> but they thinke they are by theirs: ſhall I preſſe theſe purgers with this fourth tearme of my Text, <hi>per ſimetipſum,</hi> by himſelfe, they will flye unto the ſecond, and ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid not, he had purged.

                     <p>IN Maſter <hi>Ward</hi>'s Comentary on Matthew, written copy page 399. this clauſe is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out: Fourthly, by Baptiſme we gaine eternall life and ſalvation; that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Baptiſme doth not conferre theſe <hi>ex Opere operato,</hi> yet where the Sacrament in rightly adminiſtred, and faithfully received, and Chriſt within juſtifying the perſon to be baptized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 11. there Baptiſme doth ſeale all theſe mercies, graces and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits unto the party baptized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Baptiſme is not abſolutely neceſſary unto ſalvation, as appeares thus; Firſt Sacraments doe not conferre grace upon all, nor by a phiſicall power give grace unto any, but ſometimes God in and by the Sacraments conveyes grace unto his Elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſometimes by the Sacraments confirmes grace which he hath formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                     <p>Ibidem on Matthew 3. ver. 11. <hi>I indeed have baptized you with water, but he ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> this diſcourſe is obliterated:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts principall ſcope herein?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> His principall and particular ſcope was this, to ſhew that his baptiſme had no effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy nor power in it from himſelfe at all, but onely from Chriſt: teaching us, that the outward Sacrament may be in-effectuall <hi>(vede August. contr. Faustum</hi> 10. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 12.) and that two manner of wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, for a time onely, as thoſe who were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſme received not the graces of the ſpirit till afterwards, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 2. And Secondly, ſometimes finally, and for ever; and thus <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized but never benefitted at all by it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13. 20. 23.</p>
                     <p>It may here be demanded, why the Sacraments are ſometimes in-effectuall, ſeeing they are the Sacraments of Chriſt, inſtituted by himſelfe?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe they are Sacraments appointed for the confirming of grace formerly given, <hi>not for the conferring of grace by any phiſicall power in themſelves</hi> (Rom. 4. 11.) and therefore no wonder if the Sacraments be not effectuall, when they are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to one voyd of grace; for a ſeale ſet to a blank profits nothing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe thoſe things which are a meanes of conferring grace, according to the Ordinance of God, are but onely meanes, and not efficient cauſes; and therefore unto the receiver is like the preaching of the Word, altogether unprofitable when they are not mixed with faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
                     <p>How may we know whether we are truly baptized or not, or whether our baptiſme be effectuall or operative in us?</p>
                     <p>We may know thisby a ſerious examination of our ſelves by thoſe things whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baptiſme is compared, <hi>viz.</hi> Water <hi>A.</hi> Spirit <hi>B.</hi> Fire <hi>C.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, Baptiſme is compared to Water, which hath theſe two principall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Firſt, it waſheth cleane, and cleanſeth away filth and pollution from a garment, and therefore we muſt examine and try, whether we be waſhed and cleane purged from the pollution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inne or not? Secondly, It moyſteneth and maketh apt to fructifie; and to bring forth fruit, Iſa. 44. 3. and therefore we muſt try whether we are barren or not? for if we encreaſe nor in the works of ſanctification, we are not yet truly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61245:173"/>
unto Chriſt. <hi>B.</hi> Secondly, baptiſme is compared unto the Spirit, or to wind or breath, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e properties are theſe two, namely; Firſt, to coole and refreſh the Lungs; and ſecondly, to work inſenſibly, according to our Saviours ſpeech <hi>John</hi> 3. the wind blowes where it liſts, of which afterwards in his proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>John.</hi> 2. 5. Let us here onely examine, whether luſt burne and rage within us or not? for if we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed therewith, and have no ſpirituall breath to coole theſe carnall flames, then we are not truly baptized into Chriſt; the pulſes of the conſcience being ſighes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wherewith the child of God doth querch the fire of concupiſcence. <hi>C.</hi> Thirdly, Baptiſme is compared to fite, whoſe properties are theſe three; <hi>to wit,</hi> Firſt, to give light, and therefore he that is blind, is not yet by baptiſme made a member of Chriſt; for where the ſpirit of Chriſt is there the eyes of the underſtanding are opened by him; and ſecondly to purge away droſſe from mettle: and therefore we muſt try, whether the corruption of our nature be more and more ſubdued, and whether we be more holy, more pure and more unſpotted then formerly we were? yea like gold ſeven times tryed in the furnace; and thirdly, it doth enflame and burne; and therefore key-cold and luke-warme Chriſtians are not yet baptized into Chriſt: wherefore we muſt labour that our hearts may be enflamed with a deſire to advance the glory of God; as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaw the City <hi>Athens</hi> ſubject to idolatry, his ſpirit was ſtirred in him, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 16.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: our ſacrifices now are Thankſgiving and Almes, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But this Sacrament is frequently by the Fathers called a ſacrifice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maſſe is no Idoll; yea the Papiſts urge <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from thence of ſet up the Bread, Chriſt, unto God for a propitiatory ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it is not certaine that the Apoſtle in that place ſpeaks of the Euchariſt, yea rather contrarily, it is certaine, that he ſpeaks not of the Euchariſt, for <hi>verſe</hi> 15. it is ſaid, <hi>Per illum,</hi> by him, <hi>therefore let us offer. &amp;c.</hi> and therefore if we offer ſacrifice unto God <hi>(per illum, ergo non illum)</hi> by Chriſt, then we doe not offer up Chriſt himſelf unto God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, our ſacrifices now are ſpirituall, <hi>viz.</hi> prayers, praiſes and almes; as was ſhewed before in the anſwer to the Queſtion: And hence collections were wont to be made in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. at the time when the Euchariſt was celebrated; and thus the Fathers doe alwayes explaine themſelves when they ſpeak of ſacrifice: for there is a double ſacrifice, <hi>to wit,</hi> firſt, one which the Prieſt offers up, and this the Papiſts ſpeak of, but not the Fathers; ſecondly, a ſacrifice which every Communicant offers, and of this the Fathers ſpeak; <hi>Tu ſine oblatione venis, participas quod pauper offert, Chryſoſt.</hi> When thou commeſt to the Lords Supper, thou muſt not come without an offering.</p>
                     <p>Ibid. page 365. The Papiſts object, Chriſt in the inſtitution of his ſupper ſpeaking of his ſacrifice, doth not utter the words in the future tenſe: This is my body, which <hi>trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tur,</hi> ſhall hereafter be given for you; and my blood, which <hi>effundetur,</hi> ſhall be ſhed for you: but in the preſent tenſe, <hi>pro vobis traditur &amp; effunditur,</hi> which is given for you, and ſhed for you; therefore Chriſt did not onely ſacrifice his body and blood upon the Croſſe, but alſo in the Lords ſupper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, if theſe words (this is my body which is given, and my blood which is ſhed) be the ſubſtantiall words of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, then there is a groſſe and impious errour in the Canon of the Maſſe; for in the firſt part of the inſtitution, the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61245:174"/>
Canon wholly omits theſe word, <hi>quod pro vobis traditur,</hi> which is given for you; and in the other part of the inſtitution, the Canon hath not the preſent tenſe, but the future <hi>effundteur,</hi> this is my blood which hereafter ſhall be ſhed for you; and thus the very nerves and ſinewes of this argument are quite cut a ſunder by the Canon of the Maſſe it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, how can the ſacrifice of the Maſſe be called <hi>Jucruentum,</hi> an unbloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, if there were in effuſion of blood even at that inſtant when Chriſt celebrated his ſupper? yea if the Wine be ſubſtantially changed into the blood of Chriſt, and the Bread into his body, and that there be blood not onely in the Cup, but alſo with the fleſh, as they teach, then it muſt needs be a bloody ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is not unknowne to the Chriſtian Faith of Proteſtants, when and where the body of Chriſt was given for the redemption of our ſoules and the blood of Chriſt ſhed for waſhing away of our ſinnes; for the Scripture in many places declares, that this was done in the death and ſuffering of Chriſt, and not in the celebration or inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, neither doth the uſe of the preſent tenſe prove that which they would have, for it is uſuall and well known, that there is an Enallage oft times in Scripture, and that not onely the preſent tenſe, but alſo ſometimes the preter tenſe is put for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the certainty of things affirmed: as for example; <hi>paer natus eſt nobis,</hi> unto us a child is given or borne; <hi>Agnus occiſus,</hi> the Lamb was ſlaine from the beginning of the world; behold the Lambe of God, <hi>qui tollet,</hi> which taketh away the ſinnes of the world, <hi>Ego pono,</hi> I lay downe my life for my ſheep &amp;c. <hi>Chem.

Secondly, though the Church be a light, yet ſuch as walke in darkeneſſe, loving that better then the light, doe not alwayes ſee it, but want either will or eyes thereto: Thus the King of <hi>Arams</hi> Souldiers neither ſaw the horſes and Chariots of fire that were
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61245:175"/>
round about <hi>Eliſha,</hi> nor knew that they were in the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> untill their eyes were opened.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither do men light a candle and put it under a Buſhell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Papiſts ſay, that the Scriptures are ſo hard and obſcure, that although people were permitted to read them in their mother tongue, yet they could not poſſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, and therfore it boots not at all to do ſo: Now againſt this Tenet of theirs we enforce this place, arguing thus; Chriſt in the former verſes affirmed his Apoſtles to be, not only <hi>the ſale of the earth,</hi> but alſo <hi>the light of the world;</hi> and in this verſe ſhewes how abſurd a thing it is to <hi>light a candle, and then to put it under a Buſhell,</hi> and how uſefull it is to put it into a candleſtick, <hi>becauſe ſo it gives light to all that are in the houſe.</hi> But if the writings of the Apoſtles be obſcure, then we muſt of neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the light is hid under a buſhell, and is not ſeen by thoſe in the roome: Now if this be abſurd, then let the Paſtiſts acknowledge it an abſurd opinion to think the Scriptures obſcure, and rather affirme them to be perſpicuous and plain; yea, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſpicuous and clear to the underſtanding of ſome, but to all who are in the houſe, that is, to all the faithfull: Briefly, if the Goſpell be like a lighted candle which is put into a candleſtick, and gives light to all who are in the houſe, then it is perſpicuous and clear to the whole houſhold; but the former is true from this verſe; therefore alſo the latter, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Were not our Prelates wholly Popiſh, and Romes ſworne Vaſſals, who could not endure to have ſuch paſſages as theſe paſſe freely through our Preſſes without a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh purgation? and do not theſe bad fruits diſcover how rotten their hearts, how corrupt their judgements were?</p>

this call belongs not unto ſalvation, and therefore I omit it: Secondly, there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall call unto ſalvation, which is two fold, <hi>to wit,</hi> ineffectuall and effectuall: Firſt, there is an effectuall calling, which is twofold. <hi>to wit,</hi> a calling whereby God cals all men, and a call whereby he cals the outward Church: Firſt, there is an effectuall call where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God cals all men, and this is twofold, <hi>to wit;</hi> Firſt, the Word of God, which is ſaid to call all, and that both becauſe it ſpeaks unto all without difference; <hi>Come all, &amp;c.</hi> Mark 11. 24. &amp; Acts 17. 30. &amp; 10. 35. and alſo becauſe the ſound thereof goes into all the world, or unto the atmoſt parts of the world. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 4: The book of the creatures for the inviſible things of God are ſeen in the creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and there are ſome marks and impreſſions or prints of God in every creature: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is an effectuall call, whereby God cals the eternall Church, <hi>to wit,</hi> the whole Church profeſſing the Goſpell outwardly, whether they be Papiſts, Arrians, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Ana baptiſts or Proteſtants: Whence we may learne, That all in the outward Church are called, and therefore many are called; this is cleere from this verſe: and chap. 20. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16.</p>

Here obſerve two things, <hi>to wit,</hi> Firſt, there are many in the places of the Goſpel who heare the Word preached all the dayes of their lives, and yet underſtand nothing, but remaine children in underſtanding; now theſe never were made partakers ſo much as of common or generall grace: Secondly, there are ſome who live under the Word, and doe dogmatically underſtand the Word; now theſe muſt remember that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not enough, God having given them knowledge for practice ſake, yea to know and not to obey will aggravate their paniſhment. Secondly, a taſte of ſpirituall things

and the heavenly gift, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. this is to receive the Word with joy. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20. and there are few ordinary hearers, but at ſome time or other have theſe affecting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, although for the moſt part the reprobate rather rejoyceth in the newneſſe then in the truneſſe of that which he heares.

And thus much for the firſt generall call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, <hi>to wit,</hi> the ineffectuall call. Now</p>

                  <p>Firſt, it is clear and undenyable not onely by known experience and divers Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters found in his ſtudy, but by the <hi>Docquet Bookes</hi> and privy <hi>Signets</hi> on record, that this Archbiſhop (contrary to the uſe of his Predeceſtors) incroached, uſurped to himſelfe from the year of our Lord 1627. when he firſt grew potent at Court and became <hi>Biſhop of Bath</hi> &amp; <hi>Wells,</hi> afterwards of <hi>London,</hi> before he was Archbiſhop, and ever ſince he mounted to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the diſpoſition and donation of all or moſt <hi>Biſhopricks, Deaneries, Prebendaries</hi> and <hi>Benefices</hi> of note in his Majeſties gift, or in the gift of the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> and Maſter <hi>of the Court of Wards,</hi> not onely within the Kingdomes of <hi>England,</hi> but of <hi>Scotland and Ireland</hi> too; and that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the power of nominating <hi>Chaplaines</hi> in ordinary to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> and the <hi>Princes Highneſſe</hi> (contrary to all former Preſidents) belonging time out of mind to the Lord <hi>High Chamberlaines Office,</hi> who had the nomination of theſe Chaplaines and ſwore and inveſted them in their office, as Maſter <hi>Oldeſworth</hi> (a Member of the Houſe of <hi>Commons)</hi> Secretary to the late <hi>High Chamberlaine</hi> the Honourable <hi>Earle of Pembrooke</hi> atteſted upon Oath, and the Noble <hi>Earle</hi> himſelfe averred upon his Honour; a thing ſo notorious to all old Courtiers, and Chaplaines in ordinary to the King, as to doubt of it were a Soleciſme.</p>
                  <p>To make this apparent by punctuall proofes, we ſhall inſtance in ſuch particular perſons which were advanced by him to Biſhopricks even for their erronious <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian opinions,</hi> or dangerous <hi>Popiſh Tenets and Practiſes.</hi> We have <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>p.</hi> 157. to 164.</note> formerly proved, that <hi>Richard Mountague</hi> was queſtioned and voted againſt in the Commons Houſe in Parliament <hi>April</hi> 13. 1626. for his <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Tenets,</hi> publiſhed in his <hi>Gagge</hi> and <hi>Appeale,</hi> and, <hi>endeavouring, as much as in him lay to reconcile us to Popery:</hi> which complaint was revived againſt him in the enſuing Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 1627.

By this Letter it is moſt apparent: Firſt, that Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> made the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop acquainted with his Bookes before he printed them, and ſubmitted them to his cenſure: and how full of Popery they are, you have already heard: Yea after they were printed he preſented him with printed Coppies of them curiouſly bound up and guilded, produced and read formerly at the Lords Barre: Secondly, That <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and he were of the ſame religion, and did drive at the ſame end; and what was that but the erecting of <hi>Altars,</hi> the introducing of Popery, and reconciling us to <hi>Rome,</hi> as this Letter and the foregoing evidence manifeſt. Thirdly, That his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were by the Archbiſhops long-continued extraordinary favours, for which he returnes him thankes in this Letter. And no wonder was it, that Biſhop <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> was his ſpeciall Favourite; for if we beleeve the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> intituled; <hi>The Popes Nuncio,</hi> p. 11. 14. 16. (firſt publiſhed in <hi>Italian</hi> by the <hi>Venetian Embaſſadour)</hi> this <hi>great confident of the</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>was very intimate with</hi> Panzain <hi>the Popes firſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, frequently viſited him, and very paſſionately deſired a Reconciliation of us and the Church of Rome:</hi> Yea, <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> in his Letter to the Archbiſhop whiles they were both priſoners in the <hi>Tower,</hi> dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 30. 1642. (the originall whereof was ſeiſed on by M. <hi>Prynne)</hi> writes: <hi>That at that inſtant when he diſſented from the New Canons</hi> (by Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> encouragement) <hi>An.</hi> 1640. <hi>he could have proved, how that in his perſon he did viſit and held correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the</hi> Popes Agent <hi>and received his Letters in behalfe of his Sonne who was</hi>

Now what a Capitall Crime and tranſcendent miſdemeanour it is for this Arch-Prelate to place ſuch Arminian Popiſh Prelates, and Chaplaines in ordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Majeſtie, &amp; the young Prince (more infectious then <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Cooks</hi> 4.

                  <p>For his promoting of Arminians, of perſons addicted to Popiſh Ceremonies, Errours, Innovations, to Offices and Headſhips in our Univerſities to poyſon thoſe fountaines of Piety and Learning, we ſhall inſtance in theſe few Particulars. During the time of his <hi>Chancellorſhip</hi> in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> from April 1630. till <hi>Anno,</hi> 1641. it is obſervable, that he nominated only five Vice-Chancellors to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the Univerſity under him; namely Dr <hi>Smith,</hi> Warden of <hi>Wadham Colledge;</hi> Doctor <hi>Brian Duppa,</hi> Deane of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> (whoſe further promotions he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured) Doctor <hi>Pinke,</hi> Warden of New-Colledge, Doctor <hi>Bayly,</hi> Preſident of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt Colledge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Frewen</hi> Preſident of <hi>Mary Magdalen Colledge,</hi> Dr <hi>Christopher Potter</hi> Provoſt of <hi>Queenes Colledge;</hi> (as the Univerſity Regiſter unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably proves, and all <hi>Oxford</hi> Schollers can atteſt;) all deeply tainted with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme, great Promoters of all Popiſh Innovations, Superſtitions, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in that Univerſity, as we have <note n="*" place="margin">Here p. 70; 71, 72, 73.</note> formerly manifeſted.

                  <p>What heades of Houſes hee promored in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and what profeſſed Arminians and Well-wiſhers to Popery they were, you have <note n="*" place="margin">Here p. 73, 74, 193, 167.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard in part; we ſhall onely repeate the names of ſome of them, Doctor <hi>Brookes,</hi> Doctor <hi>Beal,</hi> Doctor <hi>Martin,</hi> Doctor <hi>Coſin,</hi> Doctor <hi>Layny,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Sterne,</hi> men very infamous both for Arminian and Popiſh Errors.</p>
                  <p>And not content to corrupt our Engliſh Academies, he promoted Maſter <hi>Chapple,</hi> the Archeſt and moſt notorious Arminian in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who leavened all his Pupels and many hopefull Schollers with <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> (as Mr <hi>Walker</hi> and others witneſſed) to the Provoſt-ſhip and Government of the <hi>Colledge</hi> and <hi>Vniverſity of Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (as appears by ſundry originall Letters thence, endorſed with his own hand, and himſelfe muſt needs acknowledge) whom he brought into that place with an high hand, where he did much hurt by venting his Arminian druggs, and maintained <hi>Juſtification by Workes: Exemption of the Clergy from the Secular power, and was very active in the Synod there, in ſuppreſſing the Articles of</hi> Ireland <hi>againſt</hi> Papiſts and Arminians, (as was Doctor <hi>Bramhall</hi> too, his grand Arminian Popiſh Inſtrument there) as was atteſted upon Oath by Dr <hi>Hoyle,</hi> a Member of the Aſſembly, and Divinity Reader in that Univerſity.</p>
                  <p>His advancements of Perſons tainted with Arminianiſme, Popery and Popiſh Superſtitions, to Benefices, Prebendaries and other Eccleſiaſticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, are almoſt numberleſſe, as wee finde by the <hi>Docquet Bookes;</hi> all or moſt of the Eccleſiaſticall Preferments belonging to the Crowne being diſpoſed of by him alone of latter times, not by the Lord Keeper and Maſter of the <hi>Wardes</hi> as formerly, upon whoſe Preſentations he encroached.

Before this Doctors Letter the Biſhop had received an information of the heads of his Sermon from others thus endorſed with his own hand. <hi>May</hi> 6. 1932. <hi>Notes of Mr</hi> Bernards <hi>Sermon at</hi> Cambridge; the particulars whereof are hereafter expreſſed more at large in his own words.</p>
                  <p>Soone after Mr <hi>Bernard</hi> by this Biſhops proſecution was brought into the High Commiſſion Court and forced to deliver in a Copy of his Sermon to the Biſhop, which he did: who excepted againſt theſe Paſſages in it, for which he was articled againſt. <hi>Gods Ordinances for his publike Worſhip are the glory of any Nation. By Gods Ordinances here, I underſtand chiefly the Word, Sacraments and Prayer,</hi> which if blended and adulterated with any Superſtitious Innovations of men, ceaſe to bee Gods Ordinances, and he ownes them no longer. <hi>It is not the ſingle having of Gods Ordinances for his publike Worſhip, but the having of them in their purity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity that dignifies a Nation. Gods Ordinances for his publike Worſhip in their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Integrity are a ſure ſhield between a Nation and publike ruine and deſolation: For proofe whereof, I challenge all Recordes both divine and humane to produce one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance wherein God puniſhed any part of his Church with any Nationall ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, before they had either departed from, or corrupted his Ordinances. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> Rom. 1. 16. <hi>affirmeth of the preaching of the Word,</hi> that it is the power of God to ſalvation. <hi>It is the meanes by which God manifeſteth his omnipotent and irreſistible power in the converſion and ſalvation of all thoſe who from eternity were ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by Gods abſolute and immutable Decree. This ſeemes to confute their errour who think meanly and baſely of theſe</hi> Ordinances of God, <hi>which we have proved to be the glory of that Nation, where they are in their purity and integrity. Theſe men turn their glory into ſhame; for is there not a generation of prophane men among us, who are afraide and aſhamed to preach twice on the Lords day, to preach plainly, powerfully, and ſpiritually to the ſoules and conſciences of their people, leaſt they ſhould be accounted Puritans? Many who are afraide to hear too often, eſpecially on the weeke dayes leaſt they ſhould be accounted Bible-bearers, and gadders after Sermons? Many who are as much afraide to performe holy duties in their families, and to ſpeake like Christians as</hi> Peter <hi>was, who that his ſpeech might not betray him, began to curſe and ſwear? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who complain that there is too much preaching and that it was never merry ſince? Many who eſteem very meanly of prayer, eſpecially of the publike prayers of the Church? Some that have ſcorufully called the ſirging of a Pſalme a Geneva Iigge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the principall exception was for this enſuing Diſcourſe in the cloſe of his Sermon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Further, I will not deny that God hath his true inviſible Church among thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he had in Iſrael in the dayes of</hi> Ahab <hi>and</hi> Eliah: <hi>nay, I ſee no reaſon why (in a large, yet true ſence) we may not call the Church of Rome, Italy, or Spain a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viſible Church of Chriſt: as</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the Reign of</hi> Jeroboem <hi>was a Church of God, though Idolatrous, and Apoſtaticall: Yet I ſay, that it is impoſible that any ſhould be ſaved living or dying (without repentance) in the doctrine and Idolatrous worſhip of the Church of Rome, as the late Tridentine Councell hath decreed it. My reaſon is this; Hee that thinkes to go to heaven any other way then by faith in Chriſt onely, ſhall never</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>come there. But he that dyes without repentance in the Doctrine of the Church of Rome (as the Councell of</hi> Trent <hi>hath decreed it) thinkes to go to heaven another way, then by faith in Chriſt onely, as namely by the merits of his own workes; Ergo ſuch a one ſhall never come there. Thirdly, if Gods Ordinances for his publike worship in their purity are the glory of a nation, then it followes, that they who go about to deprive a Nation of any of Gods Ordinances for his publike Worship, either in whole or in the beſt part of them (ideſt) in their purity and integrity, they go about to make that Nation baſe, and inglorious and if ſo, then are they enemies to that Nation, and Traytors to it, if it be their</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>own Nation: for Treaſon is not limited to the royall blood, as if he only could be a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor who plotteth and attempteth the dishonour and shedding thereof, but may be and is</hi>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:61245:186"/>
                     <hi>too oft committed againſt the whole Church and nation, which laſt, is by ſo much the worſt of them two, by how much the end is better then the meanes, and the whole of greater conſequence then any other part alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereby we may learn, what to account of thoſe among our ſelves (if any ſuch be, which is better known to you then to mee) who endeavour to quench the light and abate the glory of our Iſrael, by bringing in their Pelagian errours into the Doctrine of our Church eſtabliſhed by Law, and the Superſtitions of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>into our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, as high Altars, Crucifixes, and bowing to them,</hi> id eſt <hi>(in plain Engliſh) worſhipping them; whereby they Symbolize with the Church of Rome very ſhamefully, to the irreparable Shipwracke of many ſoules who ſplit upon this rocke. The Papiſts teach, that it is impoſſible to be ſaved in our Church and our Religion: Some of ours (at leaſt in outward profeſſion) teach, that it is poſſible to be ſaved in the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Church; hence an unſettled judgement concludes, if we may agree in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why do we not agree and meet each other halfe way on earth? And hence we have many Caſſanders among us, who meditate and wiſh a reconciliation between the Church of Rome and ours; and to be ſure (ſay the unſettled) it is the ſafeſt way to be members of that Church wherein both ſides agree that ſalvation is to be had, then of that Church in which one ſide onely affirmes it, and that a party; And this fills</hi> Rome <hi>with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish proſelites. What can we thinke leſſe of thoſe men who by their Symbolizing with the Church of Rome in Doctrine and Worship give occaſion thereunto, then that they are enemies to this Church and Nation? I ſay, they are enemies, and therefore let us take up armes againſt them. But what armes?</hi> Preces Eccleſiae ſunt arma Eccleſiae, <hi>let us pray theſe men either to converſion (if it be Gods bleſſed will,) or to their deſtruction,</hi> fiat juſtitia, pereant illi. <hi>And let us uſe that prayer againſt them, which David uſed againſt Achitophell, with which I will conclude all; O Lord turne the councell of all theſe crafty Achitophells into folly, who go about to lay the honour of this Church and Nation in the duſt, by depriving us of the purity of any of thy Ordinances for thy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Worship, which are the glory of this our Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p>For theſe clauſes Mr <hi>Bernard</hi> was moſt ſeverely ſentenced in the High Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this Biſhops violent Proſecution; Suſpended his Miniſtry, excommunicated, fined a thouſand pounds, impriſoned; condemned in coſts of ſuite, committed priſonet to the new Priſon, where he lay ſundry moneths, being moſt barbarouſly uſed and almoſt ſtarved for want of neceſſaries; of which he complained to the Biſhop by ſundry Letters and Petitions found in his ſtudy with Mr <hi>Bernards</hi> Sermon, and the informations againſt him, (endorſed with the Biſhops own hand and produced at the Barre) but could find no reliefe, unleſſe he would make this enſuing Recantation ſent to him by the Biſhop, and thus endorſed with his own pen: <hi>Septem.</hi> 11. 1632 <hi>A Copy of a Recantation tendered to Mr</hi> Bernard, <hi>Lecturer of</hi> Sepulchers, <hi>about a Sermon that he preached at</hi> Cambridge. <hi>He refuſed this Recantation.</hi>

                  <p>For refuſing to make this ſtrange preſcribed Recantation, this godly Miniſter, though he in generall termes profeſſed, his ſyncere ſorrow and penitency for any Overſights and unbeſeeming Expreſſions in his Sermon, both in his Petitions and Letters to the Biſhop, (which would not ſuffice,) was for a long time deteined in the New Priſon, there miſerably abuſed by the Keepers, of which he oft complained without redreſſe, and in concluſion utterly ruined for ſpeaking out the truth.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſhall cloſe this branch of our Evidence with this obſervation; That as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments rightly diſtributed are the greateſt incentives to vertue, piety, learning, and retractives from vice, error, ſuperſtition; ſo when they are perverted, miſplaced, they become the grandeſt diſcouragements to Piety, Religion, the ſtrongeſt attractives to Hereſie, Popery and all kinde of Superſtitions; Schollers commonly looke moſt of all after preferments; yea make it their principall ſtudy to comply with thoſe mens Opinions, and Practifes, who are the chiefe Beſtowers of them. No wonder therefore that our poor Church was ſodainly overſpread with a generation of Arminian, Popiſh, Superſtitious, Ceremonious, prophane, Prelaticall Clergy-men, when all or moſt Eccleſiaſticall preferments were in this Arch-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates diſpoſall, who for the moſt part advanced none but ſuch, but diſcountenanced, ſuppreſſed, perſecuted, &amp; kept back from preferments moſt orthodox zeal us preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divines who would not comply with his Popiſh Innovations and Deſignes. It is very obſervable, that the Archbiſhop himſelfe records in his <hi>Diary,</hi> April 5. 1625. <hi>How he preſented to the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>by his command, a Schedule wherein the Names of Eccleſiaſticall perſons were written under the Letters O.</hi> (that is orthodox in his ſence, to wit, Arminians, or perſons addicted to Popiſh Errors and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) <hi>and P. (that is</hi> Puritans) <hi>who was to deliver them to King</hi> CHARLES: Ever ſince which time <hi>Mountague, Manwaring, Wren,</hi> with ſuch like unorthodox Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have been advanced, and all Puritans as they termed them, kept from preferment; And it is as conſiderable what Mr <hi>Chaloner</hi> depoſed to this purpoſe: That being in <hi>Rome about five yeares ſince,</hi> Friar John (the great agent there for our Engliſh Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines and Catholiques) was <hi>very inquiſitive and demanded ſeriouſly of him, Whether the</hi> Archbiſhop of Canterbury <hi>had not the beſtowing of all Eccleſiaſticall preferments and livings in England, especially thoſe in the Kings gift?</hi> Seeming to be confident they were all then in his diſpoſe, and thereupon aſſuring himſelfe, that he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſuch perſons to them as ſhould be moſt favourable, moſt plyable to Popery and Papiſts, to drive on their deſignes; as they did indeed with a witneſſe, till this Parliament imployed their diligence and power to weed them out by Degrees. And therefore his advancement of ſuch unſound, corrupt, Popiſh Clergy-men on the One, and ſuppreſſing good Orthodox Preaching Miniſters on the other ſide; muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily import a moſt deſperate deſign in him to ſupplant our eſtabliſhed Religion, by ſuch a Generation of Vipers, who would eat out the very bowells of their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Mother Church, and Religion by Degrees.</p>

                  <p>By this Originall Paper, the main ſcope whereof is only to ſuppreſſe Preaching, Lectures, and extirpate all Lecturers by Degrees; it is apparant. Firſt, that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late was the prime Projector, Promoter of all the Jeſuiticall Devices conteined in theſe Conſiderations, and ſince put in Practiſe in every Dioceſſe to ſuppreſſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lectures and Lecturers. Secondly, that the ſpecious pretence of <hi>having the Afternoon Sermons in every Pariſh turned into catechiſing;</hi> ſo much preſſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, was only a meer pretence and wicked policy of purpoſe to ſuppreſſe Lectures and undermine Lecturers; None being enjoyned to catechiſe but ſuch as preached; none being queſtioned for not catechiſing if they preached not; and thoſe that cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed and preached too, or expounded, or uſed any other Catechiſm but that in the Common-Prayer-Booke, being queſtioned and ſuſpended as Delinquents. Thirdly, that he not only recommends theſe Conſiderations to his Majeſty, but moves him to turne them into Injunctions, and to call for an Account every halfe year to ſee how they were obſerved. Fourthly, that to effect and further this wicked project, all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, grave Miniſters are required to be preſent at Lectures the better to turne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers againſt Lecturers that were honeſt and painfull. Fifthly, ſome Colledges muſt have new Governours appointed them to prevent the growth of Puritaniſm: No new Biſhops muſt be made but ſuch who would be active in putting this deſign in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Kings own privy Councell muſt be ſpecially enjoyned to dance attendance at the High Commiſſion to puniſh ſuch who tranſgreſſed theſe Preſcriptions, and the Judges inhibited to grant Prohibitions for their releife.</p>
                  <p>This foundation being layd, theſe Conſiderations of the Biſhop were in a few weeks after, with very little alteration, transformed and hightned into the Title of <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from his Majeſty;</hi> the Originall Draught whereof we have here preſent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlined, altered with this Biſhops own hand: and then in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1629, they were ſent in the Kings own name, as his owne Regall Injunctions, to the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> and by them to all the Biſhops in their particular Provinces to ſee them punctually obſerved and put in execution in every pariſh within their Dioceſſe.

The Inſtructions which concern the Perſons to be governed, are only the third, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Declaration, that ſo differences and queſtions may ceaſe, and the fifth about Lecturers, and the ſeventh concerning private Chaplaines in the Houſes of men not qualified, and the eighth about either Recuſants or any other Abſents from Church and Divine Service; all the reſt are Perſonall to the Biſhops: yet becauſe they are ſo full of Juſtice, Honour and Care of the Church, I ſend to you the whole Body of the Inſtructions as they came to me, praying and requiring you as Arch-Deacon of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to ſend me at or before <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the third of <hi>February</hi> next, both the Chriſtian and Surnames of every Lecturer within your Archdeaconry, as well in places exempt as not exempt, and the place where he preacheth and his quality and Degree. As alſo the Names of ſuch men as being not qualified keep Chaplains in their Houſes. And theſe are farther to pray, and in his Majeſties name to require you that you leave with the Parſon or Vicar of the place a Copy not of all, but of the foure Inſtructions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with the foure ſeverall branches belonging to the Lecturers, with a Charge that the Perſon or Vicar deliver another Copy of them to the Churchwardens; and that you do not onely call upon them for Performance, now preſently, but alſo take great care from time to time that at the End of your next Viſitation, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the End of every ſeverall Viſitation, I may by your ſelf or your Officialls have true notice how they are perform'd, and where and by whom they are diſobey'd. For ſo much my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> requires of me as you ſhall ſee by the Tenor of his Graces Letters to mee here incloſed. I pray you in any caſe not to faile in this, for if you ſhould, when I come to give up my Account I muſt diſcharge my ſelfe upon you, and that Neglect would make you go backward

                  <p>Upon the publication of theſe <hi>Instructions</hi> (ſtrictly purſued till this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) Lecturers and Chaplaines in private Gentlemens houſes were generally que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned and ſuppreſſed in all places, with very great Rigor; eſpecially if they refuſed or neglected to read Common Prayers in their Surpliſſes and Hoods before they Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured: all Sermons on the Lords dayes in the Afternoon were generally ſuppreſſed by degrees throughout the Kingdome: moſt ſingle, and many Combination Lectures were put downe in every place; All Catechiſmes, but that in the Common Prayer Book, prohibited; All Expoſitions of Chapters or of the Catechiſme forbidden and layd aſide; Wakes, Revels, Dancing, and all kind of Recreations introduced, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, commanded by a Regall Declaration, printed and publiſhed in the Kings name by this Prelate as we have already proved, (and preached for in Pulpits, inſtead of Afternoon Sermons and Catechiſmes on the Lords day) that people might go more merrily down to Hell, and baniſh the thoughts of God and heaven out of their minds, on that very day whereon they ſhould minde them moſt. And that theſe Inſtructions might be the better executed, this Prelate both before and after he was <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> together with Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Peirce</hi> and others thruſt them into their <hi>Viſitation Articles,</hi> and every Church-Warden and Sideſman on their Oath, was to inquire after the <hi>Execution</hi> and <hi>Violation</hi> of them. If any doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe upon theſe <hi>Instructions</hi> how to proceed upon them, not Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> but this Lording <hi>Prelate,</hi> was conſulted with as the only Oracle, who beſt knew their meaning, as being the contriver of them: Witneſſe the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Briſtols Letter and Quaeres to him about his Majeſties late Inſtructions</hi> Febr. 12. 1629. the Originall whereof (indorſed with Mr <hi>Dells</hi> his Secretaries hand) found with the former Papers in his ſtudy, was produced. If any neglect or connivance at Lecturers was uſed in any place, information and complaint thereof was preſently ſent up unto him; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this one from <hi>Canterbury</hi> againſt Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> himſelfe: thus endorſed with this Prelates own hand <hi>Feb,</hi> 18. 1629. <hi>The Proceedings of the Dean and Arch-Deacon of</hi> Canterbury <hi>upon the Kings Inſtructions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MAſter Deane and Archdeacon of <hi>Canterbury</hi> received from my Lords Grace a Commiſſion for the ſpeeding of his Majeſties Inſtructions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by theſe phraſes. (It is expected that you ſhould ſtrictly put in execution theſe matters which do concern either your ſelves, in your own perſons, or the Clergy that do remain within my Dioceſſe, and this to be done, not as a thing of forme, or perfunctorily, but ſo that an account be made and returned to his Majeſtie, what fruit there is of theſe Inſtructions, and how in the ſeverall Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes they are performed. And therefore <hi>I</hi> pray you, and in the name of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe require you to advertiſe me what is done in theſe particulars, and whether there be due obedience unto theſe commands.)</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the Commiſſioners ſent for Mr <hi>Palmer,</hi> a Lecturer in Saint <hi>Alphage Canterbury</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> in the afternoone, who firſt denyed to ſhew any Licence; Secondly certified that he had no Licence to preach there. Thirdly againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will, he read Prayers and catechized but not according to Canon. Fourthly, in that catechizing he undertook to declare the Kings minde in his Inſtructions. Fiftly, he hath never heretofore read Prayers or uſed the Surpliſſe in that Pariſh. Sixthly, the Incumbent, a man licenſed by three Archbiſhops, petitioned that he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his own miniſteriall duties in his own Pariſh. Seventhly, Mr <hi>Polmer</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a factious Sermon in the <hi>Cathedrall Church,</hi> and detracted from Divine Service
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61245:192"/>
there, Eighthly the Incumbent for not joyning with him is threatned to looſe his tithes. Ninthly, factious parties of all the Pariſhes in the Towne are his auditors, where they will not be forbidden to ſit vpon the Communion table.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Commiſſioners, willed Maſter <hi>Palmer</hi> to deſiſt, and to give Maſter <hi>Platt</hi> the Miniſter of the ſaid-Church roome, to doe his duties himſelfe, vntill they might heare farther from my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to him they remitted him, ſending up their reaſons wherefore they did it.</p>
                  <p>They likewiſe ſent for Maſter <hi>Vdnay</hi> Lecturer on Sunday in the after-noone at <hi>Aſhford,</hi> a Market towne and the moſt factious of all <hi>Kent.</hi> Where though there be a grave learned diligent Incumbent, and a Lecture beſide performed every Sattur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by the grave neighbour Miniſters, yet Maſter <hi>Vdnay</hi> was invited thither by factious perſons, ſuch as are regiſtred in the high Commiſſion for Conventiclers, whereupon he obtained a recommendation from the King, directed to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>Aſhford,</hi> who in the Kings name charging the Incumbent to admit him, thruſt him up into the Pulpit, where he hath ever ſince Lectured directly contrary to the third inſtruction for Lectures, it being a great diſcouragement to the Incumbent, <hi>Vdnay</hi> himſelfe having had a Benefice neere that Towne within eight miles, at which for this ten yeeres he hath never conſtantly reſided. For theſe reaſons the Commiſſioners wiſht him likewiſe to deſiſt, and referd him <hi rend="margQuotes">to my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who hath ſince replaced him in <hi>Aſhford</hi> by his Licence and Seale, and as we are informed hath likewiſe authoriſed Maſter <hi>Palmer.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p>In his own Dioceſſe of <hi>London</hi> many Lectures were ſuppreſſed, many Lecturers and Miniſters queſtioned, ſuſpended by colour of theſe <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> eſpecially if they vſed the leaſt glances againſt <hi>Arminianiſme and Popiſh Innovations,</hi> by name Mr <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham,</hi> Mr <hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> of <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> of <hi>Chemſford,</hi> Mr <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Knightsbridge;</hi> Mr <hi>Archer,</hi> M. <hi>William Martyn,</hi> M. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> M. <hi>Iones,</hi> M. <hi>Ward,</hi> M. <hi>Saunders;</hi> M. <hi>Iames Gardner,</hi> M. <hi>Foxly,</hi> with ſundry others being likewiſe, ſome of them driven out of his Dioceſſe and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome too.</p>

                              <p> To the 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                                 <hi>Article,</hi> and the four branches thereof, I ſcarce found any Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing uſed in the whole Dioceſſe, ſome fewe places excepted; but I have very ſtrictly enforced it, and I preſume it is now faithfully performed in moſt Churches of the Dioceſſe. Eſpecially in the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> there were not above 4 Sermons on <hi>Sunday</hi> mornings in 34 Churches, only in the Afternoon they had them. But I cauſed Sermons or Homilies to be had in every Church in the forenoon, and Catechizing in the afternoon according to the Canon. Lectures abounded, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Suffolke:</hi> Not a Market, or a bowling greene, or an Ordinary could ſtand without one, and many of them were ſet up by private Gentlemen at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. At St. <hi>Edmunds Bury</hi> there were three: Two ſingle Lectures on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> (in either of their Churches one) and one by Combination of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61245:193"/>
Divines on <hi>Munday</hi> the Market day. The Combination ending at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, of themſelves they forbeare to begin it again, till they had fought to me for leave and order therein. I gave my conſent and allowed fifty choice Divines inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting within that Archdeaconry, upon theſe two Conditions.</p>
                              <p>Firſt, that the Divine Service being began duly by the Curate of the Church at nine of the Clocke, the Preacher for that day ſhould be ready in his Surpliſſe and Hood to begin the ſecond Service at the Communion Table; and ſo ſhould aſſend into the Pulpit after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creede, and there uſing no other prayer then is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 55. Canon, nor preaching above one hour, ſhould not give the Bleſſing out of the Pulpit; but ſhould deſſend again to the Table and read the Prayer for the univerſull Church; and ſo diſmiſſe the congregation with the Peace of God &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, that the people of the Town ſhould duly reſort to the Church to the beginning of Divine Service and there deport themſelves with all Humility, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Devotion, in kneeling, ſtanding, bowing, being uncovered and anſwering audibly. Both which conditions are joyfully and duly performed, as well by the Preachers for their part, as the people, for theirs reſpectively: The two ſingle Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are likewiſe continued and performed upon the ſame conditions. Only during the time of this Faſt, I appointed the <hi>Friday</hi> Lecture to be held on the Faſt day alſo.</p>
                              <p>At <hi>Ipſwich</hi> there hath been no Lecture ſince Mr <hi>Wards</hi> cenſure: It was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to ſome of them, that if they had ſought to have one, I would have gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, but they are reſolved to have him or none; and him they make account to have in deſpite of all cenſures.</p>
                              <p>At <hi>Yarmouth</hi> there hath beene no Lecturer theſe two yeares, ever ſince which time more Peace hath been in the Town, and good Order in Eccleſiaſticall things much increaſed.</p>
                              <p>At <hi>Lyme</hi> their Lecturer dyed in <hi>February:</hi> They preſently ſought to have the Curate of the place allowed to be Lecturer: I gave leave that he ſhould ſupply the place, till I might further enquire of him; but about <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> he voluntarily relinquiſhed, and not without ſome contempt; whereupon I would not ſuffer him afterward to return though ſome deſired it.</p>
                              <p>At <hi>Norwich</hi> one Lecture is ſtill held by Mr <hi>Cock,</hi> an honeſt conformable man of whom they make no great regard. Other two have voluntarily relinquiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will obſerve no Order, whereof one (Mr <hi>Bridge)</hi> hath left two Cures and is runne into <hi>Holland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The other Lectures in the Country Towns were at this paſſe: Firſt, they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Order at all in reading of the Divine Service, or in abſtaining from points of controverſie, or in their habits. Secondly, Laymen had taken upon them to put in and put out ſome Lecturers at their pleaſure. Thirdly, the people alſo knowing before hand who was to preach, when any factious fellow came, would throng and hang upon the Windowes; but if they did not phanſie the man, the Church was halfe empty, to the great diſcouragement of many who complained thereof to me. Fourthly, they never ſought to me to obtaine any allowances or to receive any order about them, whereupon (after more then halfe a years expectation) ſome of them were inhibited untill they ſought leave of their ordinary. Since they in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> Petition was made to me. 1 From <hi>Debenham,</hi> and I was ready to allow them a Lecture on the ſame conditions with St. <hi>Edmunds Bury,</hi> which they went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of, but I never heard ſince from them. 2 From <hi>Bergholt,</hi> (vulgo <hi>Baifeld)</hi> which is a Mile of <hi>Dedham</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> But it being no Market Town, and I not finding a ſufficient number of grave and orthodox Divines neer that part: and Dr. <hi>Jones</hi> (an eminent man their late Lecturer) having often complained to me of their factious diſpoſitions, <hi>I</hi> took time to conſider of it. 3 From <hi>Haverill,</hi> no Market Town alſo, where a young fellow had thruſt up himſelf without leave, <hi>Sede vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie,</hi> to be their Lecturer, yet in regard of his want of means <hi>I</hi> yeelded; upon condition, that he ſhould behave himſelfe orderly; and the Towne ſhould aſſure fourty Markes <hi>per annum,</hi> for a Stipend, which they have not yet done.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61245:194"/>
In <hi>Norfolk</hi> from <hi>Wimendam</hi> and <hi>Eaſtharling</hi> ſuite was made to me, but it was ſince the Faſt began, whereupon I reſpited them, till it pleaſed God that it might ceaſe, and then I would be ready to do to them as I had done at <hi>Bury.</hi> Beſides theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces afore named. I remember but three in <hi>Northfolke</hi> as yet inhibited: <hi>Viz.</hi> at <hi>Diſſ.</hi> new <hi>Buckenham,</hi> and <hi>Northwalſham,</hi> and three in <hi>Suffolk; viz.</hi> at <hi>Ixmom,</hi> a Lecture ſtarted up by Sir <hi>William Spring</hi> within theſe four years; at <hi>Cockefield,</hi> a private town, where the ſaid Knight bound his Clerk (when he preſented him) to read a Lecture there every <hi>Thurſday,</hi> becauſe Mr <hi>Knewſtubs</hi> had for many years before done it: And at <hi>Wickham</hi> where the Lecturer is no Graduate and hath been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stage player, a man of ſmall abilities, and of whom many complaints were brought to me.</p>

                              <p>Foraſmuch as of late years the courſe and humor of Lecturing and the frequenting and hearing ſuch exerciſes, is of great reſent in the State and Church of <hi>England,</hi> (from which courſe, as much good may enſue and be procured, if well and diſcreetly managed, ſo if otherwiſe, great hurt, danger and ſcandall may and often doth reſult; the cure and care whereof properly and immediately belongs to the Biſhop of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſe where ſuch exerciſes are) the Church-Wardens and Sideſmen are given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there be amongſt us three ſorts of Lecturers.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 The firſt, moſt hugged, followed, admired and maintained, is a ſuper-inducted Lecturer in another mans cure and paſtorall charge, who hath ſome reſemblance to the ancient Cathariſt in the Primitive Church, but is up and down the ſame with the Doctor in the New Diſcipline; which (I take it) is the motive of his ſo great appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and good entertainment above the Incumbent of the Cure, though never ſo learned and painfull.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 Concerning him, it is to be enquired, of what degrees in Schools he is? and of how long ſtanding and ſtudying in Divinity? whether he be a graduate in Divinity, a Doctor, or at leaſt a Batchelor, and not a young Student or Preacher?</p>
                              <p n="3">3 Are his Lectures popular Afternoon Sermons? or be they Catechiſticall, and readings upon ſome common place of Divinity, or the four parts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Catechiſme, or ſome of the 39 Articles of our Confeſſion?</p>
                              <p n="4">4 Is he there admitted with the conſent of the Incumbent, or againſt his will, with warrant and authority from the Biſhop, under his Epiſcopall ſeal? Is the Miniſter and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61245:194"/>
Incumbent of that place where he Lectureth, a Preacher or not? and if a Benefice be offered the Lecturer, do you ſuppoſe he would take it?</p>
                              <p n="5">5 Doth he often and at times appointed read Divine Service, and adminiſter the Communion in his Surpliſſe and Hood of his degree?</p>
                              <p n="6">6 Of what length are his Lectures, and how is his Prayer at beginning and end? is he there in conforme unto the Appointment and Order of the Canon? <hi>Can.</hi> 55.</p>
                              <p n="7">7 Doth he in his popular Lectures ordinarily fall upon points of miſticall, darke, and abſtruſe Divinity, as Praedeſtination &amp;c. Doth he intermeddle with matters of State, Government, forrein from his profeſſion, above his underſtanding?</p>
                              <p n="8">8 Doth he oppoſe or traduce openly the Doctrine of his Brethren and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters; or obliquely, underhand or upon the by gird at them, the Doctrine, Diſcipline of the Church, any Pariſhioner &amp;c. ſo deſigning him, them, or that, that a man may take notice of his meaning?</p>
                              <p n="9">9 The ſecond ſort of Lecturers be thoſe of Combination, when many neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters do voluntarily agree and conſent with the Ordinaries approbation, not otherwiſe, to preach a Sermon, every man in his courſe, at ſome adjoyning market town, upon the market day, for inſtructing of ſuch who repair together to ſell and buy in their duty to God, and commerce with man: Have you any ſuch Lecturers?</p>
                              <p n="10">10 Who be the Combiners? be they beneficed men of the Dioceſſe, and not ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or Curates? who are not to be admitted, becauſe if they offend in their Sermons the Dioceſan cannot reach them; they are gone.</p>
                              <p n="11">11 Doth this Lecturer any way abridge, hinder, or cut off Divine Service, which is compleatly to be finiſhed before the Lecture begin?</p>
                              <p n="12">12 Do any reſorting thereto, walke aloofe, or in the Church-yard, on ſtay at ſome houſe purpoſely, and not repair to the Church till Lecture begin? If any ſuch miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour be, preſent it; and without amendment the Lecture ſhall ceaſe.</p>
                              <p n="13">13 A third ſort be running Lecturers: who point upon ſuch a day to meete at ſuch a Church, moſt an end in ſome Country Town or Village; and then after Sermon, and dinner at ſome houſe of their diſciples, repeat, cenſure, and explain the Sermon, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of points propoſed at their laſt meeting, by the head of that Claſſis or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ever to the promoting of their owne fancies, and derogation from the doctrine, and diſcipline of the Church: after all, they do again <hi>condicere,</hi> and appoint to meet next at ſuch a Church, in like ſort, to like purpoſe. Such I found in <hi>Suſſex</hi> at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither. If you have any ſuch, or know any ſuch, preſent them (as far as you can learn) who they be, where they do meet, whither any of your Pariſh run after them.</p>

But with all he hath made this humble ſuit to my Lords Grace, that if you vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit that Church and Colledge, they may not be ſummoned out of their own Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but rather that in your way from <hi>Litchfield</hi> to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> your viſitation may be held in that very Place, it being a goodly Collegiate Church, and every way ſit for it <note n="*" place="margin">I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Wolver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> is but 12. miles from <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and not out of the way to <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> Might you not be there on <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> May 18.?</note>. In which my Lord wills you by all means to give Mr Dean content in what may conveniently be done. And whereas his Grace is informed that the Place is much given to Faction, and that the laſt Summer there were ſome very good Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Acts, and other Orders made by my Lord the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> then Dean, to ſettle things there in a Church way, and to curbe the inſolency of ſome men, who ſince, upon occaſion of this my Lords Viſitation are bold to give it out, that they will have all reverſed <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Grace hath commanded me to ſignifie his expreſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61245:196"/>
to you, That no former Act made by the Chapter there, nor any Order appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Deane, be reverſed, or any wayes altered, without firſt acquainting his Grace therewith. And that you take ſpeciall notice of one Mr <hi>Lee,</hi> a Prebend there who hath been the Author of much diſorder thereabouts, <hi>And if you can faſten upon any thing, whereby he may juſtly be cenſured, pray ſee it be done, and home, or bring him to the High Commiſſion Court to anſwer it there,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But HOWEVER let him not obtain any Licenſe to Preach any Lecture there, or in another Exempt place hard by at</hi> Tetenſhall, <hi>whither thoſe of</hi> Wolverhampton <hi>do now run after him, out of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;</hi>

If you speak with Mr</hi> Latham <hi>of</hi> Litchfield <hi>who is the Surrogate there, he will informe you more fully concerning this Buſineſſe.</hi> That he (the ſaid Mr <hi>Lee)</hi> hath Churched Refractory Women in private &amp;c.

It was to make a farewell Sermon to that exerciſe, as he ſaith: wherein he rather aggravateth his fault then otherwiſe.

                  <p>His third deſign to ſuppreſſe preaching was, by diſcouraging conſcientious young Schollers and Divines from entering into the Miniſtry by putting divers clogs &amp; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties <note place="margin">3.</note> upon them, under a moſt ſpecious pretext; which was thus effected: No ſooner was this Prelate ſetled in his Archbiſhoprick, but he contrived a Letter, drawn by Mr <hi>Dell</hi> his Secretary, but interlined, corrected with his own hand, (as appears by the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall</hi> draught found in his ſtudy) directed as from his Majeſtie to himſelf; which he afterwards preſented to the King, who directed and ſent it to him under his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Signet</hi> to be put in Execution, in manner following, as the very Letter it ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Kings Signet</hi> declares; thus endorſed with the Archbiſhops own hand; <hi>Rec.

There is nothing more deer to US then the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true Religion, as it is now ſettled and eſtabliſhed in this our Kingdome, to the honour of God and the great comfort of our ſelfe, and our Loyall people; and there can nothing more conduce to the advancement thereof then the ſtrict obſervation of ſuch <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church as concern thoſe that are to take orders in their ſeverall times. More eſpecially of keeping that particular <hi>Canon</hi> which injoyns, <hi>That no man be made a Prieſt or a Miniſter without a Title:</hi> For we finde that many not ſo qualified, do by favour or other means procure themſelves to be ordeined, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for want of means, wander up and downe to the ſcandall of their calling, or to get maintenance fall upon ſuch courſes as are moſt unfit for them, both by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring their Auditours and other wayes altogether unſufferable. Wee have therefore thought fit and Wee doe hereby ſtreightly require and charge

you to call ſuch Biſhops to you as are now preſent in or neer our City of <hi>London</hi> and to acqulint them with this our reſolution. And further that you faile not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next Terme to give notice of this our will and pleaſure openly in our <hi>High Commiſſion Court,</hi> and that you call into our ſaid Court every Biſhop reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively that ſhall preſume to give Orders to any man that hath not a Title, and there to cenſure him as the Canon aforeſaid doth injoyn (which is to maintain the party ſo ordered till he give him a Title) and with what other cenſure you in Juſtice ſhall think ſit. And our further will is, <hi>That nothing ſhall be reputed a Title to enable a man for orders, but that which is ſo by the ancient courſe of the Church, and the Canon</hi>

                        </opener>
                        <p>HIS Majeſtie hath been often and much troubled upon complaints which have been made unto him by the Lords and other men of quality, concerning the multitude or both unlearned and unworthy Miniſters, which peſter the Church, and are alwayes the Cauſes of great ſcandall, and too often of Schiſm and Diviſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And ſome of them are forced, to the ſhame of themſelves and their Calling, for want of means to begg for their Living, and yet are daily made in great numbers, and that directly againſt the Canon of the Church, which require's, <hi>That no man should be made a Miniſter ſine Titulo.</hi> For remedy of this great abuſe and wrong to the Church, his Majeſtie hath directed his Letters to me, and by them required me to call all ſuch Biſhops to me,, as were then in or about the City, and after conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, to ſend my Letters to every ſeverall Biſhop within the Province, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire obedience to the Canon of the Church, and his Majeſties directions according to it. The Tenor of his Majeſties Letter followeth, (as before).</p>
                        <p>ACcording to theſe Letters I am to pray and require you, that at all times of Ordination you be very carefull to admit none into Holy Orders, but ſuch men as for life and learning are fit, and which have a Title for their Maintenance, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes and ancient practiſe of the Church. And his Majeſty hath farther commanded me to advertiſe your Lordſhip, that He will not faile to call for <note place="margin">Note.</note> an Accompt of theſe his Letters both of me and you. Thus not doubting but you will have a ſpeciall care both of the good of the Church and his Majeſties content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein: I leave you to the Grace of God and reſt.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>And I think the Canon intends that after a Man is once admitted a Curate, the Parſon or Vicar of the place ſhould not have power to put them off at pleaſure, but only for ſuch criminall unworthineſſe as might deprive him of his Benefice if hee had one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So I conceive, under favour, the Order may go briefly thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And farther his Majeſties expreſſe Command is, that this Canon be ſtrictly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all Biſhops in their ſeverall Dioceſſes reſpectively, and that none preſume to ordeine any man to be a Deacon, Prieſt or Miniſter under the penalty injoyned in the Canon, or any other which his Majeſties juſt diſpleaſure may inflict upon him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Letters <hi>primâ facié</hi> ſeem very faire, neceſſary; but <hi>latet Anguis in herba:</hi> there was a dangerous deſigne couched under them.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, no Lecture whatſoever, was admitted to be a Canonicall Title: and ſo all ordination of Miniſters to ſupply Lectures was totally ſecluded: which was one chiefe end of this deſigne. Secondly, no <hi>Chaplainſhip</hi> to any Noblemans or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans family was allowed to be a ſufficient Title; and this gave a fatall blow to all ſuch young Chaplains ordinations; unleſſe they had ſome better Title and Livelihood for the future; which was likewiſe formerly aimed at in the precedent <hi>Conſiderations</hi> and <hi>Inſtructions.</hi> And by this device many yong Divines were in a manner quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of ſuch Religious Gentlemens Families, which might ſeaſon them with the practicall power of godlineſſe, or any principles which the Prelates held to be <hi>Puritaniſme</hi> or <hi>Preciſeneſſe.</hi> Thirdly, by this device all young Students in Divinity were made more dependent on, more obſequious to the Biſhops, &amp; leſs dependent on the Nobility, Gentry, people; as the Letters inſinuate. Fourthly, under pretent of theſe Letters a kinde of new ſubſcription was impoſed on all ſuch who were to be ordained (eſpecially if ſuſpected to be orthodox or preciſe) to ſundry Arminian, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Errours, and Superſtitions, upon which they were interrogated to ſound their inclinations, and denyed Orders in caſe of diſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Whether all baptized Infants were not truly regenerated? Whether Epiſcopacy and the Hierarchy of Bishops were not of divine Right? Whether the Church of Rome were not a true Church? Whether Altars, Copes, Organs, Tapers, Crucifixes and Images were not lawfull? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly regenerate men might not totally and finally fall from Grace?</hi> and the like, By which Interrogations, and many new Ceremonies introduced at ordinations, ſundry godly Schollers and Students of Divinity were deterred from taking Orders, and a Superſtitious, Popiſh, prophane, Epiſcopall generation of New ordained Prieſts (zealous to promote, embrace the very groſleſt Doctrines and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rome,) engeadred and ſcattered among us in moſt places; all powerfull

                     <hi>That whereas divers gifts and diſpoſitions of divers ſummes of mony were heretofore made by divers charitable and well-diſpoſed perſons for the buying in of divers Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations for the maintenance of preaching the word of God in ſeverall Churches, the ſaid Archbiſhop about eight years laſt paſt, wilfully and maliciouſly cauſed the ſaid gifts feofments and contrivances made to the uſes aforeſaid to be overthrown in his Majesties Court of Exchequer contrary to law, as things dangerous to the Church and State, under the ſpecious pretence of buying in Impropriations; whereby that pious worke was ſuppreſſed and trodden down, to the great diſhonour of God and ſcandall of Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Article informes us briefly what theſe Feoffees were, we ſhall only add who they were, what they did, and how they were proceeded againſt by this Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. About the year 1626. ſome godly Perſons in and about <hi>London</hi> to promote the preaching of the Goſpel, and ſet up a Preaching Miniſtry to inſtruct the people in divers great Towns and Pariſhes impropriate where they wanted means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Preaching, of which they had long been deſtitute in former times, reſolved to lay their purſes together and chuſe out of themſelves four Divines, four Common Lawyers, and four Citizens of note who ſhould be Feoffees in truſt to purchaſe in theſe Impropriations, and with the profits of them to ſet up and maintain a conſtant preaching Miniſtery in places of greateſt need and eminency: whereupon they made choice of Dr <hi>W. Gouge,</hi> Dr <hi>R. Sibbs, C. Ofſpring,</hi> &amp; <hi>I. Davenport</hi> Divines. <hi>Ralph Eyre, S. Brown</hi> of Lincolas Inne, <hi>C. Sherland</hi> of Greyes Inne, <hi>J. White</hi> of middle Temple Eſquires, Common Lawyers. <hi>Iohn Geering, Richard Davis, George Harwood</hi> and <hi>Francis Bridges,</hi> Citizens; to be Feoffees for this purpoſe; who with their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes and the contributions of other well-affected perſons in 2 or 3 years ſpace pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed in the Impropriations of <hi>Hartford, Dunſtable, Cirencester,</hi> with others, and ſet up able preaching conformable Miniſters (authorized by the Biſhops of the Dioceſſe) there in many other places where they had never any before; as likewiſe at <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north Clarely;</hi> and had they not been interrupted in this good work, would in very few years in all probability, have purchaſed in moſt of the great Towns &amp; noted Pariſhes Impropriations of <hi>England</hi> in Lay-mens hands, where Preaching was moſt wanting, and meanes to maintain it. No ſooner had this Malignant Prelate notice of this pious religious work, but out of his enmity to Preaching, and the good of ignorant peoples ſouls (whom he would rather have ſtill keept in blindneſſe and the chaines of Sathan, then inſtructed with the Goſpels light, and brought under the Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt) he preſently projects not only the obſtruction, but utter ſubvertion of this pious deſigne, which none but a Devill incarnate, or Enemy of all goodneſſe could diſlike; many even of the worſer ſort of Biſhops, yea Courtiers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding it, as a very neceſſary and godly work.</p>
                  <p>That he himſelf projected the overthrow of theſe Feoffees, was proved out of his own Diary; where thus he writes in the cloſe of it. <hi>Things which I have projected to do, if Godbleſſe me in them:</hi> the third whereof is this: <hi>To overthrow the Feofment dangerous both to Church and State, going under the ſpecious pretence of buying in Impropriations.</hi> Over againſt which he writes in the Margin, <hi>DONE:</hi> which fights
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61245:199"/>
point-blanke with his very next project of a quite contrary nature, juſtifying theſe Feoffees acts, namely: <hi>To procure King</hi> CHARLES <hi>to give all the Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons yet remaining in the Crown within the Realme of</hi> Ireland, <hi>to that poor Church:</hi> Againſt which he writes in the Margin; <hi>Done and ſettled there:</hi> though to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of that Crownes revenues, and that by power of the <hi>Councell Table,</hi> in an arbitrary, forcible and illegall way, to the undoing of many; as appears by ſundry Originall Letters thence; whereas the Feoffees buying in Impropriations did no wayes leſſen the Kings revenues, and was done in a juſt and legall way. To over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this pious work, he cauſed Mr <hi>Noy</hi> the Kings Atturney Generall, by the Kings command, to exhibit a Bill againſt theſe Feoffees in the Eſchequer Chamber, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate their purchaſed Impropriations to the King by a Decree of that Court, and ſo diſſolve all they had done: which Bill was proſecuted with all violence. To ſet on the proſecution with more edge he ſuborned his flattering creatures to declaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Feoffees and their deſign in the Pulpit both at Court and elſewhere. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, his great Minion <hi>Peter Heylin,</hi> preaching at Saint <hi>Maryes</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> before the whole <hi>

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61245:199"/>
maintenance of Miniſters and Preachers where there was moſt need; that they bought them with their own moneyes, and the monyes of their friends, and diſpoſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues thereof to none, nor placed any Miniſter in any Church, but ſuch as they took more then ordinary care ſhould be throughly examined by the Ordinary of the place, for his Sufficiency and full Conformity by law required. And therefore hee beſought him earneſtly, that he would not uſe his power to hinder and deſtroy ſo good a work, but rather to cheriſh and further it: And if he diſliked either the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who managed it, or the courſe they took in ordering the ſame, they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſuch other meet perſons and rules for the regulating and carrying on of that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke as he ſhould think fit. But notwithſtanding this and all other Arguments he could uſe and earneſtly preſſe him withall, the <hi>Biſhop with much paſſion expreſly declared his reſolution, to break the neck of this good worke, that it should not proceed:</hi> Whereupon an Information was exhibited againſt the Feoffees by his procurement in the Eſchequer Chamber in the Kings name, by Mr <hi>Noy</hi> the Kings Attorny Generall, and ſentence given againſt them for ſeiſing all the Impropriations they had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and monyes received by them, into the Kings hands; whereby this good worke was deſtroy'd; the profits diverted to other uſes (as appears by the <hi>Docquet Book</hi> ultimo Decembris 1638. and Sir <hi>William Whitmores</hi> Petition to the Archbiſhop <hi>Novemb.</hi> 13. 1633. found in his ſtudy) and deboyſt ſcandalous unworthy Miniſters, ſuch as had been formerly turned out by other BPS put in to them; wheras they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſundry godly Miniſters and ſix Lecturers at S. <hi>Antholins</hi> with the profits of the Impropriations purchaſed. After which, Mr <hi>White</hi> atteſted there was another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation put by the Kings Attorny into the Exchequer criminally againſt theſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees, as grand Delinquents, and that by this Archbiſhops direction, as was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by a Note produced by Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> under Secretary <hi>Windebanks</hi> own hand, to this effect.</p>

                  <p>Mr <hi>Thomas Foxly</hi> a reverend Divine depoſed upon Oath, <hi>Viva Voce;</hi> That about Eight years ſince, <hi>William Laud</hi> now <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury</hi> did put down his Lecture on Fridayes at Saint <hi>Martins</hi> in the fields, for fear (as he pretended) leaſt thoſe that came thereunto ſhould infect the Kings, Queenes and ſuch Noble mens houſes as were in that Pariſh, with the Plague, though there then dyed very few in and about <hi>London</hi> of that diſeaſe, the Plague not being then in that Pariſh when his ſayd Lecture was ſuppreſſed, though God brought it into the Pariſh the very next weeke after its ſuppreſſion; by means whereof this deponent was deprived of his preſent livelyhood. After which he being brought before the ſaid Biſhop for divers frivilous matters whiles he was Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and cleared of them, becauſe there was no colour of Crime againſt him; <hi>The ſaid Bishop charged him, for intermedling with the buſineſſe of buying in Impropriations, and thereby endeavouring (as he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by putting his fingers to his Girdle and shaking of it) to bring the Bishops under the Feoffees Girdles for Impropriations; and when this deponent anſwered him, that this could not be, ſince the Miniſters on which they beſtowed the ſaid Impropriations were ſent to the respective Bishops of every Dioceſſe to be approved by them;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>that if he had known this deponent to be ſo buſie in this matter of redeeming Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations he should not have ſo eaſily gotten off before, as he did.</hi> And he farther depoſed,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61245:200"/>
that about nineteen Moneths before this preſent Parliament he having a Chamber in <hi>London</hi> and ſtudy in <hi>Canewood</hi> neer <hi>Highgate,</hi> was rifled by Purſevants and taken and kept Priſoner for two Dayes and two Nights ſpace, by vertue of a generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to ſearch for Popiſh Books and ſuſpected Perſons, and bidden to chooſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would be brought before the now Archbiſhop, or Sir <hi>John Lambe;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he bid the Purſevant carry him whither he would; who carryed him to Sir <hi>John Lambe;</hi> who told him, he muſt put in Bond to appear the next Thurſday at the <hi>High Commiſſion;</hi> which he did accordingly: on which Thurſday morning by meanes of <hi>Dr Bray,</hi> he obtaining ſpeech which the ſaid Archbiſhop, deſired him to grant him one weekes time to conſider, whether he might take the oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> or not: which he hardly granting, the ſaid Archbiſhop ſaid; <hi>He had almoſt forgotten him, but by way of threatning ſaid, he remembred him about the buſineſſe of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees:</hi> to which the deponent replyed; <hi>That he was encouraged therein by Biſhops</hi>

                     <hi>and Privy Councellors, who ſometimes conceived it to be a very good worke to redeem Impropriations;</hi> and ſo he was deſired to appear the Thurſday following. But the very next Lords day another Purſevant was ſent to this deponent, who bringing him to the Councell Chamber door and there attending about halfe an Hour, a warrant under the ſaid <hi>Archbiſhops hand and five others,</hi> was delivered to the ſaid Purſevant to carry him to the <hi>Gate houſe;</hi> where he was kept cloſe Priſoner in a Chamber, not four yards ſquare, for the ſpace of twenty months; not having the allowance of pen and Inke to Petition, that he might know whom or wherein he had offended; that ſo he might repent, through God gives leave, yea calls upon the greateſt ſinners to Petition to him: and at three Months end (he growing very ſick by reaſon of his cloſe Impriſonment, and for want of one to cut his Haire, which he uſed to wear ſhort for his health) fell very ſick: his wife thereupon Petitioned time after time to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him being at the very point of death, as his keeper informed her, but could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by her ſelfe, nor any other friends, procure acceſſe unto him, untill ſuch time as Sir <hi>Mathew Liſter</hi> was appointed by the Privy Coucell to come unto him, to ſee in what ill caſe he was: upon whoſe certificate and fifty ſhillings paid Sir <hi>William Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In which ſtrict cloſe Impriſonment by the ſaid Archbiſhops procurement, he continued till about a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths ſpace after this preſent Parliament began, and then upon a Petition of his wives to the Houſe of Commons he was releaſed without bayl, and his ſaid Impriſonment by them voted Illegall; there being all this while no proceedings againſt him, nor any crime objected to him in any Court of Juſtice. By means of which Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was much prejudiced and undone in his Eſtate, and his wife with four ſmall children expoſed to Pennury and Beggery.</p>

it in theſe few <hi>Duth</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches planted here among us; who enjoyed their owne Government, Priviledges, Diſcipline without any interruption by any of his Predeceſſors, or other Engliſh Prelates, in all our Proteſtant Princes reignes, from King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth his reigne, till this Archprelates moleſtation of, and attempts againſt them, thus laid down in the twelfth <hi>Originall Article</hi> of his Impeachment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He hath Traiterouſly endeavoured to cauſe diviſion and diſcord between the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and other Reformed Churches; and to that end hath ſuppreſt and abrogated the Priviledges and Immunities which have been by his Majeſty and his Royall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors granted to the</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> French <hi>Churches in this Kingdom. And divers other wayes hath expreſſed his malice and diſaffection to theſe Churches, that ſo by ſuch diſ-union, the Papiſts might have more advantage for the overthrow and extirpation of both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make good this Article we could produce many Letters, Papers, Inſtructions, Orders under the Archbiſhops own hand, or indorſed by him, found in his own ſtudy, here ready at the Barre; but for brevity ſake we ſhall inſtance only in ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of more ſpeciall note.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that this Arch-prelate though he beares ſo good an affection and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reſpect to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as to juſtifie her to be, <hi>a true viſible Apoſtolike Church, which never erred in fundamentals, and wherein men may be ſaved; and that we and ſhe are one and the ſame Church ſtill, no doubt of that, both one;</hi> as we have <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 235. 240, 241.</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved: Yet he is ſo maliciouſly deſpitefull to the Proteſtant Churches in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign parts, and at home, that he reputes them not only <hi>no true Churches,</hi> but <hi>even no Churches at all,</hi> becauſe they have no Lord-biſhops, different in Order and Degree from ordinary Miniſters. This opinion of his we ſhall manifeſt, not only by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity Queſtions when he was to proceed Batchelor and Doctor of Divinity (for which Dr <hi>Holland</hi> publickly <hi>checkt, and turned him out of the Schools with diſgrace, as a ſower of diſcord between Brethren, to wit the Church of England and other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;)</hi> but by his own late reprinted Book <hi>An</hi> 1639. entituled, <hi>A Relation of the Conference between</hi> William Laud, <hi>then Lord Biſhop of</hi> St. Davids, <hi>now Lord Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and</hi> Mr Fiſher <hi>the Jeſuite &amp;c.</hi> p. 175, 176. where thus he writes (in juſtification of his former <hi>Theſes</hi> in the Divinity Schools:) <hi>For the calling and Authority of Biſhops over the inferiour Clergy, that was a thing</hi> of known uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for preſervation of Truth and Peace in the Church. <hi>And ſo much</hi> St Ierom <hi>tels us, though being none himſelfe, he was no great friend to Biſhops: And this was ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the mindes of men</hi> from the very infancy of the Chriſtian Church, as <hi>that it had not been till that time contradicted by any. So that then there was no controverſie about the calling, all agreed upon it.</hi> Then citing <hi>Jeroms</hi> words in the margin, he thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them. <hi>So, even according to</hi> St. Ierom, <hi>Biſhops had a very ancient and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deſcent in the Church from</hi> St. Mark <hi>the Evangelist: And about the end of the ſame Epiſtle he acknowledgeth it,</hi> Traditionem eſſe Apoſtolicam: <hi>Nay more then ſo, he affirmes plainly, That</hi> ubi non eſt Sacerdos, NON EST ECCLESIA (St. Ierom <hi>adverſ. Luciferianos:)</hi> And <hi>in that place moſt manifeſt it is, that</hi> St. Ierom <hi>by</hi> Sacerdos <hi>meanes a Biſhop; for he ſpeaks</hi> de Sacerdote qui poteſtatem habet Ordinandi: <hi>which in</hi> St. Ieroms <hi>owne judgement, no meere Prieſt had, but a Biſhop only,</hi> St. Ierom <hi>Epist. ad Evagrium: ſo even with him,</hi> NO BISHOP NO CHURCH. Which being his own poſitive judgement, the Dutch and French Proteſtant Churches both at home and abroad, muſt needs be no Church at all in his opinion, becauſe they have no ſuch Biſhops; and ſo are in farre worſe condition then the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his repute.</p>
                  <p>To make this more apparent, we ſhall deſire you to take notice, that in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1639. there was a plot between this Archbiſhop and others of our Prelates to obtrude upon all our Miniſters this ſubſcription, as the received <hi>Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; to wit, that there could be no Church of Chriſt without Dioceſan Lord Biſhops; which clearly appeares by the <note n="*" place="margin">Here p. 237, 238.</note> forementioned propoſitions of Biſhop <hi>Hall, which the Archbiſhop thought fit for the ſubſcription of others:</hi> but eſpecially by the 1. 12. and 13. propoſitions <hi>viz. God had never any Church on earth that was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a Parity: There was NO CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH OF CHRIST <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PON EARTH</hi>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:61245:201"/>
                     <hi>ever ſince the times of the Apoſtles governed any otherwiſe then by Biſhops. This courſe of government thus ſet by the Apoſtles in their life time, by the ſpeciall direction of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, is unalterable by any humane Authority, but O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT to be perpetuated in the Church to the end of the world.</hi> From whence it inevitably followes, that the reformed forraign Churches having no ſuch imparity of Governours nor Lordly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in them, are in this Arch-Prelates and his Confederates judgements, <hi>No Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God or Chriſt at all;</hi> and if the deſigne of ſubſcribing theſe Propoſitions had ſucceeded (as it did in the <hi>Etcetera</hi> Oath for a time) he would have engaged the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> with all our Miniſters by a publike ſubſcription, in this moſt unchriſtian and uncharitable opinion; which not prevailing, was yet ſoone after thus ſeconded in print by his grand Favourite Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> (whom he advanced to two Biſhopricks) in his <hi>Originum Eccleſiaſticarum Tomi prioris Pars poſterior p.</hi> 464, publiſhed with his approbation, authorized by his Chaplain Dr <hi>Bray,</hi> preſented to, and accepted by himſelfe when publiſhed, as appears by two faire gilded printed copies thereof with his Archiepiſcopall Armes engraven on the Covers, found in his ſtudy by Mr <hi>Pryune</hi> (printed <hi>An.</hi> 1640.) ſince theſe Propoſitions of Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> were ſent him; reſolving, that there can be not only no Church, but no Miniſters at all without Biſhops to ordain them, in theſe terms. <hi>Non eſt Sacerdotium niſi in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, non eſt Eccleſia ſine Sacerdotio.

The witneſſes are Mr <hi>Wakerly</hi> (then Secretary to Mr <hi>Secretary Cook)</hi> and Mr <hi>Hartlib,</hi> who depoſed at the Lords Barre upon Oath; That in the yeare 1634. the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> ſent over one Mr <hi>Ruly</hi> a Palatinate Miniſter into <hi>England,</hi> with Letters of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Archbiſhop, to deſire his mediation and aſſiſtance to the King, to grant Letters Patents under the great ſeale, for a <hi>generall Collection towards the reliefe of the exiled Miniſters of the Palatinate and their families, who were then in great diſtreſſe:</hi> which Letter Mr <hi>Ruly</hi> preſenting to the Archbiſhop (among whoſe Papers Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> found the very Originall) after the reading thereof, the Archbiſhop promiſed (out of reſpect to the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> who writ to him with her own hand) to move the King in it, which he did; and then informed him, that it was the Kings pleaſure there ſhould be Letters Patents drawn for a generall collection for thoſe Miniſters as was deſired: Wherupon Mr <hi>Ruly</hi> requeſted the Archbiſhop, in regard he was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and knew not our proceedings, to give him ſome directions how to get the Letters Patents drawn and ſealed; who anſwered, that he needed no inſtructions herein, for it was a thing of uſuall courſe, and willed him to repaire to the Officers of the King (his Secretaries and Attorney generall) who would draw and procure them to be ſealed. Whereupon he repaired to Mr <hi>Wakerly,</hi> who went with him to the other Officers and procured Letters Patents to be drawn according to former Preſidents, both in King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> reignes, and namely <hi>verbatim,</hi> according to Letters Patents for a like Collection, dated 29 <hi>Ian.</hi> 3. <hi>Caroli,</hi> which being drawn, engroſſed, and paſſed the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> without any ſcruple (the Lord Keeper both reading and approving the ſame before the ſealing) Mr <hi>Ruly</hi> carried the Patent over to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to deſire the Archbiſhops aſſiſtance for the printing, diſperſing and promoting therof; where meeting with Mr <hi>Dell,</hi> his Secretary, he acquainted him with his buſineſſe, and ſhewed him the Patent, who caſting his eye thereon, took ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereat, <hi>becauſe it made our and their Religion to be both one,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Are your Church and Religion and ours one?</hi> which done, he carried the Patent to the Archbiſhop, <note place="margin">Note</note> who after he had peruſed it, calling for Mr <hi>Ruly,</hi> demanded of him in a very angry man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>What have you brought me here?</hi> Mr <hi>Ruly</hi> replied, <hi>His Majeſties Letters Patents.</hi> At which <hi>anſwer he fell into a great paſſion, rating and reviling Mr</hi> Ruly <hi>with very ill language; threatned and called him ill names; proteſted that that Patent ſhould not paſſe though it were under the Great Seale, and made Mr</hi> Dell <hi>write ſomething out of it:</hi> Mr <hi>Ruly</hi> ſhaking for feare, excuſed himſelfe, that it was drawn by the Officers to whom his Grace had directed him, and if there were ought offenſive in it, he was altogether ignorant and not guilty of it. Whereunto the Archbiſhop replied; <hi>that were it not for his respect and engagements to the Queen of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>they ſhould have no collection at all, and that he could finde in his heart to quaſh it; but however he would ſuppreſſe that Patent, which he detained by him, and would have one drawn in another forme.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr <hi>Ruly</hi> leaving him to his angry mood departed, and acquainted Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſe caſes are more to be deplored, for that this extremity is fallen upon them for their ſincerity and conſtancy IN THE TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E RELIGION, which WE, TOGETHER</hi>

                  <p>In lieu whereof he only inſerts, <hi>That they ſuffered FOR THEIR RELIGION;</hi> as if our Religion and <hi>theris</hi> were contra-diſtinct and different one from another, and theirs not the true. Which Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> when he ſaw affirmed would make a Schiſm, a Diviſion betwixt us and the forraign Proteſtant Churches, by intimating that they profeſſed neither our, nor yet the true Religion, (as Mr <hi>Wakerly</hi> depoſed) and gave great ſcandall and offence to the Deponents, yea to the forraign Churches and Proteſtants here, who took ſpeciall Notice of it.</p>
                  <p>In this notable peece of Evidence we ſhall deſire your Lordſhips and the world to take notice of theſe remarkable particulars. Firſt, of this Archbiſhops inſufferable Inſolency, in daring to preſume ſo farre as to ſtop, ſuppreſſe the Kings own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Parents when approved by his Royall Signature, allowed by the Lord Keeper, and actually paſſed under the Great Seale of <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, his extraordinary over-ruling power with the King, who againſt his own Iudgement, Signe Manuall, Seale, and former Preſidents, muſt have this Patent altered in this clauſe, only <hi>becauſe the Archbiſhop would have it ſo,</hi> and for no other reaſon. Thirdly, that this alteration proceeded meerly from the Archbiſhops own motion, not from any Prieſts or Ieſuits inſtigation, much leſſe from the King (as he <note n="f" place="margin">Speech in Star-chamber, <hi>p.</hi> 32. to 39. See here <hi>p.</hi> 247. 248</note> pretended the alterations of the <hi>Prayer-Book for the fifth of November</hi> did.) Fourthly, that he was exceeding paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and enraged at this clauſe, inſomuch that this charitable Collection and Patent muſt totally be quaſhed, rather then this clauſe tolerated; whereas his Chaplaines au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Books in commendation of Popery, Popiſh Errours, yea pleading for <hi>Rome</hi> and her Religion as true, and one with ours. Fiftly, that this very clauſe had paſſed both the Broad Seal and Preſſe too, without the leaſt exceptions, in a Patent, 29 <hi>Ian.</hi> 3. <hi>Caroli</hi> not full ſeven yeares before, even in King <hi>Charles</hi> his own Reign; and in another <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Collection</hi> granted under the Privy Signet the ſeventeenth of Iune, in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of King <hi>James, Anno Dom.</hi> 1618. <hi>for reliefe of the Inhabitants of the Town of</hi> Weſell; then printed by Authority, together with <hi>Archbiſhop Abbots directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame to the ſeverall Biſhops under him, dated June</hi> 25. 1618. wherein we finde theſe following expreſſions; <hi>That that City had been a place of ſuccour and reliefe to many afflicted ſtrangers, ſuch as have been exiled for THE TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E RELIGION That they were not able any longer to ſuſtaine the charge neither of the Miniſtry, nor of the Free-ſchoole, which heretofore they have erected for the propagation of THE</hi>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:61245:202"/>
                     <hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E RELIGION &amp;c. which ſhould excite us to enlarge the Bowels of compaſſions toward them, which cannot be better expreſſed of our parts, then by having compaſſion and a fellow-feeling of them, MAKING THE SAME PROFESSION OF FAITH THAT WE DO, yet doe ſuffer ſuch adverſity &amp;c.</hi> which are the ſame <hi>in terminis</hi> with thoſe in this expunged Patent. What then was the cauſe that this Clauſe ſhould be thought ſo inſufferable, ſo impaſſible by this Archprelate now? Certainly there muſt be ſome great myſtery of Iniquity in it; he and his Predeceſſor <hi>Abbot</hi> had not the ſelfe-ſame opinion of the Proteſtant Churches and their Religion. <hi>Abbot</hi> deemed both their Churches and Religion true, and the ſame with ours; but <hi>Laud</hi> deemes them no Churches at all, their Religion not the true Religion, nor the ſame with ours at this time, though formerly one and the ſame with it. And why ſo? becauſe himſelfe had altered, perverted, yea almoſt quite ſubverted it, both in Deſign and Execution, intending to ſet up Popery as the only old and true Religion: therefore to ſuffer ſuch a Patent to paſſe both the Great Seal and Preſſe in his Majeſties name, as ſhould proclaim their Religion, <hi>to be the true Religion, which we together with them do profeſſe, and we are all bound in conſcience to maintain to the uttermoſt of our power;</hi> when he and his Confederates bent all their might to ſuppreſſe it; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their <hi>ſincerity and conſtancy in the true Religion, when as they might have enjoyed their eſtates and fortunes, if with other backſliders, in the times of Tryall they would have ſubmitted themſelves to the Antichriſtian Yoak, and have renounced or diſſembled their profeſſion of the true Religion,</hi> in theſe dayes when he with his Confederates endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make men Backſliders, Apoſtates, and perſwaded them to <hi>ſubmit themſelves to the Antichristian yoak,</hi> and to <hi>renounce or diſſemble the profeſſion of the true Religion,</hi> would have quite croſſed or fruſtrated his Deſign; Therfore out it muſt, and be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated whatever comes of it. Finally, obſerve his imbittered malice to the Proteſtant Churches, but grand affection to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> moſt evidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by this expunction: the firſt in deleating thoſe clauſes which ſtyle theirs, <hi>the true Religion,</hi> &amp;c. the latter in expunging this expreſſion in favour of the Roman Church and Pontife only, <hi>if they would have ſubmitted themſelves to THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN YOAK;</hi> which we have elſewhere <note n="*" place="margin">Page 263.</note> dilated upon. In briefe, He that thus would have the Proteſtant Churches no Churches at all of God or Chriſt, their Miniſters no Miniſters, their Religion not the true Religion, nor the ſame with ours, muſt certainly expreſſe <hi>abundance of malice and diſaffection to theſe Churches, endeavour to cauſe diſcord and diviſion between the Church of England and them;</hi> (the very charge in the Article) and proclaime himſelfe a greater friend to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Religion, then to the Proteſtant Churches and the true Religion in them profeſſed: yea a Trayterous endeavourer to ſubvert the true Religion eſtabliſhed in our Engliſh Church, which is the ſame with theirs. And the rather may we beleeve this of the Archbiſhop, becauſe ſhortly after he cauſed a Book entituled, <hi>A Declaration of the Faith and Ceremonies of the Palſgraves Churches,</hi> printed firſt in Dutch, but afterwards in Engliſh <hi>Anno</hi> 1637. to be ſtrictly called in and ſeized by his Purſevants (in high affront of the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> then newly arrived in <hi>England,</hi> and of his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) becauſe it declared thoſe Churches Orthodox judgement and cenſure againſt ſundry Arminian and Popiſt Errours, Innovations, Ceremonies, which hee and his Confederates then laboured to introduce among us; as was atteſted upon Oath by <hi>Michael Spark</hi> ſenior and Mr <hi>Prynne;</hi> when as we never heard of any Popiſh Books (as <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> and others here printed) either called in or ſeized by his ſpeciall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary command, but countenanced, yea reſtored by him or his Agents, when ſeiſed by the Searchers and Stationers.</p>
                  <p>Let all the world then judge by this prime peece of our Evidence, what manner of Proteſtant this Archbiſhop was, and how ill he ſtood affected to the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe premiſes conſidered, no wonder if he endeavoured by all his policy and power <hi>to ſuppreſſe, nay abrogate the Priviledges, Immunities of the Dutch and French Churches in this Kingdom, granted to them by his Majeſty and his Royall Anceſtors;</hi>

On March 22. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1632. this Biſhop upon his own motion procured a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to himſelfe from the Lords of the Councell, concerning the Engliſh living in forraigne parts, and the forraigne Proteſtant Churches in <hi>England;</hi> concerning which he drew up and preſented two ſeverall Papers to the Lords found in his ſtudy, under Mr <hi>Dells</hi> hand, thus endorſed with his owne, <hi>Concerning the Dutch and French Churches in England</hi> &amp;c. here neceſſary to be inſerted, though not read at large.</p>
                  <p>VVHereas I was commanded by your Lordſhips upon Friday, March 22. 1632. Firſt to repreſent to His Gracious Majeſty the great and Honourable care you had to preſerve the unity and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it ſtands now eſtabliſhed by Law; Which care was very great and pious, and according to my duty, in the Name of the Church, I humbly thank your Lordſhips for it: And have in purſuance of your Commands faithfully acquainted His Majeſty with as many particulars as I could carry away ſafe in my memory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I was commanded by your Lordſhips to take into farther conſideration ſuch Heads as might beſt conduce to the rectifying of ſuch his Majeſties Subjects as reſide at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> or elſewhere beyond the Seas, but eſpecially in the Low-Countreys, either in Merchandize, or in uſe and exerciſe of Armes under the Colonells there. As alſo what might be thought fit to be done concerning the French and Dutch Churches, as they now ſtand, and are uſed at this preſent within this Realme; but at ſuch time as your Lordſhips in your wiſdome ſhall beſt approve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning the firſt of theſe,</hi> viz. <hi>the Engliſh living in Forraigne parts, I humbly recommend to your Lordſhips Wiſe. dome, as followeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether it be not fit (I had almoſt ſaid neceſſary) that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Colonels in the Low-Countreys ſhould entertaine no Miniſter as Preacher to their Regiments, but ſuch as ſhall conforme in all things to the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed: And be commended unto them from your Lordſhips by adviſe of the Lords Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>York</hi> for the time being.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Company of Merchants reſiding there, or in any other Forraigne Parts, ſhall admit no Miniſter as Preacher to them, but ſuch as are ſo qualified and ſo commended as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That if any Miniſter having by feigned carriage gotten to be ſo recommended, either to any of the ſeverall Colonells, or to the Deputy Governour and Body of the Merchants there, ſhall after be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable, and will not mend upon warning given him by the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell or Deputy Governour of the Merchants, ſhall within three months after ſuch warning given, and refuſed, be diſmiſſed from his ſervice, that a more orderly and peaceable man may be ſent unto them.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="399" facs="tcp:61245:205"/>
4. That every Miniſter or Preacher with any Regiment of ſouldiers that are his Majeſties borne Subjects, or with the Company of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants there or elſewhere, ſhall read Divine Service, Chriſten children, Adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, marry, inſtruct the younger or more ignorant ſort in the Catechiſme, viſit the ſick, bury the Dead, and doe all other Duties according as they are preſcribed in the Book of Common-Prayer maintained in the Chuch of <hi>England,</hi> and not otherwiſe. And that he which will not conforme himſelfe ſo to doe, ſhall not continue Preacher either to any Regiment of Engliſh, or Scottiſh, or to the Merchants.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That if any Miniſter or Preacher, being the Kings Subject, ſhall with any bitter words or writings in print or otherwiſe, defame the Government of the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed, His Majeſties Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador or Agent in thoſe parts for the time being, is to be informed of it, and upon notice given from him to the State, he or they ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending ſhall be commanded over by Privy Seale or otherwiſe, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their offence or offences here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That no Colonell of any ſeverall Regiment, or Deputy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Merchants, ſhall give way that their Miniſter or Preacher ſhall bring any other Miniſter to preach for him in time of his ſickneſſe, abſence, or other neceſſary employment, but ſuch as for whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Church and Government here, he will be anſwerable.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That if any Miniſter being a Subject of the Kings, in the Low-Countreys, or any other place beyond the Seas, ſhall in any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, as well as before the Regiments or the Merchants, preach or publiſh, or in any other way by publike Speech, Writing, or Printing, divulge any thing derogatory to the Doctrine or Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or otherwiſe prejudiciall to the Temporall State and Government, His Majeſties Agent there ſhall uſe the beſt meanes he can to diſcover him or them ſo offending, and having found them, ſhall preſently certifie the State here, that ſo they may be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Privy Seale to anſwer it. And if they then refuſe to come, that the Law in that caſe paſſe upon them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That no man ſhall be choſen or ſent over by the Merchants here, either to <hi>Delf,</hi> or any other place of their reſidence beyond the Seas, (whenſoever any ſuch place or places ſhall become voyd) but ſuch a man as is conformable to the Church of <hi>England</hi> both in Doctrine and Diſcipline, and ſuch as will be carefull to ſee that they which are under his Governments ſhall obſerve all ſuch Church Duties as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and required in any the former Articles. And that ſome of the chiefe Merchant-Adventurers here be ſent for to the Board, and be made acquainted with this Article. And farther, that at every time and times that they ſend a new Deputy Governour to any place of their Reſidence, they preſent the ſaid Deputy to the Lords, and give
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:61245:206"/>
them aſſurance of his fitneſſe and ſufficiency for that Charge. At which time the ſaid Deputy may have ſuch Directions given him by their Lordſhips as the preſent times and occaſions require. And that there be like care taken for other good Officers there, as for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Governour himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That whenſoever the Merchant-Adventurers ſhall become ſuitors to His Majeſty to renew or confirme their Patent (as in moſt Kings times it is uſuall ſo to doe) that then there be a Clauſe inſerted into their Patent, to binde them to the obſervance of all, or ſo much of theſe Inſtructions, as ſhall bee thought fit by his Majeſty and the Lords.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That the preſent Agent, as alſo all others that ſhall ſucceed in that employment, have theſe Inſtructions given them in Charge; and that once a yeare they be required to give the Board an Account what the Proceed of the buſineſſe is. That ſo His Majeſties Subjects aſwell abroad as at home, may be kept in orderly obedience to the Honour of His Majeſties Government, and the better uniting of the hearts of his People to God, His Majeſty, and one to another. In which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the ſtrength as well as the Honour of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I conceive it no way fit, that the Miniſters which are His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects in <hi>Holland,</hi> ſhould have any Claſſicall Meetings allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them (as it ſeemes they pretend ſome grant ſince the yeare 1622.) eſpecially that they be not ſuffered to aſſume power of Ordination; for then it will be a perpetuall Seminary to breed and tranſplant men ill-affected to the Government into this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved that the French and High Germane Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the Low-Countreys doe all obſerve the Liturgy of their own Mother Churches; only the Engliſh obſerve neither their owne, nor any other uniformity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning the ſecond; that is, the French and Dutch Churches, as they now ſtand in many parts of this Kingdom, I as humbly repreſent, firſt the Danger, then the probable Remedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Dangers I humbly ſubmit, but conceive as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was Honour and Piety in this State, when at the firſt way was given for thoſe Churches both in <hi>London</hi> and ſome other parts of this Kingdome; Becauſe at that time there was perſecution upon them in their owne Countreys: And the Peace with which God then bleſſed this Kingdom, was their ſafety.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I conceive it was never the meaning and purpoſe of this State then, or at any other time, that they living and continuing here, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and having wives and children, and many of them plentifull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61245:206"/>
and Lands; And their children and childrens children being now Natives, and his Majeſties borne Subjects, ſhould live like an abſolute divided Body from the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed, which muſt needs work upon their affections, and alienate them from the State, or at leaſt make them ready for any Innovation that may ſort better with their humour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is likewiſe conſiderable what an entire and divided body they keep themſelves. For few or none of them marry with any of us, but only one with another. Upon which it muſt needs follow, that as they encreaſe and multiply, they which are now a Church within a Church, will in time grow to be a kinde of another Common-wealth within this, and ſo ready for that which I hold not fit to expreſſe any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is likewiſe of great conſequence, that theſe men living with their entire Families, divided from the preſent Government of Church and Common-wealth are many, and have got their Reſidence and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in all or moſt of the Haven Townes, eſpecially ſuch as lie fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for <hi>France</hi> and the Low-Countreys. And were occaſion offered, God knowes what advantage they may take to themſelves, or make for others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Their Example is of ill conſequence (in Church affaires eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) to the Subject of <hi>England.</hi> For many are confirmed in their ſtubborne wayes of diſobedience to the Church-Government, ſeeing them ſo freely ſuffered in this great and populous City.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſt of all, I think it very juſt not to ſuffer French or Dutch Church differing from us in Diſcipline, to be otherwiſe or longer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated in any part of this Realme, then the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhall among the Subjects of this Crowne be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated in thoſe ſeverall parts beyond the Seas, whither they have cauſe to reſort and abide.</p>
                  <p>For the Remedies likewiſe I humbly ſubmit, but conceive they may be theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I think it fit their Number in all places of this Kingdome bee made knowne as fully as may be; that your Lordſhips may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judge both of them, and the way to reduce them into one Body with this Kingdome in which they are borne Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I conceive the beſt way to know their Number, is by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the State it ſelfe, and to have it avowedly taken in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they reſide; with a Certificat either preſently, or when your Lordſhips ſhall think fit, which are the men of Credit and Wealth
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:61245:207"/>
among them. And this may be done really for their good, and ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as that they may apprehend it for a benefit, as indeed it is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is fit, if they will continue as a divided Body from both State and Church, that they be uſed as Strangers, and not as Natives. That is, that they may pay all double duties as Strangers uſe to doe, and have no more Immunities then Strangers have, till they will live and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe as other Subjects do. And this matter of loſſe or gaine is as likely to work upon them, eſpecially the Merchants and richer men as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and perhaps more.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When it ſhall be thought fit actually to reduce them to live as other Subjects doe, both in relation to Church and State, the way I conceive may be to have them fairely warned in an Eccleſiaſticall way, for every man with his Houſhold (if he be not a new commer, but a borne Subject) to repaire to his Pariſh Church here, to conforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Prayers, Sacraments &amp;c. And if any receive not according to Cannon and Law, then to excommunicate him or them. And by that <note place="margin">Note</note> time the Writ <hi>de Excommunicato capiendo</hi> hath been ſerved upon ſome few, it may be the reſt will yeeld themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If this doe not prevaile, I then conceive under favour, it will be hard to remedy, unleſſe the State will publikely declare, That if they will be as Natives, and take the benefit of Subjects, they muſt conforme themſelves to the Laws of the Kingdom aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. <note place="margin">Note</note> Which Declaration, when it ſhall once be made publike, I think they will be well adviſed before they will reſiſt or refuſe it.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Papers it is apparent, That this Arch-Prelate was the Originall Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all the proceedings againſt the Dutch and French Churches. In purſuance of theſe determinations of his, in his Metropoliticall Viſitation <hi>Ann.</hi> 1634. &amp; 1635. he ſummoned all the Miniſters and Elders of theſe Churches to appeare before Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> his Vicar Generall; as appeares by an <hi>Abſtract</hi> of his Viſitation endorſed with his owne hand, unto whom he preſcribed theſe two following <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That all the Natives of the Dutch and Walloon Congregations in his Graces Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, are to repaire to their ſeverall Pariſh Churches of thoſe ſeverall Pariſhes where they inhabit, to heare Divine Service and Sermons, and performe all duties and payments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in that behalfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Miniſters and all others of the Dutch and Walloon Congregations which are not Natives and borne Subjects to the Kings Majeſty, or any other ſtrangers that ſhall come over to them, while they remaine ſtrangers, may have and uſe their owne Diſcipline as formerly they have done; yet it is thought ſit, that the Engliſh Liturgy ſhould be tranſlated into French and Dutch, for the better ſettling of their children to the Engliſh Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Injunctions were preſcribed to the Forraign Churches at <hi>Norwich, An.</hi> 1634. and to theſe at <hi>Canterbury, Maidstone,</hi> and <hi>Sandwich,</hi> 13. <hi>Aprilis</hi> 1635. as appeares by ſundry Copies of them found in the Archbiſhops ſtudy: and the like were impoſed on all other Dutch and Walloon Churches within his Province. Yet not content herewith, he cauſed the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> to impoſe harder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

on the Forraigne Congregations within his Province; as appeares by two Letters found in his ſtudy under the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorks</hi> owne hand, the one dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 1. 1636. the other 22 <hi>Ian.</hi> 1637. Wherein <hi>he denyes them the exerciſe of any Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction of their owne, injoynes them the uſe of the Engliſh Liturgie in the French Tongue, with obedience to all the Lawes and Ordinances of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to receive the Sacrament once a yeare in the Pariſh Church wherein they dwell, and to performe all their Chriſtnings, Marriages, and Burials there; elſe no Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their owne would be permitted.</hi> Hereupon theſe Forraigners conceiving theſe Injunctions prejudiciall to their Ancient Rights, Liberties indulged them, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to their Churches, oppoſed them all they could in an humble way.</p>
                  <p>Upon the publication of theſe Injunctions, the Dutch and Walloon Churches at <hi>Norwich</hi> preſented this enſuing Remonſtrance to the Biſhop there, who ſent it up to the Archbiſhop, who received it as appeares by the endorſement <hi>Febr.</hi> 21. 1634.</p>

                              <p>IT hath pleaſed my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to ſend forth lately two Injunctions to the three Congregations of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Canterbury, Sandwich,</hi> and <hi>Maidstone</hi> in his Graces Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, to this effect. 1. That their Engliſh Natives ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them, and reſort to the Engliſh Pariſh Churches where they dwell. 2. That the Remainder of them, being ſtrangers borne, ſhould receive and uſe the Engliſh Liturgy, tranſlated into their own language, upon the firſt day of <hi>March</hi> next. The which is generally conceived to be a leading caſe for all the Strangers Congregations that are in <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">1 Now foraſmuch as the ſaid Injunctions ſeeme to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, not only to ſundry Orders of his Majeſties moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Councell heretofore upon ſeverall occaſions granted unto ſeverall Congregations of the ſaid Strangers; but
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61245:208"/>
chiefly to all the gracious Liberties, and Priviledges granted unto them of old, and continued during the Reigne of three moſt famous Princes, King <hi>Edward,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> of glorious memory; And confirmed by his now Majeſties Regall word our gracious Soveraigne (whom God long preſerve) which he was pleaſed graciouſly to give unto the Deputies of all the ſtrangers Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at his Majeſties feet, the 30 of <hi>April</hi> 1625.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 And alſo, that the obſerving of the ſaid Injunctions will neceſſarily draw after it many great and unavoydable Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences both common and perſonall; as namely that</p>
                              <p n="1">1 The Pariſhes ſhall be needleſſely charged with a great multitude of poore Strangers that are Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 Many ſuch Natives ſhall <hi>ipſo facto</hi> loſe the benefit of their Toleration in exerciſing their Manufactures, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not ſerved their ſeven years Apprentiſhips, and be in danger of ruine or moleſtation.</p>
                              <p n="3">3 Many ſuch alſo that underſtand not well the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tongue, ſhall be little edified by the Engliſh Prayers and Sermons which they ſhall heare.</p>
                              <p n="4">4 Their Families ſhall be divided, ſome going one way, ſome another to their appointed Aſſemblies; which may miniſter an unhappy opportunity of licentiouſneſſe to ſervants and children that are looſely minded.</p>
                              <p n="5">5 The Alien ſtrangers that ſhall remaine, being not the fourth part of the now ſtanding Congregations (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this City) for want of competent ability to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their Miniſter and poore, muſt needs be utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and come to nothing.</p>
                              <p n="6">6 So the ancient and much renowned <hi>Aſyla,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of refuge for the poore perſecuted and other ignorant Chriſtians beyond the Seas, ſhall be wanting; whereat <hi>Rome</hi> will rejoyce, and the Reformed Churches in all places will mourne.</p>
                              <p n="7">7 Many Miniſters (and thoſe ancient) having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes but their Congregations, which ſhall then faile them, ſhall be to ſeek for themſelves and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Families.</p>
                              <p n="8">

8 The Forraigne poore will be added to the Native poore, and encreaſe the charge and burden of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Pariſhes, who will be to them no welcome gueſts; or elſe be ſent away beyond Sea, where they will open many mouthes againſt the authors of their miſery.</p>
                              <p n="9">9 The Common-wealth ſhall loſe many skilfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in ſundry Manufactures, whom in times paſt the Land hath ſo much deſired.</p>
                              <p n="10">10 Many thouſand Engliſh of the poorer ſort ſhall miſſe their good maſters that ſet them on work and paid them well, which will cauſe them to grieve at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, if not to murmure.</p>
                              <p n="11">11 And ſay a handfull of Aliens ſhould remaine to make up a poore Congregation, where ſhall they baptize their new-borne Infants? If in their Pariſh Churches, then ſhall the ſtrangers loſe one of their Sacraments; and if in the ſaid ſtrangers Congregation, then it would be known when they ſhall be ſent away to be admitted as Natives in their Engliſh Pariſhes.</p>
                              <p n="12">12 A greater difficulty will yet ariſe about the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Rites and Ceremonies enjoyned to ſuch Aliens as ſhall remaine. For though they miſlike them not in the Engliſh Churches, unto the which upon occaſion they do willingly reſort; yet when this Innovation ſhall come upon them, it will bee ſo uncouth and ſtrange, as it is doubtfull whether it, or the ſeparation of the Natives from the Aliens, will bring the more trouble; And whether they will not both be followed (though not <hi>aequis paſsibus)</hi> with the utter diſſolution of their Congregations.</p>
                              <p n="13">13 And the rather, becauſe it is not likely that upon their want of a Miniſter, any will be ready to come (though ſent for) from beyond the Seas to ſerve them upon theſe two Conditions. The one, to be contented with ſo meane a ſtipend as they ſhall then be able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and that uncertaine too. The other, to obſerve ſuch Rites and Ceremonies as they were never acquainted withall, yea are offenſive to ſome beyond the Seas, from whence they ſhall be called.</p>
                              <p n="3">3 Laſtly, foraſmuch as we have given no occaſion of offence
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61245:209"/>
that might deſerve the taking away of our former Liberties, but have ſtill demeaned our ſelves peaceably and reſpectively to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Engliſh Diſcipline; Neither do we harbour any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Engliſh perſons as members of our Congregations; And alſo that by two ſeverall Orders of his Majeſties moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privy Councell, your Lordſhip and your Succeſſors have power to order the diſordered in both the Congregations, if any ſhall happen.</p>
                              <p>Therefore we humbly entreat your good Lordſhip ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to take the premiſes into your grave and judicious conſideration; And as occaſion ſhall ſerve, to acquaint his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with them if your Lordſhip think it ſo fitting. Vnto whoſe Grace we deſire our humble du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be preſented; humbly beſeeching his Grace that he will be pleaſed to be graciouſly and favourably encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to us and the reſt of the ſtrangers; And (if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to ſtay the proceedings of his Graces Commiſſaries upon the ſaid three Congregations of his Graces Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; that ſo they and we all may yet continue under the ſhadow of His Majeſties moſt gracious protection and Toleration, as before. And wee ſhall pray for his Graces and your Honours long life and proſperity.</p>

                  <p>By theſe Injunctions theſe Churches were moleſted and diſquieted ſome three or foure yeares ſpace; ſome of them interdicted, ſuſpended and ſhut up for a time, for refuſing conformity; others of them diſſolved, their Miniſters deſerting them rather then ſubmitting to theſe Injunctions, all of them much diminiſhed, diſcontented, the maintenance of their Miniſters and poore Members much impaired almoſt to their utter deſolation, notwithſtanding all the great friends they could make to intercede in their behalfe; and they brought quite under that Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, from which they were formerly exempted. Hereupon many conſciencious Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and their children deſerted the Kingdom, who could not in conſcience ſubmit to the Ceremonies, Innovations in our Churches, and moſt of their Families were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably diſtracted, as appeares by <hi>a Summary Relation</hi> of the Archbiſhops procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings herein, preſented to the Parliament, and by a late printed Book, entituled, <hi>A Relation of the Troubles of the three Forraigne Churches</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> cauſed by the Injunctions of <hi>William Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Anno Dom.</hi> 1634.

                  <p>By all which premiſes compared with his forementioned judgement of the Forraign Churches, that they were no true Churches of Chriſt becauſe they had no Biſhops; their Miniſters no Miniſters, and their Religion not the ſame with ours; it is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly evident, that his deſigne was to ſuppreſſe and ſubvert the Dutch and French Churches by degrees at home, and to embroyle them and our Engliſh Congregations abroad, for the better advancement of the Roman Catholike Church and Religion both at home and in Forraign parts.

                  <hi>Now for this ſpeech, that the Preſbyterians are as bad as the Papists; there is a ſting in the ſpeech, which I wiſh had been left out; for there are many churches beyond the ſeas, which contend for the Religion establiſhed among us, which yet have approved and admitted the preſbytery; and this is to make them as bad as the papists.

               <p>Theſe Notes of Doctor <hi>Abbots</hi> Sermon were found in this Arch-biſhops Study, written with his owne hand (produced and atteſted by Maſter <hi>Prynne)</hi> incloſed in a copy of a Letter of his to the then Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> under his owne hand too, thus indorſed by him; <hi>April.</hi> 18. 1615. <hi>The copy of a Letter which I ſent to the</hi> Lord Biſhop of Lincolne <hi>concerning a Sermon, in which Doctor</hi> Abbot HAD WRON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GED ME IN THE UNIVERSITY: In which Letter he incloſed theſe Notes for his Lordſhip to peruſe, complaining thus therein, <hi>I came time enough to be at the rehearſall of this Sermon: upon much perſwaſion I went to Church, where I was faine to ſit patiently, and heare my ſelfe abuſed almoſt an hour together, yet I was poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at as I ſate; for this preſent abuſe, I would have taken no notice of it, but that</hi> THE WHOLE UNIVERSITY APPLIES IT TO ME; <hi>and my owne friends tell me, I ſhall ſink my credit, if I anſwer not Doctor</hi> Abbot <hi>in his own</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By which it is cleere, under his owne hand-writing, that Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi> and the whole Univerſity in the yeer 1615. reputed and accounted him a Papiſt; <hi>a Papiſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> at leaſtwiſe, <hi>partly Romiſh, and partly Engliſh; or a mongrell and a compound of a Papiſt and Protestant; one ready upon all occaſions to ſtep over to the Papists: A Papiſt in the Doctrine of freewill, justificaiian by works, inherent righteouſneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence no ſinne after Baptiſme, certainly of ſalvation, and the Doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and that the papiſts beyond the ſeas could ſay, he was</hi> WHOLLY THEIRS, <hi>and the Recuſants at home make their brags of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This his temper was the cauſe of Doctor <hi>Hals</hi> Letter to W. L. <hi>(William Laud</hi> as is generally conceived) long ſince printed, Anno 1608. in the third Decad of his Epiſtles; Epiſt. 5. page 55. (for which his works were lately threatned to be called in, or this Leter expunged out of them) wherein he thus expoſtulates with him for his unſetledneſſe and newtrality in Religion, and inclining to the popiſh party: <hi>I would I knew where to find you, then I could tell how to take a direct ayme, whereas now I muſt rove and conjecture; to day</hi> YOU ARE IN THE TENTS OF THE ROMANISTS; <hi>to morrow in ours; the next day betweene both,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude this part of our Evidence with the depoſition of <hi>Francis Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> a converted Prieſt, examined upon oath before the Lords, who being in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Army, could not poſſibly be procured <hi>viva voce</hi> (of which oath was made) and thereupon his depoſition was read as followeth.</p>

               <p>The Arch-biſhop ſome fevv dayes before his tryall, <hi>petitioned the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that Sir</hi> Henry Mildmay <hi>of the Jewell Houſe (one of their Members) might be examined in his behalfe, as a ſpeciall witneſſe for him, how much he was hated and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt above all men at</hi> Rome, <hi>for oppoſing the Popes and Papiſts deſignes in</hi> England.

                              <hi rend="margQuotes">
                                 <hi>that they had many great</hi> parſons in England <hi>who were ſecretly of their religion, and in particular, the Arch-biſhop, whom they avowed to be wholly theirs,</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, that eleven or twelve yeers ſince I being at <hi>Bruxels</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and there diſcourſing with an Engliſh Gentleman, who had been an ancient traveller, touching the then late rooting out of ſundry Engliſh able and orthodox Miniſters, for not complying with the Biſhops in divers new idolatrous ceremonies; this Gentleman aſſured me, that he had often heard of ſtrange reports of matters likely to befall Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, both from Engliſh and Iriſh papiſts, which he gave no heed unto, ſuppoſing them to ſpeake rather as they would have it, then as it was in verity: But now that he had heard ſo much from me, he did much ſuſpect that there was ſome plot in hand <hi rend="margQuotes">to change the Religion in Eng. wherof he would diligently enquire, aſſuring me that he had as good means to know it, as any man of our Nation that lived on that ſide of the Seas.

                              <hi>would ſlide into it unawares: that nothing but the King of</hi> Sweden's <hi>prosperity did hinder the ſudden effecting of it. Lastly, that if we reſisted not, we ſhould be cheated and cozened of our Religion; and if we reſisted, we ſhould be compelled thereto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I replied, that I thought the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> were not of any conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to effect their ends by force, and that they were alſo diſ-armed. He told me the <hi>Papiſts were more in number, and better armed then I conceived them to be; many going now to Church, who would then declare themſelves papiſts; beſides a world of Newters, who for hopes of preferment, would be eaſily drawne to their party: that they vvere all united, and beſides armed with authority:</hi> He affirming, that <hi>for many yeers vve had vvholly been governed by Papiſts; moſt men in higheſt authority being either vvholly ſo, or at leaſt, as ſerviceable unto them for private ends, as if they vvere ſo indeed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I replied, that if we ſhould be compelled to defend our Religion by force, their authority would not be regarded.

He told me, <hi>they ſhould have a better back, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement then the King of</hi> Spaine <hi>could give them, and that both</hi> France and Spain <hi>ſhould aſſiſt therein.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I replied, that I thought <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> were likely to diſagree, and therefore unfit for ſuch a buſineſſe. He told me, that <hi>ſince J vvould needs have it, the greateſt introducers of popery ſhould be the Proteſtants themſelves: Whereat vvhen J vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as ſeeming to me a paradox; he told me, that the vvar ſhould be ſo diſguiſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

                              <hi>told me, that he did not deſpaire of ſeeing</hi> England <hi>to be very ſuddenly Catholike: And though be were, by reaſon of his Order, tyed more ſtrictly to the Pope then others were, yet he was carefull to have both Kings and Kingdomes priviledges preſerved, and more particularly, that the Benefices in</hi> England <hi>might not be beſtowed upon Italians as formerly, but that the Arch-biſhop ſhould have the ordering thereof.</hi> All this I have oft related ſome yeers ſince, to divers perſons of quality, for which I incurred ſome trouble by the Jeſuits and this Arch-biſhops meanes.</p>

               <p>This Teſtimony is ſo home and punctuall, that we ſhall adde no more thereto: it informs us of a long ſince plotted and actuated confederacy between this Archbiſhop and other Engliſh Prelats, and the Popes Inſtruments at <hi>Rome</hi> and in other forraigne parts, to introduce popery, and reduce us back to <hi>Rome:</hi> It chalks out to us the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and method of their proceedings in all particulars and the politick contrivances of all ſorts to effect their intended deſigne; all which we have by wofull experience ſeen punctually acted, purſued accordingly to this very moment in which purſuit this Archbiſhop hath been the Archinſtrument; ſince then we viſibly behold theſe reports of theirs verefied to the view of all the world; we muſt no longer look upon them is empty rumours or diſcourſes, but as reall Evidences beyond all exceptions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Plot was firſt laid about the yeer 1617. when the Spaniſh Match was ſet <note place="margin">See A neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Arch-biſhops Triall, p. 1. to 50.</note> on foot, and King <hi>Charles</hi> (then Prince of <hi>Wales)</hi> fent into <hi>Spaine,</hi> of purpoſe <hi>to reconcile him (and in him our Kingdomes) to the Church of Rome, the prime end the Pope and Catholikes intended in that Match and Treaty;</hi> as appeares by the ſeverall Articles paſſages and proceedings in it, well knowne to this Prelate, by the <hi>Popes Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Prince,</hi> whiles in Spaine, to <hi>reconcile him to Rome, and make him a dutifull Sonne of that Church,</hi> by the <hi>Popes Letter to his Nuncio,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Conchen</hi> (when the Prince was in Spaine) <hi>to endeavour his converſion to their Church upon this occaſion; by a Jeſuits Oration,</hi> to induce his Highneſſe to that Religion, and by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> Articles of impeachment againſt him in Parliament, <hi>charging one another recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with high treaſon, for endeavouring to withdraw the Prince (when in Spaine) from his Religion, and make him a Roman Catholike;</hi> of all which we find Authentick Copies endorſed with his owne and <hi>Windebanke</hi> (his creatures) hands, among both their ſeized papers (already publiſhed at large in print, where you may peruſe them at leizure) and therefore he could not poſſibly be ignorant of this Plot: The rather becauſe the ſending of the King (when Prince) into <hi>Spaine,</hi> was the <hi>Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham's</hi> project, of purpoſe to ſeduce him in his Religion, for which there were <note n="a" place="margin">Ibidem p. 31, 32, 33.</note>

               <p>That this Prelat was privy to the plot of ſending the Prince thither, before he was ſent, and to the Inſtructions given him here how to demean himſelf even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Pope and his inſtruments when he came thither, is moſt apparent by his owne Letter under his owne hand, ſent to Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> Jan. 14. 1639. wherein there is this notable paſſage, <note n="b" place="margin">Here p. 264.</note> formerly urged upon another occaſion.</p>

                  <hi>thanks for a buſineſſe with which ſhee truſted me; her promiſe then that ſhe would be my friend, and that I ſhould have immediate addreſſe to her when I had occaſion.</hi> Here we have the Queen truſting the Arch-biſhop with a private buſineſſe; her thanks for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this truſt, with a promiſe of future favour, and immediate addreſſe to her upon all occaſions: May 18. &amp; 24. 1635. <hi>Whitſon Munday at Greenwich, my account to the Queen put off till Trinity Sunday, then given her by my ſelfe, and aſſurance of all that was deſired by me, &amp;c.</hi> A very ſuſpitious paſſage: after which, five whole <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> lines are ſo raſed that they are not legible: April 3. 1639. <hi>Wedneſday, before the Kings going, I ſetled with him a great buſineſſe for the Queen, which I under ſtood ſhee would never move for her ſelfe: the Queen gave me great thanks, and this, day I waited purpoſely on her, to give her thanks for her gracious acceptance; ſhee was pleaſed to be very free with me, and to promiſe me freedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This intimacy of the Arch-biſhop with the Queene, theſe private ſervices he did for her, and theſe ſpeciall mementoes of her favours to, and freeneſſe with him, could not be to convert her to the Proteſtant Religion (which he never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in any meaſure, for ought we ever heard) it being contrary to the tenth <hi>Article of her Marriage,</hi> which runs thus; <hi>Alſo the King of Great Britaine is by Oath bound</hi> NOT TO ENDEAVOUR BY ANY MEANS AT ALL <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>to have his ſaid Queen to renounce the Catholike, Apoſtolike and Romiſh Religion, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell her to do any thing whatſoever that is contrary to the ſame Religion.</hi> Now this Archbi. was ſo farre from endeavouring her converſion to our Religion himſelfe, that in his owne <hi>Metropoliticall viſitation,</hi> he prohibited Miniſters publikely to pray for the Queens converſion in their Pulpits, and queſtioned, cenſured ſome Miniſters in the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> for praying for her converſion from Popery to our Religion, as a grand unpardonable offence.

               <p>Hereupon Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> in purſuance of this Order, in his open viſitation <hi>prohibited the Miniſters to pray for the Queenes converſion:</hi> for proofe whereof, Maſter <hi>Hugh Ratcliffe</hi> of <hi>Martins Ludgate,</hi> teſtified upon oath, <hi>That at a viſitation held at Bow Church in</hi> London <hi>by Sir</hi> Nathaniel Brent, <hi>Vicar generall to this Arch-biſhop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, <hi>in whoſe right he then viſited,</hi> about Mar. 1636. <hi>the ſaid Sir</hi> Nath. <hi>then and there in his publike charge to the Miniſters, in his bearing uſed theſe words; Whereas divers of you in your Prayers before your Sermons,</hi> Uſe TO PRAY FOR THE <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> QUEENS CONVERSION, YOU ARE TO DOE SO NO MORE. Adding, <hi>that the Queen did not doubt of her converſion;</hi> meaning, that ſhee
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:61245:215"/>
doubted not but that ſhee was already in the right way: We could produce other witneſſes of this, but the thing is ſo notorious, we ſhall need no more.</p>
               <p>From this inhibition of his, we may certainly inferre theſe concluſions: Firſt, that he who thus publikely inhibited other Miniſters to pray for the Queens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, would never queſteonleſſe himſelfe endeavour by prayer, conference, or intimacy with her, to convert her to our Religion: Secondly, that he muſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve her popiſh Religion to be the true Religion, and ours the falſe; elſe both himſelfe and all other our Miniſters were bound, in duty, conſcience, moſt realouſly and conſtantly to pray in ſpeciall manner to God, <hi>for her Highneſſe converſion from it,</hi> becauſe Gods Word and chriſtian charity required it; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger that might and doth acrew thereby to her owne ſoule in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to his Majeſty, his royall Iſſue, and this whole Church, State in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, exacts it; and the publike Liturgy of our Church (which this Prelate ſo much ſtickled for) both warrants and preſcribes it; not onely in the <hi>ſpeciall Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects for the King and Queen, the Letany, the Prayer for the eſtate of the whole Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,</hi> but likewiſe in the Collect for Good-friday, which runs thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercifull God, who haſt made all men, and hateſt nothing that thou haſt made, nor wouldeſt the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould be converted &amp; live, have mercy upon all Jewes, Turkes, Inſidels and Heretycks, and take from them all ignorance, hardneſſe of heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thy Word, and ſo fetch them home (bleſſed Lord) to thy ſtocke, that they may be ſaved among the remnant of the true Iſraelites, and be made one fold under one Shepheard, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> May, yea muſt we then pray for all <hi>Jewes, Turkes, Hereticks in generall,</hi> that God would really convert and bring them to his fold, though we have no ſpeciall relation to them; and muſt our Miniſters yet be expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to pray for the <hi>Queens converſion</hi> in particular, to whom we have ſo neere relation; the want of whoſe converſion hath brought ſo many miſchiefs, wars on our Church and Kingdomes? Certainly this was an Act of the greateſt impiety that ever was committed by any chriſtian Prelat, if he really beleeved the Queen to live in a falſe Religion; and may juſtly brand him for an Atheiſt, being dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrally contrary to Gods precept, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions and giving of thanks be made FOR ALL MEN, for Kings and ALL THAT ARE IN A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THORITY, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty:</hi> Therefore he muſt needs beleeve her popiſh Religion to be the true, ours the falſe; elſe he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged rather then prohibited Miniſters to pray for her converſion unto us and our Religion, whom it ſeems by this inhibition, he would have converted to her and hers. Thirdly, this inhibition manifeſts, at the leaſt, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop was a very cordiall friend, ſervant, not onely to her Majeſties perſon but her popiſh Religion too, that he deſired her un-interrupted continuance in it, without the leaſt oppoſition, not onely by way of diſpute, but prayers too: Fourthly, this publike prohibition in his own Metropoliticall viſitation, was of it ſelf a great encouragement to, a ſtrong confirmation of her Majeſty and all the popiſh party in their falſe Religion, giving them great advantages to ſeduce others to it, as the true, becauſe this Injunction intimated it to be the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherein they might ſafely perſevere.</p>
               <p>But did this Prelate ſtop here only, openly to inhibit men thus to pray for her Majeſties converſion? No verily; for both before and after this, he impriſoned, queſtioned and cenſured ſome in the High Commiſſion, for ſuch prayers. Maſter <hi>Bernard</hi> (as we proved formerly) was queſtioned, cenſured in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as a grand offender for ſuch a Prayer; Maſter <hi>Hugh Peter</hi> was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Purſevant, impriſoned for a time in the New-priſon, ſilenced here from his Miniſtry, and forced into <hi>Holland</hi> by the Arch-biſhop, onely <hi>for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Sepulchers</hi> Church <hi>for the Queen,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>That as ſhee came into a</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen <hi>of ſafety, ſo the light of</hi> Goſhen <hi>might ſhine into her ſoule, that ſhee might not periſh in the day of Chriſt;</hi> as himſelfe and ſundry others will depoſe: But we ſhall inſiſt

               <p>Nor did he onely perſecute and trouble Miniſters thus for praying for the <hi>Queens illumination and converſion to Gods true worſhip;</hi> but likewiſe for praying to God to keep the Prince from the infection of popery; witneſſe the caſe of one Maſter <hi>John How,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Loughborough</hi> in the County of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who on the <note place="margin">

(as was proved by the <hi>Regiſter book of the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion Court,</hi> there produced and read) <hi>was cenſured in that Court</hi> (where the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop was chiefe Judge and <hi>Dominus fac totum) attached, committed during his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties pleaſure, ſuſpended from the execution of his Miniſtry, and every part thereof, fined five hundred pounds to the Kings uſe, ordered to make a ſubmiſsion to the Court, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in expences and coſts of ſuit,</hi> onely for praying but once in the Pulpit, <hi>That the young Prince might not be brought up in Popery, whereof there was great cauſe to feare;</hi> for that (as was alleaged) <hi>theſe words did much derogate from his Majeſties known, approved, Religious care in maintaining, propagating the true Religion here eſtabliſhed, profeſſed within this Realme, and cauſed a cauſeleſſe jealouſie of the education of the young Prince his Sonne in the popiſh Religion.</hi> When as he onely intended it of the danger of his education in reſpect of the Queen his Mother, and thoſe many ſeducing Prieſts, Papiſts then about her, who by many policies, devices, endeavoured, as much in them lay, to draw him to, and educate him in the popiſh Religion: it being provided by the ſixteenth Article of the Kings marriage with <hi>France; That the children which ſhall by reaſon of the ſaid marriage be borne and live, ſhall be nurſt and brought up</hi> NEER THE SAID LADY AND QUEEN, <hi>from the time of their birth, untill they come to the age</hi> OF FOURTEEN YEERS. In reſpect whereof there <hi>was great cauſe to feare</hi> the Princes infection by, and ſeducement unto Popery, without Gods extraordinary mercy; and therefore great need of our frequent prayers to prevent it.</p>
               <p>His rigorous proceedings therefore againſt theſe Miniſters on the one hand, <hi>for praying for the Queens illumination with, and converſion to our Religion;</hi> and his ſevere cenſuring them on the other hand, for praying, <hi>That the young Prince might not be brought up in Popery,</hi> compared with his intimacy, favour with the Queen, his redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſerve her Majeſty upon all ſpeciall ſervices and commands, are a moſt pregnant evidence, not onely of his conuſance of, but powerfull concurring aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in promoting this grand dangerous deſigne, of introducing Popery, and reconciling us to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>From theſe few generall, we ſhall next deſcend to ſome more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to prove, that there was a ſerious deſigne and endeavour of the Pope and his Inſtruments in forraigne parts, to reduce us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had exact notice of it, and yet was ſo far from reſiſting, oppoſing this their deſigne, according to his place, truſt, duty, that he complied with them to the utmoſt of his wit and power therein. It cannot be expected, that in a Plot of this nature, being a hidden work of darkneſſe, and abſtruce myſtery of iniquity carried on with all the artifice and cunning that <hi>Rome</hi> or Hell could ſuggeſt; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, concealed under divers charactariſticall Letters, which we cannot as yet unriddle, though we have ſome of them in our cuſtody; ſealed up under oaths, promiſes of ſecreſie, and acted by ſuch Jeſuiticall ſpirits, as will rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately die, then diſcloſe the ſecrets of their helliſh conſpiracies; which we cannot poſſibly manifeſt to the full, unleſſe we had been ſo happy as to have ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Arch-biſhops moſt ſecret papers (which he conveyed away or burned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his cloſet, dores were ſealed up) and the Popes Nuncioes Cabinet, or might have liberty to ſearch the Popes own Cloſet, or Cardi. <hi>Barbarino</hi> his ſecret papers and the private intelligences of the Roman Conclave; yet we preſume we ſhall produce ſo many cleer demonſtrations, and circumſtantial proofs, as ſhall abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfie your Lordſhips judgements, conſciences, and the world, both of the reality of this plot, and the Arch-biſhops guiltineſle in concurring in it: We know it is uſuall for Juries to convict, for Judges to condemne and execute Traitors, felons as well upon violent preſumptions &amp; circumſtances, as upon eye witneſſes and punctuall teſtimonies of the facts for which they are indicted: and we doubt not but our evidence in this kind will be ſo cleer, as it will ſurmount a violent preſumption, yea amount to an infallible demonſtration, conviction of his guiltineſſe, if not ſeverally conſidered, yet at leaſt conjoyned.</p>
               <p>The firſt particular Evidence to prove a deſigne at <hi>Rome,</hi> to reduce us to our ancient vaſſalage under it, is a very notable paper printed at <hi>Rome, Superiorum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſu</hi> (in two large folio ſheets paſted together) <hi>An.</hi> 1636.

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:61245:217"/>
his owne royall hand to it in the margin, ſent from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Lambeth:</hi> Yet for all this, he was ſo far from croſſing this their Jeſuiticall deſigne, that he <hi>confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joyned with the Jeſuits</hi> and popiſh party in fomenting, maintaining the war <note place="margin">

               <p>The third particular we ſhall produce, to prove an endeavour of the Pope and <hi>Cardinall Barbarino</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to reconcile, reduce us back to them, and that this Arch-biſhop had notice of it, is a Letter (found in his Study, atteſted by Maſter <hi>Prynne)</hi> written to him by one Maſter <hi>John Greaves,</hi> from <hi>Ligonne,</hi> March 3. 1639. indorſed with his owne hand thus, <hi>Rece. Mar.</hi> 27. 1640. <hi>Faſtidius printed at Rome:</hi> Wherein Maſter <hi>Greaves</hi> hath this clauſe: <hi>I humbly beſeech your Grace to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my preſumptions, and this other Information which I ſhall give your Grace: They have printed at Rome a Book of</hi> Faſtidius, <hi>a Britaine Biſhop,</hi> De Vitâ Chriſtianâ, WHICH THE CARDINALL FRANCISCO BARBARINO INTENDS <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> TO DEDICATE TO HIS SACRED MAJESTY; <hi>a Book of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulan devotion and piety, and of great Antiquity; the Author being a Biſhop in</hi> England, <hi>about three hundred yeers after our Saviour.</hi> Lucas Holſtenius, <hi>a very learned man, hath the care oft the Edition, but hath not I thinke, as yet finiſhed the Annotations upon it: For the Text, he and I compared the Manuſcript</hi> (which was alſo very ancient) <hi>with the printed Copy, and I find it exactly to agree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what other meaning could there be for this Cardinall to print this book at <hi>Rome,</hi> to dedicate it publikely to our King, and to uſe Maſter <hi>Greaves</hi> himſelfe in comparing the printed Copy with the Manuſcript, but to inſinuate himſelf into the Kings affections, thereby to reduce both him and his Dominions unto the boſome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the forementioned diſcovery of this and the Jeſuits Plot, by <hi>Andreas ab Habernfield,</hi> more largely demonſtrates? this Cardinall ſending over <hi>ſundry Statues, Pictures, Antiquities, and other vanities from Rome to his Majeſty, to incline him to the Roman party,</hi> as we have <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>From all theſe remarkable paſſages of this book, it is moſt evident, that it was purpoſely penned, publiſhed, dedicated and preſented to the King, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him, and reunite our Church and Articles to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that this union and accommodation was already accompliſhed by Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Muntague,</hi> and others of our moſt eminent moderate Divines, in many points of greateſt moment, and would ſoon be effected in the reſidue, by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Aſſembly or Synod of our Prelates and divines, if no Puritans were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed among them.</p>
               <p>But you will object; What is all this, or this Book to the Archbiſhop? Did he know any thing of this Plot, Book, or had any hand therein?

                  <hi>MY Intelligence with the Pope by</hi> S. Clara. <hi>I never ſaw that Franciſcan Fryar in my life, to the utmoſt of my memory, above four times, or five at moſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was firſt brought to me by Doctor</hi> Linſey, <hi>it was when he was ſetting out his booke about the Articles of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and I then told Doctor</hi> Linſey, <hi>I did feare he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>would never expound them, ſo as the Church of</hi> England <hi>might have cauſe to thanke him for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He never came to me after, till he was almoſt ready to print another booke, to prove, that Epiſcopacy was authorized in the Church by divine right; and theſe was after this vnhappy ſtirres began: His deſire was, to have this book printed here; but at his ſeverall addreſſes to me for this, I ſtill gave him this anſwer: That I did not like the way which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>went concerning Epiſcopacy: And howſoever, I would never give way that any ſuch book from the pen of any Romaniſt, ſhould be printed here: And the Biſhops of</hi> England <hi>are very well able to defend their owne cauſe and calling, without calling in any ayd from</hi> Rome, <hi>and would ſo doe when they ſaw cauſe; And this is all the conference that ever I had with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This excuſe of his (though partiall) acknowledgeth, that he was acquainted with the book and Author before its printing, and that Doctor <hi>Linſey</hi> his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, was a great promoter of it, privy to the plot of Reconciliation, and very intimate with the Fryar that compiled it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the book was printed, this Author preſented not onely the King, but Archbiſhop himſelf with one of them, bound up in Vellam, with the Kings Armes on the cover, and blew ſilk ſtrings, which he thus endorſed with his owne hand, <hi>Fron. â Sanctâ Clara, Problemata</hi> 37. <hi>Expoſitio paraphraſtica Confeſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Anglicanae:</hi> Which book he reſerved in his Study at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> ſeized, and produced it at the Barre.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he not onely received, but permitted it to be publikely ſold and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed amongſt us, without any ſeizure or reſtaint, and to be twice or thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding many exceptions and complaints againſt it, when as he moſt ſtrictly ſuppreſſed orthodox books.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if Fryar Saint <hi>Giles</hi> were the true Author of this book (as he was reputed by the Fryars in forraigne parts) the Archbiſhop not onely knew, but maintained him in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> (to ſeduce, poyſon the Schollers there, and reconcile them to <hi>Rome)</hi> and gave him an annuall penſion of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Markes; the blame of which action for his owne excuſe, he would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre upon the King (without any proofe at all, but onely this ſurreptitious warrant, without any date at all, writ with his owne hand, not by any Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State) which will no wayes extenuate, but aggravate his crime, the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant being no doubt fraudulently procured, to ſerve a turne at a dead lift, ſince his troubles.</p>

               </p>
               <p>What the ſervice was that this Fryar had done for the King and State, for which he loſt his hopes in <hi>France,</hi> we could never learne, unleſſe it were the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and publiſhing of this book, which ſome Jeſuits and their faction onely, diſliked. What it was that this Archbiſhop did for him (upon this warrant,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61245:220"/>
as he pretends) is thus expreſſed, in a paper written with his own hand, by way of excuſe, ſeized by Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> in the Tower, and by him produced at the Lords Barre, where it was read as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAſter Saint</hi> Giles <hi>was a man well reputed of in</hi> France, <hi>and placed about the Queens Majeſty, at her Majeſties firſt comming hither: After upon ſome ſervices (and thoſe in a very faire way) done to this State, he loſt ground in</hi> France, <hi>and when ſome other French men were ſent away from the Queens ſervice, he durſt not goe thither, but choſe to live here in a very low condition for ſafeties ſake, rather then adventure thither. All this while the man was unknowne to me, but comming one day to wait upon his Majeſty at Saint</hi> Jamſes, <hi>his Majeſty was pleaſed to ask me,</hi> Whether I knew Maſter Saint Giles? <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> I did not: <hi>Hereupon his Majeſty tooke occaſion to tell me the condition of the man, and his wants, and withall, told me which way he conceived ſome reliefe might be given to his neceſsities; and preſcribed me a way how to order it, that he might receive for his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">NOTE:</note> 
                  <hi>a hundred Marks a yeere. This in obedience to his Majeſty, I did: (and I have his Majeſties Warrant for it) But I never allowed or gave him one penny of my owne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not long after this, partly that the poore man, being a ſtranger, might live the cheaper, and partly that he might have the uſe of the publike Library, reſolving (as he pretended) to follow metaphisicall learning, and not engage himſelfe in the controversies of the times; His Majeſty moved me againe, that he might live in</hi> Oxford, <hi>and in ſome Colledge or Hall there. In this I humbly beſought his Majeſty to pardon me, becauſe it would be dangerous to the youth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>bred in that Colledge, and ſcandalous to his Majeſty, this Church, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversity, and bring danger upon my ſelfe, being Chancellour there: After much importunity uſed by me, his Majeſty was gnaciously pleaſed to be ſatisfied, that he ſhould not be admitted to live in any Colledge or Hall among the Students, but required me not to hinder his going to</hi> Oxford, <hi>and the making uſe of the Library, provided, that he kept no company with any young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; that he lived privately in ſome Towne-houſe; and that he did not preſume to exerciſe his Prieſtly function, or doe any thing againſt the lawes: This he undertook to performe, and I could never find (by any the ſpies which I put upon him) that he brake this in any particular, but lived there without offence given to any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all times of his recourſe to me for his pension, I never ſpent one houre with him, nor had I ever any diſcourſe with him at all, but once onely, and that was about a dangerous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Pompanatius,: <hi>At that time he told me, he had a desire to labour in that Argument, and to confute him: I told him, I could not approve any medling with that queſtion in theſe times, for that I thought few would be able to underſtand the ſubtilty of that diſpute, and that the ſtirring of it in theſe times would doe a great deale of miſchiefe; and this is all that ever paſt between him and me all my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Saint <hi>Giles</hi> by this Prelats meanes, continued in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſundry yeers, and had the uſe of the Libraries there, where he did much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; Maſter <hi>Broad</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> depoſed, <hi>that Saint</hi> Giles <hi>continued in</hi> Oxford <hi>foure yeers or more, that he was a very dangerous insinuating perſon, that Doctor</hi> Turner, <hi>Doctor</hi> Johnſon, <hi>and others of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversity, uſually reſorted to him, and familiarly converſed with him, though he were there knowne to be a popiſh Prieſt; that when Maſter</hi> Prynne, <hi>Maſter</hi> Burton, <hi>and Doctor</hi> Baſtwick <hi>ſuffered at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>on the Pillory, this Saint</hi> Giles <hi>ſpeaking of their ſufferings, told this Deponent (in whoſe Kinſwomans houſe he lay) that though the Archbiſhop and other Biſhops WERE CORDIALL FOR THE</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>ROMISH RELIGION, yet he doubted their cruelty would rather hurt then further their cauſe, becauſe it loſt them much in the affections of the people.</hi> Now what a capitall offence it was for this Archprelat to harbour ſuch a dangerous ſeducing Prieſt, (reputed one of the greateſt Schollers among the Papiſts) in this famous Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſeduce the Students there (and as the Queens Apothecary, a great Papiſt, reported, of purpoſe to inſtruct the Doctors there, as Maſter <hi>Godfrey,</hi> a quondam converted popiſh Prieſt averred) and to lay the blame of it thus wholly on his Majeſty to excuſe himſelfe, we humbly ſubmit to your Lordſhips conſideration.</p>

               <p>The fifth Evidence we ſhall pitch upon, to prove a deſigne to reconcile and reduce us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> is the Popes and his Agents promiſes, tenders of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Caps and Places to ſome prime Engliſh men, and to this Archbiſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in particular; the end whereof could be no other, but to enthrall us againe to the ſuperſtitious juriſdiction of the Papall See.</p>
               <p>The firſt proffer we find of a Cardinals Cap made to any Engliſh Prelat ſince the Reformation, was to this Archbiſhop, who thus records the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof with his owne hand in his Diary.</p>
               <p>Aug. 4. 1633. <hi>Sunday, news came to Court of the Lord Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterburies <hi>death, and the King</hi> RESOLVED PRESENTLY <hi>to give it me, which he did.</hi> Aug. 6. <hi>That very morning at</hi> Greenwich, <hi>there came one to me ſeriouſly, and</hi> THAT AVOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> ABILITY TO PERFORME IT, AND OFFERED ME TO BE A CARDINALL. <hi>I went preſently to the King and acquainted him both with the thing and perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very conſiderable that Maſter <hi>Anthony Mildmay</hi> depoſed, that <hi>Con</hi> the Popes Nuncio, <hi>told him at Rome before Archbiſhop Abbots death, that Biſhop</hi> Laud <hi>ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, and that he would be more favourable to the Catholikes then</hi> Abbot. By which it appeares, that Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was long before <hi>Abbots</hi> death deſigned to the place, if not at the ſolicitation, yet at leaſt by the approbation of the Roman party: No ſooner comes newes to Court of Archbiſhop <hi>Abbots</hi> death, <hi>but the King preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, that Biſhop</hi> Laud <hi>ſhould ſucceed him;</hi> and no ſooner is this known at Court, <hi>but that very morning</hi> (as himſelfe records) <hi>he is thus ſeriouſly offered to be a Cardinall, by one who avowed ability to performe it;</hi> and that at <hi>Greenwich</hi> in the Kings own Court. Who it was that made this offer, were worth the diſcovery, but this myſtery he couceales; The Plot againſt the King, diſcovered to him by <hi>Habernfield,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>That</hi> Con <hi>the Popes Nuncio had a command to offer</hi> A CARDINALS CAP TO THE ARCHBISHOP, <hi>in the name of the Pope of Rome, and that he ſhould allure him alſo, with greater promiſes;</hi> but this firſt offer was before <hi>Con's</hi> arrivall here.

               <p>Aug. 17. 1633. <hi>Saturday, I had</hi> A SERIOUS OFFER MADE ME AGAIN <note place="margin">NOTE:</note> TO BE A CARDINALL: <hi>I was then from Court, but ſo ſoon as I came thither, (which was Auguſt</hi> 21) <hi>I acquainted his Majeſty with it: But my anſwer againe was, that ſomewhat dwelt within me, which would not ſuffer that, till Rome were other then it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What it was that dwelt within him (which made him not abſolutely, but for the preſent only, to refuſe this offer till <hi>Rome</hi> was other then it is) we may learn from Sir <hi>Hen.

               <p>This double, ſerious proffer of a Romiſh Cardinalſhip to the Archbiſhop, is an infallible Argument; Firſt, that the Pope and his Conclave at <hi>Rome,</hi> had an extraordinary good opinion of his favour, his good affection to Popery and their Antichriſtian Church, elſe they would not have profered him ſuch a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, incompatible to any Proteſtant Engliſh Prelat: Secondly, that they deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the apteſt, activeſt Inſtrument to reconcile and re-unite us to <hi>Rome</hi> of all other, in reſpect of his favour at Court, power with the King, and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Popery (as Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> Maſter <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> Maſter <hi>Challoner</hi> have atteſted;) therefore they would honour him with a <hi>Cardinals Hat,</hi> to the end, that as his Predeceſſor Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (the laſt Engliſh Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of any of our Prelats) reconciled our revolted Kingdom to <hi>Rome</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, as appeareth at large by the Statute of 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Phil. &amp; Mary, ch.</hi> 8.

               <p>As this Archbiſhop, ſo Maſter <hi>Walter Mountague,</hi> not long after, had good hopes given him at <hi>Rome</hi> to be made a Cardinal, as the Archbiſhop himſelf was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Mr. <hi>Middleton's</hi> forecited Letter; which dignity he ſhould have lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thence, had he not been impriſoned (if Sir <note n="c" place="margin">

All which particulars are a moſt cleere demonſtration of the Pope and his Conclaves endeavours to reduce us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> and of this Archbiſhops privity to, if not aſſiſtance in it.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Evidence we ſhall mention to prove the Archbiſhops, not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of, but compliance with the Popes and his Inſtruments Plots and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to uſher in Popery, and reduce our Kingdomes to the Antichriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is his conuſance and furtherance of this their deſign in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which we ſhall thus demonſtrate. <hi>The Houſe of Commons</hi> June 11. 1628. preſented a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> to the King, concerning the extraordinary encreaſe and growth of Popery, of Papiſts both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the extraordinary favour which they found from ſome great perſons in his Court; wherein they had this notable clauſe concerning <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IT doth not a little alſo encreaſe our dangers and feares this way, to understand the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of your Kingdome of</hi> Ireland, <hi>where without controle the Popiſh Religion is openly profeſſed and practiſed in every part thereof, Popiſh juriſdiction being generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed</hi>

                  <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>doe) to lay the ſerious conſideration thereof to your Royall, pious heart,</hi> AND THAT SOME TIMELY COURSE MAY BE TAKEN FOR REDRESSE HEREIN.</p>
               <p>Had this pious, prudent, timely advice been then harkned to, and followed to purpoſe, it might no doubt (through Gods concurrence with it) have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that horrid Rebellion, thoſe bloody <hi>Maſſacres</hi> of ſome hundred thouſands of poor <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> in, and devaſtation of that diſtreſſed Kingdom, which have broken forth and been perpetrated there of late, almoſt to the utter extirpation of the Engliſh and Iriſh Proteſtants, the ruine of that Kingdome, and infinite loſſe, yea eminent danger of this our Realme to boot.</p>
               <p>But this Popiſh Prelate, though he then certainly knew this Remonſtrance to be moſt true, out of an inveterate hatred to the Parliament, and a deſire to promote the Catholikes deſignes there, inſtead of perſwading his Majeſty to hearken to this true information and wholeſome advice of his faithfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, drew up a moſt pernitious malepert Anſwer, with his owne hand, in his Majeſties name, againſt this Remonſtrance, which he preſented to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; wherein he incenſed him againſt the Commons, charging them not onely with miſinforming, but traducing his Majeſties government by this clauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> in this diſhonourable language, produced and read under his owne hand out of the Originall draught, atteſted by Maſter <hi>Prynne.</hi>

Which in plaine tearmes is but a giving the Houſe of Commons the <hi>Lye,</hi> and a ſlandering of them as falſe Informers, both to the King and people: By which wicked practice, their Remonſtrance was rejected as a ſlanderous Libell, and their Councell not purſued; the dolefull effects whereof, we now experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally feele and rue.

               <p>From which Proteſtation, we may obſerve theſe conſiderable particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> had their owne popiſh Archbiſhops, Biſhops and a Vicar Apoſtolicall reſiding then amongſt them, as the title and body of this Proteſtation manifeſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:61245:227"/>
Secondly, that their Archbiſhop <hi>Flemming</hi> had a popiſh Clergy under him, in his Province, and did exceedingly tyrannize over them, uſurping juriſdiction even in temporall cauſes, and over the Kings own Courts among the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the popiſh Biſhops in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did uſually conferre Orders, and exerciſe all Epiſcopall juriſdiction there.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that they had a ſpeciall Cardinall at <hi>Rome</hi> [Ludovifius] <hi>given by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>the Pope unto the Iriſh, as the onely Patron and Protector of the Iriſh Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, that they were grown extraordinary bold and inſolent there, ſo as they openly publiſhed this their Proteſtation and Appeal in print, both in Latin and English, to all the world, and avowed it under their hands, ſubſcribed to it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that they had then erected a popiſh Univerſity in <hi>Dublin</hi> it ſelf, of which <hi>Paul Harris</hi> profeſſeth himſelf Deacon (or Dean, as Biſhop <hi>Beadle</hi> ſtiles him. even in print.</p>
               <p>This Prelat, though he knew all this, yet for ought we find, he never took any ſevere courſe at all to prevent the encreaſe and inſolencies of the popiſh Prelats, Prieſts, Fryars, Papiſts there, but rather to foment them: For firſt, he promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſent over divers ſuperſtitious popiſh Clergy-men thither, as young Mr. <hi>Croxton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Bramball</hi> (his principall Agent and Informer, Chaplain to the Lord Deputy) Maſter <hi>Chapple,</hi> and others, who ſet up ſundry popiſh innovations, and brcohed popiſh Doctrines there, to the great encouragement of the Papiſts: Secondly, he ſent over the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> (his grand inſtrument and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race) to be Lord Deputy of that Kingdome, who extraordinarily favoured the popiſh party there, and at laſt proceeded ſo far, as to make uſe of them even in Parliament, <hi>to ballance the Protestants,</hi> the better to conquer and enſlave that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, even by Parliaments; witneſſe this remarkable clauſe in <hi>A Duplicate of a Diſpatch of this Lord Deputies to his Majesty Jan.</hi> 22. 1633. with this ſubſcription: <hi>For my Lords Grace of Canterbury;</hi> found in his private Study at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed with his own hand, <hi>Rec.

               <p> 
                  <q>I <hi>Shall endeavoour that the lower Houſe may be ſo compoſed, as that neither the Recuſants, nor yet the Protestants ſhall appear conſiderably more one then the other, holding them as much as may be, upon an equall ballance, for they will prove thus eaſier to govern, then if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party were abſolute. Then would I in private diſcourſe ſhew the Recuſant,</hi> That the contribution ending in December next, if your Majeſties Army were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome other way before, the twelve pence a Sunday muſt of neceſſity be exacted upon them: <hi>Shew the</hi> Proteſtant, that your Majeſty muſt not let goe the 20000<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. contribution; nor yet diſcontent the other in matter of Religion, till the Army were ſome way elſe certainly provided for, and convince them both, that the preſent quarterly paiments are not ſo burthenſome as they pretended them to be: And that by the graces they have had already more benefit then their mony came to:</q> 
                  <hi>Thus poiſing one by the other, which ſingle might perchance prove more unhappy to deal with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this Machiavillian policy, he then acquainted this Archbiſhop, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accordingly purſued it; which what deſperate effects it hath of late produced in that Kingdom, by making the Iriſh Papiſts able to over-maſter, and almoſt extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Engliſh-Iriſh Proteſtants and their Religion there, we now experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally feel to our greateſt grief and danger.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Archbiſhop only approve this helliſh policy of the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, but likewiſe in the late Scottiſh troubles, they both moſt deſperately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his Majeſty (without the privity of the other Lords) to <hi>raiſe an Army among the Papiſts in</hi> Ireland, <hi>to ſubdue the Scots by force, becauſe they durſt not truſt the</hi>

               <p>If any ſhould object, than this Archbiſhop had no power or charge at all in <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſuppreſſe the Papiſts there: We anſwer, it appears by hundreds of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Letters found in his Study, ſent from thence to him; that nothing at all was there acted concerning any Church affairs, but by his direction, who ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all things, diſpoſed of all Church preferments there at his pleaſure, and likewiſe did what he pleaſed there in moſt ſtate buſineſſes by reaſon of his power with the King, and intereſt in the Deputy, inſomuch, <hi>that the very naming of him at the Counſell Table there, was like a Gorgons head, to amaze all oppoſites, and ſtrike them mute, or into a ſhaking fit,</hi> as the Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> informed him in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Letters from thence: Wherefore we cannot but from all the premiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this very Archbiſhop guilty of being not only privy, but aiding to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing of popery in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and reuniting it to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which Realm being fartheſt out of ſight, was thought the meeteſt Theater for the Pope and his Inſtruments to act their deſigns and parts upon, with moſt advantage, ſecurity, and leaſt oppoſition.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh particular, which moſt evidently manifeſts the Pope's with his Agents deſignes and ſtudious endeavour to reconcile us to <hi>Rome,</hi> and our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick compliance therewith, is the Popes ſending of divers Nuncioes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>England</hi> (a thing never formerly heard of ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) who kept their reſidence, and were entertained as Nuncioes to him in <hi>London, Westminster,</hi> had frequent acceſſe to Court, and held correſpondency with divers of our Nobility; more eſpecially with Secret. <hi>Windebank</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> this Archbiſhops chief Creatures, ſeconded with our avowed entertainment of popiſh Agents at <hi>Rome,</hi> of purpoſe to reduce and reconcile us to it.</p>

He after three yeers and two moneths ſtay here in <hi>England,</hi> aſpiring to a Cardinals Cap, returned towards <hi>Rome,</hi> laden with great ſtore of Jewels and gifts worth many thouſand pounds. After him <hi>Count Roſſetti,</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> was ſent over hither as Nuncio, who continued his Negotiation here, and found great reſpect at Court, till he was driven hence by this Parliament, wherin were many complaints againſt him, about July 1641. as we have elſwhere manifeſted: And as the Pope had his Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's here, ſo had we our reciprocall Agents at <hi>Rome:</hi> The firſt of them was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Walter Mountague,</hi> who arrived there about Auguſt 1633. to whom ſucceeded Serj.

After him ſucceeded Sir <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> a Scot, dangerous Papiſt, who came to <hi>Rome</hi> about the end of May 1636. and continued Agent there till this preſent Parliament: Of all which this Archbiſhop had exact intelligence, as appears by Maſter <hi>Midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi> Letters to him, and <hi>Habernfields</hi> Diſcovery; found among his owne papers, endorſed by himſelf.</p>

was Preſident; to raiſe arms, forces, monies againſt the Scots, to advance the Catholikes cauſe; all which we have elſwhere related, proved at large, and was very well know to this Prelat, by the manifold Remonſtrances, Petitions of the Parliament, againſt this dangerous encreaſe of Papiſts, Prieſts, Jeſuits, Popery, which Petitions he ſtill oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe five particulars thus proved, premiſed, infallibly demonſtrating a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deſign and proſecution of it in the Pope and his Inſtruments to reduce, ſubject us to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which this Archbiſhop was moſt fully inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wherewith in a great meaſure he complied with them; we ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to demonſtrate, that inſtead of counterworking, oppoſing, reſiſting this known deſign and practice of theirs, according to his truſt and duty, he did moſt traiterouſly and wickedly combine, confederate with them to the utmoſt of his wit and power, to advance, accompliſh this their deſign and project by ſundry Jeſuiticall practiſes; ſome whereof we have formerly proved, preſſed at large, and therefore ſhall only recapitulate now, to re-freſh your memories, and then proceed to further evidence.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, he began to uſher into our Cathedrals, Churches, Chappels, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, by inches and degrees, one after another, Altars, Images, Crucifixes, Tapers, Copes, conſecrated Baſons, Altar-cloths, bowing to Altars, Popiſh conſecrations of Churches, Chappels, Church-yards, Flagons, Veſtments, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiaes, Corporals, turning and railing in Communion Tables Altarwiſe, kneeling at the new Rails, ſtanding up at <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> praying toward the eaſt, reading ſecond ſervice at the Altar, with other popiſh Innovations formerly mentioned; at firſt he introduced them only as things tolerable, or indifferent, at laſt enjoyed them as expedient and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he proceeded to introduce divers Arminian Tenents as a bridge to popery; firſt, in Pulpits, diſcourſes; then in printed authorized books, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting, ſuppreſſing, all preaching, printing, and books againſt them under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he next went on to countenance, authorize, maintain, confirm, both in Pulpit and Preſſe, divers erronious poſitions, contrary to the general ſtraine and tenent of our own and forraign Proteſtant Writers of chiefeſt note, tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a reconciliation between us and <hi>Rome:</hi> We ſhall inſtance in theſe few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, maintained by himſelf, both in his ſpeeches and writings: Firſt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church: Secondly, that ſhe never erred in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in the worſt times, but only <hi>circa fundamentalia,</hi> both which he publikely maintained in the High Commiſſion at Doctor <hi>Bastwicks</hi> cenſure, as Maſter <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Lane</hi> a Miniſter depoſed: Thirdly, that the Religion of Papiſts and Proteſtants is one and the ſame: Fourthly, that men may be ſaved in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Romiſh Religion, &amp; therefore we need not pray for any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts converſion, no not for the Queens, which he ſpecially prohibited, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned thoſe who thus prayed for her: Fifthly, that the Pope is not Antichriſt, nor ought to have this title given him, which he expunged both out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Books of our Church, and private mens impreſſions: Sixtly, that the Pope is ſupream head of the Church, the firſt and greateſt Patriarch; and to make this doctrine paſſe more current, he ſuffered the Popes own Titles of, <hi>Sanctitatis Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strae Sanctiſſime Pater, Spiritus Sancti effuſiſſime plenus; Optimus Maximuſque in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: Ille quo rectior non-ſtat Regula, quo Prior eſt corrigenda Religio;</hi> to be attributed to him ſucceſſively in ſundry Letters from the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Maſter <hi>Crox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and others without controll; and proclaims himſelf a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> in his own book againſt <hi>Fiſher, pag.</hi> 171. Seventhly, his own Chaplain Doctor <hi>Bray,</hi> by his ſpeciall direction, in two Books of Doctor <hi>Pocklingtons,</hi> ſeverally printed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed with authority, proclaimed, that he derived his lineall ſucceſſion and Epiſcopacy from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that our Church was miſerable if he could not doe ſo; which Doctor <hi>Heylen,</hi> by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

command, ſeconded in print; which Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> thus trebles in his <hi>Originum Eccleſiaſticarum; Tomi Priorus, pars poſterior,</hi> pag. 465. <hi>In Pontificali, ſeu li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro quam vocamus Ordinationum, Epiſcopus,</hi> (AB AUGUSTINO LEGITIME DERIVATA SUCCESSIONE, ET GREGORIO ROMANO DEDU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTUS) <hi>Sacros Ordines ſecundum veteris Eccleſiae Cannores conferens, Ordinandum Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotem, ſic affatur, Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, &amp;c.</hi> Deriving not only this Archbiſhop, but all our other Biſhops ſucceſſions and Epiſcopacy from <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk, and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> a goodly Romiſh pedegree to be much inſiſted on directly reducing us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence it was derived, as to our Mother Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he with his Inſtruments and Chaplains, vented, authorized not only in the Pulpit, but Preſſe, all manner of popiſh erronious doctrines, never heard amongſt us in former yeers, comprizing the whole body of Papiſtry, of purpoſe to reduce us back to <hi>Rome;</hi> the particulars whereof you have heard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, ſuppreſſing orthodox Books, written againſt popiſh errours, and purging the chiefeſt paſſages againſt the Church, Pope, Preſts, Jeſuits and errours of <hi>Rome</hi> out of all old reprinted and new licenſed books, before they could paſſe the Preſſe, as we have abundantly proved, inſerting popiſh pictures, and a popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex into our very Bibles, the more eaſily to ſeduce men to Popery.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, he advanced the moſt corrupt, popiſh, ſuperſtitious perſons of all ſorts, to Biſhopricks, Deaneries, Prebendaries, Head-ſhips of houſes in the Univerſity, Chaplains to the King and Prince, and the greateſt Benefices; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſilenced, deprived, cenſured, baniſhed the moſt zealous preaching or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Miniſters in all places, and kept them from preferment, the better to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate and effect this deſign.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, he cauſed ſundry books tending to Reconciliation of us to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be printed and publiſhed, eſpecially Biſhop <hi>Mountague's Appeal,</hi> and other Books ſince, of which <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> took ſpeciall notice, and made bold to proclaim a peace and reconciliation in moſt points between us.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, he ſuppreſſed all Lectures and after-noon Sermons on the Lord's day in moſt places, that the people through ignorance might be more eaſily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and inſtead of ſtrict ſanctification of the Lords day, the principall means of encreaſing piety, knowledge, and keeping men off from popery and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanneſſe, he cauſed a new Declaration to be printed and publiſhed in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties name, for the uſe of prophane ſports and paſtimes even on Gods own day, and under pretext thereof, cauſed hundreds of our moſt conſciencious Miniſters, (whom otherwiſe he could not tax or quarrell,) to be ſilenced, ſuſpended, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, yea, driven out of the Realm to forreign Countries and Plantations, that ſo theſe grand obſtructions of our reconciliation with <hi>Rome</hi> being removed we might without any great difficulty or oppoſition be reduced, reconciled to her; and leaſt any impediment ſhould ariſe to croſſe this Unity from the Dutch, French, or Walloon Churches in our Realms, not any ways poyſoned with his popiſh drugs and Romiſh innovations, he attempted their extirpation too, and had almoſt effected it: All which particulars we have already proved.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to ſome further evidence, manifeſting his compliancy, intelligence and concurrence with the Pope and his Inſtruments in this helliſh plot; what evidence of this kind, common fame and report, both at home, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſwhere hath given in againſt him, Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> Maſter <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> Maſter <hi>Challoner</hi> and others have already atteſted: what reall evidence we have yet remaining, to make good this fame, we ſhall now produce.</p>
               <p>It had been too groſſe, too palpable an overſight in ſuch a politician as this Archbiſhop was reputed, and very prejudiciall to his deſigns, conſidering the place he ſuſtained, his pretended profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religion, his diſlike of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the many vigilant eyes that were continually fixed on his actions, to have held any open or immediate intelligence with the Pope, or

               <p>SEcretary Windebank, <hi>a moſt fierce Papiſt, is the moſt unfaithfull to the King of all men, who not only betrayes and reveals even the Kings greateſt ſecrets, but likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates Councels, by which the deſigne may be beſt advanced: He at leaſt thrice every week converſeth with the Legat in nocturnall Conventicles, and reveals thoſe things which he thinks fit to be known, for which end he hired a houſe neer to the Legats houſe, whom he often reſorts</hi>

               <p>For his committing Meſſengers to priſon, untill they ſhould enter into bond never to perſecute Prieſts or Jeſuits more (an extraordinary good ſervice of a pretended Proteſtant Secretary of State) you ſhall hear thereof anon, when we produce our Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>By all theſe particulars, it is moſt evident, that this Secretary, (the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops old, and moſt intimate loving friend,) was advanced by him to this place of truſt, to be a moſt peſtilent trecherous inſtrument of protecting, enlarging, ſecuring popiſh Prieſts, Jeſuits, Fryars, Papiſts, to hold familiar intelligence with the Popes Cardinals, Nuncio's, Agents, to promote their dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon us, and reduce us back to <hi>Rome;</hi> that the Archbiſhop knew he was ſuch an one, and yet continued his intimacy and correſpondency with him to promote the ſame deſigns.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed a little further, and cleerly evidence to your Lordſhips and the world, that the Archbiſhop held, not only remote &amp; mediate correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the Pope and his Agents by Biſhop <hi>Mountague, Windebank,</hi> and others of his Inſtruments, but even with moſt deſperate popiſh Prieſts, Jeſuits and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves; Not to inſtance in the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and his Counteſſe, Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby,</hi> Sir <hi>John Winter,</hi> and other lay-papiſts, who were very active ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous promoters of this Romiſh plot, at <hi>Habernfield's</hi> Diſcovery informs both the Archbiſhop himſelf and us, we ſhall nominate ſome profeſſed Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of note, with whom he had intelligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> as we have proved formerly under his own hand, was brought to him by Doctor <hi>Lindſey,</hi> who acquainted him with his Book of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before it was printed, and was with him afterwards ſome five or ſix times more, proffering him his Service to maintain Epiſcopacy to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>

                  <hi>Monſieur Saint Giles,</hi> a moſt dangerous ſeducing Prieſt, though known to him to be ſuch a one, was maintained by him ſundry yeers together in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he had the free uſe of the Library, to inſtruct and ſeduce both the Doctors and Students there, &amp; reduce them back to <hi>Rome,</hi> who were running too faſt thither without ſuch a ſpur to poſt them forwards, or Poſtilion to direct them in the way: This we have proved under his own hand, by the teſtimony of Maſter <hi>Brode,</hi> and if need be, we have Maſter <hi>Nixon,</hi> Maſter <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and one Father <hi>Cox</hi> a Benectine Prieſt, to atteſt it further on their Oaths.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> a moſt dangerous ſeducing active Prieſt and Jeſuit, was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with him at <hi>Lambeth, White-Hall,</hi> and other places, eating oft with him at his Table, riding ſometimes very familiarly with him in his Coach, and going with him in his Barge.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Flud</hi> alias <hi>Smith,</hi> a moſt deſperate ſeducing Prieſt and Jeſuit, who had a hand in the Gun-powder-plot, was very familiar with his Creature <hi>Windebank</hi> and oft frequented the Arch-biſhop at <hi>Lambeth Houſe.</hi>

Neither was he thus only familiar and held correſpondency with theſe Prieſts and Jeſuits, but protected them all he might, not proſecuting them at all, but onely in ſhew to delude the people, and then very coldly, ſecuring them in by priſons where they had the beſt chambers, great reſort, liberty to goe in and out at pleaſure without a Keeper, never ſending them to the common Goales, to be indicted, executed, and at laſt releaſing them out of priſon, when as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, cloſe impriſoned, baniſhed into forraigne Countries, dungeons, cut off the ears, ſlit the noſes, branded the cheeks of ſome, and utterly ruined other Proteſtant Miniſtes and zealous Gentlemen, for oppoſing popery and popiſh Innovations.

               <p>Yea, this moſt ſedulous promoter of the Popes deſignes, for his dexterity, experience and ſedulity in mannaging his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> affaires in <hi>England,</hi> was in ſuch extraordinary favour with the Pope, that by a <hi>Speciall Bull</hi> he committed his laſt <hi>Nuncio,</hi> Count <hi>Roſſetti</hi> (being but yong) to his tutelage and direction, as to his <hi>Angle Gardian;</hi> hoping, that his Nuncio aſſiſted by his <hi>Counſels, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no ſmall fruits to the Catholicke Church</hi> IN A SHORT TIME, SPACE, <hi>and</hi>

               <p>By all theſe premiſed Teſtimonies and Evidences, it is moſt fully proved, as farre as is poſſible for us to goe, unleſſe we had the very Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuites themſelves here perſonally preſent to be examined (who would be very unwilling to diſcover any thing againſt their Arch-Patriot upon Oath.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, that this Archbiſhop held familiarity and correſpondency with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry notorious Prieſts and Jeſuites forementioned, imployed as Agents by the Papiſts to reduce and reconcile us unto <hi>Rome;</hi> who were oft-times ſeene at <hi>Lambeth-houſe,</hi> neer his Study, and publikely boaſted of their recourſe to, and favour with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> the moſt dangerous ſeducing Prieſt and Jeſuite of all others, was moſt intimately familiar with him, and oft-times ſeen with him both in his Coach, his Barge, his Garden, his Houſe, and a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Gueſſe at his Table: and Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> a moſt pernicious Prieſt, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> to ſeduce the Doctors and Students there to Popery.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that he was very coldin the proſecution of Prieſts and Jeſuites; and if at any time he impriſoned them for a ſhew to gull the vulgar people, it

was onely in the <hi>Clinke</hi> or <hi>New Priſon</hi> (not <hi>Newgate</hi> or any County Goale,) where they were protected, ſecured againſt all Legall proſecutions, had the beſt Lodgings, a common Steward, Cooke, Table, very good fare, great reſort of all ſorts of people, daily Maſſes, and free liberty to walke and ſtay abroad at pleaſure without a Keeper, as freely as any man might walke out of his owne Houſe. Yea, ſuch was his indulgence towards them (though Arch-Traytors by our Lawes) that in his <hi>Epistle Dedicatory to the King himſelfe,</hi> before his <hi>Relation of a Conference with</hi> Fiſher <hi>the Jeſuite,</hi> he makes this profeſſion of it in Print, not onely to his Majeſty, but to the whole world, in theſe words which were read at the Barre.</p>

And did he not perſecute hundreds of other godly Miniſters, yea raiſe up a generall perſecution againſt them throughout the Kingdome, and drive ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of them, with many thouſands of religious, godly people out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into forraigne Plantations among Savages and Indian heathens? Nay, did he not all this and more whiles he had any power, notwithſtanding <hi>God</hi> himſelfe did <hi>forbid</hi> it? And whereas he writes, <hi>That to his remembrance be never gave this Jeſuite, or any of his, ſo much as courſe language:</hi> he was ſo far from uſing ſuch civility to our godly Proteſtant Miniſters, Gentlemen, &amp; others who moſt oppoſed Popery and Popiſh Innovations; that his mouth was full of moſt bitter railing Invectives, Satyres, revilings againſt them, not onely in his private Chamber when ever convented before him, but even in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Speeches in the Starchamber and High-Commiſſion; witneſſe his printed Speech in Starchamber before mentioned, with his Epiſtle to it; nay, in this

very Epiſtle to the King, he thus railes upon them in down-right tearmes; <hi>How I have been uſed by the</hi> ſcandalous and ſcurrilous <hi>pennes of ſome</hi> bitter men, <hi>the world knows: little leaſure and leſſe encouragement given me, whiles I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prophets affliction, Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>between</hi> the mouth that ſpeaks wickedneſſe, and the tongue that ſets forth deceit, and ſlander me as thick as if I were not their own mothers ſonne. <hi>In the midſt of theſe</hi> libellous outcries <hi>againſt me,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Fourthly, that the Archbiſhop contrary to his Truſt, Oath, Place and duty, both as an Archbiſhop, a Privy Counſellour and high Commiſſioner, did not onely favour Seminary Prieſts and Jeſuits, though traitors by Law, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, diſcountenance thoſe Officers appointed by the State to apprehend them; telling <hi>Thomas Mayo,</hi> that he <hi>was too hot and nimble for that ſervice;</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Maſter <hi>Thatcher to lay him by the heels, and turne him out of his place, if he kept</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>company with</hi> Gray, <hi>who gave him intelligence of the perſons and lodgings of Priests and Jeſuits;</hi> threatning <hi>all the Meſſengars of the high Commiſſion openly in Court, that if they kept company with</hi> Gray (whom he called A PRIEST-CATCHER) <hi>he would not onely lay them by the heels, but likewiſe pull-their Coats from off their backs, and turne them out of their places: That he cauſed</hi> Gray <hi>to be committed to the Fleet above twelve weeks for apprehending Prieſts,</hi> and the words forementioned, yea threw away his Petition, ſaying, <hi>He would have nothing to doe with that</hi> PRIST-CATCHING KNAVE: <hi>nay, he and Master</hi> Waddeſworth <hi>muſt not be releaſed out of Priſon till they would promiſe never to apprehend or proſecute Priests or Jeſuits more.</hi> A moſt cleer demonſtration, that he not onely had correſpondency and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with Prieſts and Jeſuits, but likewiſe was their Arch-protector, their grand friend, inſomuch that <hi>Smith</hi> the Jeſuit openly threatned Maſter <hi>Newton</hi> in the ſtreets, <hi>That he had done his errand to the Archbiſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we appeale to all the world, whether ever any reall Proteſtant Prelat ſhewed himſelf ſuch a Patriot of Prieſts and Jeſuits in this kind as he? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope himſelfe could have done more in their behalfe then he did, had he ſate Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> at <hi>Lambeth-houſe.</hi> It was one chief Article of the Privy Counſels and Judges charge againſt Cardinall <hi>Woolſey,</hi> preſented to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: <hi>That he had been the impeacher and disturber of due and direct correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                  <hi>of Errours and Hereſies, by reaſon whereof, they crept more abroad, and tooke grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place, being highly to the danger and perill of the whole body, and good Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Realme:</hi> All which this Archbiſhop is guilty in an higher meaſure, in reſpect of Popery, Prieſts and Jeſuits, then ever this Cardinall was, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Lutheran Sect and Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is evident that the Archbiſhop had a hand in aſſiſting the Papiſts Prieſts and Jeſuits, in the diſperſing of their popiſh Books, to ſeduce his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects, contrary to an expreſſe Statut; whereas he uſed all poſſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to ſuppreſſe the printing, diſperſing, importing Orthodox Books (and thoſe he ſtiled Puritannicall) both at home and beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:61245:237"/>
Finally, the Archbiſhop complyed with the Papiſts, Prieſts, Jeſuits, in concealing their very treaſonable plots and conſpiracies againſt the King, Kingdome, Church; and all profeſſors of the Proteſtant Religion; we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but in two particulars. The firſt is in the caſe of Miſtreſſe <hi>Anne Huſſey,</hi> who depoſed at the Lords Barre to this effect: That <hi>William O Conner an Iriſh Prieſt, ſervant to the</hi> Queen Mother, ſoon after Eaſter, in the yeer 1640. among other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, told her, at the houſe of one Maſter <hi>Hill,</hi> neer the <hi>Strand</hi> in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> That <hi>there were many private houſes about</hi> London, <hi>wherein they uſed to have Maſſe ſaid, that there were</hi> 7000. <hi>men in private pay ready to ayde the Catholicks, and to</hi>

                  <hi>cut the Protestants throats that ſhould reſiſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which, he comming to her in great haſte, at Miſtreſſe <hi>Pinocks</hi> houſe about the end of <hi>July</hi> 1640. told her, <hi>That he was then in great haſte, for he had Letters from the Queen Mother, to be delivered to three Embaſſadours, the</hi> Spaniſh, <hi>the</hi> Venetian, <hi>the</hi> French, <hi>to ſend to the Pope, to know from himſelfe or his Legat, when to begin the ſubduing of the Protestants; that the Queen his Lady was no foole, and that if the King joyned with the Protestants, they would cut him off, if not by the ſword, yet by ſome other way; that if no other hand would doe it, his hand ſhould kill the King; and that he would kill an Heretick at any time, for the advancement of the Mother Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſwearing by Saint</hi> Francis <hi>and Saint</hi> Dominick, <hi>that he would doe it.</hi> All which he ſpake to her in <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſhe counterfeiting her ſelfe to be a Roman Catholick, deſirous to become a Nunne: He likewiſe confeſſed, <hi>That he had been a ſervant long to the Queen Mother, and imployed by her in buſineſſe to all the Princes of</hi> CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STENDOME.</p>
               <p>Whereupon ſhe according to her duty and alleagiance, complained of this Prieſt, revealing this diſcomſe and treaſon of his to the Lords of the Privy Counſell, atteſting her information upon oath, and producing a Letter of this Prieſts to her under his owne hand, with ſome other witneſſes to confirme her teſtimony in point of circumſtance of time, place, and this Prieſts reſort unto her; But the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to diſcourage and take her off from this diſcovery, <hi>reviled and gave her many ill words and threats, told her ſhe was mad,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">NOTE:</note>

               <p>We ſhall next as faithfully, as exactly as our imperfect notes, and frail memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will aſſiſt, relate his ſeveral Anſwers and Replies given to the particular proofs produced againſt him, both as he delivered them in perſon after each dayes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at the Lords bar, and as he afterwards repeated them in his general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, with ſome Additions, in the Lords and Commons Houſe; wherein if I have involuntarily miſtaken or miſreported his words or anſwers in any particular as I preſume I have not done, his ſurviving friends muſt only blame either him, or themſelves, not me, who uſed all the means I could to his Secretary Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> his Councel, and others whom he truſted with his Papers, to procure his own Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal written Notes, Anſwers, and Replies, or true Copies of them; that ſo I might have printed them <hi>verbatim,</hi> to avoid all calumnies and miſtakes; yet could neither by my own intreaties, nor warrants from Authority procure them, or any Copies thereof: Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> returning me this anſwer, <hi>that he believed the Archbiſhop himſelf had burnt all his Notes and Anſwers in his life time, to prevent their publication after his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To avoid prolixity, obſcurity, that every Reader may more clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the inſufficiency, falſhood, Sophiſtry of his Anſwers, and the pregnancy of the Commons proofs, and evidence to make good their impeachment againſt him in each particular; I ſhall forbear to relate his Anſwers and the Commons Replies thereto, intirely together in two diſtinct continued Relations, as they were delivered at the bar, but ſubjoyn the Commons diſtinct Replies to his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Anſwers to each particular proof and part of their evidence, as they lie in order; that ſo <hi>reddendo ſingula ſingulis,</hi> the pertinency of their evidence, and reality of his guiltineſſe, may more perſpicuouſly ſhine forth to all the world, I aiming only at verity, not victory in this Relation.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop began his Anſwer to the firſt Branch of the Commons charge, concerning his traiterous endeavours to ſubvert the true Religion of God by Law eſtabliſhed among us, and ſet up Popiſh Superſtition and Idolatry in its ſtead, with a general deteſtation both of the charge and fact, for which preſumptuous and unſeemly expreſſion, he was juſtly taxed by the Commons councel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:61245:239"/>
a defiance given to them and their proceedings, proſeſſing it the greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe that ever beſel him, to be thus deeply and criminally charged by the Honourable Houſe of Commons (the repreſentative body of the whole commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of <hi>England)</hi> before the higheſt Tribunal in the Realm, as being guilty of ſuch a crime as this, in his laſt dying dayes, when he had one foot already in the grave, which his own conſcience pronounced him to have been guiltleſſe of, all the dayes of his life: Yet proteſting it to be an unſpeakable comfort to him in this his infelicity, that he was arraigned for it before ſo juſt, ſo Honourable an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Peers (many of them being privy to the ſincerity of his actions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to his Majeſtie) to vindicate his integrity to all the world, and waſh off all thoſe black ſpots of calumny, of obloquy, wherewith he had for many years by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, been moſt unjuſtly aſperſed by Sectaries on the one hand, by Ieſuits and Papiſts on the other, to ruin him both in his reputation, fortune, and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties moſt gracious opinion. And ſo preſuming he had ſufficiently cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the general from this heavy charge in their Lordſhips and others opinions by his firſt dayes ſpeech, the new Canons and Oath preſcribed in them and by his Book againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Ieſuite; he would without any further Prologue or Apology diſcend to Anſwer the particular evidences, proofs, produced againſt him by the Commons in their reſpective order, with as much brevity, perſpicuity as the ſuddainneſſe of his preparations, the frailty of his memory, the burthen of 70 yeers, with other natural infirmities then lying heavy upon him, would permit: And to give him his due, he made as full, as gallant, as pithy a defence of ſo bad a cauſe, and ſpake as much for himſelf, as was poſſible for the wit of man to invent, and that with ſo much Art, Sophiſtry, Vivacity, Oratory, Audacity and confidence, without the leaſt bluſh or acknowledgement of guilt in any thing (annimated by his ſeated Panders lying by him) as argued him rather obſtinate, then innocent, impudent, then penitent, a far better Orator, Sophiſter, then Proteſtant or Chriſtian, yea, a truer Son of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in many particulars, as you will anon diſcern.</p>
               <p>He began his defence, where the Commons did their charge, and they their Reply where he began his Anſwer, to wit, at his publike Chappel at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Houſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing the Commons have in their evidence charged againſt me, is the ſetting up and repairing of Popiſh Images and Pictures in the glaſſe windows of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> my Chappel at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> and amongſt others, the Picture of Chriſt hanging on the Croſſe between the two Theeves in the Eaſt window; of God the Father in Form of a little old Man, with a Glory, ſtriking <hi>Myriam</hi> with a leproſie; of the Holy Ghoſt deſcending in Form of a Dove; and of Chriſts Nativity, laſt Supper, Reſurrection, Aſcention, and others, the Patern whereof Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> atteſted I took out of the very Maſſe Book, wherein he ſhewed their Portratures.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: Firſt, that I did not ſet theſe Images up, but found them <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> there before: Secondly, That I did only repair the windows which were ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and the Chappel which lay ſo naſtily before, that I was aſhamed to behold, and could not reſort unto it, but with ſome diſdain, which cauſed me to repair it to my great coſt: Thirdly, that I made up the Hiſtory of theſe old broken Pictures, not by any patern in the Maſſe Book, but only by help of the fragments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of them, which I compared with the ſtory: Fourthly, though the very reſemblances of them be in the Maſſe Book, yet I proteſt I never knew they were there, till Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> ſhewed them in it at this bar: And it is but a meer fallacy, the Pictures which I repaired are in the Maſſe Book; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I took the patern of them out of it: Fifthly, Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf allows an Hiſtorical uſe of Images, <hi>Juſt, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. where thus he writes, <hi>Neque tamenea ſuperſtitione teneor, ut nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las prorſus imagines ſerendas cenſeam; ſed quia ſculptura et pictura Dei dona ſunt, purum et legitimum utriuſque uſum requiro:</hi> Sixthly, our Homilies themſelves allow an Hiſtorical uſe of Images, as appears by <hi>Page</hi> 64, 65.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:61245:239"/>
Seventhly, The Primitive Chriſtians approved, and had the Pictures of Chriſt himſelf: <hi>Tertullian</hi> recording, that they had the Picture of Chriſt engraven on their Chalices in form of a Shepherd carrying home the loſt ſheep on his back. Eightly, I hope the repairing and ſetting up of theſe Pictures is no High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by any Law. Ninthly, Images and Pictures in Arras, or Glaſſe-Windows, are not againſt the Statute of 3. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. but Statues onely.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed: Firſt, That he did not finde theſe Images there compleat or entire, but broken and demoliſhed by vertue of our Statutes, Homilies, <note place="margin">Reply.</note> Injunctions forecited, and that at the beginning of Reformation; ever ſince which time they continued unrepaired, as Monuments of our indignation and deteſtation againſt them, like the ruines of our Abbies and Monaſteries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have here <hi>confitentem reum,</hi> the Archbiſhop plainly confeſſing that we charge him with; to wit, the repairing of the broken Images of Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt in Glaſſe-Windows; and no wayes denying, extenuating, but juſtifying this Popiſh-Fact of his againſt our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yea, his own frequent Subſcriptions to our Homilies, and Articles of Religion, which confirm them: Nay, Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> his own Joyner, atteſted, that he by the Archbiſhops directions, repaired and new made the broken Crucifix in <hi>Croyden</hi> Chappel, as well as in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Chappel; and the Archbiſhop plainly confeſſeth, That he had no great devotion to ſerve God in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Chappel, nor yet to reſort unto it, till theſe Images were repaired, and now beautified to pleaſe his eyes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That himſelf took pains, and gave direction to the Glaſiers to make up the Stories and Pictures in the Windows, out of the broken fragments remaining, and new made them to his exceſſive coſt, whereas he might have new glaſed them with unpainted Glaſſe, for the tenth part of that his Painted Pictures coſt him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He confeſſeth the very portratures of the new furbiſhed Pictures in his Chappel to be all contained in the Maſſe-Book, which we made ſo apparant to your Lordſhips, that he could not with ſhame deny it; but proteſts he knew them not to be in it, and that he took not his patern out of it. To which we muſt reply, That he having noted his Maſſe-Book, wherein we ſhewed them to be portrayed, in every page almoſt with his own hand, and turning this Book ſo frequently over, muſt of neceſſity ſee theſe Pictures in it, which are ſo large and viſible, unleſſe we ſhall ſuppoſe him blinde, or ſuch an hater of them, as purpoſely to turn his eye-ſight from them, which is improbable; And therefore, notwithſtanding this bold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of his, we hold our Argument both true and ſolid. The new Images in his Chappel-Windows exactly agree in all things with the Printed ones in his Maſſe-Book, which he could not but know, and ſee too, as oft as he noted or peruſed his <hi>Roman Miſſal. Ergo,</hi> He took his patern from the Maſſe-Book in the repairing, as well as his Popiſh Predeceſſors in the firſt making of them, ſince no other patern hath been produced by him, by which he gave directions to new make them, but the <hi>Roman Miſſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, We wonder greatly, that he who hath ſo much traduced, reviled Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> publikely heretofore, ſhould flie thus unto him for ſhelter now; but as he abuſed his perſon and memory then, ſo he miſerably perverts and miſapplies his words now, point-blank againſt his meaning. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> onely affirms, that he is not ſo ſuperſtitious as to think it altogether unlawful to make any Images of men or Beaſts for a civil uſe, ſince painting is the gift of God: From whence the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop hath inferred. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> holds it lawful to make the Pictures of Chriſts Nativity, laſt Supper, Paſſion, Reſurrection, coming to Judgement; of God the Father, like an Old Man; of Chriſt on the Croſſe, of God the Holy Ghoſt, in form of a Dove, and Cloven-Tongues, of the Virgin<hi>-Mary,</hi> other Saints, and to ſet them up in Churches, as he did theſe Images in his Chappel: Whereas Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> in the ſelf ſame place, in moſt poſitive terms, concludes the contrary; Witneſſe the very next words following thoſe he objects;
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:61245:240"/>
                  <hi>Purum &amp; legitimum utriuſque uſum require, ne quae Dominus in ſuam gloriam, &amp; bonum noſtrum nobis contulit, ea non tantum polluantur praepoſtero abuſu, ſed in noſtram quoque perniciem convertantur.

                  <hi>Non judicio aut delectu, ſed ſtulta &amp; inconfide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata cupiditate.</hi> In the very next Section he debates the very point in queſtion, whether it be lawful for Chriſtians to have any Images at all of Hiſtories, or of mens bodies (not of any perſons in the Trinity, the very making whereof he formerly concludes to be a great wickedneſſe) which he thus propounds and reſolves:</p>

                  <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and other Ancients unanimouſly agree, That the Primitive Chriſtians had no Images at all in their Churches, together with the Councels of <hi>Eliberis, Conſtantinople, Toledo, Francford,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine the Great, Conſtantinus Caballinus, Nicephorus Stauratius, Philipicus, Anthemius, Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Leo Armenus, Valens, Michael Balbus, Theophylus, Charls the Great,</hi> with ſundry other godly Emperors, utterly demoliſhed and caſt them out of Churches, as Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Authors, our own <note n="c" place="margin">See the 2. and 3. part of the Homily againſt the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of Idolatry.</note>

And therefore it is a moſt deſperate Impudency in the Archbiſhop, thus falſly to affirm the contrary, point-blank againſt our <hi>Homilies</hi> and his own ſubſcription to them. And whereas he cites <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to prove, that the Chriſtians in his dayes had the picture of Chriſt upon their <hi>Chalices;</hi> We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if the Book <hi>de Pvdicitia</hi> be <hi>Tertullians</hi> own, (of which ſome doubt) yet his words import no ſuch thing, which are theſe, <hi>A parabolis licebit incipias; ubi eſt evis perdita à Domino acquiſita, &amp; humeris ejus revecta; Procedant ipſae PICT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RAE CALIC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M VESTROR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M</hi> (not <hi>noſtrorum) ſi volle nillis perlucebit interpretatio pecudis illius, utrumne Chriſtiano vel Ethnico pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateri de reſtitutione colliniet.</hi> If this place intimate any thing, it is onely this, That the <hi>Phychici</hi> and other Hereticks againſt whom he writ this Book, (not the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians, as this Prelate dreams) had the picture of the loſt ſheep graven on their cups: will it therefore follow hence, <hi>Ergo</hi> The Orthodox Chriſtians had Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes and Images of Chriſt, God the Father, the Holy Ghoſt and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in their Churches, in their Chappelss, as he hath ſet up in his <hi>Lambeth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> windows?

And therefore his Impudency and Sophiſtry in citing <hi>Tertullian</hi> for defence of Images in Churches, who is thus point-blank againſt the making of any Image whatſoever, even for civil uſes, is an intolerable, inexcuſable Boldneſſe.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Whereas he Anſwers, That the ſetting up of theſe Glaſſe-Images is no High-Treaſon by the Statute: We grant it not to be ſo ſimply in it ſelf, neither do we urge it to be ſo, but as it tends to ſubvert our Religion, Laws, and ſet up Popery,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:61245:241"/>
concurs with his other practiſes of this nature, ſo it may and will prove High Treaſon. The ſecond Part of the <hi>Homily againſt the peril of Idolatry,</hi> Page 37. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, <hi>That the maintenance of Images hath brought in a ſea of miſchiefs, horrible Schiſms, Rebellions, TREASONS,</hi> and his maintaining of them hath done the like.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, we conceive that the Statute of 3. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. which command all Images of Stone, Timber, Alabaſter, or Earth, graven, carved, or painted; which heretofore have been taken out of any Church or Chapple, or yet ſtand in any Church or Chapple to be defaced and deſtroyed, extend to Images in glaſſe windowes as well as others, which are but painted Earth; and that which confirms us in this opinion is, That the <hi>Homilies againſt the peril of Jdolatry (the occaſion of this Law) and the injunctions of Queen</hi> Elizabeth made in purſuance of it, extend in direct terms to <hi>Images in glaſſe windowes,</hi> as well as to Images of Stone, Timber and the like, yea, the practiſe of that time in defacing the glaſſe Images in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-windowes (which he of late repaired) and in moſt other places, infallibly proves it: Together with the Statute of 3. <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 5. which reckons up <hi>Jmages</hi> and <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> of what matter ſoever, among the <hi>Reliques of Popery,</hi> and enjoynes them to be defaced: wherefore the evaſion of his is moſt falſe and frivolous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince Popery may creep in at a glaſſe-window, as well as at a door; and our Homilies, Injunctions, writers cenſure all of them alike, if this Statute do it not: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by all theſe Anſwers he profeſſeth himſelf a moſt zealous, real Papiſt, but falſe Proteſtant in pleading thus boldly and falſly for the uſe of Images of all ſorts in Churches, and in repairing of Popiſh Images formerly defaced by Authority, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of confeſſing and craving pardon for this his dangerous error, his moſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, Popiſh practiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing objected againſt me, as a <hi>Popiſh Innovation</hi> in my Chapple <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> is, <note n="b" place="margin">See here <hi>Pa.</hi> 62, 64.</note> my removing and railing in the Communion Table there Altarwiſe, with the ends of it North and South againſt the wall; my furniſhing it with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Candleſticks, and other furniture, and hanging a cloth of Arras behinde it, with the Picture of Chriſt and his Apoſtles eating the Lords Supper together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which <hi>I</hi> Anſwer, Firſt, That the railing in and placing the Table Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarwiſe is warranted by Queen <hi>Elizabeths Injunctions,</hi> which preſcribe, That <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Holy Table in every Church be decently made, and ſet in the place where the Altar ſtood: Now the Altars generally in all Churches, as all Antiquity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts, ſtood at the Eaſt end of the Quire, North and South cloſe to the wall, as the Tables were lately placed, and there were railed in: This therefore is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the furniture on the Altar is no other then ſuch as is in uſe in the Kings own Chapple at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and had been there uſed ever ſince and before my time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Arras peece at the back of the Table containing the Story of Chriſts laſt Supper, was fit for that place and occaſion: That ſuch Images and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations were lawful, approved by all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, yea, by Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, for an Hiſtorical uſe, in the place forecited, <hi>Jnſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> To this the Commons replied, Firſt, That neither Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Injunctions, nor the Rubrick in the Common Prayer-Book, nor any Law or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <note place="margin">Reply.</note> of our Church preſcribe the railing in of our Communion Tables, or placing them Altarwiſe againſt the wall, with the ends North and South: There is no ſillable in any of them to warrant any ſuch Popiſh innovation, preſcribed only by Popiſh Canons, as we have proved: That it cannot be proved that Altars were generally ſo placed and railed in anciently, either in <hi>England</hi> or elſwhere: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof we ſhall prove anon; That the makers and executers of theſe Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions knew beſt of any, where and how Communion Tables were to be ſituated by vertue of them, and they generally placed them throughout the Realm, in the midſt of the Quire or Chancel, with the ends Eaſt and Weſt, ſtanding a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61245:241"/>
from the Eaſt wall, without any rail about it, in which poſture they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſtood in all Churches, Chapples, and in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Chapple it ſelf for one, ever ſince theſe Injunctions publiſhed, till this innovating Arch prelate alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this their ancient ſituation. Yet both the Rubrick in the Common Prayer Book, the Queens Injunctions, the 82 Canon, Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Babington,</hi> Doctor <hi>Fulk,</hi> and other of our writers agree, that when the Sacrament is adminiſtred it ought to ſtand in the body of the Church or Chancel, of which more hereafter: This therefore is an innovation and that a Popiſh one too, tending to introduce pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Maſſe, to remove the Lords Table as far as poſſible from the view and audience of the common people, when the Sacrament is celebrated at it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We <note n="k" place="margin">See p. 62.</note> have proved, that this Altar-furniture of Candleſticks, Tapers, Baſons, Crucifixes, and the like, was originally borrowed from the <hi>Roman, Ceremonial, Pontifical,</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh Councel of Aix,</hi> which injoyn them, <hi>That the third Part of our Homilies againſt the peril of Idolatry, and Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths <hi>Injunctions</hi> (which he cites for the placing of Lords Tables Altarwiſe) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct. 2. 23. 25. condemn, cenſure, aboliſh, as Superſtitious, Ethnical; and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, all Candleſticks, Trendals, Rolls of wax, and ſetting up of Tapers, for that they be things tending to Idolatry and Superſtition, which of all other offences, God Almighty doth moſt deteſt and abhor, for that the ſame diminiſh moſt his honour and glory: Therefore the Kings Altar-Furniture in his Chappel at <hi>White Hall,</hi> can be no juſtification nor extenuation of his offence, who ſhould have reformed his Majeſties Chappel (whereof he was the Dean and Superintendent, according to our Lawes, Homilies, Injunctions which condemn ſuch Altar-trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets) not conformed his own Chapple, Altar to the Kings, in theſe meer Popiſh Superſtitious innovations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Arras hanging was rather ſuited to the Crucifixes in the glaſſe window over it and other Images of Chriſt in that Chappel, then to the place or Lords Table where it hanged. The Table and Sacramental elements themſelves, with the uſual participation of them every moneth, being ſufficient to minde us of our Saviours laſt Supper, paſſion, death too, and <note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1.</note> to ſhew them forth till he come, (who uſed no ſuch Pictures nor Crucifixes, when he inſtituted his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) without any ſuch Image or Crucifix: which being condemned by our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Canons, Writers, as we have formerly evidenced, yea, by all Antiquity, by Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, and many <hi>Lutherans</hi> too, ought not to have been placed there; the rather, becauſe there is no warrant nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript for it, but only in the <note n="m" place="margin">See p. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>Roman Ceremonial,</hi> p. 69. 70. His conformity whereto was the only ground of hanging up thoſe Arras Pictures, which well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves another hanging, eſpecially in an Arch-prelate, who profeſſeth himſelf a Proteſtant, and as averſe from Popery as any man whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of Innovations in my Chappel charged againſt me, is the ſetting <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> up of a <note n="n" place="margin">Here pag. 63, 64.</note> 
                  <hi>Credentia</hi> or Side-table, my own and my Chaplaines bowing towards the Table or Altar at our approaches to it, our going in and out from the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; my Chaplains with my own uſing of Copes therein, at the celebration of the Lords Supper and ſolemn conſecrations of Biſhops, atteſted by Dr. <hi>Heywood</hi> my own Chaplain, <hi>who confeſſed, That he celebrated the Sacrament at</hi> Lambeth <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a Cope, that my other Chaplains did the like, and that he thought I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſent when they did it; that the Bread when the Sacrament was adminiſtred was firſt laid upon the</hi> Credentia, <hi>from whence he took it in his hand and then carried it too, and kneeling down upon his knee preſented it, laid it on the Lords Table, on which there were Candleſticks, and Tapers, but not burning,</hi> as he had ſeen them at <hi>White-Hall;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cordwel</hi> once my ſervant likewiſe depoſed; adding, that I was preſent ſometimes when this was done, and that my Chaplains bowed down thrice towards the Altar at their approaches to it.</p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer: Firſt, that I took my patern of the <hi>Credentia</hi> from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>Andrews</hi> Chappel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:61245:242"/>
Secondly, that this bowing towards the Altar was uſed in the Kings Chappel, and in many Cathedrals both in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> their raigns.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the uſe of Copes is preſcribed by the 24 Canon of our Church Anno 1603. which orders thus, <note n="o" place="margin">See p. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>In all Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, the Holy Communion ſhall be adminiſtred upon principal feaſt dayes, ſometimes by the Biſhop if he be preſent, and ſometimes by the Dean, ſometimes by a Canon or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary, the principal Miniſter uſing a decent Cope.</hi> This therefore is no Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>To this was retorted in general, that Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> depoſed, nor there was no ſuch <hi>Credentia,</hi> bowing towards the Table, Altar, nor <note place="margin">Reply.</note> any Cope at all uſed in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Chappel, in his predeceſſors time; therefore all theſe are meer Innovations: In particular, it was replied, that it appears not by proof Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> had any ſuch utenſels, veſtments, or bowings in his Chappel; therefore this is a meer groundleſſe evaſion: But admit he had, yet Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> Chappel was no Law, Canon, nor Patern for him to follow, againſt our Lawes; Common Prayer Book, Homilies, Injunctions, which exclude ſuch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: And if the Patern of the Chappel and its Furniture which we gave in evidence were Biſhops <hi>Andrews,</hi> as he avers; it was as groſly Popiſh and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious as the Popes, or any Popiſh Prelates Chappel whatſoever. As for the <hi>Credentia,</hi> it is directly taken out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremonial and Pontifical, as we have <note n="p" place="margin">Here p. 63.</note> proved, the onely Canons we know preſcribing it, and we finde the uſe of it only in ſome Popiſh Churches, and mentioned no wherebut in the <hi>Roman Miſſal,</hi> among the Rites of celebrating the Maſſe: Therefore it is a meer Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh utenſel, appropriated to the Maſſe and a forerunner of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This bowing to and towards the Altar, was never preſcribed by our Statutes, Articles, Homilies, Common Prayer Book, Injunctions, Canons, never practiſed by any till of late, but ſome few Popiſh Court Doctors, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedraliſts; never uſed by his Predeceſſor or his Chaplains, <note n="q" place="margin">See the <hi>Quench-cole, p.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> introduced only by Papiſts at the firſt, in honour and adoration of their Breaden God upon the Altar; and enjoyned only by the <note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>Roman Miſſal, Ceremonian,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Canoniſts,</hi> as we have largely manifeſted: Therefore not to be juſtified or excuſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Book of Common-Prayer, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (the onely Directory what veſtments, Ceremonies are to be uſed, confirmed by our Lawes) preſcribes not any of theſe; warrants not but excludes the uſe of Copes upon any occaſion: Our Homilies and writers of beſt rank condemn Copes, as Iewiſh, Popiſh, Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, enjoyned only by the <note n="ſ" place="margin">See. p. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>Roman Ceremonial,</hi> and <hi>Pontifical,</hi> as we have proved, <note n="t" place="margin">See Queen <hi>Elizabeths Injunctions,</hi> Num. 47.</note> Injunctions deeming them Popiſh: Yea the third Part of the Homily againſt the peril of Idolatry, hath this memorable paſſage concerning them, p. 72. <hi>And becauſe the whole Pageant muſt thorowly be plaid, it is not enough thus to deck Images and Idols (with gold, ſilver, rich, wanton and proud apparel, tempting their paramours to wantonneſſe) but at laſt come in the Prieſts themſelves, likewiſe decked with gold and pearls, that they may be meet ſervants for ſuch Lords and Ladies, and fit worſhippers of ſuch Gods and Goddeſſes; and with a ſolemn pace they paſſe forth before the golden Puppets, and fall down to the ground on their marrow-bones before the Honourable Idols:</hi> (and their gorgious Altars too) Therefore certainly it is impudency for him thus to introduce and juſtifie them againſt theſe Authorities. Now whereas the Archbiſhop pleads the 24 Canon, made in the yeer 1603. to warrant the uſe of Copes in his Chappel: we Anſwer firſt, That the Canon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends onely to Collegiat and Cathedral Churches, not Parochial, much leſſe to Chappels: Therefore it can no wayes warrant, but condemns this uſe of Copes in his Chappel: Secondly, it enjoyns onely the chief Miniſter to uſe a decent Cope; not a gawdy one with Images, and rich embroidring upon it, ſuch as his Copes were: Thirdly, this Canon was never binding to any, but meerly void in Law, being never confirmed by Parliament, and croſſing both the Common Prayer

Book and Homilies ratified by Parliament: Therefore all theſe his Anſwers in juſtification of theſe Innovations, diſplay his impudence to the world, in juſtifying ſuch Popiſh Reliques as theſe.</p>
               <p>The fourth kinde of Innovations charged againſt me in my Chappel are, <note n="u" place="margin">here p. 64. 65.</note> the <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>To which I give this Anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſtanding up at <hi>gloria patri,</hi> though not preſcribed by any Canon, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or Rubrick of our Church, is of great Antiquity, and hath been commonly practiſed in our Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That bowing at the name of Ieſus, is a thing preſcribed in direct termes by Queen <hi>Elizabeths Injunctions,</hi> Num. 12. and the 18 Canon of our Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Innovation nor offence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That though there were no Organs there before my time, yet they being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and generally uſed in our Church, there could be no Popery in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Conſecration of Churches, Communion Tables, Altars, Chalices, Veſtments is no fault, nor Innovation; for it is as ancient as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and have been uſed in the Church of Chriſt ever ſince his time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That ſuch Conſecrations are neceſſary, elſe the Lords Table could not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led holy, nor the Church holy, nor thoſe veſſels holy veſſels, as they uſually are: Yea, there is a Holineſſe in the Altar, as Chriſt averreth, which conſecrates the gold thereon: And the Statute of 5 and 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. againſt quarrelling and fighting in Churches, proves, that they are holy places; and they could not be holy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe firſt conſecrated: As for the form of conſecrating theſe veſſels, I took it not out of <hi>Miſſale Romanum</hi> nor the <hi>Roman Pontifical,</hi> as is objected; but from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> his Form, as learned, reverend, Orthodox Proteſtant a Prelate, as ever the Church of <hi>England</hi> bred.</p>
               <p>To this was Replied: <note place="margin">Reply.</note>
               </p>

firſt introduced the uſe of them into Chriſtian Churches, and all know they are moſt in uſe only in Popiſh Churches beyond the ſeas.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for the Antiquity and lawfulneſſe of conſecrating Churches, we have already diſcuſſed, and ſhall further reſute it in its due place; for the conſecration of Altars, Flagons, Altar-clothes, and other Altar-furniture, the only thing here objected; we have proved the original and derivation of it, to be meerly from the <hi>Roman Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Pontifical,</hi> and from no better nor higher Antiquity: He pretends, but proves not, that he took his immediate preſident from Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> a late deceaſed ſuperſtitious, if not Popiſh Prelate, how ever he applauds him: Therefore certainly from no Antiquity. But from whom did Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> take his patern? doubtleſſe from the <hi>Roman Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Pontifical,</hi> ſince no other ſampler can be produced. And are theſe a fit patern for a Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops imitation? As for his objected reaſon, that Altars, Churches, Flagons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could not be called nor reputed Holy, unleſſe thus ſolemnly conſecrated: Firſt, It is but a meer Nonſequitur, it being not any Biſhops formal unwarrantable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, but the peoples appropriation of them to a ſacred uſe that makes them holy, not inherently, but relatively only, with reference to the holy Ordinances therein adminiſtred, of which hereafter: For the Statute of 5 and 6. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 5. It hath been not one ſillable in it in juſtification of the conſecration of Churches, much leſſe of Altars, Flagons, Altar-clothes and the like; neither doth it ever ſtile the Church or Churches holy, or a holy or conſecrated place: nor could it well be ſo, in reſpect of their conſecration only, they being Hallowed onely by Popiſh Prelates in times of Popery, with ſuch Popiſh Reliques, Ceremonies, Chriſms, Exorciſms, Croſſings, and waſhings with holy water, and ſince then exploded as ſuperſtitious and ridiculous: Therefore to juſtifie theſe conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from thence, is to make a concluſion without any premiſes to warrant it. Finally, he diſcovers a rotten Popiſh ſpirit, inclination in the higheſt degree, in pleading for, and juſtifying to the utmoſt ſuch Popiſh conſecrations againſt the expreſſe reſolutions of our Orthodox <note n="b" place="margin">here p. 115. 116.</note> forecited Writers, Prelates, and his own learned predeceſſour <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> who have ſo ſeverely cenſured them as Popiſh, Iewiſh, and childiſh tryfles fit to be exploded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, having ended with my Chappel at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> they next purſued me to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> my ſtudy there.</p>
               <p>Where, firſt they <note n="c" place="margin">Pa 66, &amp;c.</note> charge me for having an Engliſh Bible with a Crucifix em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered on the Cover of it.</p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer, That I bought it not, but it was ſent unto me by a Lady, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and the Crucifix it ſelf is lawful, if there be no adoration of it; as appears by the Chriſtians engraving of it on their Chalices in <hi>Tertullians</hi> dayes.</p>
               <p>To which was replied: Firſt, that his receiving and reſerving of this Bible <note place="margin">Reply.</note> with a Crucifix on the Cover, (which was ſo viſible to his eyes, and lay upon his ſtudy Table) was as great an offence as if he had bought it: And no Lady durſt have ſent him ſuch a preſent, had ſhe not been aſſured of his good affection to ſuch Popiſh Pictures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas he avers the Picture of the Crucifix to be lawful, ſo it be not adored: He herein expreſly contradicts our <note n="d" place="margin">See here p. 59. 102. to 110.</note> Homilies, to which he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, our Statutes, Injunctions, Authors forecited, yea, the judgement of all ſound Antiquity. And if this Picture of Chriſt hanging ſtill on the Croſſe (as if he had never been taken down thence) be lawful, (as he avers with the Papiſts againſt all Orthodox Proteſtants) then it is lawful to make or reſerve it either for a meer civill uſe to grace his ſtudy, or pleaſe his eye ſight only; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is an extream diſhonour to, diſparagement of our moſt bleſſed Saviour and his paſſion, who is <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Act.</hi> 4 30.</note> the holy One of God, tranſcending all civil uſes being made for holy ends alone: or for a religious uſe, to ſtir up our devotion, and put us in remembrance of his death (which he hath purpoſely ordained his <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.</note> word and Sacraments to do) which at beſt is ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:61245:243"/>
Thirdly, the place of <hi>Tertullian</hi> (already quoted) proves not at all that the Chriſtians had any Crucifixes or Pictures of Chriſt engraven on their Chalices; there is no ſuch ſillable in his writings, but only that the Hereticks againſt whom he writ, had the Picture of a loſt ſheep engraven on ſome of their Cups. And we hope there is a vaſt difference, between Hereticks and Orthodox Chriſtians, the Picture of a loſt ſheep, and a Crucifix or Picture of Chriſt himſelf hanging on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing charged againſt me in my ſtudy, is a <hi>(g)</hi> Book of Popiſh Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures printed 1623. containing the Portratures of the Life, Paſſion, and Death of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. <hi>(q)</hi> Pa. 66, 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, that I kept it only as a Scholler, to peruſe and refute it upon occaſion, nor <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to adore or make uſe of the Pictures in it.</p>
               <p>To which was anſwered, that this Book was (as the Papiſts ſtile their Images) a meer ignorant Lay-mans, not a learned Archbiſhops Book, conſiſting meerly <note place="margin">Reply.</note> of unlawful Pictures: Therefore he had it only to view, not read.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his curious guilding of the Book and Pictures in it, argues, that he prized it more then ordinary to help him in his Devotions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he was ſo far from refuting it, that he authorized thoſe very Pictures to be reprinted in England, and bound up in our Bibles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he had many ſmall Popiſh guilded velome Pictures, curiouſly guilt inſerted into this Book; a pregnant proof he very much doted on theſe Puppets in his declining age.</p>
               <p>The third particular objected againſt me in my ſtudy, is <note n="h" place="margin">Page 66.</note> two large folio <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> Maſſe-books, and that I had noted one of them frequently with my hand: That I had likewiſe there the <hi>Roman Miſſal, Pontifical,</hi> and twenty two Popiſh hours of our Lady, Breviaries, Manuels, and Books of Popiſh devotion.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer: Firſt, that it is lawful for every learned man to have thoſe Books to peruſe and refute them, as there is occaſion, there being no great Schollers <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but have them in their ſtudies for this end; for which cauſe alone I both read and noted one of them with my own hand, not out of any love to, or approbation of the Maſſe it ſelf: And they may as aptly conclude that I am a Turk, becauſe I have the Alcoran in my ſtudy; as that I am a Papiſt or Popiſhly affected, becauſe I have the Maſſe-book. The ſame Anſwer I ſhall give to the other objected Books found in my ſtudy.</p>
               <p>The Reply hereto was: Firſt, that the meer having all or any of theſe Books <note place="margin">Reply.</note> in his ſtudy, was no convincing argument of his affection and inclination to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, no more then his keeping the Alcoran as a Schollar, proves him to be a Turk; neither was it ſo preſſed by us, ſince many Proteſtants have them in their ſtudies to peruſe, refute; which is no offence, but laudable and neceſſary in ſome caſes. But we have punctually proved all along, that he bought, peruſed, and noted them with his own hand; not by way of diſlike or refutation, but appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, yea he purſued them ſtrictly in practiſe and imitation, as far as the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Popiſh Prieſts or Prelates did at <hi>Rome</hi> in moſt particulars.</p>
               <p>Secondly, compare his having of theſe Books, with the extraordinary curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and coſtlineſſe of their binding, guilding; the Popiſh Images, Crucifixes in his ſtudy, Chappel, Gallery, and the reſt of our following evidence; and then they are a very ſtrong Argument, to prove him a profeſſed Papiſt in affection, opinion, if not in practiſe too.</p>
               <p>The laſt <note n="i" place="margin">Page 67.</note> objected thing found in my Library is, my private Prayers and Devotions written with my own hand, againſt which there are three exceptions: <note place="margin">Objection.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that ſome of theſe Prayers are extracted out of the <hi>Roman Miſſal, Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical,</hi> Breviary, and hours of our Lady.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they are digeſted into Canonical hours of prayer after the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts Model.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that I make mention of proſtration in ſome of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="472" facs="tcp:61245:244"/>
To which I return this general Anſwer: That this being only a Book for my <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> own private devotions and uſe alone, ought not to be charged againſt me. As to the objected particulars excepted againſt, I Anſwer: Firſt, that if any ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be taken out of the <hi>Miſſal, Pontifical,</hi> or <hi>Roman Breviary;</hi> yet they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and pious in themſelves, and there is no prayer to Saints or Angels in the Book: Thirdly, the Canonical hours of Prayer are of very great Antiquity in the Church: derived from holy King <hi>Davids</hi> practiſe, who ſaid <note n="k" place="margin">Pſ. i. 9. 164.</note> 
                  <hi>Seven times a day will I praiſe thee,</hi> and was taken up and practiſed by Chriſtians within two hundred years after Chriſt, and approved of in <hi>preces privatae,</hi> in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> raign: Thirdly, that proſtration in prayer is no crime, but commendable, and a ſigne of extraordinary humility; Chriſt himſelf uſing this geſture in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before his paſſion.</p>
               <p>Hereunto the Commons Councel retorted in general, That his own private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions did beſt of all ſerve to diſcover his ſecret intentions and inclinations; <note place="margin">Reply.</note> therefore they were fit to be given in evidence, for this purpoſe. In particular: Firſt, that his collecting of Prayers out of ſuch Popiſh dunghils, when there were purer mines to dig in, was a ſymptome of a Romiſh inclination. And whereas he alleageth the matter of thoſe prayers to be good; thoſe we except againſt are for their very matter meerly ſuperſtitious: Secondly, that this juſtification of the Antiquity and lawfulneſſe of Canonical hours of Prayer, was taken <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Coſens</hi> his hours of Prayer, formerly complained of in Parliament. That Canonical hours of Prayer, are no wayes warranted by <hi>Davids</hi> preſident, who ſpeaks onely of Praiſe, not Prayer, and never digeſted his Pſalms or Prayers into ſuch Canonical houers, nor any other Saint in the Old Teſtament or New: The moſt exact patern of Prayer which Chriſt himſelf left both his Diſciples and us to imitate, warrants no ſuch practiſe: nay the Primitive Chriſtians and true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity never knew of any ſuch Models of Prayer, digeſted into Canonical hours, which Popiſh monks firſt introduced, practiſed, preſcribed: Neither did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> approve of them as Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> pretends in his hours of Prayer, whence the Archbiſhop borrowed this falſe anſwer; as <note n="l" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſome who anſwered his Book by publique Authority have manifeſted to his ſhame: Thirdly, the Archbiſhop hath quite miſtaken the laſt objection; which was not his proſtration to God in Prayer, but, his proſtration <hi>coram Altare,</hi> and <hi>dum Altari adſto,</hi> in honour and reverence of his idolized Altar: So that the charge reſts ſtill upon, and ſticks faſter to him then before, by this his juſtification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From my ſtudy at <hi>Lambeth</hi> they purſued me to my Gallery there, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> where they charge <note n="m" place="margin">Page 67.</note> three Pictures againſt me; to which I return this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>That the firſt of them, which is the great one, was given me by a friend, and there can be no harm or Popery in it, being onely the Picture of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>Auguſtine, Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, which may be lawfully made and reſerved. That the two other Pictures were in the Gallery long before my time, and continued there in Archbiſhop <hi>Abbots, Bancrofts,</hi> and <hi>Whitgifts</hi> dayes; to prove which he produces Mr. <hi>Dobſon</hi> his ſervant, who affirmed, that he ſaw theſe two latter Pictures in the Gallery in Archbiſhop <hi>Bancrofts</hi> time, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever ſince; and one of them is a Picture againſt Popery, to wit, of Chriſt, going into the ſheepfold by the door, and of Popiſh Prieſts and Friers <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3.</note> clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing into it by the window, like theeves and robbers: Beſides, the Harmony of confeſſions of the reformed Churches, holds that Images are in themſelves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, ſo as no adoration be given to them; yea, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in the <note n="o" place="margin">Inſt. l. 1. c. 11. ſect. 12, 13.</note> place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, is of the ſame opinion: And I have written againſt the adoration and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious uſe of Images as fully as any man whatſoever: Therefore thoſe Pictures can be no evidence of mine intention to bring in Popery.</p>
               <p>To which was rejoyned: Firſt, that we beleeve the firſt Picture was a preſent <note place="margin">Reply.</note> ſent unto him from <hi>Rome,</hi> where the workmanſhip of it ſhews it was made; and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:61245:244"/>
therefore he did wiſely to conceal his name, who beſtowed it on him: That we did not except againſt the meer Pictures of thoſe Fathers; but againſt the Picture of the Holy Ghoſt in form of a Dove hovering over their heads, and ſending forth rayes and influences from his beak ſeverally upon each of them; directly contrary to our Statutes, Homilies, Writers, which condemn all ſuch Pictures of the Holy Ghoſt, or any other perſons of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that one of the other Pictures was a moſt abominable Idol of Chriſt newly taken down from his Croſſe all bloody, with ſhaven crown Prieſts, Friers, and Nunns, ſtanding and kneeling round about him; which kinde of Pictures by our Lawes, Homilies, Injunctions reſolutions (as we <note n="p" place="margin">Page 102. to 108.</note> have already proved) ought to be utterly demoliſhed and not ſuffered in private Houſes or Galleries, no more then in Churches or Chappels, The other was a Picture of Chriſt himſelf upon a ladder, not entring in at a door, with Monks and Friers only about him: and therefore as ſuperſtitious, Popiſh as the former, and not tolerable by our Lawes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in an Archbiſhops publique Gallary, where all ſorts of ſtrangers and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of quality were entertained; who by this example would be induced, if Proteſtants, to approve of ſuch ſuperſtitious Pictures, and to procure the like by way of imitation; If Papiſts, would be thereby hardned, confirmed in their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and in giving them adoration, eſpecially when they ſhould behold the like Superſtitious and Idolatrous Pictures, as well in his Chappel and ſtudy, as in his Gallary, where no ſuch were in his predeceſſours dayes, but only broken and defaced ones. As for his predeceſſours having or leaving theſe two laſt Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to him, it is no juſtification, nor mitigation of his crime; their ill actions are no Apology at all for his, who repaired and beautified in his Chappel thoſe very ſuperſtitious Images, which they demoliſhed, and never durſt repair.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he produceth the Harmony of confeſſions of the Proteſtants Churches, for proof of the uſe and indifferency of theſe Images, ſo as they be not adored: He cites neither Section, nor Page, nor ſentence therein to prove this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, but we muſt take it on his own bare word; which how falſe it is, we ſhall prove by the words of the Harmony it ſelf: Sect. 17. p. 401. <hi>Where the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of</hi> Helvetia, <hi>Cha.</hi> 17. <hi>determines thus. But yet notwithſtanding we muſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh men to take heed, that they count not among things indifferent; ſuch as</hi> IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEED ARE NOT INDIFFERENT, <hi>as ſome uſe to count the Maſſe,</hi> and THE USE OF IMAGES IN CHURCHES. This is the only paſſage we finde in the Harmony of confeſſions for the indifferency of Images or their uſe, which is point blank againſt him. And as for <note n="q" place="margin">Page. And ſo in his Inſt. l. 2. c. 8. ſect. 17.</note> Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> forecited Text, it is as point blank againſt him, as this of the Harmony, as we have proved. Therefore this charge lies ſtill heavy upon him in each particular, and bewrayes both his Popery and falſity in quotations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from <hi>Lambeth</hi> houſe, they next purſued me to <hi>White Hall,</hi> where theſe <note n="r" place="margin">Page. 69, 70, 71.</note> particulars were charged againſt me: Firſt, my own perſonal bowing <note place="margin">Objection.</note> to the Altar: and my enjoyning of others his Majeſties Chaplains to uſe it, when I was Dean of the Chappel: Secondly, the hanging up of a glorious large coſtly Arras Crucifix behinde the Altar, on paſſion week, in his Majeſties own Chappel there, in the yeers 1636. and 1637. which gave great ſcandal and offence, as Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi> atteſted: Thirdly, my making his Majeſties Chappel a patern of imitation to all Cathedrals and other Churches: Fourthly, the practiſe of Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> and two Seminary Prieſts, in bowing to the Altar and Crucifix there; with their ſpeech to Mrs. <hi>Charnock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe I Anſwer, that my bowing there was only to worſhip God, not the Altar, and I hope it is no offence nor treaſon to worſhip God in the Kings <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> own Chappel, or to induce others to do the like: The lawfulneſſe of this worſhip towards the Altar, I have manifeſted at large in my <note n="ſ" place="margin">Page 39. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Speech in Starchamber,</hi> and proved it by a Chapter order in the <hi>Black book of Windſor,</hi> which the Knights of the Honourable Order of the Garter yet obſerve and practiſe; therefore it is no
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:61245:245"/>
Popery, nor Popiſh Innovation, but a reverence fitting the place which the Homily for repairing and keeping clean Churches commands. And I pray God that under colour of caſting ſuperſtition out of Churches, we bring not in prophaneſſe.</p>
               <p>To the third I Anſwer, that I was not Dean of the Chappel, but Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> when this Crucifix was ſet up; that neither Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> nor any other ever complained to me, that they were ſcandalized by this Crucifix: If Sir <hi>Henry</hi> took ſcandal meerly at the Crucifix it ſelf, he muſt have taken ſcandal at that Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix in the old hangings, which ſtood continually, behinde the Altar, as well as at this which was more coſtly; which ſince he did not, it ſeems, he took ſcandal only at the workmanſhip, not at the Crucifix it ſelf, in this more coſtly peece.</p>
               <p>(To the third he gave no Anſwer.)</p>
               <p>To the fourth I Anſwer, that Dr. <hi>Browns</hi> act is nothing to me, he is old enough and muſt anſwer for himſelf: The ſame Anſwer I give to that of the Seminary Prieſts; only this I ſhall add, that perchance it might be an act of cunning in them, of purpoſe to diſcredit and diſcountenance all our external worſhip, of purpoſe to gain Proſelytes to themſelves.</p>
               <p>To which was replied: Firſt, that to worſhip God as we ought in the Kings Chappel, is no treaſon, nor offence; but this kinde of worſhipping God there or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note place="margin">Reply.</note> towards the Altar, is both <note n="t" place="margin">See the <hi>Quench cole</hi> p. 240. to 330.

And for the Homily, it hath neither word nor ſyllable to warrant it, but ſome thing againſt it, ſince as it condemns, prophanes, on the one hand, ſo it cenſures all ſuperſtition on the other; between which this Prelate would have no <hi>medium,</hi> as this his prayer imports.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Archbiſhop was chief Superintendent of his Majeſties Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>England.</hi> The King and Queen where ever they live in <hi>England,</hi> being his immediate Pariſhoners, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but his Pariſh; though devided into ſeveral Biſhopricks, as hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by all the Nobles in King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt his raign, as our Hiſtorians, and his <note place="margin">

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:61245:245"/>
together, nor juſtified it ſo peremptorily as now he did. And whereas he objects, that had Sir <hi>Henry</hi> been thus ſcandalized with the Crucifix it ſelf, he would have been as much offended with the old, there conſtantly hanging, as with the new: We Anſwer, That the old was hardly viſible and ſcarce obſerved by any; but this ſo groſſe, ſo great, ſo gaudy and notorious, that every man in the Chappel took ſpecial notice thereof, as if it had been ſome new blaſing Star. And if the old were ſo viſible all the yeer long, what need the hanging up of this new one onely in the paſſion and Eaſter weeks, which was never uſed in the memory of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? In fine the third Part of the Homily againſt the peril of Idolatry, reſolves, that the moſt rich, coſtly, gaudy Images and Crucifixes, are more dangerous and ſcandalous, then others not ſo ſtately: therefore Sir <hi>Henry</hi> might well be ſcandalized with it, more then with the old one not ſo coſtly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he gives no Anſwer to that which is one main charge from this Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the royal Chappel, to make it the patern, the Canon to regulate all Cathedral, and Pariſh Churches by. His ſilence herein bewrayes his guilt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Dr. <hi>Browns,</hi> and thoſe Seminaries adorations of this Crucifix and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, were but the meer ſcandalous fruits of his own exemplary Innovations before, and erections of them there; and their ſpeeches occaſioned by his actions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the guilt of them muſt reſt heavieſt on himſelf, not them. It is his own oft iterated poſition, <note n="z" place="margin">Relation of the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſher.</hi>
                  </note> That he who gives the occaſion of a Schiſm ought to be repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed the Schiſmatick, not he that ſeparates upon the occaſion given: And <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>De Idolatria</hi> reſolves, That the makers of Idols are the greateſt Idolaters, becauſe none would or could worſhip them, were they not firſt made that they might be worſhipped: His own hanging of up this Crucifix and bowing towards the Altar, and it was the cauſe that Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> and theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Prieſts adored and bowed towards them in the ſelf ſome manner, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there uſed: Therefore the crime, the ſcandal of it, muſt reſt moſt on himſelf. His pretence, that this might be done and ſpoken by the Prieſt, to gain Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, by diſcountenancing our external worſhip, is a very ſtrange improbable whimſey, ſince our Biſhops, our Doctors imitation of their Popiſh worſhipping Crucifixes, Altars, was more likely ten thouſand to one; to gain them Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, then any diſcountenancing whatſoever thereof by them could be; yea, it had been a monſtrous contradiction and folly in them, to diſcountenance that very thing themſelves practiſed and endeavoured to draw others to: Therefore the whole weight of this heavy charge concerning his Majeſties Chappel, reſts intirely upon him in each particular, without the leaſt diminution.</p>

               <p n="2">2. That the anointing in Form of a Croſſe was made by my Predeceſſor, not by me, who ſupplied only the place of the Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That I was commanded to bring this old Crucifix, being <hi>inter regalia,</hi> and to place it on the Altar.</p>

                  <hi>dum vertit ſtercorarium offendit gommam:</hi> And a Pearl is never the worſe if raked out of a dunghil.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I was to offer the <hi>regalia</hi> at the Altar by my place, and the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer approves of offerings.</p>
               <p>To which was Replied:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it appears by his own <hi>Diary,</hi> that he had the chief hand in compiling <note place="margin">Reply.</note> this Form, and that it was collected, corrected by himſelf, though other Biſhops were joyned in conſultation with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though the Unction were made by his Predeceſſor, which he makes not appear; yet it was principally by his direction, and himſelf makes ſpecial mention of it, That it was <hi>in medum Crucis,</hi> in the Margent of his Book.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he makes no command appear from any Supream Authority for his placing the old Crucifix on the Altar, neither doth he alleadge who it was that gave him any ſuch command: Therefore it muſt be interpreted his own volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Prayer it ſelf is not very good, ſavouring of Papal pride in the Clergy; and it is no ſuch precious Pearl, as that he needed to rake ſuch a dunghil of Popiſh ſuperſtitions as the <hi>Roman Pontifical</hi> is, to finde it out to adorn his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties royal Diadem with at his Coronation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He proves not, that it was his duty thus to offer up the <hi>regalia</hi> at the Altar, yea, the Form of the Kings Coronation found in his own ſtudy, enjoyned it not, and he pretends no command at all for it: Therefore it was his own ſpontaneous act; as for the Common Prayer Book, ſurely it preſcribes neither this, nor any other ſolemn oblation at all at an Altar: And ſo this charge remains unavoyded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> they proceed to the <note n="b" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That there were ſome old Crucifixes repaired, and divers new ones erected in divers Colledges there, ſince I became Chancellour of the Univerſity, whereas there were none before my time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Communion Tables were railed in Altarwiſe and bowed to, which they were not before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That I enjoyned all Schollers by a Univerſity Statute and Oath to give due reverence, and bow to the Communion Table, and that my Letter required bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proſtation before the Altar.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That my viſitor at <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge enjoyned the Fellows and Schollers there to bow to the Lords Table, and queſtioned Mr. <hi>Chainel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> for not bowing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That they uſed Copes in ſome Colledges, which they did not before.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That there was a very ſcandalous Statue of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with Chriſt in her Arms, ſet up in the front of the New Church porch of St. <hi>Maries</hi> next the ſtreet, to which Mr. <hi>Nixon</hi> depoſeth he ſaw one bow, and another pray.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That I enjoyned Latin Prayers all the Lent, not uſed before my Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſince the Reformation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That I enjoyned by a Statute all Regent Maſters, to reade and ſing what ſhould be preſcribed them in ſolemn Proceſſions.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no proof at all, that I knew of the repairing and ſetting up of <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> theſe Crucifixes, or that any complained of them to me. That the Crucifix in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> Colledge was ſet up by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and it would have been thought hard, if I ſhould have oppoſed it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the turning and rayling in of the Tables Altarwiſe is warranted by the Queens Injunctions, as I have proved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Statute enjoyne only due reverence when they come to offer at the Lords Table, and that my Letter implies a bowing or proſtration only, according to the 95 <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:61245:246"/>
4. That Sir <hi>John Lamb</hi> only queſtioned Maſter <hi>Chainel,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Corbet,</hi> which is nothing to me; and Doctor <hi>Frewens</hi> words are but a hear-ſay, beſides, they were not puniſhed for not doing it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Copes are warrantable by the 24 Canon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Statue at St. <hi>Maries</hi> was ſet up by Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> reputed a reverend Orthodox Divine, not by me, nor is there any proof I had notice of it, or of any bowing or praying to it, which might be a miſtake in Alderman <hi>Nixon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. That Latin prayers have been anciently uſed in the Univerſity on <hi>Aſhwedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and being among Schollers who underſtand the Language, there can be no hurt therein.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That no Proceſſions are intended in the Statute, but ſuch as our Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in nature of perambulations, the Statutes of the Univerſity preſcribing, That nothing ſhall be done therein but according to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. For the Innovations of like nature in the Vniverſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> they concern me not, I being not their Chancellor, and not enjoyning them, nor made acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>Whereunto was Replied:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all thoſe Crucifixes were erected at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſince he became Chancellor <note place="margin">Reply.</note> of it: That his own example in his Chappels at <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Croyden,</hi> where he repaired the old broken Crucifixes at his own coſt, were the primary occaſions of ſetting up thoſe in <hi>Oxford,</hi> by way of imitation. That he could not chooſe but take notice of them being himſelf ſeveral times at <hi>Oxford</hi> in perſon, where he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the King, Queen, Prince, and Prince Elector, ſundry dayes: Beſides, having conſtant weekly intelligence by Letters, and recourſe of Schollers of all ſorts to him from the Univerſity, who acquainted him with all particulars there tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, he could not but take notice, and have exact knowledge of them: And he being both Chancellor and Viſitor of the Univerſity, his not hindring of their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up at firſt, not pulling them down, when ſet up contrary to our Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, was in Law both a commanding and approving of them. <hi>Nam qui non prohibet malum quod poteſt, jubet.</hi> That none complained to him of them, was his own fault; ſince none durſt complain againſt that then, as a crime, which himſelf firſt practiſed in his own Chappels, as a commendable action. His Anſwer to the Crucifix erected in <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledge proves clearly he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; and truly it could not have been well taken at his hands to pull that down according to Law, unleſſe he had pulled them down firſt in other Colledges, and his own Chappel, the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> perchance ſetting it up, onely to humour his Grace, and manifeſt to the world, he was but his Ape in this particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have already refuted his ſecond Anſwer as falſe, and therefore ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat nothing here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this due reverence, was interpreted by himſelf in his Speech in <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,</hi> to be a bowing to the Altar or Lords Table: For (ſaith he) THERE IS A REVERENCE DUE TO IT: Namely, of bowing the body, not onely towards, but to the Altar, <hi>DEO ET ALT ARI EJ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> in the <hi>dative caſe,</hi> and proſtration, not ſimply to God, but <hi>CORAM ALT ARE DEI &amp; Chriſti ejus,</hi> is preſcribed by his Letter, as much worſhip as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel himſelf required of our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Si adoraveris CORAM ME;</hi> as the vulgar Latin, or fall down BEFORE ME, as the Margin of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bibles render it; whereas the 95 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> requires no worſhipping and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down thus before an Altar, but before the Lord our Maker only, without any mention of an Altar or Lords Table in the <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. His Viſitors act in queſtioning thoſe Fellows for not bowing, was his own, and muſt concern him, ſince he did it only in his name and right by his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in purſuit of his Injunctions: and Dr. <hi>Frewens</hi> words are expreſſe, that the Archbiſhop ſent him to Maſter <hi>Corbet,</hi> when Proctor, requiring and preſſing him in
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:61245:247"/>
his name to bow to the Altar in regard of his place, elſe it would be ill taken. And though theſe fellows were not puniſhed nor ſuſpended for not bowing, yet they were often queſtioned, menaced, forced to obſcure themſelves, and deſert the Colledge for a time, and had not the Scottiſh Troubles intervened, would have been ſeverely puniſhed too.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Copes in Colledges, are neither within the words nor meaning of the 24 Canon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Neither the Church-porch, nor ſtatue at St. <hi>Maries</hi> being the Univerſity Church, could or would have been erected there by Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> without the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops ſpecial licence being Chancellour, and ſupream Viſitor there, as Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, as himſelf both pretended, pleaded; and he muſt needs not only hear of, but ſee it too, when he was in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Therefore the blame thereof muſt be his alone: As for the bowing and praying to it, Mr. <hi>Nixon</hi> ſwears it directly, and was not miſtaken, as he would ſurmiſe to excuſe the odiouſneſſe of this new erected <hi>Oxford</hi> Idol, which gave ſuch publike ſcandal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Its true that Latin Prayers on <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi> onely, were formerly uſed in <hi>Oxford</hi> before the Batchellors of Art, but he enjoyned ſuch Prayers all the Lent long in ſtead of Engliſh, which was never done before, to uſher in Latin Service by degrees in an unknown tongue, divers Townſmen reſorting to the Engliſh Prayers in Lent, who could not underſtand theſe new Latin ones which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Statute enjoyning reading and chanting in ſolemn Proceſſions, was made in time of Popery, and Popiſh proceſſions, and renewed in theſe New Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made by this Archbiſhop. Therefore certainly meant of ſuch proceſſions not of perambulations only, which are not uſed by the Univerſity: And the objected ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Statute, is but a blinde to delude the ſimple for the preſent; the Doctrine and Diſcipline of our Church (in the Vniverſities judgement) being only written in his breſt, <note n="c" place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford, p.</hi> 183.</note> 
                  <hi>quo rectior non ſtat regula, quo prior eſt corrigenda Religio,</hi> as they write unto him in their Letter of <hi>November</hi> 9. 1640. the laſt recorded in their Regiſter.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whereas he would aſſoil himſelf from the Popiſh Innovations in <hi>Cambridge</hi> Vniverſity, the guilt of them muſt originally reſt on him alone, for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were introduced by his inſtruments, favourites, creatures there advanced by him: as Dr. <hi>Martin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Coſens,</hi> Dr. <hi>Beal,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lany,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Introduced in imitation of thoſe Crucifixes, Images, Copes, Altar-furniture, Genuflexions, which himſelf had introduced at <hi>Lambeth</hi> Chappel, to which they were ſubſequent, not antecedent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe though he was not Chancellor, yet he pretended to be Viſitor of this Vniverſity, and that of <hi>Oxford</hi> too, as he was Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a ſolemn Decree and Patent for it, to himſelf and his ſucceſſors: Therefore ſince he did not prohibit, correct, ſuppreſſe them as Viſitor, according to Law and duty, they will prove his proper Innovations; the rather becauſe he permitted, countenanced, nay enjoyned the like at <hi>Oxford</hi> by new Statutes, where he was both Viſitor and Chancellor, which was never done in <hi>Cambridge:</hi> That he ſhould have no notice of thoſe Popiſh Innovations there, which were ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all the Kingdom, ſo publikely ſpoken of in every place, when as he had conſtant weekly intelligence from thence (as appears by ſundry Letters) of all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions there, and was ſo converſant with the chief Authors of them, is not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, but impoſſible: Therefore he ſtill lyes under the guilt of this intire charge concerning the Popiſh Innovations in our Vniverſities.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, from the Vniverſities, I was next traced to Cathedrals, and Collegiat Churches, where I am charged with introducing, enjoyning ſundry Innovations <note place="margin">

                  <item>4. Bowing to and towards the Altar and Lords Table, which I enjoyned to ſundry Cathedrals by new Statutes, as namely to the Cathedraliſts of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bletchenden</hi> depoſed) and divers others.</item>
                  <item>5. Crucifixes and Images.</item>
                  <item>6. Candleſticks, Baſons, Altar-clothes, with other Altar Ornaments; and they inſtanced in ſundry particular Cathedrals, as <hi>Canterbury, Glonceſter, Durham, Wincheſter, Chicheſter, Hereford, Worceſter;</hi> where theſe Innovations were introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by my Injunctions and new Statutes, to make way for them in Pariſh Churches, who muſt imitate theſe their Mother Churches.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe I Anſwer, that the uſe of Copes in Cathedral and Collegiat Churches, is enjoyned by the 24 Canon made in Convocation, An. 1603. therefore <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it was lawful, and no Popiſh Innovation for me to enjoyn them, as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, that Altars, both the name and thing, were in uſe among the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians and Churches, who were far from Popery, and long before it; yea, are found both in the Old and New Teſtament; as divers learned men have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved.</p>
               <p>To the third, that my Injunctions for rayling in of Altars, and Lords Tables Altarwiſe, with the ſides againſt the Eaſt wall of the Quire, is conſonant to the Queens Injunctions, to the practiſe of approved Antiquity, all Altars and Lords Tables being generally ſo placed in Churches in ancient times, both in this and other Churches of Chriſtendom, as well Eaſt as Weſt; and that there is no matter of Popery in placing and rayling in Lords Tables in this manner, as I have proved at large in my printed Speech in <hi>Starchamber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fourth, that I did in the very Statutes for the Cathedral-church of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and others, enjoyn the Prebends and Members of the Cathedral, <note n="e" place="margin">P. 52. to 63</note> 
                  <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma reverentia adorare Deum verſus Altare;</hi> which bowing to worſhip God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Altar,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Bletchenden</hi> atteſted upon oath, was uſed before the new Statutes of <hi>Canterbury</hi> were made, yea, approved, practiſed by Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as readily as by any other Prebends, who hath given a greater teſtimony againſt himſelf, then me: After which he produced his Secretary Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie without oath, that in the peruſal of the old Statutes for the Cathedral of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> divers ſuperſtitions were put out by the Archbiſhop, and by name, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the ſoul of King Henry the 8. after his deceaſe. Then he concluded his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thus, That the 95 <hi>Pſalm</hi> did command this kinde of bowing at our entrance into the Church, and that the Knights of the Honourable <hi>Order of the Garter</hi> were bound by a <hi>Chapter-Order,</hi> to bow to God towards the Altar, when they offered at it in their ſolemnities, and did ſtill practiſe it without guilt or ſuſpition of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: Therefore himſelf might uſe, enjoyn, and others practiſe it, without any guilt of Popery at all, as well as they.</p>
               <p>To the fifth, that Crucifixes and Images were not ſimply unlawful, being uſed in the Kings own Chappel: That Images in Churches had been long in uſe, even in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great his Raign, and long before; therefore no Popery could be couched in them.</p>
               <p>To the ſixth, that thoſe are no other then what the King uſed in his own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had been long time uſed in the Church for greater Ornament, luſtre, it being a diſparagement to our Religion, to have God ſerved ſlovenly and meanly, as many deſired he ſhould be, under pretence of ſhunning ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>To this was Replyed:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That neither our Common Prayer Book, nor Book of Ordination, nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies <note place="margin">Reply.</note> confirmed by Parliament (the only Canons in force to direct us) nor Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Injunctions in the firſt year of Her Raign, enjoyn any Copes in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals, more then in other Churches, but condemn, ſeclude them alike out of all our Churches, and that the laſt Common Prayer Book in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:61245:248"/>
expreſly prohibits them: Therefore the 24 Canon (which was never any binding Law confirmed by Parliament, and expired with King <hi>Iames,</hi> if not before) can be no warrant for their uſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the 24 Canon, enjoyns onely the chief Miniſter to wear a Cope, and that but at the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, not at any other ſeaſon: But the Archbiſhop contrary to the Canon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Cathedrals to provide divers Copes, at leaſt four a peece, and preſcribed them to be worn, as well when the Sacrament was not adminiſtred, as when it was, and that by others, beſide the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: Therefore he exceeded the Canon it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. None of his Predeceſſors in their viſitation Articles, or Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ever preſcribed, exacted the providing or wearing of Copes in Cathedrals, but himſelf alone, and in many Cathedrals they had never any Copes at all, in others but mean ones, as appears by the Abſtract of his viſitation, under his viſitors hand, found in his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet notwithſtanding he enjoyned the providing of new, better and coſtlier Copes to their great coſt, in imitation of the <hi>Roman Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,</hi> that ſo they might be like Romiſh Cathedrals in forraign parts. This allegation therefore of his will not excuſe him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we grant, that the name of Altars, together with the thing, are frequent in the Old Teſtament, to offer Sacrifices and burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings upon, which were but <note n="*" place="margin">

Therefore the Archbiſhops bold aſſertion, that the Scriptures, Fathers, and primitive, Chriſtians practiſe, <hi>Iuſtifie</hi> both the <hi>Antiquity uſe and lawfullneſſe of Altars, is a moſt groſſe untruth,</hi> though averred by his Creatures Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> &amp; Dr. <hi>Pocklington</hi> in their late Popiſh Bookes publiſhed by his direction. As for our Church, ſtate in the beginning of Reformation, they were ſo far from allowing Altars, that they <note n="g" place="margin">See the Quench Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Thirdly, The Rayling in and placing of <hi>Communion Tables Altarwiſe</hi> againſt the <hi>VVall,</hi> like a <hi>Dreſſer,</hi> or ſide Table is not conſonant to Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Injunctions, which require the Communion Table (not to be fixed to the Wall or rayled in cloſe priſoner againſt it; but) <hi>to be removed, when ever the Sacrament as distributed, and placed in ſuch ſort within the Chancel, as whereby the Minister may be more conveniently board of the communicants in his prayer and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; the communicants may more conveniently, &amp; in greater number communicate with him.</hi> If then it were to be thus removed and placed conveniently from time to time, then not to be conſtantly fixed, impounded Altarwiſe againſt the Eaſt Wall of the Quire, remoteſt from the people: but ſeated in <hi>the Body of the Church</hi> (where the Chancell is too ſmall or inconvenient) or in the Chancell (where it is capacious) neare the midſt, as the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Common prayer Booke; and the 82. <hi>Canon Anno</hi> 1603. determine.</p>
               <p>But the Archbiſhop objects, that the <hi>Injunctions</hi> preſcribe the Communion <note place="margin">Objection.</note> Table in every Church <hi>ſhall be ſet in the place where the Altar ſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True; <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Altar</hi> (in every Church) <hi>ſtood at the upper end of the Quire, North and South, as appeares by the practiſe of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we deny as moſt falſe: Therefore his concluſion from the Injunction; <note place="margin">Anſwer:</note> 
                  <hi>That the Table in all Churches ought thus to be placed North and South, at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the Quire,</hi> is a meer inconſequent. To refute this groſſe dotage of his, and diſplay his learned ſuperſtitious Ignorance to the world, leaſt any ſhould be deluded with a fond opinion of his great learning, we confidently affirme, that he neither doth nor can produce ſo much as one Preſident or Authority in all Antiquity, but only his owne groundleſſe confidence, to juſtifie his aſſertion. On the contrary we ſhall offer ſome few punctuall arguments, preſidents, Authorities undeniably manifeſting, that <hi>Altars and Lords Tables anciently, not only among Pagans and Iewes but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Fulke</hi> informes us, <hi>That the Altar uſually ſtood in the</hi> MIDEST <hi>of the Church, wherof ſome ſymptomes remain in our Cathedrall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

               <p>Now whereas hee Objects, that <hi>there can bee no Popery in placing Communion Tables Altarwiſe,</hi> we anſwer, that if we conſider this ſituation of them ſimply in it ſelfe, perchance it may be true. But if we obſerve that Prieſts private Maſſes, brought in this ſituation of Altars firſt of all into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the end of this new placing of them is, to turne our Lords Tables into Altars, to imitate the Papiſts, and make way for private Maſſes, as all other concurrent circumſtances manifeſt, then it favours of <note n="x" place="margin">See the Quenchcole p. 201. to 208</note> 
                  <hi>Popery in the higheſt degree.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we ſhall obſerve the Archbiſhops jugling and falſhood in this particular. In his <hi>Speech in Starchamber</hi> he averreth. pag. 53. 14. <hi>And yet here is nothing done either by violence, or command, to take off the Indifferency of the ſtanding of the holy Table, either way, but onely by laying it fairely before men how fit it is there ſhould be Order and uniformity.</hi> And yet we have proved, that hee by his ſpecial <hi>Jnjunctions</hi> under Seale, and by private Letters to his Vicar General, enjoyned all Lords Tables to be placed and rayled in Altarwiſe; yea excommunicated, cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, fined in the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> ſuch Miniſters and Church-Wards as oppoſed or refuſed to obey his Injunctions herein, as the Caſes of Maſter <hi>Chancy,</hi> the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> of <hi>Beckington, John Premly, Ferdinando Adams,</hi> and others evidence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We reply, that the Archbiſhop in his <hi>Starchamber-speech, p.</hi> 45. 46. makes this averment, <hi>And yet the Government is ſo moderate [God grant it be not too looſe the while] that</hi> NO MAN IS CONSTRAINED, NO MAN QUESTIONED, <hi>only religiouſly called upon,</hi> venite, Adoremus, <hi>Come let us Worſhip;</hi> that is, bow to, and toward the Altar: Yet here we have himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, and others teſtifying upon Oath, that he enjoyned all Schollers in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> all Officers, Prebends in Cathedrall and Collegiat Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by ſpeciall Statutes [to which they were all compelled to ſweare Obedience
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:61245:251"/>
and Conformity] <hi>to worſhip God with higheſt Reverence towards the Altar,</hi> to bow devoutly to, towards it at, their approaches thereunto, which none were ever thus ſtrictly obliged to do by ſpeciall Lawes and Oathes in the very darkeſt times of Popery. That Doctor <hi>Jackson</hi> did approve, practiſe this bowing to the Altar for a time, it was by force only of theſe new Statutes and Oath, as himſelfe depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, for which he profeſſeth his hearty ſorrow: and whereas Doctor <hi>Blechenden</hi> ſweares, that ſome <hi>Prebends</hi> uſed to bow before theſe new Statutes, it was only by reaſon of this Archbiſhops Injunctions and daily practiſe both at Court and in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Chappell. For his expunging of the prayer for <hi>King Henry the</hi> 8. <hi>after his death,</hi> out of theſe Statutes, it no way juſtifies nor extenuates his Injunction of ſuch Popiſh Altar-Adorations. For the 95. <hi>Pſa.</hi> it commands us only, <hi>to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker;</hi> not towards or before an Altar, which is not <hi>the Lord our Maker:</hi> Neither did the Archbiſhop himſelfe, not the moſt ſuperſtitious Popiſh Prelate or Clergie man in <hi>England</hi> ever yet uſe to Worſhip and fall down to God, before or towards the Altar, juſt when this <hi>Venite, Adoromus</hi> was read; which requiring no ſuch Worſhip at the very inſtant it is reading, much leſſe exacts it after or before its reading. For the Knights of the <hi>Garters</hi> Chapter-Order made in times of Popery, in imitation of Popiſh Prieſts, it is no binding Law to any but thoſe of that Order, in their ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which being meerely Civill, and if it bee <hi>Deo &amp; Altars ejus,</hi> joyntly; then certainely ſuperſtitious, Popiſh, nay Idolatrous too, cannot be fit for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, We reply, that theſe Crucifixes, Images being unlawfull to be made. condemned by Our <hi>Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Writers, Church,</hi> and all <hi>ſound Antiquity,</hi> as wee <note n="y" place="margin">

And here we cannot but obſerve the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops Legerdemain, and groſſe abuſe of his Majeſties Chappell.</p>
               <p>Firſt, himſelfe introduced Crucifixes with other Popiſh Innovations into it, which he afterwards by way of imitation preſcribed to Cathedralls; And then being charged with this practiſe in Cathedralls, he juſtifies himſelfe by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Chapell, where he takes Sanctuary; juſt as if a Cutpurſe ſhould juſtifie the cutting of a mans purſe in Pauls Cathedrall becauſe hee formerly picked ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans pocket in <hi>Whit-Hall Chapell,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but to wipe off the preſent charge by the next preceeding, which lyes ſo heavy upon him, and to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify this ſubſeouent crime of his by another anteceeding it.

               <p>To the firſt, I anſwer in Generall, that this removing and placing Lords Tables <note place="margin">ANSWER.</note> Altarwiſe, is warranted by the <hi>Queens Injunctions,</hi> as I have formerly evidenced: As for the caſe of Saint <hi>Gregories,</hi> the Table was not turned by mee, <hi>but by the Deane and Chapter of Paules:</hi> And when it came to the Councell Table, I did there only deliver my opinion, and oppoſe the <hi>Queens Injunctions</hi> againſt <hi>Biſhop Jewels</hi> opinion and Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> there preſſed: and the Order made therein, was made by the King and Councell then preſent, not by me alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I preſſed none to come up to receive at the Rayles, no further then the Common Prayer Booke preſcribes, which enjoynes the people <hi>to draw weare and take the Holy Sacrament for their comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3ly. Reading Second ſervice at the Lords table is no Innovation, it hath bin ever ſince my rememberance conſtantly practiſed in Cathedralls, and is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Rubrick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4ly. I gave no order for ſetting up Images or Pictures in any pariſh Church; nor yet in the new Chappell at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> ſweares, it was Dr. <hi>Nowel</hi> that directed and paid him for his work there, not I.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Iohn Premly</hi> his proſecution was the Act of Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> and it was for an high contempt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, For Mr. <hi>Sherfield,</hi> he was cenſured by the Major voyce of the Court, not by me alone: and Mr. <hi>Caryll</hi> depoſed that the Picture he brake was only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the Picture of God the Father; not that it was ſo: But admit it were, yet it was not lawfull for him of his owne Authority to pull it downe and break it, no not though it had bin the Picture of <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe; This I did then affirme, for which I had the Authority of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Davenant.</hi> Yea in Conſtantine the Great his time, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes in the third Booke <hi>De vita Conſtantini</hi> c. 52. 53. 54. <hi>No priuate Chriſtians of their owne heads durſt deſtroy the Jdols that were then worſhipped, nor the temple of</hi> Aeſculapius, <hi>wherein the Divel himſelfe was adored, til</hi> Conſtantine <hi>the Emperour gave expreſſe command, and appointed certaine men, whom he particularly imployed, to demoliſh them.</hi> It is true he pleaded, that he demoliſhed it by the Authority of the <hi>Veſtry;</hi> but the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry had no authority themſelves to do it, therefore they could not derive it unto him. But it was Idolized and adored by ſome. True, but this appeared not till the hearing of the cauſe, and was unknowne before.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, The purging out of a Paſſage againſt Images in Dr. <hi>Featlyes</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons taken out of our Homilies; was no act of mine, but my Chaplaines, who muſt anſwer for it, yet there are other paſſages therein left which are ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough againſt Images and their adoration: And Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> never complained hereofto mee.</p>
               <p>Eightly, The Bibles wherein theſe Pictures are ſhewed were Secretary <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debanks</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ducks</hi> which is nothing to me: yea one of them is a Latine Bible printed beyond the ſeas, at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a place free from ſuperſtition, not here Indeed I firſt ſaw one of theſe Bibles in Miſtreſſe <hi>Kirkes</hi> hands, whereupon I ſent for one of them my ſelfe, and then acquainted the Lords of the Councell with it, who reſolved they ſhould not be ſold publickly, nor laid upon ſtalls, for feare of giving ſcandall, but privatly; whereupon I told Mr. <hi>Wally</hi> as much, which he hath teſtified, But yet this is no Innovation, for the old Engliſh prin-Bibells are full of Pictures.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Mr. <hi>Workman</hi> was juſtly ſuſpected for inconformity; he was cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for other things, as well as for paſſages againſt Images, as appeares by his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, As firſt for his words againſt <hi>Dancing.</hi> 2ly. For ſaying <hi>Images in Churches were Idolls</hi> (though they are not Idolls till they are worſhipped) <hi>and that they were no better then ſtewes;</hi> an unfitting expreſſion. 3ly. For ſaying that Drunkards were preferred. 4ly. That the <hi>Election of Miniſters was in the People.</hi> 5ly. For <hi>praying for the King of</hi> Sweden <hi>before our King.</hi> 6ly.

                  </gap> a peece, and that was pardoned: As for Mr. <hi>Workman</hi> himſelfe being put from his Miniſtry by ſentence, he was unfit to teach Schoole, or practiſe Phiſick, for of leavening others with his dangerous opinions.</p>
               <p>10ly. For Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Baſtwick</hi> I anſwer, 1. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt them in Starchamber was in a legall way, for ſeditious Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall and libellous Books. 2ly. That the rejecting of their anſwers under their owne hands and taking them <hi>pro confeſſo</hi> was no act of mine, but of the whole Court. 3ly. That the expunging of Mr. <hi>Burtons</hi> Anſwer, was not done by mee, but by the two <hi>chiefe Iuſtices,</hi> to whom it was referred by the Court, who muſt anſwer for it if unjuſt, and that the Copy of his anſwer found in my Study in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlined
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:61245:253"/>
with black-lead, ſo far as it ſhould ſtand, was not interſined by me. 4ly. J gave no ſentence againſt them at all, but only Iuſtified my ſelfe and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt their calumnies. But it hath bin objected, that Mr. <hi>Cockeſhut</hi> gave an accompt of the proceedings againſt them to me from time to time: therefore I was the cauſe thereof. I confeſſe he gave me ſuch an account, and it was juſt and fit he ſhould do it, becauſe the cauſe concerned not only myſelfe in ſome ſort in particular, but the Church of <hi>England</hi> in generall, of which I ought to take care according as my place and duty required: But I was no cauſe of any irregular proceedings: Yea, but <hi>I gave thankes to the Lords in the cloſe of my Speech for their ſentence and Iustice on them,</hi> though I cenſured them not my ſelfe: True and it was no more then I ought to do in behalfe of the Church: But yet after the ſentence given in my <hi>Epiſtle to his Majeſty,</hi> I excited him to put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. No, I only left it to his Majeſties conſideration to forbeare or execute it, as he in his juſtice and wiſdome ſhould deeme meet.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed, 1. in generall; that the Archbiſhop in his ſpeech in Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, p. 53. hath this expreſsion concerning rayling in Communion Tables Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarwiſe <note place="margin">Reply</note> in pariſh Churches: <hi>And though it ſtood in moſt Pariſh Churches the other way yet whither there be not more reaſon the Pariſh ſhould be made conformable to the Cathedrall and Mother Churches, then the Cathedralls to them, I leave to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man to judge.</hi> So as his Innovations begun in Cathedralls, were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely introduced there firſt of all, to draw on Pariſh Churches to Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with them in theſe Innovations. Next, in particular we reply: that the alteration of the ſtanding of the Lords Table and rayling it in Altarwiſe, was no wayes warranted by the <hi>Queens Injunctions,</hi> but contrary to them, as wee have largely manifeſted. That though this was not done immediately by himſelfe, but by the Deane and Chapter of <hi>Paules,</hi> yet he was the Originall author of it, and juſtified it when complained of. That he publikely checked the Councell, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners and ſir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> before the King and Lords for oppoſing this Innovation, and alleadging Biſhop <hi>Iewill</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> againſt it: deſiring his Majeſty to take theſe Bookes out of the Church, if they made no better uſe of them then to oppoſe this Novelty. That he carried himſelfe more like an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate then Judge in this Cauſe, and when the King himſelfe was ſatisfied and would have it ſtand as formerly, his violence was ſuch, that he over-ruled both King and Councell, and drew up the Order forecited in their names for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing this Innovation which favours of his ſtile and ſpirit, the guilt whereof muſt reſt principally on him.</p>
               <p>2ly. The comming up to the Rayles was preſſed by his Viſitors, Agents au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and thoſe excommunicated who refuſed to come up and receive at the New Rayle; to which certainly it was never the minde of the Common Prayer Book the Communicants ſhould draw neare, ſince there were no Rayles to draw neare and kneele at till this Archbiſhop enjoyned them to be ſet up, in imitation of the Papiſts, as we have proved: but this drawing neare, is rather a drawing neare to Chriſt by faith, with our hearts and affections, or elſe a drawing neare to the body of the Church of Chancell where the Lords Table is to be placed, &amp; to the Miniſter officiating, as it is expounded by the <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Table when the holy Communion ſhal be adminiſtred ſhal be placed in ſo good ſort within the Church or Chancel, as thereby the Miniſter may be more conveniently heard of the Communicants in his prayer and adminiſtration, and the Communicants alſo may more conveniently, and in more number communicate with the Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3ly. We anſwer, that the Lords Table was ordained only to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <note n="a" place="margin">

ſecond ſervice now to bee read at the Lords Table when there was no Communion, and where it was rayled in at the upper end of the Quite, not brought downe into the <hi>body of the Church or Chancell;</hi> contrary to the <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the Common Prayer Booke, which expreſly determines: <hi>That the Epiſtle and Goſpel</hi> (chiefe parts of this ſecond ſervice) <hi>ſhall be read where the two Leſſons are, with a loud voice, that the people may heare the Minister that readeth them the Miniſter standing and turning himſelfe, as he may best be heard of ALL ſuch as be preſent</hi> (which he cannot be if he read them at the upper end of the Chancell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the people, where the Churches are great, or the Miniſters voyce low.] This innovation then which was never practiſed in any Pariſh Church till of late, though uſed in ſome Cathedralls, wherein <hi>the Rubrick</hi> enjoynes <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion every Sunday in the yeare at leaſt to be adminiſtred;</hi> which was wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the ſecond ſervice at the Table left to ſupply it) is directly contrary to the <hi>Rubricke,</hi> Homilies, Injunctions, Canon.</p>
               <p>4ly. It is evident that Crucifixes were ſet up in many Pariſh Churches, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells of the Kingdome, which though we cannot prove to be done by his expreſſe particular Command; yet certainly it was by his example or incouragement, who repaired and ſet up Crucifixes in his owne Chappells at <hi>Lambeth, Croyden,</hi> and one over the Altar in Paſſion week in the Kings owne Chappell at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> Beſides, thoſe who erected them were either his owne Chaplaines or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verites who knew his minde, and did it for to imitate and pleaſe his Grace to gaine ſome further preferments.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Images</hi> ſet up in the New <hi>b Chappell</hi> in Tuttle fields, we <hi>[b]</hi> have proved, that the <hi>Arch-biſhop promiſed to bestow a new Window on it: that thereupon the old</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 93.</note> 
                  <hi>was taken downe, the Kings Armes removed, and thoſe Images, with the Archbiſhops owne Armes</hi> (as the Donor of it) <hi>ſet up:</hi> that his <hi>Chaplaine gave directions about the VVindow: and Mr. Sutton</hi> ſweares that <hi>the money for new glaſing it was paid ſince the Archbiſhops commitment to the Tower by his direction, as he believeth.</hi> A cleare evidence, that he was the Author and director of this worke, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his ſhifts to elude it.</p>
               <p>5ly. Though the Archbiſhop made not theſe Biſhops <hi>Viſitation Oathes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;</hi> yet he made all of them Biſhops, who durſt do nothing in their Dioceſſe or Viſitations but by his direction; to whom they gave an <hi>Annuall Accompt</hi> of their proceedings in writing, as we have manifeſted. Beſides, its apparent that all theſe <hi>Viſitation Articles</hi> were made in purſuance of his owne Archiepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall <hi>Injunctions, Inſtructions,</hi> and himſelfe approved of theſe their Oathes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, never checking nor queſtioning them for them, though their <hi>Metropolitan:</hi> yea himſelfe preſcribed the ſelfe ſame things in his Metropoliticall Viſitations, by printed <hi>Articles,</hi> written <hi>Injunctions,</hi> or private <hi>Jnſtructions,</hi> as theſe Biſhops did in imitation of him. Therefore hee muſt Anſwer for theſe their Articles, Oathes, proceedings as farre forth as they, who were but his Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Sixtly For his Anſwer to the particular Caſes, wee ſhall returne theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though Mr. <hi>Smart</hi> was cenſured by the <hi>High Commiſſion at Yorke,</hi> yet he was firſt impriſoned here at <hi>London,</hi> and tranſmitted from the <hi>High Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> here to <hi>York</hi> by this Archbiſhops meanes; who complyed with Dr. <hi>Coſin</hi> in his proſecution, and diſpoſed of his livings after his deprivation, as we can prove by ſundry Letters found in his Study; As for Mr. <hi>Smarts</hi> Sermon, it was neither ſcandalous nor factions, but Orthodox, and Iuditious, againſt the Popiſh <hi>Jnno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> introduced in the Cathedrall of <hi>Durham,</hi> where he was the ancienteſt Prehend, deſerving rather applauſe then any cenſure, as both Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have reſolved upon a full hearing, and awarded him reparations and Damages for his unjuſt cenſure.</p>
               <p>2ly. Mr. <hi>Chancy</hi> ſpake no contemptuous words at all againſt the Rayle, nor of ſetting it up in his Garden: His ſuſpention was illegall, not only without, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:61245:254"/>
Law and Canon; As for his ſubmiſſion, it was forced, and a meere art to deterre others from oppoſing his Graces Popiſh Innovaſions, the only proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor appearing againſt him. And his ſhaking up or menacing of his advocate, an unlawfull act, to diſcourage him from making any defence, and ſubject his Client to a cenſure. Therefore inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>3ly. The main Article againſt Mr. <hi>Burkit,</hi> was only for his and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens removing of the Table when the Sacrament was adminiſtred into the body of the Church without the rayles, according to the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi> Injunctions, and the 28. <hi>Canon,</hi> the other Articles being but frivilous, not inſiſted on: And for this he was moleſted in the High Commiſſion, yea a <hi>traditio Satana,</hi> a turning over of him to Sir <hi>John Lamb</hi> pronounced againſt him, who uſed him like a Lyon a Wolfe in a Lambes Skin.</p>
               <p>4ly. For the Churchwardens of <hi>Beckingtons</hi> moſt ſevere, illegall, harbarous proſecution, we have proved by the depoſition of Mr. <hi>Iohn Aſh,</hi> a Member of the Commons Houſe, that the Archbiſhop himſelfe ſince his Impriſonment in the Tower confeſſed, that Biſhop <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>5ly. For <hi>Ferdinando Adams,</hi> he was excommunicated in the Archbiſhops name by Mr. <hi>Dade</hi> his Surrogate, and this Excommunication pleaded in Barre of his Bill in Starchamber. The proceſſe, Purſivants ſent out to apprehend him, and the impriſonment of his Attorney till he withdrew his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, were all by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops procurement. His ſhutting Biſhop <hi>VVrens</hi> Viſitors out of the Church at <hi>Jpſmich unleſſe they derived their Authority by Letters Patens, from the King,</hi> was warranted by the Statut of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. Therefore his proſecution, only for his duty and allegeance to the King againſt the Biſhops diſloyall incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was moſt unjuſt and diſloyall. 6ly. <hi>Iohn Premly,</hi> was not proſecuted by Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent,</hi> but by the Archbiſhop himſelfe, for oppoſing his order in the <hi>Metropoliticall Viſitation,</hi> in removing the Lords Table placed Altarwiſe, to the place and poſture wherein it formerly ſtood; for which he was fined, cenſured, impriſoned in the High Commiſſion, where the Archbiſhop ſate chiefe Iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Law and Iuſtice, his act being no contempt, nor offence in Law; but the Archbiſhops order by Sir <hi>Nathaniell Brent</hi> his Viſitor, and Dr. <hi>Nevells</hi> act, a contempt againſt Law and Canon.</p>
               <p>7ly. Mr. <hi>Sherfield</hi> was proſecuted principally by the Archbiſhops procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for demoliſhing according to Law: an Idolatrous blaſphemous, falſe Image of God the Father, which was openly Idolized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee was then a Juſtice of Peace, Recorder of Sarum, and had the Warrant of the whole Veſtry (wherein were ſix or ſeaven Iuſtices of Peace at that time) to demoliſh this Image, and take downe the whole Window, which all the <hi>Kings Subjects,</hi> (and Iuſtices of Peace eſpecially) have authority to demoliſh by the Statutes of 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. c. 10. 3. <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 5.

That ALL ISRAEL <hi>that were preſent went out to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Iudah and brake the Images in peeces, and cut downe the groves; and threw downe the High places and Altars out of all Iudah and Benjamin, in Ephraim alſo and Manaſſith, untill they had utterly diſtroyed them all;</hi> which is recorded to their Eternall honour by God himſelfe: nor were they ever queſtioned or fined for a Riot, in any Starchamber, or High Commiſſion or <hi>for going out</hi> of their owne limits, or doing this without a ſpeciall Commiſſion from the King. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Sherfield</hi> being a publike Majeſtrate, both as a Iuſtice or Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder of <hi>Sarum</hi> might much more by the whole Veſtries Order, demoliſh this Idolatrous Picture in his owne Pariſh Church, in ſuch a privat manner as he did, without blame or cenſure, having ſufficient authority from theſe Texts and Preſidents of Scripture, and from the forecited <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Injunctions;</hi> to warrant it every man in ſuch a caſe being a lawfull Majeſtrate, without any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warrant. Thus the <hi>common people in Girmany and elſe where</hi> in the beginning of Reformation, <hi>brake downe the Popiſh Images and Altars without any ſpeciall Order</hi> from the Superior or Inferior Magiſtrates, as Mr. <note n="c" place="margin">Acts and Monu mean vol. 2.

                  <hi>Fox</hi> and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; And therefore, his Doctrine of the Archbiſhops, that <hi>it is unlawfull to break downe the very Image and Temple of Iupiter and Eſculapius where the Divell himſelfe was worſhiped, without the ſpeciall command of the ſupreame Magiſtrate,</hi> is a moſt impious Paradox; for if the ſupreame Magiſtrate will give no ſuch command, theſe Idols, Devills ſhall ſtill be to erated, worſhiped to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, and Religions ſlander, in deſpite of all the people and inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. As for the place of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> it only proves; that Idolatrous Statues, Images, Temples, were demoliſhed by the <hi>Emperor Conſtantines</hi> ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but that the Chriſtians under him, might not lawfully have defaced them without ſuch a ſpeciall command, eſpecially after a <hi>Generall Statute</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi> publiſhed by him for their demoliſhing, without being lyable to a ſeveer cenſure [the only thing in queſtion] is no wayes warranted by, nor deducible from <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> nor <hi>Saint Auguſtine.</hi> Yea had Mr <hi>Sherfields</hi> zeale out-run his diſcretion in this act, it deſerved rather applauſe then cenſure, from a Proteſtant Prelate, yet this Biſhop was ſo far from excuſing, extenuating, that hee aggravated his pretended offence beyond all bounds of Law, Iuſtice, Conſcience, pleaded as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly <hi>for the lawfullneſſe of Images in Churches, and of this abominable Idoll of God the Father,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe could have dont; yea he abuſed <hi>Master Sherfeild</hi> in his ſpeech and cenſured him with the higheſt, though a Biſhop, when ſome temporall Lords excuſed, yea acquitted him.

For his evaſions, that this Picture was conceived to bee the picture of God the Father as Maſter <hi>Caryl</hi> depoſed; not a picture of him in truth: It is a moſt childiſh evaſion, for the Scripture is expreſſe, <hi>That God being a ſpirit, an inviſible infinite Eſſence, can have no true pillure, likeneſſe, or ſimilitude made of him by any corporall viſible repreſentation, Iſay</hi> 40. 18. to 27. c. 46. 5, 6 <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. 24, 25. whence every ſuch Image of God is tearmed, <hi>a lye in Scripture,</hi> Iſay 44. 20. Hab. 2. 18. Rom. 1. 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if ever any Image of God were a <hi>lye,</hi> then certainly this, as hath bin proved. Now, whereas he pretends, it appeared <hi>not it was adored and idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed till the hearing,</hi> it is certaine it appeared to Mr. <hi>Sherfield</hi> long before the hearing or demoliſhing of it as he depoſed in his anſwer, and this appearing by witneſſes upon Oath to the Biſhop and whole Court when the cauſe was heard, made his unjuſt and heavy cenſure, farre more abominable to God and man.</p>
               <p>Eghtly, Mr. <hi>Workman</hi> was principally cenſured for his preaching <hi>againſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> though his expreſſions were the very words of our <hi>Homilies.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars vvere all juſtifiable, true, &amp; no wayes cenſurable except the ſixt,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:61245:255"/>
which was pretended, but not proved. Therefore his cenſure moſt unjuſt, and his cenſuring of ſome of thoſe of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> that joyned in a grant of Annuity to him under the City Seale though the Fine was but ſmall, and afterwards remitted, was far more unjuſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the grant of this Anpuity was not only an act of Charity, but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity, puniſhable by no Law and highly to bee commended.</p>
               <p>2ly. Becauſe they were cenſured in their privat naturall Capacity, for what they acted only in their politique, as Members of the Corporation under their Common Seale, wherein the whole City were engaged as much as they.</p>
               <p>3ly. Becauſe they damned this grant of which they had no cogniſance, to ſtarve a faithfull Miniſter and his Family, who had no other Livelyhood. As for his prohibiting him to teach Schoole, to practiſe Phiſick, when he had put him from his Miniſtry without any juſt cauſe it was a treble tyrany and oppreſſion, he being enforced to take this courſe only to ſupply himſelfe and his family, for which the Law of God and nature enjoynes him to provide, <hi>unleſſe he will</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>be worſe then an Infidell:</hi> and doubtleſſe he muſt needs be worſe then any Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell who had the heart to do it upon ſuch a poore pretence, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others with his opinions, to wit, of the unlawfullneſſe of Images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chs, or private houſes the very approved, reſolved Doctrine of our <hi>Statutes, Homilies, Injunctions, Writers, Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9ly. For that he alleageth by way of juſtification and excuſe touching the moſt barbarous cenſures of Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> &amp; Dr. <hi>Baſtwick:</hi> We reply, 1. That his hand was to all the Warrants for their Illegall commitments, croſe impriſenments before their cenſures. That the Books for which they were queſtioned were neither ſcandalous, Seditious nor Schiſmaticall, but neceſſary Apologies, Pleas againſt his unjuſt tyrannicall proceedings in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Popiſh Innovations in the Church to ſubvert our Religion. That himſelfe in his Starchamber Speech (and <hi>Heylin</hi> and <hi>Dove</hi> after him) confeſſeth juſtifieth the truth of theſe <hi>Innovations</hi> wherewith thoſe Bookes did charge him: all which the former and this preſent Parliament have unanimouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained off and voted to be illegall, Popiſh, deſtructive to our Religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were theſe Bookes were neither Scandalous, nor Libellous.</p>
               <p>3ly. Both the proceedings and ſentence againſt them are voted, adjudged by both Houſes <hi>to be altogether illegall unjuſt barbarous, contrary to Magna Charta, the Lawes of the Land, and liberty of the Subject, and unparralel'd in any age; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered to be utterly raſed and taken off the file, as unfit to remaine upon record to prejudice poſterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4ly. Their proſecution proceeded principally from him, the Orders for ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them up cloſe priſoners, denying them pen inke, paper, and ſpeech with one another, were procured by him. The Orders for denying them liberty to put in their Anſwers under their owne hands, taking them <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> were made when himſelfe ſate and Voted in Court, being both proſecutor party and Iudge; the ſentence was given; He ſitting in Court, though particularly excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt though he gave no Vote in the Cenſure it ſelfe, yet al knowe he was the cauſe and contriver of it before it was given, yea he approved <hi>and thanked the Lord for it,</hi> in his <hi>Speech,</hi> when it was given cauſed it to he moſt ſeveerly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when given againſt the will of thoſe that gave it inſtigating his Majeſty to the bloudy execution of it; afterwards when executed; denyed Mr. <hi>Pryns</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant liberty upon Rayle to attend him during his wounds ſet his hand firſt to all the Warrants for ſending them to and cloſe impriſoning them in remote <hi>Caſtles,</hi> and after that for baniſhing them into forraigne Iſlands, where they were ſo ſtrictly mewed up, that neither freind, Wife, Children <hi>could have the leaſt acceſſe unto them for their releife, nor they procure liberty of pen inke or paper</hi> to write unto them for neceſſaries. Yea, had not he ingaged his extraordinary power and malice in their proſecution, neither the Court, Iudges, Officers, nor Lords,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:61245:255"/>
had bin ſo extravagant, ſo unjuſt in their proceedings, Cenſures, Executions againſt them nor their Councell ſo over-awed as they were, nor they denyed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to anſwer for themſelves, and to impeach their Oppoſites by a Croſſe Bil; which if admitted (as it ought of right and juſtice) it, would have prevented their, heavy Cenſure, elſewhere, which probably would have falne ſhort of this he is now likely to incurre. All which conſidered, this part of the charge ſtickes faſt upon him in each particular.</p>
               <p>7ly. Himſelfe ſent for Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> and commanded him to carry his Sermons to his Chaplin to peruſe, who thereupon expunged this and other paſſages out of them after they were printed, to pleaſe his Lord; and his Chaplains Act in this caſe is his own. And though other paſſages againſt Images remained, yet no reaſon can be given for expunging this [being the direct words of the Homily,] but his complyancy with the Papiſts: Yea, Dr. <hi>Featlie</hi> ſweares expreſly, that he did complaine of it to Sir <hi>Edmond Scot,</hi> who told him it would bee bootleſſe to complaine to the Archbiſhop, who would undoe nothing his Chaplaine had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>8ly. For the Popiſh pictures, we have proved them printed in <hi>London</hi> by the Archbiſhops own authority and direction, that himſelfe ſaw and approved them whiles in printing, being the very ſame with thoſe his Chapell windowes, the Maſſe-Booke, and <hi>Boetius a Bolſwort,</hi> found in his ſtudy: That they were ordinarily bound up in Bibles and ſold in ſhops, of which the Stationers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to him he thereupon gave them the foreſaid anſwer himſelfe. But that the Lords of the Counſel gave any ſuch order he produceth no proofe at all. In few words, if the pictures were lawfull, to bee bound up in Bibles; why then did he give order that they ſhould bee only ſold in private, not in publique? If unlawfull, Popiſh, Idolatrous, or ſuperſtitious, contrary to the Scripture, our owne <hi>Statutes, Homilies, Jnjunctions, VVriters,</hi> as we have proved them, then they ought not by his direction, to ſell or binde them up in Bibles, no more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately theſe publikely, And whereas he Objects, that the <hi>Latine Bible</hi> produced wherein ſome of theſe pictures were bound, was printed at <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> wee grant it. But the Pictures in it, were printed and bound up with it here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> not at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and theſe Pictures by the Archbiſhops owne direction were bound and ſold with many <hi>Engliſh Bibles;</hi> in which act he ſo much gloried, inſtead of being aſhamed of it, that he would have theſe Bibles thus bound up with Pictures, called the <hi>Arch-Biſhops Bibles,</hi> by way of diſtinction. As for the <hi>Engliſh Bibles</hi> printed with Pictures in <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> dayes, they had no <note place="margin">Note.</note> other Pictures in them, but onely of the Arke, Temple and ſuch like, not any Pictures of Chriſt, the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> or any perſons of the Trinity. All which conſidered, this part of his charge ſtickes ſtill upon him in each particular not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his evaſions.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, They Object againſt me the Conſecration of Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 7.</note> as a Popiſh Innovation; tending to introduce <hi>Popery among us,</hi> and have <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 114. to 228.</note> inſtanced in my conſecrating of <hi>Creed-Church,</hi> St. <hi>Giles Church in the fields;</hi> and the <hi>Church-yard</hi> there; for conſecrating whereof the <hi>Pariſh paid</hi> me 15. l. The Church of <hi>Stanmore Magna,</hi> my Chappell at <hi>Aberguilly,</hi> the forme, and furniture whereof were excepted againſt as Popiſh, the Chappell of <hi>Hamer-Smith,</hi> where they alleadge, I conſecrated the firſt ſtone when it was layd, the Chappell of <hi>Roe-Hampton;</hi> and that I would have conſecrated other Chapells <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer firſt in generall; that the Conſecration of Churches is very <note place="margin">Anſw:</note> ancient and warranted by Scripture and Eccleſiaſticall ſtories. In the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, wee read that the <hi>Tabernacle, with all the Veſſells, Ornaments thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing were ſolemnly conſecrated by</hi>

                  <hi>the dedication of the Houſe of God with joy; and offered in the Dedication of the Houſe of God an hundred bullockes, which Feaſt of Dedication, was obſerved by the</hi> Jewes <hi>even in our Saviours time,</hi> as wee read in the New Teſtament, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 22. In the reigne of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, when Chriſtian Churches began to be built, or re-edified: wee no ſooner read of their building, but of their <hi>ſolemne conſecration and Dedication;</hi> as of the conſecration of the <hi>Church of Tyre</hi> with ſundry others mentioned by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, l.</hi> 10. c. 3. <hi>&amp; Devita Conſtantini, l.</hi> 4. c. 40. After which wee finde this practiſe continued in the Chriſtian Church in all ages, as Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, the Conſecration Sermons of ſundry Fathers, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of ancient Councels and the Canoniſts in their titles <hi>De Conſecratione Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiarum,</hi> prove at large. Wherefore this can be no Popery, ner Innovation. Yea if Churches were not conſecrated, then I ſay, they could not bee termed <hi>Holy,</hi> for it is the <hi>Conſecration makes them holy.</hi> And if places be not <hi>holy</hi> then perſons alſo <hi>cannot be holy,</hi> when they are conſecrated and entred into <hi>holy</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As for <hi>Biſhop Pilkinton</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhop Parker,</hi> they ſpeake not ſimply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſecrations in generall, for they were conſecrated <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the book of Ordination is confirmed by Parliament, nor yet againſt conſecrating of Churches in generall, but againſt the <hi>Popiſh conſecrations</hi> of them uſed by ſome moderne Romiſh Prelates. For my form of conſecrating them, it was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the <hi>Roman Pontificall,</hi> but that which was uſed by Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> from whom I had it: This forme I followed at <hi>Creed Church</hi> and the reſt.

               <p>Firſt, to that concerning <hi>Katherin Creed-Church.</hi> It was teſtified, that I came thither in a <hi>Pompous manner;</hi> I deny it; it was only in a grave and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner. It is Objected, that as ſoone as I came within the Church doore I fell downe upon my knees: True, it was no more then my duty; being an <hi>Oratory;</hi>

                  <hi>O come let us worſhip and fall downe, and kneell before the Lord our Maker,</hi> is the common <hi>Introitus</hi> in our owne and other <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies.</hi> It is objected, I pronounced the place and ground holy: I did ſo, and it is an ordinary and legall Speech, there being a <hi>relative</hi> though not an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>holineſſe</hi> in Churches Dedicated to Gods ſervice. Hence wee read in <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Codicis, l.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 5. this Title <hi>DESACROS ANCTIS ECCLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIIS,</hi> as they are there often ſtiled: Therefore Churches are holy, and their conſecration makes them ſo. Wheras it was ſaid, <hi>I threw up dust into the ayre:</hi> This I deny: and where it was alleadged, that this was <hi>in imitation</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pontificall;</hi> that is a miſtake, for the <hi>Pontificall</hi> preſcribes <hi>Cinis,</hi> a hes not duſt to be caſt abroad, and Greek Letters to be made therein, with many other vanities. For my forme of conſecration, Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> made it, from whom I deſired a Coppy and had it, which I obſerved. It was objected that the form of prayer I uſed, <hi>is in the Maſſe Booke</hi> and <hi>Roman Pontificall;</hi> It may bee ſo, many other very good prayers are in it, yet they be good. It was further allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that I objected Doctor <hi>Deniſons</hi> Sermon to <hi>him at his cenſure in the High Commiſſion:</hi> I Objected only his extravagances, and that was no hurt. For St. <hi>Giles</hi> Church, it is true I conſecrated firſt the Church and then the Church-yard which is the uſuall manner; as for the fees amounting to 15. l. I returned them againe, and beſtowed them on the poore of the Pariſh.</p>
               <p>But it hath bin Objected, that theſe were no new Churches, but Churches only new repaired: therfore not to be re-conſecrated. I anſwer, that there was ſome new ground taken in at Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> and admit there were ſtill the ſame
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:61245:256"/>
longitude and latitude, yet the walls and ſtructure being for the moſt part new; the Churches in this reſpect were new, and to be new conſecrated.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to the conſecration of the Objected <hi>Chappells,</hi> I confeſſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations; and though there be no expreſſe forme for conſecrating of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells in the <hi>Pontificall,</hi> nor mention in <hi>Eccleſiaſticall ſtory</hi> of Chappels conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations; yet ſeeing they are <hi>Oratories,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſtifying, that <hi>Oratories</hi> were conſecrated in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, there is the like warrant and Antiquity for conſecration of them, as of Churches. For my Chappell at <hi>Aberguelle,</hi> I conſecrated, and put a name upon it, (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, wee dedicate Churches to Saint <hi>Peter)</hi> for diſtinction ſake; and though I had a relation to the beheading of Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in my Dedication of it, I hope there is no hurt therein. For the patterne and furniture of the Chappell produced, as if it were mine at <hi>Aberguelle,</hi> it is a miſtake: for it is the patterne of Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> Chappell and furniture (which I cauſed to be written out) as the indorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it proves, viz. 1623. <hi>Chappell and furniture as it was in uſe by the Right Reverend Father in God Lancelot Andrewes, Lord Biſhop then of Winton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had no ſuch furniture in my Chappell there. For the Wafer basket and the reſt, they concerne not me, yet Wafers have bin alwayes uſed and are at this day in the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> and in <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey</hi> too. Whereas it is objected, that I hold there is a badge of Holineſſe put upon our Churches and Chappells by a Biſhops breath, I anſwer no, but there is an awſulneſſe, put upon them; For my prayer at the laying of the foundation ſtone of <hi>Hamerſmith Chappell,</hi> there is no hurt, nor ſuperſtition in it. In fine, I hope there is is no High Treaſon to bee found either in the one or other, in conſecrating Churches, Chappells or foundation ſtones.</p>
               <p>To this brave flouriſh of his for the Antiquity and lawfulneſſe of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration <note place="margin">Reply.</note> of Churches, of Chappells, we ſhall returne a full reply. To his Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents taken out of the Old Teſtament we anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Moſes had an expreſſe command from God Himſelfe to conſecrate the Tabernacle, with all the veſſells thereof, by annointing them with conſecrated Oyle, Exod.</hi> 40. 10. 11, 12. [they being types of Chriſt to come;] but wee have no ſuch command from God, to conſecrate Churches, Church-Yards, Chappels Altars, Veſtments; which are no types of Chriſt, already come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This conſecration was made by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Temporall Magiſtrate (not by <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt) without any other ceremony then meer <hi>annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Tabernacle and its Veſſells, implements, with oyle:</hi> Therefore no warrant for Biſhops conſecrating Churches, Church-Yards, Chappells Altars, Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with other ceremonies, without any anoynting them with oyle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this conſecration was only Temporary, Jewiſh, ceremoniall, aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Chriſts death, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. to 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>c.</hi> 9. 1. to the end, and cap. 10 1. to 22.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, King <hi>Solomon</hi> did not conſecrate the Temple not the Veſſells and Court thereof, with Oyle, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> but <note n="k" place="margin">1 Kings 8 2 Chron. 5. 6. and 7.</note> 
                  <hi>after hee had brought the Arke, Tabernacle and all the Holy Veſſells into it, with praiſes, thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, inſtruments of Muſicke; and after the cloud and glory of the Lord had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Houſe, he made an heavenly prayer only in the middeſt of the Court</hi> (not in the Temple) <hi>before all the Congregation of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>kneeling on his knees, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his hands towards heaven,</hi> [uſing no ſuch prayers or ceremonies as the Biſhop uſed:] and all the hallowing that we read of in this ſtory is, <hi>Solomons hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the middle of the Court, that was before the houſe of the Lord</hi> (and how was that?) only by <hi>offring burnt offerings and peace offerings,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 7. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 64. From which <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and practiſe, of his we ſhall obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if there were any conſecration of this Temple, it was made only by <hi>King Solomon</hi> himſelfe, not by the <hi>High Priest,</hi> Prieſts, or Biſhops, who now appropriate all conſecrations of Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to themſelves alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Oracle of the houſe where the Arke was placed, is called <hi>THE MOST HOLY PLACE,</hi> even before and without any conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of it at all, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 6, 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 7. Therefore the conſecration made it not moſt holy, but only the uſe to which it was deſigned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Atke, Tabernacle, Veſſells were brought into the Temple, and praiſes, thankſgivings, there ſolemnly ſung to God, who manifeſted his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there, filling it with a Cloud and his glory, ſo as the Prieſts could not ſtand to miniſter; before <hi>Solomonmade is prayer,</hi> which ſome tearme a <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration;</hi> whereas this Archbiſhop fell to his conſecration, before any publike prayers, thankſgiving Pſalmes, Service, or Sacraments adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That if this prayer were a conſecration; it was made only in the <hi>outward Court,</hi> not in the temple it ſelfe, whereas the Arch-biſhops conſecration was made in the Church, not Church-Yard.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That the Hallowing of the Court (and ſo by conſequence of the Temple, if properly conſecrated) is by the text aſcribed only, to <hi>Solomons offering of burnt offrings, meat-offrings, and the fat of the Peace-offerings:</hi> not to any other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, exorciſmes, Unctions, or Ceremonies, which Offrings being long ſince cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and not to be uſed by Chriſtians, the conſecration of Churches and Church-Yards muſt likewiſe ceaſe, unleſſe it bee onely by performing publike duties of Gods worſhip in them. Therfore this preſident of <hi>Solomon</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; is no warrant at all for our Biſhops conſecrating of Churches, Church-Yards, Altars, Veſſells or Veſtiments under the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the ſanctifying and cleanſing of the <hi>Temple</hi> and Veſſells of it preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> but executed by the Prieſts and Levites; was only the <hi>clean, ſing out of the Idols, Jdolatrius Altars, rubbiſh, filth and uncleanneſſe of the Temple, which they found, and carried out thence into the Brooke Kidron;</hi> with their <hi>ſcouring of the Veſſells,</hi> which had beene polluted, as is plaine by the letter of the text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> c. 33. 15, 16. compared together. Therefore it makes nothing for any Epiſcopall conſecration of Churches, but only for keeping them cleane from filth and Idolls.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that of <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6. 16, 17. is no warrant for the hallowing of Churches or Chappells. For it only mentions; <hi>That the Prieſts, Levites, and Children of Iſrael kept the Dedication of the houſe of God with joy; and offered at the dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the houſe of God an hundred Bullockes, two hundred Rammes,</hi> 400. <hi>Lambs; and for a ſinne offering for all Iſrael, twelve he-Goates according to the number of the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And they ſet the Prieſts in their diviſions and the Levites in their courſes for the ſervice of God.</hi> But of any ſpeciall Prayers, Ceremonies, Unctions, and the like, uſed at this <hi>Dedication,</hi> by the Prieſts or people, wee read not one ſyllable. Therefore this their <hi>Dedication of the Temple,</hi> was only their <hi>offering of burnt offerings, of ſinne offerings in it to God, and ordering the ſervices of the Prieſts and Levites in it.</hi> Therefore no Preſident for the conſecration of Churches by our Prelates, ſince ſuch oblations, ſuch courſes of Prieſts, Levites are ceaſed with Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 11. 12, 18.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the Feaſt of <hi>Dedication</hi> mentioned <hi>John</hi> 10. 22. was not of the <hi>Temples Dedication,</hi> but of the <hi>Altars,</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Iudas Maccabeus and his Brethren, to be annually kept by the ſpace of</hi> 8. <hi>dayes in the Month Caſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It can be no warrant at all for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of <hi>Altars,</hi> much leſſe of Churches now.</p>
               <p>Finally wee anſwer, that we find no mention in Scripture or Claſſicall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of any conſecration of <hi>Iewiſh Synagogues,</hi> to which our Churches <hi>properly</hi> ſucceed, but only of their <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> in ſuch ſort as you have heard; with which our Churches, Chapells have no proper Analogie: That this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Archbiſhop drawne from the preſidents in the Old Teſtament, is borrowed from no Orthodox Ancient Father or Councell, but only from the <hi>Popiſh Canoniſt, Gratian De Conſecratione.</hi> Diſtinct 1. who thus concludes from theſe preſidents. <hi>Si enim Judai qui umbrae legis deſerviebant, hoc facicbant, multo</hi>

Theſe Dedications therefore of Churches then, were farre different from thoſe uſed by the Papiſts and this Archbiſhop now. We read not <hi>then of any conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their foundation ſtones, any pompous proceſſions to them, any knocking at the doores, by the Biſhop, crying with a loud voyce, Open, Open ye everlaſting doores, &amp;c</hi> [a cleare perverting of Scripture;] <hi>of no flying open of the doores there-upon; No falling downe upon the marrow bones; and ſaying: This place is holy, &amp;c.

Now to prove the conſecration and meerly Popiſh [as of late ages it hath beene uſed at leaſt] it is agreed by <hi>Gratian, Platina,</hi> the <hi>Centuryators, Thomas Beacon, and others, that Pope Hyginus, Gelaſius, Iohn, Nicholas, Clemens, Sylveſter, Felix and Gregory</hi> (whoſe ſpurious Decrees are cited by <hi>Gratian De Conſecratione Distincti: and Surius in his</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Tome of Councells)</hi> were <hi>the firſt inventors and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers of this Ceremony of Conſecrating Churches and Altars:</hi> preſcribing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That no Church ſhould be built or conſecrated without the command, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or conſent of the Biſhop of Rome.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>7ly. <hi>That the Timber of a conſecrated Church, and Vestments once conſecrated, though worne out &amp; decayed ſhould not be converted to any other good uſe but burnt to Aſhes and theſe to be laid up ſafely in ſome place within the Church, least they ſhould be polluted with the feet of thoſe who paſſed by.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Of latter times, many Ethnicall, ſuperſtitious Exerciſmes, Conjurations, Vnctions, Ceremonies, Notions, and frantick inventions have bin added by Popes and Prelates to theſe conſecrations recorded at large in the Roman Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonialls, Pontificalls, <hi>Thomas Beacons Reliques of Rome,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calfehill</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: whereby it will appeare to be moſt Popiſh, ſuperſtitious in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gree, whatever is pretended to the contrary. Whereupon it was exploded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by our <hi>Church, State,</hi> Biſhops, and other writers in the beginning of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as Popiſh, Jewiſh, Superſtitious and by forraigne Proteſtant writers (See <hi>Aretij Problemata</hi> Locus 121 <hi>De Encaenijs)</hi> as we have formerly proved. Therefore it muſt needs be a Popiſh deſigne in this <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it now.</p>
               <p>For his Argument, that Churches cannot be called Holy, unleſſe conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Biſhop; it being his conſecration that makes them ſo. We anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Biſhop <hi>Pilkinton</hi> and others define this very Doctrine of his, <hi>to be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> as we haye proved, ſo doth <hi>Aretius</hi> too.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the <hi>moſt Holy Place,</hi> was ſo ſtiled, though never conſecrated 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 6. 10. So Jeruſalem is called very frequently, the <hi>Holy City: Matth</hi> 4. 5. c. 27. 53. though never conſecrated. And God told <hi>Moſes the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground, Exodus</hi> 3. 5. though never conſecrated by a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Our owne (<note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping cleane Churches. p.</hi> 78 79.</note>) <hi>Homilies</hi> informe us, <hi>That the Church is counted and talled Holy, not of it ſelfe</hi> (nor yet for its conſecration by a Biſhop) <hi>but becauſe Gods people reſorting thither are holy, and exerciſe themſelves in holy and heavenly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The hearing and preaching of Gods Word, Prayer, and receiving the Sacraments therin <hi>are ſufficient of themſelves to ſanctifie and make it holy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:61245:258"/>
                  <hi>any other conſecration.</hi> See 1 Tim. 45. <hi>Centur: Mag:</hi> 3. and 4. c. 6. <hi>&amp; Aretij Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemaia Locus,</hi> 126. who reſolves further againſt this ſuperſtition: <hi>Vana eſt etiam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>illa ſuperſtitio, quod dicunt; Niſi dedicatur Templum, non poſſe ibi preces haberi, non exandiri orantes, non rectè praedicari verbum Dei, nec Sacramenta adminiſtrari: quae ſententia MANIFESTE J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DAISMUM RESIPIT; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus tamen praemonſtravit, Horam nunc eſſe, ut veri adoratores, nec in monteiſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nec Jeroſolymis, ſed ubique lieorum Deum adorent in spiritu &amp; veritate. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius ſane non erubuit preces habere &amp; populum ad audiendum verbum Dei convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care in Templum Alexandrinum majus, quamvis nondum eſſet Dedicatione conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratum: nondum enim juſſerat Imperator. Id noſtri hodie magnum nefas ducunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſanctification in its owne nature, is nothing elſe, but a ſequeſtring of any thing from a common or ordinary uſe, to a religious and ſacred purpoſe. And this may be done without a Biſhops exorciſme or conjuration; in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> reſpect the firſt borne, firſt fruits, and oblations among the Jewes were termed <hi>Holy,</hi> though never ſolemnly conſecrated, becauſe appropriated and devoted unto God. For his other Argument, that if places bee not holy perſons cannot be ſo; and our Church allowes of the conſecration of perſons; <hi>Ergo</hi> of places. It is both a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and abſurdity. For firſt, it is God and his Spirit only that make perſons ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not Prelates; who never ſanctifie places as they do perſons. Secondly, Our Church allowes only <hi>of the Ordination</hi> (not conſecration) <hi>of Biſhops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> confirmed by Statute (many of whom ordained ſuch, are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy, that they are moſt polluted and unclean) but not of conſecrating Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; utterly exploded by the Common Prayer Booke, and book of Ordination, compriſing all the authorized Rites and Ceremonies of our Church, whereof conſecration of Churches is none. And thus much in anſwer to his defence in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall for conſecration of Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the particulars Objected; our witneſſes depoſe, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Creed Church,</hi> was pompous, not decent, that he fell downe on his knees to pronounce, the place and ground holy, <hi>in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> not to adore and pray to God; which the Examples of <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> warrant not, who never fell down at the Tabernacle door not bowed the head and worſhipped to conſecrate either the <hi>Tabernacle, Temple,</hi> or <hi>Altar.</hi> And whereas he objects, that his pronouncing of the place holy as ſoon he entred into it, was legall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That himſelfe avers, that no Church or place is legally holy, before it be conſecrated; and when he pronounced it holy upon his entrance to it, hee had not conſecrated it; therfore by his own doctrine it was not legally holy, when he pronounced it ſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If our Churches be legally holy by their conſecration, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of our Popiſh Prelates in times of Popery with ſuperſtitious, Popiſh Ceremonies, conjurations, Exorciſmes, enoylings, proceſſions, ſprinklings with holy water, made them ſo, ſince moſt of them were onely conſecrated in, though none re-conſecrated ſince the times of Popery: And if ſuch Popiſh conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make them legally and really holy, then they are of as great efficacy at his owne or Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> his forme, and no difference at all between them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For <hi>Iustinian,</hi> he makes no mention at all in that Title of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches, and ſtiles them <hi>holy Churches,</hi> only in reſpect of the holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties publikely performed in them. For his throwing up of duſt, two witneſſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly depoſe it, which muſt overballance his own bare negation: and there is ſo little difference between duſt and aſhes, that they are uſually coupled together as <hi>Synonimaes,</hi> in Scripture and Authors. That he took his forme from Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> is only averred by himſelfe nor proved by any witneſſes; but that it agrees with that in the <hi>Pontificall</hi> which we found in his Study even <hi>in terminis,</hi> is moſt cleare; and therefore we cannot but preſume he derived it from thence. However, if Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> imitated the Pontificall, and he Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> the charge is ſtill alike, both of them imitating and complying with the Pope herein. He grants his prayer taken out of the Pontificall; therefore no doubt
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:61245:259"/>
the reſt, eſpecially his frequent bowings and Jackanapes trickes at the Altar: which he cunningly pretermits and anſwers not. For Dr. <hi>Ieniſon,</hi> he objected on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his preaching againſt Images to him at his cenſure, and that was no extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy. As for the conſecrating of Churches only repaired or ſomwhat enlarged, we know no Law nor Canon in our Church to warrant it: And to take ſees for it, is both Symony, and extortion. For the reſtoring of them, it is only affirmed not proved; and to take them illegally to beſtow them on the poore, is but to rob <hi>Peter</hi> to cloath <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the conſecration of <hi>Chappells</hi> and meere private Oratoties, there is no preſident in Antiquity; yea <hi>Gratian</hi> himſelfe and the <hi>Roman Pontificall</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>uſe of them, without any conſecration:</hi> Therefore to conſecrate them is to exceed even Popery and Papiſts in Superſtition. As for his <hi>Chapell</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berguilly</hi> his owne Diary proclaimes his Superſtition both in its conſecration. and denomination of it. For the Patterne and furniture of it, his owne notes and papers clearly prove, it was the ſame with that of Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> whoſe forme of conſcration himſelfe alleageth he punctually purſued. And if this were the true patterne furniture of Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> owne Chapell <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. all the world may juſtly cenſure him for a profeſſed Papiſt, his Chapell Altar, and their furniture being as Popiſh Superſtitious, Idolatrous every way as the Pops in <hi>Rome,</hi> yea exceeding the very Roman Ceremoniall and Pontificall For Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, they are directly contrary to the Rubrick at the end of the Communion in the Book of Common prayer; we wonder therefore with what face this Prelate dares juſtify them: That a Biſhops breath puts only a badge of reverence not holineſſe on Churches, is diametrially contrary to what he formerly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Perchance he now remembers that <hi>Quicquid effecit tale eſt magis tale?</hi> and therefore Biſhops cannot make other things holy with their breath who have little or no holineſſe at all in their hearts: For his ſolemne conſecration prayer at the laying the firſt ſtone of <hi>Hammerſmith Chappell,</hi> it hath neither Scripture, Law, Canon, Antiquity, but the Roman Pontificall to warrant it: Therefore it is meerly Popiſh Wheras he objects by way of jeare, that he hopes the conſecration of Churches and Chapells is no Treaſon: we anſwer, that we do not charge it to be ſo in it ſelfe. But we have proved it to be a branch of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and a groſſe one too and being introduced by him among other things to ſet up Popery, and ſubvert Religion it will prove Treaſon in this reſpect, as we ſhall manifeſt in due time. And ſo this intre charge remaines unavoyded in any the leaſt particle.</p>
               <p>8ly. The next Charge urged againſt me, Is <hi>The Kings Declaration for the uſe of ſports on the Lords day,</hi> preſcribing the obſervation of Revells, Wakes.

For preſſing Miniſters to read it in their Churches without any Warrant, ſuppreſſing of Sermons cenſuring thoſe who refuſed to publiſh it, (as Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> Maſter <hi>Player,</hi> Maſter <hi>Heiron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Snelling</hi> with ſundry others) encouraging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops to ſuſpend, ſilence many Godly preaching Miniſters for this cauſe, preſſing this Book, and ordering Churchwardens to preſent ſuch who refuſed to publiſh it, by Viſitation Oathes and Articles.</p>
               <p>3ly. For reviving, diſorder, by wakes, Revels, and cauſing the Iudges Orders to be reverſed:</p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe I anſwer, <hi>That the Kings Declaration for ſports</hi> was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and publiſhed by his <hi>Majeſties ſpeciall command.</hi> Yea I had a Warrant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand to ſee it printed, and there is no proofe at all that it was printed, publiſhed or enlarged by my procurement. Beſides, the Declaration is but for the uſe of lawful Sports and that only after evening prayer ended: and the cauſe of publiſhing it at that time was partly <hi>Barbourous</hi> Book of the Sabbath, who would revive the Iewiſh Sabbath, and the Iewiſh rigidities poſitions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:61245:259"/>
touching the Lords day, whoſe poſitions drew <hi>Brabourne</hi> into that Error. In <hi>Geneva</hi> it ſelf (as I have bin ceedibly informed by Travellers) they uſe ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in peeces long bowes Croſſe Bowes, Muſters, and throwing of the bowle too, on the Lords day as well before as after Sermons ended, and allow all honeſt recreations without reproofe of their Miniſters, yea, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor there <hi>Inſtit.</hi> l. 2. c. 8. ſect. 34. blames thoſe <hi>who infected the people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages with a Iudaicall opinion, that the morality of the</hi> 4th. <hi>Commandement, to wit, the keeping of one day in</hi> 7. <hi>did still continue; which what elſe is it then in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the Iews to change the day, and to affix as great a ſanctity to it, as the</hi> Iewes <hi>ever did. And that thoſe who adhored to their conſtitutions who broached this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, Craſſa carnalique Superſtitione Judaeos ter ſuperant:</hi> Men may be too ſtrict as wel as prophaneherein.

               <p>2ly. The <hi>Declaration</hi> was ordered to be publiſhed in the Church; and that was ſufficient warrant to enjoyne Miniſters to publiſh it there, &amp; although no penalty be preſcribed in it to ſuch who ſhould refuſe to publiſh the ſame, yet it is implyed, otherwiſe, the command were idle in caſe of diſobedience. That it was publiſhed with intent to ſuppreſſe afternoon Sermons, that ſo the people might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That I gave my Viſitor command to ſuſpend thoſe who refuſed to read it, was only within my Dioceſſe of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> not in my Metropoliticall Viſitation throughout my province; I ſuſpended but three Miniſters in my whole Dioceſſe, who had firſt time of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on granted them, to wit, Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Culmer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Player,</hi> only ſuſpended <hi>ob officio</hi> for their contumacy being men of factious Spirits. For Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> and others being brought into the High Commiſſion for not reading this <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it was the act of the Court, not mine.

Nor did I preſſe the reading of the <hi>Declaration</hi> in my Viſitation Articles, if other Biſhops did it, tis nothing to me; themſelves muſt anſwer for it, not I.</p>
               <p>3ly. Feaſts of dedication have beene of great Antiquity, and in generall uſe in ſome Coutries; and there is a lawfull uſe of them for Hoſpitality, and increaſe of love among Neighbours and friends, as the <hi>Biſhop of Bath and Wells,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the graveſt Clergy in the county of <hi>Somerſet</hi> certified his Majeſty, who deſired their continuance:</p>
               <p>If ſome abuſes crept into them as they did in ſome places, and it ſeemes in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> yet this was no good reaſon to take away the feaſts and meetings themſelves, as Iudge <hi>Richardſon</hi> did by his order (for which there were great complaints made by men of quality) but only to regulate them, and take away their abuſes, which this <hi>Declaration</hi> doth without countenancing any diſorders.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed. 1. That it is cleare by the evidence given, and his Letter written, to the Biſhop of <hi>Bath and Wells</hi> that this <hi>Declaration</hi> was enlarged <note place="margin">Reply.</note> by himſelfe, and republiſhed by his inſtigation and procurement: That him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe put his Majeſty upon the reprinting of it, the warrant being written with his owne hand and being without any date at all makes it probable it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſince the <hi>Declaration</hi> printed. The later end of the <hi>Declaration</hi> it ſelfe concerning Wakes and Revells, compared with the juncture of time when it was publiſhed, manifeſts that it was thruſt out to croſſe Iudge <hi>Richardſons</hi> order, and foreſtall the Petition of the <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> Iuſtices for its continuance, immediatly after its reverſall, it having no relation at all to <hi>Brabournes</hi> Booke.

Beſides the publiſhing of it, juſt when Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> was queſtioned for his <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triomaſtix</hi> (wherein he cenſures mixt dancing Sports &amp; Paſtimes on the Lords day) and reciting it in the very information againſt him, manifeſts; that it was likewiſe reprinted to make way for his firſt cenſure in <hi>Starchamber.</hi> Moreover ſome of the recreations mentioned in it are not very <hi>lawfull upon any day</hi> though the Archbiſhop affirmes the contrary, but certainly unlawfull on any part of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> even after evening Prayer, as <note n="r" place="margin">See Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day a Sabbath The Divine Tragedy and Hiſtriomaſtix.</note>

Sermon upon <hi>Iob,</hi> proclaimes to all the world; and other <hi>Geneva Ministers</hi> ſince him, have done the like. That this <hi>Declaration</hi> did <hi>de Pacto</hi> put downe afternoone Sermons on the Lords day in moſt and forenoone too in many places, by ſuſpending ſundry preaching Miniſters who durſt not publiſh it out of conſcience, is apparent to al. Wherefore to affirme this one part of the Archbiſhops deſign in reprinting thereof, is a certaine and more then probable truth; and the words of it, that they ſhould uſe thoſe Paſtimes after <hi>Evening Prayer,</hi> (not evening Sermon) import as much, ſome Biſhops grounding their ſuppreſſing of Afternoone Sermons on this expreſſion; which Sermons Peter Heylin in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Sabbath.</hi> part. 2. c. 6. ſect. 9. and c. 7. and 8. makes to be <hi>meere innovations,</hi> as doth Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> in his Sunday no Sabbath, both publiſhed by this Archbiſhops command and approbation. For his owne ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, it is an averment without truth. Certainly he that made conſcience of its ſtrict obſervation himſelfe, would never give way to ſuch a <hi>Declaration</hi> encouraging others to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane it, who were apt to do it without ſuch an incitement; nor ſuſpend ſuch Godly Miniſters, who durſt not publiſh it out of conſcience, for feare of encouraging others to prophane it. Yea, his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtrictneſſe of late times was ſuch, that himſelfe and his ſervants made it an ordinary practiſe in the Somer to go to Bowles and uſe other paſtimes on it, and he ſate conſtantly thereon at the Councell Table about worldly buſineſſe. 2ly. That there was no warrant at all in the Declaration that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould publiſh it, or to puniſh any who refuſed it, hath bin formerly proved at large, and where there is no penalty preſcribed in a Law (much more in a Declaration) no puniſhment can be inflicted. That he gave expreſſe order for ſilenſing Mr. <hi>Wilſon, Mr. Culmer, and Mr. Player,</hi> is proved by ſeverall Oathes, and that they were ſuſpended divers yeares not only <hi>ab officio,</hi> but <hi>beneficio,</hi> having nothing left to ſupport their Wives and Families. That they were obſtinate or ſactious is a groundleſſe ſcandall, not proved, they were only conſcientious and would not diſobey God to humour men. That he ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced only theſe three in his Dioceſſe was but caſuall, becauſe others ſubmitted to read the Booke; but his command was generall, <hi>to ſuſpend all who refuſed to read it, and thoſe three in ſpeciall.</hi> That he put not any Article of Inquiry touching the reading of this Declaration into the Articles for his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropoliticall Viſitation, was his Jeſuitical Art and cunning, to conceale his wickedneſſe and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from publique view, but that he gave private Inſtructions to his Vicar Generall in this his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to convent and queſtion ſuch who had not read it, who thereupon did accordingly queſtion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good Miniſters for this very cauſe, you have heard it proved at large by the very Abſtracts of his <hi>Metropoliticall Viſitations,</hi> under his owne and his <hi>Viſitors hands.</hi> That other Biſhops inſerted ſuch an Article into their printed Viſitation Inquiſitions, we have fully proved, as alſo that they gave an Accompt to him of the Miniſters they had ſuſpended for not Reading the <hi>Declaration</hi> according to his Injunctions. Therefore their Articles of this nature proceeded meerely from him, and muſt be charged on him, as well as on themſelves. That it was the Act of the Court, not his to bring any into the High Commiſſion for not reading this Book, is a moſt falſe averment; for Mr. <hi>VVilſon</hi> [now <note place="margin">
                     <hi>(ſ)</hi> Page 149. 150.</note> a Reverend Divine of the Aſſembly] was brought into the High Commiſſion by his owne expreſſe command and no others, as himſelfe depoſeth, who perſonally ſuſpended him before at <hi>Lambheth</hi> for that cauſe both from his <hi>Office and Benefice:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Page</hi> was by his ſpeciall order brought into the High Commiſſion as appeares by his owne Subſcription to <hi>Francis Thompſons</hi> Petition. That Mr. <hi>Snelling</hi> was there queſtioned, and ſeverely cenſured by the Archbiſhops meanes, who gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not to accept either his Anſwer or defence; and threatned to burne it; is cleare by the proofes <note n="t" place="margin">Page 151.</note> forementioned. That his cenſure was only for not publiſhing the <hi>Declaration,</hi> is evident by the ſentence it ſelfe, if well obſerved, his not <hi>bowing at the name of Jeſus,</hi> being put in only for a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, but not inſiſted on at the hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:61245:260"/>
And whereas he pretends, he was not preſent at his cenſure, which he proves not; we know he was vertually, if not perſonally preſent thereat; yea, his unjuſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his tendred Anſwer and defence, was the onely cauſe of his cenſure; which if received were ſo learned, ſolid, ſatisfactory, that prophaneneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice it ſelfe could not have impoſed ſuch a cenſure on him. Thirdly, annuall Feaſts of <hi>Dedication</hi> of Churches are not ſo ancient, but that we know their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall: The Feaſt of Dedication of the Altar, inſtituted by <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> was <hi>the</hi>

               <p>To this I anſwer in generall, that I never endeavoured to introduce Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> into our Church, nor ever maintained any Arminian opinions. For the <hi>Jeſuits Letter,</hi> it is nothing at all to me, it layes nothing to my charge in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and it was lawfull for me to read and keep it; it containes many ſtrange vile things in it againſt the Parliament, which I approve not, but deteſt. To the particulars, I anſwer; Firſt, that I did neither protect nor countenance the Arminians perſons, books or tenets; for Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> I had no hand in his Book, I countenanced it not, it was ſuppreſſed and called in by Proclamation; he was preferred by Sir <hi>Dudly Carltons</hi> meanes, not mine, who was then a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me: True is is, I was in a Declaration of the Commons houſe, taxed as a favourer, advancer of Arminians and their opinions, without any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proofe at all, which was a great ſlander to me: Secondly, I anſwer, that being publickly traduced in that Declaration, I did returne an anſwer to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my owne innocency, as was neceſſary for me to doe, to free my ſelfe from that ſcandall, without any derogation to the Parliaments authority: Neither did I this till I was expreſly commanded by the King himſelfe, as appeares by the endorſment, whoſe command it was lawfull, yea neceſſary for me to obey; and I durſt not have done it without ſuch his Royall command: After which I penned it, with all due reſpect to the Parliament, and it was never publiſhed. For my anſwer to the Parliaments Vote, it was onely a private paper kept in my Study, and communicated to none, written for my owne private ſatisfaction, and derogating noting from the power of Parliaments, it belonging properly to the Convocation and Church of <hi>England</hi> by the Lawes and Statutes of the Land, to make Canons and ſettle controverſies in Religion, as the Statute of 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. evidence: Thirdly, the calling in and ſuppreſſing of theſe Books, and proſecuting the Authors, Printers of them in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, was the Courts act, not mine: For Biſhop <hi>Carltons</hi> Book, it was called in by the High Commiſſion, and atteſted onely by Maſter <hi>Sparke,</hi> a ſingle Witneſſe; Biſhop <hi>Downhams</hi> Book was called in by the Kings ſpeciall command, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe publiſhed contrary to the his Royall Proclamation, and Declaration: For Maſter <hi>Prynnes Perpetuity,</hi> I doe not know that it was burnt in private; if it were, it was by the cenſure of the Court, there being ſome things in it liable to juſt exceptions: Doctor <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> Book is not proved to be called in by me: For Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> and thoſe that printed their Books, they were not cenſured in the High Commiſſion, but diſmiſſed thence without cenſure: For Doctor <hi>Jackson,</hi> he was a learned diſcreet man, I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed not his Book, nor doe I know he profeſſed himſelfe an Arminian: True it is, the <hi>Historicall Narration</hi> was licenſed by my Chaplaine Doctor <hi>Martin,</hi> without my privity, for which I turned him out of my ſervice, and the Book it ſelfe was called in and ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Kings Proclamation</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> before the <hi>Articles,</hi> were his owne, not mine, both publiſhed to ſettle peace in the Church, by ſilencing thoſe controverſies which diſturbed it by printing or preaching, which unquiet ſpirits would not ſubmit to, and the Authors of the Books forementioned, among
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:61245:261"/>
others, with ſome other Preachers about the City and Univerſity, for which they were juſtly queſtioned, ſuſpended, and ſome that broached Arminian Tenets in <hi>Oxford,</hi> were brought in queſtion, and ordered to recant, as well as thoſe that preached againſt it: The cenſure of Maſter <hi>Ford</hi> and his complices in <hi>Oxford,</hi> was by the King and Counſell upon a ſolemne hearing at <hi>Woodstock,</hi> not by me, and they well deſerved it, for kindling ſuch a fire in the Univerſity, as was like to ſet all in combuſtion: For the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I medled not with it: The conſiderations was not my paper, but Biſhop <hi>Harſnets,</hi> who drew them; and I did but tranſcribe them, and the end of them was not to ſupreſſe preaching againſt Arminianiſme, but to preſerve peace and order in the Church. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, they were the Kings, not mine, and they were ſent to me in a Letter by my Predeceſſor Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and brought to me by his Secretary Maſter <hi>Baker,</hi> with command to ſee them put in execution within my Dioceſſe of <hi>London;</hi> to prove which, I have produced the teſtimony of Maſter <hi>Dobſon,</hi> who affirmed it to be true. Fiftly, for the purging ſome paſſages out of Biſhop <hi>Hals</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Davenants</hi> Letter, and impriſoning Maſter <hi>Butter</hi> for printing them. I anſwer, that the ſame was done by my Chaplaine, as being contrary to his <hi>Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation and Declaration,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> himſelfe at laſt conſented to it, and was well ſatisfied upon the reaſon given him by my Chaplaine, that it was for the quiet of the Church; and therefore for the Printer of his owne head to put it in, deſerved exemplary puniſhment. Sixtly, there is no proofe that the <hi>Articles of Irreland</hi> were reverſed by my procurement, it was done by the Convocation there, where I was not preſent.</p>
               <p>To this was replied in generall, That his endeavours to introduce Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme were ſo fully cleered by the premiſed evidence, and his protection both of <note place="margin">Reply.</note> the Authors, and fomenters of it, that impudency it ſelfe would bluſh to deny it. That the <hi>Jeſuits Letter</hi> which he had in his cuſtody endorſed with his owne hand did fully diſcover to him, that <hi>the planting and introducing Arminianiſme here in England, was their Plot and chief Engine to ſubvert our Religion:</hi> And though it makes no particular mention of him, yet it informes their Superiour and others, that <hi>the Arminians had locked up the Dukes eares already;</hi> a Periphraſis of himſelfe (the Dukes <hi>Earwig,</hi> as he was then ſtiled) who had his eare more then any: His compliance therefore with the Arminians, notwithſtanding they were but the Jeſuits inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to drive on their deſignes, as he certainly knew by this Letter, much agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates his crime, and makes exceedingly againſt him: True it is, there are ſome ſtrange paſſages, concerning Parliaments in this Letter, but himſelfe hath as bad or worſe in his Diary, and Anſwer to the <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of the Commons <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. therefore certainly he diſliked not theſe in this Letter.</p>
               <p>Particularly, this replication was retorted to theſe his anſwers; Firſt, that he was a profeſſed patriot of the Arminians perſons, Books, Tenens, and particularly of Biſhop <hi>Mountagues;</hi> of whoſe cauſe he was moſt anxious and inquiſitive, whom he acquainted with his Majeſties ſpeciall favour to him while he lay under the cloud of the Parliaments diſpleaſure, his receiving all informations or ſpeeches againſt his Erronious booke; whoſe proceedings in Parliament, when there queſtioned, were daily repreſented to, and reſerved carefully by him; whoſe ill book and opinions were in ſundry conferences particularly juſtified by him, whoſe preferments proceeded originally from him, and with whom he held moſt intimate correſpondency till his death, as the forecited paſſages in his owne <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> and alleaged evidence proves moſt fully: For his advancement by Sir <hi>Dully Carltons</hi> meanes, it is but a bare ſurmiſe, contrary to the <hi>Dockquet Book</hi> to excuſe himſelfe: The <hi>Proclamation</hi> for calling in his book proceeded from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proſecution of him, not from this Biſhops care, who ordered it ſo, that it proved the chiefe inſtrument of promoting Arminianiſme, by hindring all writing and preaching againſt it what in him lay, he informing the world in the very <hi>Proclamation</hi> it ſelfe, that the Author was puniſhed onely with a good
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:61245:262"/>
Biſhoprick for writing this Book, &amp; highly advanced maugre three ſeverall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments complaints and oppoſition; In briefe, the Commons <hi>Remonstrance</hi> is a ſufficient evidence of his guilt and no ſlander at all (as he ſlanderouſly tearmes it) being verified by ſo many proofs: Secondly, his anſwer to the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of the Commons is full of bitterneſſe, ſawcineſſe, ſcandals againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, charging them with untruths in the higheſt degree, onely for ſpeaking that; which was moſt true: That he was commanded to returne this anſwer to it by the King himſelfe, without any ſuit of his owne, is very improbable, and reſts on him to prove, which he hath not done: However, he proves not that he did exceed his Commiſſion. And whereas he alleageth by way of excuſe, that his anſwer to it was never publiſhed, truly this was his griefe, as appeares by his owne endorſment of it, and no act of his, who deſired to have it printed then. Whereas he pretends he durſt not have anſwered it, had not the King commanded him; certainly he that durſt controll the Kings owne Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, under his Seale, (as he did in the caſe of the collection for the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and ſundry other particulars given in evidence againſt him,) revoke the Kings own pardons and prohibitions to the high Commiſſion, ſaying, they ſhould not ſerve the turn; yea, deprive the King of his Soveraignty, that he ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor pardon any man cenſured in the high Commiſſion, though never ſo unjuſtly; that hath preſumed ſo frequently to break off Parliaments, yea, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to diſſolve them before they were called, <hi>In caſe they prove peeviſh, &amp;c.</hi> and to write ſo of Parliaments as he hath done in other papers, durſt write ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as this without any royall mandate to encourage him: And this his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Commons Vote againſt Arminianiſme demonſtrates, which is fraught with tranſcendent contempt of their authority and proceedings therein baſely ſcorned, ſcoffed at: And the reaſons given therin, prove that it was no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate note to ſatisfie himſelf alone, but a paper purpoſely complied to incenſe the King &amp; others againſt the Commons, as the comparing it with ſome paſſages of his Diary, and diſſolving of that very Parliament in diſcontent ſoon after, will eaſily demonſtrate: For the Statutes objected, they prove no ſuch thing as in pretended, our Parliaments in all Ages (not the Convocation, who are but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſtants to the Houſes in matters of Religion, when their advice is required) having been the ſole Judges, Law-givers, determiners of all Eccleſiaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, matters of Religion, as we can prove by <note n="a" place="margin">See Truth Triumphing over Falſhood where this is largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> 
                  <hi>infinite Preſidents:</hi> Thirdly, the calling in, ſuppreſſing, burning of all the forecited books againſt Arminianiſme, with the queſtioning of the Authors and Printers of them in the high Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is directly ſworn, proved to be his act, and the Courts onely mediatly, by his procurement; the Warrants for their Citation, Commitments, were ſigned with his hand, he was the onely violent man againſt them in open Court, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions; and though many of them were not cenſured, but got off, yet it was onely by prohibitions, full ſore againſt his will, for the bringing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he threatned to lay them by the heels: However, thoſe that eſcaped beſt were there proſecuted ſundry yeers, put to great attendance and expence, many of them impriſoned, and their books all loſt or privately burnt by his direction, without any cenſure of the Court at all; as Biſhop <hi>Carltons Book againſt Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Prynnes Perpetuity,</hi> though both publikely licenſed by Archbiſhop <hi>Abbots</hi> Chaplaines; Biſhop <hi>Downhams</hi> Book (as this Archbiſhops owne Letter to Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> manifeſts) was called in by his inſtigation onely; to colour which he procured a mandate from the King; and his owne endorſment proves, that Doctor <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> Book was ſuppreſſed in the Preſſe by his procurement: For Doctor <hi>Jackson,</hi> he could not but know him to be a profeſſed Arminian, being ſo reported by all, and declaring himſelfe to be one both in his Epiſtle and Book, which, though complained of, was never ſuppreſſed nor queſtioned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Majeſties Proclamation and Declaration: For the <hi>Historicall Narration</hi> (the vileſt impoſter ever thruſt upon our Church) it was licenſed by
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:61245:262"/>
his Chaplain Doctor <hi>Martin,</hi> with his owne privity; the calling of it in was the act of Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> upon Maſter <hi>Prynnes</hi> complaint, and the publike ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall it gave, much againſt this Biſhops will, who hath ever ſince connived at the ſale of them. The turning away this his Chaplaine for it, is but a falſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for he promoted him to the Headſhip of <hi>Queens Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> and a very great living to boot, inſtead of bringing him into the high Commiſſion; and was he not then ſeverely puniſhed for ſo grand a crime? Fourthly, though the <hi>Proclamation</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> prohibiting preaching and writing on theſe controverſies, were the Kings in name and title, yet they were originally this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops meer plot and contrivance, to ſuppreſſe all <hi>Books, Diſputes, Sermons againſt Arminianiſme,</hi> to uſher it in the faſter without any oppoſition; the <hi>Arminians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext hereof, having liberty to preach, to print their errors, without check or cenſure, as our evidence abundantly proves, he making them meer ſnares to entangle all conſciencious, zealous, orthodox men, Miniſters and others, whoſe zeale excited them to appeare againſt theſe dangerous diſturbers of our <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> peace, in Preſſe, Schooles or Pulpit: For Maſter <hi>Fords</hi> and his complices ſevere cenſures in <hi>Oxford,</hi> even to expulſion and baniſhment, they proceeded meerly from his own violent proſecution, as the Evidence unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably proves; the Kings and Counſels cenſures being principally ſteered by his compaſſe, the chiefe actor, proſecutor, and Judge in this cauſe: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he pretends, that thoſe who preached or printed <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> were conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cenſured in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nverſities</hi> and elſwhere, as well as thoſe who preached againſt it; let him name but one Scholler, Miniſter, that was ever impriſoned, deprived, ſilenced, proſecuted in the high Commiſſion, or caſt out of favour for preaching, writing, printing Arminianiſme, and then perchance he may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited; but ſurely not one ſuch preſident can be found: Whereas Maſter <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> was made a Biſhop, Doctor <hi>Harſnet</hi> an Archbiſhop, Doctor <hi>Linſey</hi> promoted to two Biſhopricks, Doctor <hi>Potter,</hi> made a Deane, (to omit ſundry others) and Doctor <hi>Duppa</hi> made the Princes Tutor, Deane of Chriſt-Church, and a Biſhop too, becauſe he was an <hi>Arminian.</hi> True it is, that we find in the Univerſity Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of <hi>Oxford,</hi> pag. 50. that one Maſter <hi>Robert Rainsford</hi> (ſince a Doctor) tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching divers Arminian Tenents in a Sermon at Saint <hi>Maries,</hi> in defence of <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from foreſeen Faith,</hi> and <hi>

though after their puniſhment, and ſo his offence farre greater then theirs, who did not begin the quarrell, nor kindle the fire of the <hi>Arminian Controverſies</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> but their Oppoſites, who eſcaped ſcot-free, and were promoted by this Archbiſhop himſelfe for oppoſing, when they were thus ſeverely handled for maintaining the truth. So in <hi>London</hi> the <hi>Anti-Arminians</hi> were generally ſilenced, ſuppreſſed, the <hi>Arminians</hi> connived at, advanced, encouraged by this Prelate, under pretext of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> as the Commons in <hi>Parliament</hi> complained in their forecited <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> and as we have proved by ſundry inſtances, to which he returnes no anſwer, and ſo ſtand confeſſed by his ſilence. For <hi>Cambridge <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſity,</hi> we know he was Viſitor there, though not Chancellour, and had as great an influence upon it, if not power and activity in it, as in <hi>Oxford,</hi> giving all encouragement to the <hi>Arminian</hi> party there, advancing them to Headſhips and other preferments. For the <hi>Conſiderations</hi> they are written with his owne hand, ſavour of his ſtile, ſpirit: That Biſhop <hi>Harſnet</hi> was the compiler of them, is but his owne averment, without proofe or probability; and admit they were his in the penning, yet certainly they were his owne in the contriving, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and ſo were the <hi>Instructions,</hi> though drawne up in his Majeſties name, and ſent to Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who muſt be ordered to ſend them incloſed in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto him, onely to colour the Plot, as if it were not his; whereas the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall under his owne hand diſcovers the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the purging of thoſe objected innocent, orthodox paſſages, even out of two Biſhops Letters by his Chaplaine, was certainly by his owne command, elſe his Chaplaine durſt not be ſo bold with his Superiours of ſuch note and eminency, who if they conſented to this purgation at all, it was onely as Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conſent to throw over ſome of their goods into the Sea in a ſtorme, leaſt the whole Ship and fraight ſhould be loſt; either this muſt be expunged, or the whole Book ſuppreſſed; and all under pretext of his <hi>Majesties Declaration</hi> and the <hi>Churches peace;</hi> neither of which could reſtaine <hi>Arminian</hi> Books from the Preſſe: And whether the Stationer, <hi>Butter,</hi> deſerved to be impriſoned without Baile or Mainprize in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> to be Articled againſt in the <hi>high Commiſſion,</hi> to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine the loſſe of all his Books, and ſuffer other penalties for printing theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, the beſt part of his Book; (without which, the <hi>Letters</hi> themſelves were meere <hi>Ciphers,</hi> fragments,) let the indifferent judge, till the Archbiſhop can produce an <hi>Arminian Stationer,</hi> puniſhed in this ſort for printing Arminian Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, contrary to the Kings <hi>Proclamation</hi> and <hi>Declaration.</hi>

               <p>To which I anſwer; Firſt, That the <hi>Decree in Star-Chamber</hi> was the act of the whole Court, who likewiſe ordered it to be printed, not mine: That it was <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> made onely to regulate the abuſes of printing: That the Stationers themſelves deſired, approved, and gave me thanks for it. Secondly, That the <hi>Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Geneva Notes,</hi> was onely tolerated and connived at, not allowed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that ſome paſſages in it were abuſed, and very ill uſe made of them; as among others, that in <hi>the firſt of Exodus,</hi> which teacheth men not to obey the commands of Kings. <hi>King James</hi> himſelfe in the <hi>Conference at Hampton Court,</hi> pag. 47. publikely declared his diſlike of this tranſlation, as the <hi>worſt of all,</hi> and thereupon <hi>took care for a new tranſlation to be made, but withall gave this Caveat, that no marginal Notes ſhould be added to it, having found in them annexed to the</hi> Geneva <hi>tranſlation ſome Notes very partiall, untrue, ſeditious, and ſavouring too much of dangerous and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conceits:</hi> As for example; <hi>the firſt chapter of</hi> Exodus, <hi>and the</hi> 19. <hi>verſe, where the marginall Note alloweth diſobedience unto Kings:</hi> The endeavour to ſuppreſſe it in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> was not any extent of my power thither, but the act of Sir <hi>Will. Boſwell</hi> the Kings Agent there, who did but his duty therein. Thirdly, for Maſter <hi>Gellibrands</hi> Book, it was printed not in forme of a <hi>Calender</hi> but <hi>Almanack;</hi> it was publiſhed to diſcountenance the old Saints, and was a meer innovation, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all former Almanacks in uſe among us, and to that in the Common-prayer book: That the Queen ſent to me about it, I could not help that: That I told Maſter <hi>Gellibrand</hi> he <hi>laboured to raiſe a faction in the Court,</hi> I remember not the words; and if he did ſo, he deſerved to be cenſured for it: That the Papiſts burnt it, I could not help that: Neither did it agree with Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> his Calender, but he abuſed it, in leaving out divers Saints allowed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Epiphany</hi> and <hi>Annunciation of our Lady:</hi> For Doctor <hi>Pocklingtons</hi> Book, wherein he abuſed our Martyrs, it was licenſed by his Chaplain, Doctor <hi>Bray,</hi> who was cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it, as was Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> too, in the Lords Houſe.</p>

But it is objected, that my Chaplaines act is in law mine owne: I anſwer not, <note place="margin">Objection. Anſwer.</note> unleſſe I command it: But the Book it ſelfe was found in my Study, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> for it. I know no ſuch thing, and though I had the Book, yet I knew not of this paſſage in it. Fourthly, for the calling in of <hi>Beacons</hi> Book, printed by Miſtris <hi>Griffin,</hi> it is nothing to me what a Jeſuit ſaid of it; and if called in, it was becauſe ſhe reprinted it contrary to the Star-chamber Decree. Fiftly, for the <hi>Palſgraves Religion,</hi> I remember it not, and if called in, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was contrary to the <hi>Kings Declaration,</hi> and touched upon ſome points of controverſie prohibited by it. Sixtly, the hindring of the reprinting of Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Jewell,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Willet,</hi> was no act of mine. Seventhly, I hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the printing of no new Books againſt Popery. Eightly, the queſtioning of Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> and the reſt in the High Commiſſion, was no act of mine, but the Courts; nor were they cenſured, but got off without cenſure: Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> ſaid, he was queſtioned before the Counſell Table for one of his Books, as a Libell: If it were a Libell, there was cauſe to doe it. He added, he could not be quiet for being troubled in the high Commiſſion; nor could the Church be quiet for him, which was the cauſe of his trouble. He affirmed, I committed him to the Fleet, and denied him the benefit of the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi> I anſwer, there was cauſe enough for his commitment, for printing of Books without licenſe, and for diſturbing the peace of the Church, and he had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> becauſe the reaſon of his commitment was expreſſed in the Warrant. Ninthly, I licenſed none of the particular books forecited my ſelfe, nor any of my Chaplains to my knowledge, I am certaine not by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and if any of them have tranſgreſſed herein, themſelves muſt anſwer for it, not I; who having many other weighty publike affaires to look after, had no time to peruſe or licenſe Books my ſelfe, and was enforced to commit this truſt to their care. Tenthly, to the particular books I anſwer, Firſt, that though <hi>Sales</hi> his book was licenſed by my Chaplaine, yet he was abuſed therein, by the Tranſlator &amp; Printer, who was puniſhed for it in Star-chamber: The book it ſelf was called in and burnt by Proclamation, and I diſmiſſed the Doctor for licenſing it out of my houſe and ſervice: For <hi>Christs Epistle to a devout Soule,</hi> it was licenſed at <hi>London Houſe,</hi> by Doctor <hi>Weeks,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Chaplain, not mine, and ſo nothing to me; beſides, it was ſuppreſſed before it was publiſhed: For Doctor <hi>Heylins</hi> Books, they are nothing to me, I had no hand in them, nor yet in Doctor <hi>Pocklingtons,</hi> who hath been cenſured for them himſelfe: For Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Impreſſions, they concerne not me, I did neitheir adviſe nor authorize them: For the <hi>Lives of the Emperours,</hi> which commend the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> the Book was not licenſed, and I know not of it. For the Popiſh <hi>Index Biblicus</hi> printed in <hi>England,</hi> it is nothing to me, it was without my privity and direction: For the ſeverall popiſh paſſages objected out of ſome newbooks, the Authors themſelvs muſt anſwer them at their perill, they concerne not me: For the rejecting of Maſter <hi>Prynnes Croſſe Bill in Star-chamber,</hi> complaining of theſe popiſh Books and Doctrines, it was none of my act, but the Courts and Lord Keeper <hi>Coventries;</hi> and ſo was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burtons</hi> cenſure for his Book, in which I gave no Vote: For Maſter <hi>Croxtons</hi> Letter to me with a Croſſe, enjoyning Auricular confeſſion, I could not hinder it, nor his practiſe of confeſſion being in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And for the paſſages objected out of mine owne <hi>Speech in Star-chamber,</hi> that they imply and neceſſarily inferre the popiſh <hi>Doctrine of Tranſubstantiation,</hi> and the giving of divine worſhip to the Altar, even the ſame that is given to God. I anſwer, that neither of theſe can be inferred from thence; for my words onely imply, <hi>that Christs body is truly and really preſent in the Sacrament;</hi> yet not corporally, but in a ſpirituall manner, and ſo is received by us; which is no more then Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe affirmes on the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. where thus he writes: <hi>Neque enim mortis tantum &amp; Reſurrectionis ſuae beneficium nobis offert Christus, ſed corpus ſuum in quo paſſus eſt &amp; Reſurrexit: Concludo, REALITER (ut vulgo loquuntur) id eſt, VERE Nobis in Coena datur Chriſti corpus, ut ſic A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Nostris in Cibum ſalutarem;</hi> and Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> himſelfe faith as much. For my words, that we ſhould bow <hi>DEO ET ALTARI,</hi> which are coupled both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Conjunction Copulative, yea both bowed to at the ſelf-ſame time, in one and the ſame act, and the worſhip directed to, and terminated in both alike: <hi>Ergo,</hi> divine worſhip is given to the Altar herein as well as to God, which is flat Idolatry, or but ſuch civill reverence given to God as is rendred to the Altar; which is to diſhonour God, and gives him no greater worſhip in his houſe then is due unto a creature: I anſwer, that though the act of bowing be the ſame to both, yet the object, mind and intention being different, the worſhip muſt be ſo too; There is a double worſhip and bowing, one of the body, the other of the heart, as Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> himſelfe diſtinguiſheth; which is properly called Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, when done but to a creature in a civill reſpect, and worſhip onely when given to God himſelf.</p>
               <p>To this was replied, Ferſt, that this <hi>Decree of Star-chamber</hi> concerning printing was onely his owne act originally, who projected and put that Court upon it, <note place="margin">Reply.</note> (whereof he was an over-potent Member) theirs onely Miniſterially, to ſatisfie his importunity therein, as the forecited Paſſages in the Decreee it ſelfe, and our Witneſſes atteſt: Yea, the printing of it was by his own command, to enlarge his Juriſdiction, which it much advanced: We grant that ſome things in the Decree were good, approved of by the <hi>Stationers,</hi> who deſired the ſame, of which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not, and ſome particulars very uſefull, had a right uſe been made of them. But the prohibiting reprinting of all Orthodox Books formerly printed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unleſſe re-licenſed by him or his Agents; the deniall of any old book to be reprinted even againſt Popery it ſelfe, with the ſuppreſſing or purging moſt new Books againſt Popery, under pretext of this Decree, and the arbitrary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſuch who tranſgreſſed herein both in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> and <hi>High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> was a tranſcendent crime, of which this Arch-prelat and his Confederates (not the whole Court of <hi>Star-chamber)</hi> were onely culpable: Yea, the <hi>Stationers</hi> were ſo farre from being well pleaſed with, or returning him thanks for this, that they complained to the chiefe Juſtice, and groaned under the preſſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Secondly, the <hi>Engliſh Bible</hi> with the <hi>Geneva Notes,</hi> was not onely tolerated but printed and reprinted among us in <hi>England, Cum Privilegio,</hi> during Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> and King <hi>James Reignes;</hi> and in 15. <hi>Jacobi</hi> there was an Impreſſion of them printed here by the Kings own Printer; ſince which time, the <hi>new Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> without Notes being moſt vendible (the Kings Printers forbearing to print them for their private lucre, not by vertue of any publike reſtraint) they were uſually imported from beyond the Seas, and publickly ſold without any inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or puniſhment, till this Archbiſhops time, who made it no leſſe then an <hi>High Commiſſion crime,</hi> to vend, bind or import them. For the Notes, they are generally approved by all our <hi>Protestant Divines,</hi> which fled hence for Religion in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, who dedicated the ſame to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For the Note on <hi>Exodus</hi> 1. it is both ſound and Orthodox, condemning onely obedience to the arbitrary, tyranicall, unjunſt (not lawfull) commands of Kings, contrary to the Lawes of God, nature, men, being warranted by the example of the <hi>Midwives,</hi> who diſobeyed King <hi>Pharaohs bloody Mandate, in not murdering all the male Children of the Iſraelites,</hi> by ſundry other <note n="d" place="margin">Eſter 3, 2, 3, Dan. 2. 5. to 17 cap. 3. 3. to 30 cap. 6. 5. to 21. 1 Sam. 22. 17, 18. 2 Sam. 1. 2, 10.

                  </note> Canoniſts themſelves, who ſpeake as much or more then this <hi>Annotation</hi> doth. For King <hi>James</hi> his cenſure of this Tranſlation and Notes upon it, no doubt it proceeded from ſome Prelats miſ-information: However, we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that his own inſerting of popiſh Pictures of the Birth, Life, Paſſion, Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Aſcention of Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, the Apoſtles, yea the very Aſſumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the like, into our Engliſh, and of a Popiſh <hi>Index</hi> into our Latin Bibles, was farre worſe, more dangerous then any <hi>Geneva Notes;</hi> and the prohibition of inſerting Marginall Notes into the Bible, a policy learned from our Engliſh Prelats in King HRNRY the eighth his

Reigne, who when they could not hinder the printing of the Bible it ſelfe <hi>in Engliſh, of Master Tyndals Tranſlation;</hi> yet procured an Act of Parliament for the <hi>Obliterating of his Notes thereon;</hi> as the Statute of 35. Hen. VIII. cap. 1. and Maſter <note n="f" place="margin">Acts &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, vol. 2. p. 586. 587.</note> 
                  <hi>Fox</hi> informes us: And his endeavour to hinder the importation of Bibles with Notes from <hi>Holland,</hi> of which he had information by two Letters ſent from thence, diſcovers his vigilance, yea, ſpite againſt this Tranſlation and the Notes upon it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for Maſter <hi>Gellibrands</hi> Almanacke, ſet forth by his ſervant, it was agreeable to Maſter <hi>Foz his Calender;</hi> onely inſerting our Engliſh Martyrs in the place of popiſh Saints; no High Commiſſion crime by any knowne Law; That it differed from other Almanacks herein, is no greater offence, then for one Almanack-maker to vary from another in calculating the Weather, or other <hi>Astronomicall Obſervations,</hi> who better deſerve an High Commiſſion cenſure for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the names of ſundry Popiſh Saints, (yea arrant Traytors, as <hi>Becket, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme,</hi> with ſundry others) omitted in the Calender of the Common-Prayer Book, and agreeing Verbatim with the Calender in the <hi>Roman Miſſall,</hi> then he, for omitting the names of Romiſh Saints, whom God never Canonized, but the Pope alone, for their zeale or ſufferings for the Papall Cauſe and Romiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions. The Queens ſending to him about this Almanack, ſhewes, that the Papiſts took it to be a great blow to their Religion; and though he could not hinder the meſſage, yet certainly he might have ſurceaſed all proſecution of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Gellibrand</hi> upon the Queens and Papiſts complaints for this act of his, where as he purſued him with al violence to gratifie them. For the words he remembers not, our Witneſſe ſwears them preciſely, and his threatning Maſter <hi>Gellibrand</hi> upon a meere groundleſſe ſuppoſition, that he had raiſed a faction in the Court, becauſe they acquitted him full ſore againſt his will; argues both his violence and injuſtice: That the Papiſts burnt it, when he could not attaine the burning of it in the High Commiſſion, argues their malice, and his owne readineſſe to comply with them againſt ſo good a work, in honour of our owne Engliſh Proteſtant Martyrs. For his omiſſion of ſome Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Epiphany</hi> and <hi>Anunciation,</hi> no man knew them to be Saints till now, but onely Feſtivals, which other Almanacks mentioned, and it is onely alleaged not proved that he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. For Doctor <hi>Pocklingtons Altare Christianum,</hi> it was licenſed by his owne Chaplaine Doctor <hi>Bray,</hi> yea publiſhed by his owne command, without the Authors privity, if we beleeve his Petition to the Lords; and their two puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cenſures in the Lords Houſe for this Book, adjudged to the fire and burnt, is no extenuation, but aggravation of his guilt, the moſt culpable of all three: Himſelfe confeſſeth, that his Chaplaines act is his owne in Law, if he command it, and this Doctor himſelfe affirmes, that he did command its print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore the act is his more then the Authors or his Chaplains, who did but obey his ſuperiour command. That Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> did preſent him with both the printed Impreſſions of this Book, curiouſly gilt, he cannot deny, they being found in his Study endorſed with his owne hand: That he knew not of this paſſage in it againſt our Martyrs, and in honour of Popiſh Saints, is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea, impoſſible, ſince generally complained of in print, and particularly by Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> at the Pillory, who deſired all to take notice of it; of which the Archbiſhop had preſent information, yet neither recalled the book nor oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the paſſage.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the calling in of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Beacons book againſt the Maſſe,</hi> upon the complaint of a Prieſt or Jeſuit, with his words and threats to Miſtris <hi>Griffin,</hi> for reprinting it at ſuch a time as this, reflect as fouly upon him as poſſible yet he puts it off with this impudent common ſhift, <hi>It is nothing to me:</hi> For the reprinting and his calling of it in, it is directly ſworne to be before the Star-chamber Decree, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not done in purſuance of it; and were it done after, yet not juſtifiable without higheſt impudency by any true Proteſtant Prelate.</p>

                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:61245:265"/>
Fiftly, for the <hi>Palſgraves Religion,</hi> it is proved to be called in by him, who hath the happineſſe to forget all the evil deeds which he cannot juſtifie, though others ſweare them: And it was not contrary to the Kings Declaration (which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe originally contrived) in the Kings intention, but in his owne perverting of it, to ſuppreſſe the truth. Sixtly, the hindering of the reprinting of Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> and Doctor <hi>Willets</hi> Works, was certainly his owne act, becauſe done by colour of this <hi>Star-chamber Decree,</hi> procured by himſelfe for this very purpoſe, and the reprinting of them was ſtopped by his owne <hi>Officers,</hi> creatures meanes, who knew his mind, if not received his command herein: Seventhly, himſelfe, if not immediatly, yet originally and mediatly hindered the printing of all the new Books againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> refuſed at the Preſſe, and denied licenſe by his Inſtruments, Chaplaines, Doctor <hi>Bray,</hi> Doctor <hi>Haywood,</hi> Doctor <hi>Weekes,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Baker,</hi> unleſſe firſt purged by them.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, the queſtioning of Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> with their Printers and Stationers in the High Commiſſion, for their Books againſt Doctor <hi>Coſins</hi> his popery, <hi>Babel</hi> no <hi>Bethel, Baiting of the Popes Bull,</hi> and the like, was originally his act alone, not the Courts, which did naught in it but by his inſtigation: Their getting off thence was by <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> ſore againſt his will, where elſe he reſolved to ruine them. Maſter <hi>Burtons</hi> anſwering the <hi>Popes Bull</hi> by licenſe, deſerved no queſtioning at the Counſell Table, and was certainly no <hi>Libell</hi> at all, unleſſe the Pope or his <hi>Partiſans</hi> deemed it ſuch to them: His Books then were no trouble to the Church, and therefore it was ſtrange and moſt unjuſt he ſhould be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them; yea, his impriſonment without Baile (which he tendered) when bailable by Law, was contrary to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> though the cauſe of it (not warranted by Law) was expreſſed in the Warrant. Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his owne Chaplaines overſights and offences in licenſing popiſh Books, even with this ſpeciall <hi>Encomium, that there was nothing in them contrary to faith and ſound Doctrine</hi> (the forme of licenſing himſelfe preſcribed them under his owne hand) is certainly both in law and juſtice, his owne crime more then theirs, who muſt anſwer for it much more then they; the truſt of licenſing books being originally repoſed in himſelfe by the State, and in his Chaplaines onely by his owne Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for <note n="g" place="margin">See 27.

of Reformation in any of his Predeceſſors times, by themſelves or their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, neither durſt ſuch erronious pamphlets appeare publickly amongſt us, till he grew great to patronize them; yea, when they were thus licenſed, and publickly complained againſt, as <hi>Popiſh, erronious, and deſtructive to our Religion,</hi> he cenſured, perſecuted ſuch who durſt complaine or write againſt them, never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning nor puniſhing the Licenſers, Printers or Authors of them exemplarily as he ſhould have done, to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in him, and vindicate his ſincerity herein; whereas if any new Book againſt <hi>Arminians</hi> or <hi>Popiſh Innovations</hi> did but privily paſſe the Preſſe by licenſe of his Predeceſſors Chaplaines (as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Carltons</hi> Book againſt <hi>Mountague,</hi> Maſter <hi>Prynnes Perpetuity,</hi> his <hi>Survey of Maſter Cozens</hi> his <hi>Cozening Devotions, Hiſtriomaſtix,</hi> with other forenamed Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did) he preſently ſuppreſſed, burnt them, queſtioned the Authous, Printers, Diſperſers, Licenſers of them, both in the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> and <hi>Star-chamber</hi> too, where Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> by his meanes, was cenſured in the higheſt degree of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity for his <hi>Hiſtriomaſtix,</hi> a licenſed Book, and Maſter <hi>Buckner</hi> too, who licenſed it, fined by this Archbiſhop himſelfe and that Court; therefore this act of his Chaplaines muſt reſt upon his own head, and the guilt thereof lye heavieſt upon him, whoſe fault it was to make choyce of ſuch, and to entruſt them in this kind. As for his excuſe of his many other grand imployments, which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed his time, that he had no leiſure to peruſe what Books were tendred and licenſed for the Preſſe, it is ſo farre from being any excuſe, that it aggavates his crime: Certainly the preſervation of our Religion in its purity, the keeping out all Popiſh innovations in Ceremony, Doctrine, Worſhip, and the ſuppreſſion of Popiſh errours, Books, Doctrines, were the principall things of all others, which his Place, Calling, yea, his Majeſties truſt engaged him to look unto; for him then to neglect this principall part of his Epiſcopall duty, the frequent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods Word (he ſeldome appearing in the Pulpit after he became Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop and a Privy Counſellour) to drowne himſelfe in all manner of ſecular imployments in the Star-chamber, Counſel-Chamber, Exchequer, ſpending his time in proling about Tobacco; Licenſes, illegall Taxes, Projects, Monopolies of all ſorts, contrary to the Lawes and Liberties of the Subjects, in undermining Parliaments, oppreſſing the people every where, and managing the Kings Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, (things no way ſuitable to his ſpirituall Function;) is ſo farre from exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, that it puts the higheſt degree of aggravation upon this his negligence and Chaplaines miſdemeanours, which he ſhould have better looked too: But admit the reall duties of his Place alone had been overburthenſome to him, he ſhould then have intruſted, imployed ſuch in Licenſing and peruſing Books, who would have diſcharged the truſt repoſed in them, in farre better manner then his knowne Popiſh and Arminian Chaplains did. Tenthly, to his excuſes touching the particular Popiſh Books objected: We anſwer, firſt, that <hi>Sales</hi> his Booke was Licenſed by Doctor <hi>Haywood,</hi> his own Chaplain: that he was not abuſed in it, but the Printer, whom he checked for complaining to him of the Popiſh paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Booke, and encouraged to proceed in the printing of it, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he durſt not have printed. That it was afterwards called in and publickly burnt, was no thanks to him or his Chaplain, but to Maſter <hi>Prynnes</hi> croſſe Bill againſt him and his Chaplaine in <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for licenſing it; As for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> for calling it in, it was but a meere device to abuſe the King, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to juſtifie or excuſe his peccant Chaplain and himſelfe, by a moſt falſe relation of the carriage of the buſineſſe. Beſides, if his Chaplain was innocent, Why then doth he pretend, he puniſhed him by turning him out of his ſervice? If guilty, Why doth he juſtifie him to the King and Kingdome by this <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> But indeed this pretended puniſhment was but a meere pretence; for he puniſhed him onely with a good Living, to wit, <hi>Saint Giles</hi> in the Fields, ſending him from <hi>Lambeth</hi> thither to infect that Pariſh with his Popiſh Leproſie, or to pleaſe the Papiſts, Prieſts, Jeſuits, of which there were more reſiding in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh

alone, then in all the Pariſhes about <hi>London.</hi> For <hi>Christs Epistle to a Devout Soule,</hi> that it was licenſed by Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> at <hi>London-houſe</hi> the ſelf-ſame day that <hi>Sales</hi> was at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> is true, but yet it is as true that Doctor <hi>Weeks</hi> was this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops owne Chaplaine, and the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> his meer creature Servant, yea it appears there was a ſtrong confederacy between the Chaplaines of <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>London-houſe</hi> in licenſing both theſe Popiſh Books for the ſame Stationer the ſelf-ſame day, to propagate and licenſe Popery with a witneſſe, even juſt at that very ſeaſon, (which makes it more remarkable) when Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Bastwicke</hi> were proſecuted by their good Lord and Maſter <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Star-chamber, for oppoſing their Popiſh Innovations, Impoſitions, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins, and juſt when the gaudy <hi>Crucifix</hi> was erected by him at <hi>White-hall</hi> in the Kings owne Chappell in Paſſion week, they then thinking all cock-ſure on their ſide: That this Epiſtle was ſuppreſſed, we may thank, not the Archbiſhop, but Maſter <hi>Prynn's Croſſe-bill,</hi> who but a few weeks after was ill requited with a bloody barbarous cenſure for his paines, and ſent away hence cloſe priſoner, firſt, into <hi>North-Wales,</hi> then into <hi>Jerſey,</hi> where none muſt have acceſſe unto him, to prevent any more ſuch oppoſitions, diſcoveries of popiſh Bookes and Bils againſt them. For Doctor <hi>Heylins</hi> Books complained of, they were ſome of them purpoſely written by the Archbiſhops owne command, as he hath confeſſed <hi>(to wit,</hi> that againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burton</hi> &amp; <hi>Antidotum Lincolnienſes)</hi> &amp; licenſed by his own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines; therefore they concerne him much: For Doctor <hi>Pocklingtons</hi> Popiſh Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, they were peruſed by himſelfe, yea, publiſhed by his direction without the Doctors privity, as his Petition manifeſts; therefore his cenſure for writing them, will be no excuſe for his owne publiſhing, or his Chaplaines authorizing them without the Doctors knowledge or deſire: For Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Books, they were all bound up (moſt of them with his Armes very rightly gilt) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him by <hi>Mountague</hi> himſelfe; after that, entertained by him in his Study, juſtified by him in private conferences, yea, the later of them expreſly ſubmitted to his judgement, diſpoſe, and licenſed by his Chaplaines; and yet are they nothing to him? For the Epitome of the <hi>Lives of the Emperours,</hi> it was licenſed by his owne Chaplaine Doctor <hi>Weekes,</hi> at <hi>London-houſe,</hi> as the licenſe and entry of it in the Stationers Hall (which we have here ready to produce) atteſts: That he took no notice of it, nor of what was in it, was his owne voluntary negligence, who could take notice of any the leaſt pretended <hi>Puritannicall, Anti-epiſcopall,</hi> or <hi>Anti-Arminian</hi> paſſages in all new printed Books whatſoever; yea, of any harſh paſſages againſt the Pope, Papiſts, Jeſuits, and cauſe them to be ſuppreſſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, and the Authors of them ſometimes to be deeply cenſured: For the Popiſh <hi>Index Biblicus,</hi> being printed here in <hi>London,</hi> then publikely bound up with our Latin Bibles of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> tranſlation (with which they as well accorded as Fire doth with Water, or Popery with Proteſtaniſme) it concerned him moſt of any thing to take notice of, and have moſt ſeverely puniſhed: But this vigilant <hi>Argus</hi> againſt <hi>Protestaniſme,</hi> or any thing that trenched upon Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, Popiſh Ceremonies, Arminianiſme, or the High Commiſſion, was here as blind as a Beetle, and could eſpye no Books at all (though never ſo groſſe) that made for Popery and popiſh Innovations, or elſe fell faſt aſleep, when he ſhould watch againſt theſe popiſh enemies, who ſowed their Tarts ſo faſt among us.</p>
               <p>For the objected popiſh paſſages out of theſe now Authorized Printed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, himſelfe muſt anſwer for them:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe many of them were particularly complained againſt by Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> in his Sermon for God and the King; by Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> in his Croſſe Bill, which he read, and by ſundry printed <hi>Books,</hi> which he could not but take notice of; yet he neither ſuppreſſed the Books, nor queſtioned the Authors, Printers or diſperſers of them.

Office as Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to ſuppreſſe and extirpate, whereas he autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and propagated them all he could. For the rejecting of Maſter <hi>Prynnes</hi> Croſſe Bill in <hi>Star-chamber</hi> againſt him, his Chaplaines and Confederates for Writing, Licenſing, Publiſhing theſe Popiſh Books and Paſſages, it was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally his owne Act, who ſtopped it at the Lord Keepers; was preſent when it was rejected in open Court (where he ſat as one of the moſt ſwaying Judges) and endeavoured to have brought him in danger of his life, onely for preferring it in a Legall manner; whereas had he, his Chaplaines, Confederates been Innocent, they would have Petitioned the Court it might have been received, that ſo they might legally have cleared themſelves (if they could) of that, which now (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) we have fully proved before an Higher Tribunall, for which this cauſe by Gods providence was reſerved, as the fitteſt Court both to heare and cenſure it. For Maſter <hi>Croxtons</hi> Letter; he was his owne creature, ſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by him to the Lord Deputy <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who preferred him for his ſake: and he that durſt preferre ſuch a Popiſh Prieſt in that Popiſh Kingdome, who dared thus openly to put the Maſſe-Prieſts, yea Jeſuits badge of a <hi>Croſſe</hi> in the Front of his Letter to him, and acquaint him with this open practice of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion;</hi> muſt doubtleſſe be no wel-wiſher to our Religion, and aſſured of the Archbiſhops readineſſe to concur with him in the approbation of his courſes, elſe he durſt not write thus to him.</p>
               <p>As for that paſſage in his <hi>Speech in Star-chamber;</hi> we have <note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 203. 204</note> already proved, that it neceſſarily implyes a <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or corporall preſence of Chriſt on the very Altar. For, <hi>there</hi> (ſaith he, not in and to the beleevers heart, receiving him ſpiritually by faith) <hi>tis, Hoc eſt corpus meum, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>A greater reverence no doubt is due TO THE BODY, then to the word of the Lord.</hi> Its true, our 28. Article re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, That <hi>in the Lords Supper, to ſuch as rightly, worthily and with faith receive the ſame, the bread which we breake is a partaking of the Body of Chriſts which is given, taken and eaten in the Supper, ONLY after an heavenly and ſpirituall manner. And the meane whereby the Body of Chriſt is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.</hi> And in this ſence Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> writes, that <hi>the very Body of Chriſt wherein he ſuffered and roſe againe, is offered to us, &amp; REALLY &amp; TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LY given unto us in the Supper, in a ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner onely.</hi> But did ever our <hi>Articles,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And where doth Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> ſay Chriſts body is, which we really and truly receive in the Lords Supper? What? on the Altar? there is no ſuch ſyllable in him; but the very next words, which the Biſhop purpoſely concealed, reſolve us, that it is in heaven; <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> Pope (to omit the Bredden Wafer) into the very Throne of God himſelfe, and Deifying them both with divine Titles, Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Attributes, Epithites, Oriſons, and the like; therefore no reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete this clauſe, that <hi>it trencheth on the firſt Commandement:</hi> the rather, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe affirmes it in direct termes, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3, 4. as all orthodox Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors reſolve: Secondly, its agreed by all Proteſtants, yea, by this Arch-Prelat himſelfe (in ſhew at leaſt, when his reputation ſeemed to be ſomewhat blaſted, as if he were devoted to Popery) and expreſly reſolved by our <hi>Homilies againſt the perill of Idolatry,</hi> that <hi>Popery expreſly trencheth upon the ſecond Commandement ſundry wayes, as by adoring Crucifixes, Images, Saints, Angels, Reliques, Altars, the conſecrated Hoaſt, yea, by invocation of Saints departed, and introduction of ſundry Idolatrous Superstitious Rites, Ceremonies, formes of Worſhip, invented by Popes, Prieſts, Fryars, into the Worſhip of God:</hi> Therefore had he deleted its intrenchment upon the firſt Commandement as dubious, yet ſince there is no queſtion of their tranſgreſſing the ſecond in all theſe particulars, his abolition thereof is inexcuſable, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes his popiſh diſpoſition: Thirdly, however had he deleted this likewiſe, yet his obliterating that which followes, <hi>againſt connivance at, and ſuſpention of Lawes againſt Popery and Papists for luchre ſake, leaſt God make the gaine gotten by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding betwixt him and Idols, to be like that of</hi> Solomons, <hi>which was recompenced with the loſſe and dividing of his Kingdome betwixt his Sonne and a Stranger, &amp;c.</hi> (the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whereof we have lately felt) with all other paſſages whatſoever againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (eſpecially at this juncture of time, when all forraigne popiſh Princes had confederated to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion in forraigne parts, as the firſt deleted paſſage informes us) is ſuch an unſufferable execrable crime, in one who pretends himſelfe a Proteſtant Biſhop, and had then no legall authority to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or licenſe Books for the Preſſe, as deſerves the higheſt cenſure; yea, diſplays to all the world the hidden Popery of his heart, if not his ſecret correſpondency with the Romiſh party to replant their falſe ſuperſtitious Religion and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in our Church; and from this originall purgation of his, we may viſibly diſcover, that all ſucceeding expunctions of this kind made by his owne chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains and other Agents at <hi>Lambeth</hi> or <hi>London-houſe,</hi> proceeded primarily from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the originall cauſe and Author of them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection of this kind is, my alterations of the Prayers <note n="y" place="margin">See here pag 246. 247.</note> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the fift of <hi>November,</hi> in ſome particular cauſes in the Impreſſion of them, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objection</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1635.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that theſe alterations were not made by me, but the <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Prayers were ſent unto me altered by the King himſelfe, who commanded me to ſee them printed according to thoſe alterations; and I have here the Books, with his Majeſties hand and Warrant to each of them for what I did: Secondly, that the expreſſions were ſomewhat overharſh, and fit to be altered, terming their very <hi>Religion, Rebellion,</hi> being but the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and the ſame with <hi>Ours,</hi> as I have proved at large in my Speech in <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> to which I muſt referre, where I have rendred reaſons for it, which gave generall ſatisfaction then, and I hope will doe ſo to your Lordſhips now.</p>
               <p>To which was replied, Firſt, that the Archbiſhop ſhewes his great undutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe here in caſting this and other his unwarrantable popiſh actions on the King <note place="margin">Reply.</note> himſelfe: Secondly, that for ought appeares he procured from the King this Warrant ſince the alterations were printed, yea complained of, and that by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvention: Thirdly, that it had been his duty to have diſſwaded the King from giving way to ſuch ſcandalous alterations in favour of Jeſuits, Papiſts,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:61245:268"/>
Traitors, and their bloody Religion. Fourthly, that himſelfe in his Speech, page 33, 34. confeſſeth, <hi>he made the Alterations himſelfe by the Kings command:</hi> Therefore the Book was not ſent him altered by the King or any other, as now he falſly pretends. Fiftly, as for the grounds of the moſt groſſe alteration men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in his <hi>Speech,</hi> we have <note n="z" place="margin">Page 247, 248, 249.</note> already refuted them at large in the Charge; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall not <hi>actum agere,</hi> but refer you thereunto.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, that it is not proved that I made theſe Purgations: Secondly, that I have given a full anſwer to, and ſhewed there was reaſon for the making of them, in my SPEECH <hi>in Star-chamber,</hi> where they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>To this was replied, Firſt, that himſelfe doth both confeſſe and juſtifie thèſe <note place="margin">Reply.</note> purgations in his ſaid <hi>Speech, to be made by himſelfe,</hi> and his confederated brethren, to whom the care of this <hi>Faſt was committed;</hi> therefore he much forgets himſelfe here in denying it to be proved, when we undeniably evidenced it, by his owne printed Confeſſion: Secondly, we have already <note n="b" place="margin">Page 242, 250, 251.</note> refuted his reaſons for thoſe purgations mentioned in his Speech, diſcovering their abſurdity, and fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that they were made meerly in favour of Popery, to which he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the leaſt ſhadow of anſwer; therefore we ſhall acquieſſe therein without further reply.</p>
               <p>The <note n="c" place="margin">Page 251, 252.</note> fourth objected alterations and purgations aſcribed to my ſelfe, are in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objection</hi> 4.</note> Doctor <hi>Potters</hi> Book, entituled, <hi>Want of Charity, &amp;c.</hi> the ſecond Edition.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, that he writ to me of his own accord, to <hi>alter or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect any thing I thought meet in the ſecond Impreſſion of his Book,</hi> and what I did therein <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> was upon his owne requeſt: Secondly, that the expreſſions I adviſed him to amend, were either ſuch as were very harſh, as <hi>Beleeve in the Pope;</hi> or ſomewhat obſcure, as <hi>The Idol of Rome,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, that his expoſition of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 11. <hi>Dic Eccleſiae, &amp;c.</hi> concernes not the Parliament, but the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or Civill Court of the Jewes: And whereas it is urged, that I writ, his <hi>Expoſition of it, ſeemes to give as much power to the Parliament, as to the Church (or Convocation) in Church affaires,</hi> which is a derogation to the Parliaments Juriſdiction; I conceive it to be none, ſince it appeares by the Statute of 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. that the Parliament cannot determine any thing in matter of Religion, without aſſent of the Clergy in their Convocation; this Act, providing, <hi>That the High Commiſſioners ſhall not in any wiſe adjudge any matter to be Hereſie, but onely ſuch as hath beene heretofore determined, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or adjudged to be Hereſie by the authority of the Canonicall Scriptures, or by the firſt foure generall Councels, or any of them, &amp;c. or ſuch as ſhall be hereafter ordered, judged or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be Hereſie by the high Court of Parliament in this Realme,</hi> WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CLERGY IN THEIR CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOCATION. Fourthly, that I did not alter or raſe out thoſe paſſages, but onely left them to the Doctors owne conſideration, who thereupon of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amended and left them out.</p>
               <p>To this was replied, Firſt, that Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> writ to him onely to <hi>correct or alter by his ſervant Master</hi> Dell <hi>or others, any thing in his Booke</hi> OFFENSIVE <note place="margin">Reply.</note> TO HIM: To which he returned this anſwer; <hi>I have done that which you have ſo deſired, &amp;c.</hi> So as theſe very paſſages againſt the Pope and Papiſts were <hi>offenſive to him,</hi> as well as to them; at which (as it ſeems by the Doctors Letter) he had formerly taken ſome offence, elſe why ſhould he thus write to him, <hi>to alter and correct any thing in his Booke offenſive to his</hi> GRACE? It ſeemes by this, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever offended the Pope or Papiſts (be it but an harſh expreſſion) offended his Grace too, who was all for <hi>Charitable expreſſions towards them,</hi> who are ſo uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable towards us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the expreſſions themſelves: The firſt of them is not ſo harſh, as true and fitting, ſince Papiſts not onely beleeve the <hi>Pope,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">See <hi>Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Triumphus Bellarmini,</hi> &amp; others paſſim.</note> 
                  <hi>but beleeve in him too;</hi>
                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:61245:269"/>
viz. <hi>That his Expoſition of Scripture is infallible; that he cannot erre in his chaire; that this Lord God the Pope, cannot onely pardon ſinnes, and releaſe ſoules out of purgatory at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but infallibly ſave all ſuch who adhere to, beleeve in, and truſt upon him for ſalvation.</hi> The latter of them, <hi>the Idol of Rome,</hi> is a proper Periphraſis or Character of the Pope himſelfe, who is there <note n="e" place="margin">See <hi>Morney</hi> his Myſtery of Iniquity.</note> 
                  <hi>idolized, adored</hi> ſundry wayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the deleting his expoſition on <hi>Matth,</hi> 18. 17, 18. upon the reaſon rendred by him, is both derogatory and deſtructive to the <hi>Eccleſiasticall Juriſdiction of Parliaments,</hi> in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes and affaires, which <note n="f" place="margin">See Truth triumphing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Falſhood.</note> 
                  <hi>our Parliaments have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes judged, ſetled, establiſhed in all Ages, oft times without, yea againſt the Clergies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Convocation onely propounded, adviſed, and ſubmitted wholly to the Parliaments judgement:</hi> Yea, our Parliaments have made Lawes concerning Hereſie, its puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and matters of Religion, ſometimes without the Clergies conſent, as it is evident by the Statutes of 25 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 28 Hen. VIII. c. 10. 35 Hen. VIII. c. 5. 1 Edw. 6. c. 1. 2. &amp; 12. with others: Sometimes upon their Petition and earneſt requeſt, as 5 Ric. II. c. 5. 2. Hen. IV. c. 15. (repealed, though never truly a Statute, ſince the Commons never conſented to them) 2 Hen. V. c. 7. Sometimes by their requeſt and advice too, as 31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 34 Hen. VIII. c. 1. 1 k 2 Ph. &amp; Mary, c. 6. As for the Statute of 1 Eliz. c. 1. it no wayes inferres, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelfe cannot adjudge or determine any Eccleſiaſticall matters without the aſſent of the Clergy in the Convocation (for then they had never caſt our Popery and the Popes uſurped authority which the Clergy ſtill maintained, nor wrought any reformation of Religion in our preſent or former Parliaments) but onely Enacts, <hi>That the High Commiſſioners ſhall adjudge nothing to be Hereſie, not formerly reſolved to be ſo (as this Act expreſſeth) but what the Parliament ſhall adjudge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rder and determine to be Hereſie by aſſent of the Clergie in their Convocation;</hi> from whence no argument can be deduced, but this Nonſequitur; The High Commiſſioners can judge no new opinion to be, nor puniſh it as Hereſie, unleſſe the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> firſt adjudge it to be Hereſie with the aſſent of the Clergy in Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the expreſſe proviſion of this Act: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Parliament can make no Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, meddle with no Church affaires, nor determine ought to be Hereſie unleſſe the Clergy in Convocation firſt aſſent thereto. Pretty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent Logick, and Anti-parliamentary Divinity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> himſelfe voluntarily corrected them upon his Letter, appeares not; but if he did, it was to pleaſe this Archbiſhop, in deleting thoſe paſſages which he ſignified to be diſpleaſing to him, the better to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Prebendary he ſued for to him in this Letter: Wherefore theſe purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt reſt ſtill upon his ſcore.</p>
               <p>To the Popiſh Alterations and Delections, under his owne hand made in the SCOTTISH COMMON-PRAYER BOOKE, which the Commons deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preſſe, he pleaded the ACT OF PACIFICATION AND OBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VION, againſt the very reading of them: Whereupon they did forbeare, and wave the reading of them for the preſent, though cleane out of the ACT, alleaging onely, that this Plea of his was a plaine confeſſion of his Guilt.</p>
               <p>The fifth ſort of purgations <note n="g" place="margin">Page 252, 253, 254.</note> objected to me are thoſe in SIR ANTHONY HUNGERFORDS Books, which DOCTOR BAAR my Chaplaine would <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 5.</note> have expunged: Of which SIR EDWARD HUNGERFORD his Sonne complained to me, as he depoſeth, after he had expoſtulated with my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, who would croſſe them out, or not licenſe the Bookes: Whereupon I told him, <hi>I having many other imployments had trusted my</hi> CHAPLAINES <hi>with thoſe things, which I wholly referred to them, therefore what they thought fit to leave out, you muſt Submit to:</hi> And thereupon would not redreſſe his Grievance herein.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, Firſt, that if there were any Errour herein, it was
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:61245:269"/>
not mine but my Chaplaines, ſince dead, who if he were alive, and might have been heard to ſpeake for himſelfe, would doubtleſſe have given a good account and reaſon to your Lordſhips, why he thought theſe paſſages unfit to be printed. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, that <hi>oft times infinite harme did accrew to the Church, per temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios veritatis aſſertatores;</hi> and every Treatiſe written againſt Papiſts is not ſo ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, but that it may prove ſo diſadvantagious to the Cauſe, as to be unfit to be printed: It may be theſe were ſuch; however, God be thanked, the Books were printed with thoſe paſſages in them, and ſo no harme done by my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine. Secondly, for my anſwer to Sir <hi>Edward;</hi> it was true, I had ſo many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick buſineſſes then upon me, that I had no leiſure to peruſe Books for the Preſſe, and thereupon referred that truſt wholly to my Chaplaines; therefore if they offended, they onely muſt anſwer for it, not I: and ſhould I herein controll what my Chaplaines had done in this kind, it would have ſo diſcouraged them, that none of them have undertaken the office of a Licenſer afterwards: Beſides, I ſhould have been perpetually troubled with clamours againſt that which my Chaplaines thought fit to be blotted out of Books tendred to them to be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for them every man would have appealed from them to me in this kind, ſo as I ſhould have had no quiet.</p>
               <p>To this was replied, Firſt, that we have formerly proved at large, that his Chaplaines errours and delinquencies in this kind are his owne, becauſe the care <note place="margin">Reply.</note> of licenſing Books was originally veſted in himſelfe, and they were but his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted ſervants, for whom he muſt be reſponſible at his perill; and the rather in this caſe, becauſe he confeſſeth his Chaplaine is dead and cannot be puniſhed for it, who if alive, could give no reaſon for not licenſing thoſe Books, unleſſe theſe paſſages againſt popery were expunged; but onely this, that it was by his Lords owne ſpeciall directions, who would ſuffer no harſh paſſages againſt popery or Papiſts to paſſe our Preſſes unexpunged; as appeares by thoſe himſelfe purged out of Doctor <hi>Sibthorps</hi> Sermon, the <hi>Prayer for the Faſt,</hi> Doctor <hi>Potters Treatiſe;</hi> and that himſelfe was every way as Popiſh, as good a friend to Popery as his Grace. Secondly, for Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> ſaying, we approve it, confeſſing, that every Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet weakly written againſt Popery is not fit to paſſe the Preſſe: But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes not thoſe two <hi>Treatiſes,</hi> written by a converted Papiſt of eminent rank, with excellent ſolidity, judgement, learning, which muſt not be licenſed; not upon any pretext of weakneſſe or want of ſolidity in them (never ſo much as once objected;) but onely becauſe Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford</hi> would not condiſcend that the forecited clauſes againſt the Pope and Popery (ſome of them taken out of Popiſh Authors themſelves) ſhould be expunged out of his Fathers Works, to martilate them. That theſe Books were ſince printed without thoſe purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is no thanks to the Archbiſhop nor his Chaplaine, who would not licenſe them vnleſſe firſt purged, and the licenſing of them without ſuch purgations by others, proves ſtrongly, that there was no juſt grounds of purging them, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> gratifie the Pope and popery. Fourthly, we beleeve his anſwer true, that he intruded himſelfe out of a polypragmaticall humour into ſo many ſecular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as he had little time to peruſe Books or preach the Goſpell; but this is only his crime, not his excuſe: However, ſince he could find ſo much leiſure upon all occaſions to perſecute godly Miniſters, ſuppreſſe Orthodox Books, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Prayers, advance Arminianiſme, Popery, and popiſh deſignes, he might by like reaſon have found out time enough to have peruſed theſe ſmall Treatiſes or at leaſt the clauſes excepted againſt by his Chaplaine upon Sir <hi>Edward Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> complaint, being a Gentleman of quality and fortune. Fiftly, the latter part of his anſwer proves, that it was altogether bootleſſe for any man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to him of his Chaplaines abuſes in purging out paſſages againſt Popery, and that he was reſolved to heare no complaints of this kind, much leſſe not to redreſſe them: His reaſons rendred for it are moſt abſurd. The firſt is, becauſe this would diſcourage his Chaplaines from being Licenſers: It ſeemes by this
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:61245:270"/>
they were ſo really, ſo realouſly popiſh, that they muſt not be checked or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled in the leaſt kind for purging out ought againſt Popes, Popery, Papiſts, for feare of diſcouragement, no, not by himſelfe; or ſo waſpiſh and ſelf-willed (like himſelfe) that they would fling up their very Office of licenſing, if they might not have their wils, to obliterate what they pleaſed, without any ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our controll: But this is but a pretence, for Doctor <hi>Bray</hi> himſelfe rendred this as the true reaſon of hie refuſall to licenſe theſe clauſes to Sir <hi>Edward; That they would offend thoſe of the Roman Religion, againſt whom no harſh phraſes muſt be uſed, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in a faire way to win them (viz.</hi> by reconciling our ſelves to them, not them to us) <hi>therefore they muſt be either expladed, or the Book left unprinted.</hi> The ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is yet more abſurd, taken from his owne caſe and quiet, that he ſhould have been perpetually troubled with imployments and clamours of this nature, &amp;c. It ſeems it was his Chaplaines conſtant practice by his owne direction, to purge out all ſharpe paſſages againſt the Pope, popery, and popiſh Innovations out of new licenſed Books, os elſe the reaſon would not hold; for did they it but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not uſually, he ſhould not have been perpetually diſturbed with ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints as this of Sir <hi>Edwards:</hi> But be it ſo or not, yet certainly it was no more then his place and duty required, to heare and redreſſe all juſt complaints of this kind againſt his Chaplains when they did amiſſe, elſe Authors, Stationers, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, might be moſt injuriouſly handled by them, without knowing where to complaine or ſeek reliefe; for to whom elſe ſhould they complaine, but unto him, whoſe Chaplaines they were, whoſe place, truſt, they herein executed by his own appointment? Or who elſe ſhould or durſt right them herein if injured, but himſelfe? and if it were no trouble for him to ſpend whole dayes, weeks, yeers, in advancing unlawfull oppreſſive Loane, Monopolies, Projects, Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Texes, to oppreſſe the Subjects, contrary to, and inconſiſtent with his Archiepiſcopall function; with what face could he deem it any trouble or vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpare one hour or two each moneth or yeer in hearing, examining ſuch juſt complaints againſt his Chaplaines, when they ſo groſly offended? This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therefore plainly remonſtrates, that he was inflexibly reſolved his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines ſhould purge out all notable paſſages againſt the Pope, Popery, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh errours, no doubt by his owne ſpeciall direction given to them: Therefore let who would complaine thereof, he muſt goe without redreſſe, and ſubmit to his Chaplaines pleaſure, elſe his whole Volume muſt goe unlicenſed, be it never ſo uſefull, ſo neceſſary for our Religions juſt defence; which manifeſts the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent height of his and his Chaplaines reſolutions, their arbitrary, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable proceedings to ſet up popery without oppoſition, by theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
               <p>The fixt purged Book is Doctor <hi>Featlies</hi> Sermons, ordered by my command (after they were printed by an ancient Licenſe) to be carried to my Chaplain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Bray,</hi> who gelded out of them divers of the ſmarteſt and moſt maſculine paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages againſt <hi>Popery, Arminianiſme, toleration of Papiſts, Prieſts, Jeſuits, and a paſſage againſt Adoration of Images by Papists,</hi> taken out of the very Homily againſt the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of Idolatry; whereof he complained to Sir <hi>Edmond Soot,</hi> deſiring him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with it; who told him, he conceived it would be in vaine, becauſe he thought my Chaplaine had directions from me for what he did, and that I would not alter any thing in this kind done by my Chaplaines.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer: Firſt, that though it be the place and office of the <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterbury</hi> to have a care what Books are Licenſed, yet Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> (who hath been a Chaplaine and Licenſer of Books under my Predeceſſor) can atteſt, that the Archbiſhop himſelfe did ſeldome or never uſe to peruſe or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe Books in perſon, but onely by his Chaplaines. Secondly, theſe purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made by my Chaplaine, who is dead and cannot anſwer for himſelfe; not by me: and Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> never complained to me of them; neither did Sir <hi>Edmond Scot</hi> ever acquaint me with any complaint the <hi>Doctor</hi> made to him about
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:61245:270"/>
it. Thirdly, though ſome few ſmart Paſſages of this kinde are expunged, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and left out; yet there are in his Sermons, yea in thoſe very Pages complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, many ſharpe paſſages againſt <hi>Popery</hi> left in (two or three whereof he read) as one againſt Prayer to Saints, p. 787. where he compares the Papiſts with the <hi>Baalists,</hi> p. 808. where he avers, that <hi>the Pope is Antichriſt;</hi> and p. 810. where he cals the Pope, <hi>the whore of Babylon.</hi> Therefore theſe could not be thought to be croſſed out in favour of Papiſts and Popery, but becauſe the expreſſions in them were ſuch as might give juſt occaſion of diſtaſte. Fourthly, I ſhall by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips favour demand of Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> himſelfe two queſtions, and deſire his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them. Firſt, Whether when he was a Licenſer in my Predeceſſors time, it was not uſuall for his Chaplaines to qualifie or raſe out ſome unfitting expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions when they ſaw cauſe, out of Books tendered to them to licenſe? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were not liable to cenſure, if any ſuch eſcaped them, upon complaint? Secondly, Whether himſelfe, ſince the ſitting of this Parliament, hath not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Book, afterwards licenſed? and whether the Licenſer did not alter and blot ſomething out of it? what was it, and who did it?</p>
               <p>To which ſodaine queſtions the Doctor being commanded by the Lords to give an anſwer; replyed to the firſt Queſtion; That he and his fellow-Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers did ſometimes uſe to qualifie or obliterate ſome paſſages ſavouring of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſme,</hi> or in favour of it, (eſpecially after the burning of Doctor <hi>Mockets Booke,</hi> for which the Licenſer was reprehended) and that himſelfe was once queſtioned before <hi>King James</hi> for a Booke licenſed, about a paſſage concerning the calling of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and for Maſter <hi>Eltons</hi> Booke upon the Commandements, ſavouring of <hi>Puritaniſme;</hi> but he never knew in his time of any Paſſages againſt the Papiſts, Popery, Arminianiſme, or the like, expunged out by <hi>Archbiſhop Abbot,</hi> or his Chaplaines; nor any one queſtioned for licenſing any ſuch, but rather encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, till of late times. To the ſecond, he confeſſed that he and Maſter <hi>Rouſe</hi> did joyntly write and publiſh a Booke fince this Parliament, intituled <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertumnus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> and that Maſter <hi>Rouſe</hi> cauſed him to ſtrike out a Paſſage in it that was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharpe againſt the <hi>Separatists,</hi> which he did at his deſire. Whereupon the Archbiſhop urged, that then he hoped his Chaplaines might have the ſame liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to croſſe what they thought fitting out of the Books they licenſed, though it were againſt Popery.</p>
               <p>To this was anſwered: Firſt, that by <hi>Queene Elizabeths Injunctions,</hi> Numb. 51. The <hi>Archbiſhops of Canterbury, York &amp; Biſhop of London themſelves</hi> (not their Chaplains) <note place="margin">Reply.</note> 
                  <hi>are appointed to Licenſe Books, and trusted with this charge:</hi> which they perſonally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as appeares by ſundry <hi>Entries</hi> of Books licenſed by them in the <hi>Stationers Register</hi> of Entries: And why their Succeſſours in theſe dayes ſhould not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally licenſe Books and diſcharge this truſt, as well as their Predeceſſours, making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap>, or overmuch intermedling with ſecular affaires, no wayes concerning or beſeeming them. Secondly, that his Chaplaine made theſe Purgations, not himſelfe, is no excuſe, ſince he did it by his ſpeciall command and direction, as Sir <hi>Edmond Scots</hi> words, and Doctor <hi>Featlies</hi> teſtimony evidence. Thirdly, his Chaplains death is no excuſe of his own guilt. That Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> complained not to him of theſe Purgations, is no excuſe; for if he had, Sir <hi>Edward Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> example, his owne anſwer to him then, his preſent expreſſions at the Barre now, and Sir <hi>Edmond Scots</hi> words to Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> clearly prove, it had been boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and he remedileſſe; <hi>Legem ſibi dixerat ipſe,</hi> he was reſolved to admit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe no complaints of this nature againſt his Chaplaines. Fourthly, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſome Paſſages againſt Popery to ſtand in the <hi>Doctors</hi> Sermon, is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his Chaplaines crime in purging out others of the ſame nature; for why ſhould not all ſtand as well as ſome, eſpecially that againſt Popiſh <hi>worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> taken verbatim out of our <hi>Homilies</hi> there quoted, and the very words
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:61245:271"/>
of the Scriptuze it ſelfe <hi>againſt conniving at Popiſh Seducers to Idolatry?</hi> Indeed thoſe that remained are more generall; theſe obliterated more particular, ſharpe, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and more concerned our preſent times, practiſes; therefore leſſe reaſon to be expunged. Fiftly, theſe expunctions out of the Doctors Sermons were ſo many that the Printer was enforced to new print ſome 16. or 18. ſheets in folio, to his great prejudice. That thoſe Paſſages he cites eſcaped their purgation, was becauſe the Booke being large, they paſſed undiſcerned till after its publication, elſe doubtleſſe the Archbiſhop and his Chaplaines would have croſſed them out in <hi>Doctor Featlies</hi> Sermons, as well as in Doctor <hi>Sibthorps,</hi> or in Doctor <hi>Potters, Biſhop Hals</hi> owne Booke, <hi>Doctor Jones</hi> and <hi>Doctor Clerke;</hi> and not have permitted his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pontiffe of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be ſtiled <hi>Antichriſt, and the whoore of Rome,</hi> and his Prieſts compared unto <hi>Baalists.</hi> Sixtly, Doctor <hi>Featlies</hi> teſtimony is a very ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the Archbiſhop; for before his time, there were never any ſuch Purgations made, but onely of Paſſages in favour of <hi>Puritaniſme,</hi> nor any Books queſtioned, or Paſſages deleted that were againſt the Pope, Popery, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Jeſuits, Seminary Prieſts, or Papiſts, which the Archbiſhop and his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines firſt introduced. As for his <hi>Vertumnus Romanus,</hi> being joyntly written by Maſter <hi>Rowſe</hi> and himſelfe; it was juſt that Maſter <hi>Rowſe</hi> ſhould have liberty to croſſe out by the Doctors conſent any paſſage he diſliked, and the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to have this deleted; this Paſſage therefore not being obliterated by any Licenſer, but by the Authors themſelves by joynt conſent, and being not againſt Popery or Papiſts, but Separatiſts onely (who profeſſe the ſame Doctrine with us, and were then ready to joyne with us in one way of Worſhip, of Government) is no extenuation or juſtification of his and his Chaplaines purging this <hi>Doctors Booke</hi> ſo groſely as they did of Paſſages againſt the Pope, Popery and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme.</p>
               <p>The next Purgations <note n="i" place="margin">Here p. 254. 255.</note> objected, were made in <hi>Doctor Clerks, Doctor Jones,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer: Firſt, that there are divers ſharpe Paſſages yet remaining in Doctor <hi>Clerkes</hi> Sermons againſt Papiſts: that they were licenſed part of them by <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> (none of mine but the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> houſhold Chaplain) and part of them by Doctor <hi>Heywood</hi> my Chaplain: That Maſter <hi>White</hi> diſtinguiſhed not what Sermons were Licenſed by the one, what by the other. Beſides, Maſter <hi>White</hi> is but a ſingle witneſſe. Secondly, Doctor <hi>Jones</hi> his Commentary on the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was licenſed and purged by Doctor <hi>Baker,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and Maſter <hi>Wards</hi> Booke by Doctor <hi>Weeks,</hi> not by me or my Chaplaines; therefore they concerne me not.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed: Firſt, that the moſt pungent and pregnant Paſſages in Doctor <hi>Clerkes</hi> Sermons againſt the Popes Authority, tyranny, pride, Jeſuits, <note place="margin">Reply.</note> Prieſts, Papiſts, Arminians, Arminianiſme, Popery and Popiſh errours, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> no more excuſe the obliterating of the reſt; then a thiefes leaving of a true mans cloathes on his backe, or ſparing his life, will juſtifie or extenuate the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of his purſe, or the leaving a few Cottages ſtanding excuſe the burning of a whole City beſides. That Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> and Doctor <hi>Heywood</hi> joyned in expung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Sermons, proves their confederacy onely, not leſſens but aggravates their iniquity. As for Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> he was his owne Chaplaine as well as the Biſhop of <hi>Londons,</hi> as appeares by his owne hand and <hi>Diary;</hi> therefore he muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for his miſdemeanours in this kinde, for purging both Doctor <hi>Clorkes Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> and Maſter <hi>Wards</hi> Commentary: For Doctor <hi>Baker,</hi> he was his owne great favourite, advanced by him to a Prebendary, as appeares by the <hi>Docquet Booke;</hi> Therefore his <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> on Doctor <hi>Jones</hi> his Commentary (proceeding doubtleſſe from this Archbiſhops antecedent directions) muſt remaine upon his ſcore, notwithſtanding all his ſhifting evaſions. To the particular paſſages purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:61245:271"/>
out of theſe Authors, he returned no anſwer at all; onely by theſe his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall anſwers to theſe Purgations, all the world may clearly diſcover his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe impudence and Popery in juſtifying them, his brain-ſick folly in his exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of them, his palpable Romanizing in practiſing many of them himſelfe, and the whole weight of all the Branches in this charge falling heavily upon him, notwithſtanding all his ſhifts to ward them off.</p>
               <p>The twelfth charge <note n="k" place="margin">Page 349.</note> objected againſt me is, my connivance at the importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of popiſh Books, and reſtoring them to the owners, when ſeized by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 12.</note> and Searchers, contrary to the Statute of 3. <hi>Jacobi e.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, I never connived at their importation, and that the reſtoring of them when ſeized, was not by any direction of mine, but by order of the High <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Commiſſion Court.</p>
               <p>To which was replied, Firſt, that he doth not ſo much as once alleage, he ever gave any order for ſeizing any Popiſh Books imported, whereas the Cuſtomers, <note place="margin">Reply.</note> Searchers, Purſivants, and other Officers had ſtrict Warrants and ſpeciall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from him to ſeize all imported <hi>Bibles</hi> with <hi>Notes,</hi> with all Books ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any way of Puritaniſme, as he deemed it, or tending againſt Arminianiſme and popiſh Innovations. Secondly, he confeſſeth, that popiſh Books when ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, were uſually reſtored by order of the <hi>High Commiſſion Court</hi> to the owners, contrary to the <hi>Statute,</hi> whereas that Court never reſtored any <hi>Bibles</hi> with <hi>Notes,</hi> or Books againſt <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> or popiſh Innovations ſeized by their order, but burnt them privately, or otherwiſe deſtroyed them. Thirdly, he proves not that any of them were reſtored by Order of Court, whereas <hi>Egerton</hi> ſweares, that <hi>Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhead</hi> averred, they were reſtored by the Archbiſhops owne order, without the Courts: But be it by order of Court, yet his crime is ſtill the ſame, ſince himſelf ſate Preſident and chiefe Controller in the High Commiſſion, and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theſe Orders, if not commanded them to be made; whereas in duty he ſhould have croſſed them; that Court not daring to make any ſuch Orders of Reſtitution without his conſent, who had ſuch an over-ruling power in it.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth particular <note n="l" place="margin">Here page 349 to 354.</note> objected againſt me is, my advancing of <hi>Arminians</hi> and Clergy-men <hi>ſuperstitiouſly and popiſhly affected,</hi> to <hi>Biſhopricks, Deaneries, Headſhips</hi>

                  </gap> preferred no ſuch perſons to Biſhopricks, or any Eccleſiaſticall livings and preferments; ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, if any of thoſe preferred by me were ſuch at the time of their preferments, it was unknown to me; and if they turned ſuch afterwards, I could neither foreſee nor prevent it: Thirdly, on the contrary, I have preferred divers worthy orthodox Miniſters, free from all exceptions; as Maſter <hi>Taylor</hi> of <hi>Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> now one of the Aſſembly, Maſter <hi>John Downham,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> and ſundry others.</p>
               <p>To which was replied, Firſt, that we had proved the generallity of thoſe he preferred, to be addicted, inclined to Arminianiſme, Popery, or both, and ſo <note place="margin">Reply.</note> knowne to be when he advanced them, no doubt to himſelfe better then others, and this their inclination was one chiefe cauſe of their preferment. Secondly, that his preferment of Maſter <hi>John Downham</hi> and Maſter <hi>Taylor,</hi> orthodox men, to petty Benefices, and no higher preferments, was but a meer ſtale to blind ſome peoples eyes, or ſtop their mouths, for his advancing of ſo many rotten, corrupt,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:61245:272"/>
popiſh Clergy-men to Biſhopricks, Deanaries, Prebendaries, Arch-deaconries, Maſterſhips of Colledges, and the fatteſt Benefices; but no juſtification nor exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of his preferring of ſo many ſuch. Thirdly, for his advancement of Biſhop <hi>Hall (viz.</hi> from one Biſhoprick to another) it is yet a meer <hi>non liquet</hi> to us, onely averred not proved by himſelfe; but if true, it was rather to corrupt and draw him over to his party, then preferre him for his owne or the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; and how that worthy Prelate hath degenerated, declined ſince, in caſe of Epiſcopacy, the Scottiſh Warres, the new Canons, the <hi>Et cetera</hi> Oath, popiſh Ceremonies, Innovations of all ſorts, and preſſing the book of Sports upon the Lords day, we have already manifeſted by his owne Letters in part, and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due is ſo experimentally knowne to moſt of his Dioceſſe, that it needs no proofe. However, his preferring of above twelve <hi>Judas-Biſhops</hi> to one true <hi>Apostle,</hi> is a grand diſſervice to our Church, our Religion, and no juſtification nor extenuation of his offence therein.</p>
               <p>For particulars, the <note n="m" place="margin">Here page 250 to 256.</note> firſt thing I am charged with, is for advancing Maſter <hi>Mountague,</hi> Doctor <hi>Manwaring,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Neale,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> Doctor <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 1.</note> others, to Biſhopricks, men publikly complained againſt, one of them cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Parliament, and diſabled from all preferments in our Church, which was proved by the <hi>Docquet Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that Maſter <hi>Mountague</hi> was not preferred by me to any Biſhoprick, neither is the Docquet Book any good proofe thereof, but he was <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> preferred to it by Sir <hi>Dudly Carltons</hi> meanes; true it is, I was at his conſecration, but that was by command, and I could not refuſe or reſiſt it: Beſides, he was a great Scholler, therefore thought worthy of preferment by the King. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for Doctor <hi>Manwaring,</hi> I did not preferre him, but it was his Majeſties pleaſure to beſtow a Deanary, and after that a Biſhoprick on him in regard of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for his ſervice, notwithſtanding his ſentence, and he commanded me to conſecrate him, which command I had no power to withſtand or oppoſe, being bound by Law and the duty of my Place to obey it. Thirdly, for Biſhop <hi>Neale</hi> he was a worthy man, free from Popery and Arminianiſme, who in King <hi>James</hi> his Reigne, before his preferment to <hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>York</hi> had been preferred to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Dignities, Biſhopricks, and was in office and good eſteem at Court, both with King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles.</hi> Fourthly, For Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> when I firſt preferred him, he was a worthy man, who waited upon his Majeſty when he was in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and did good ſervice there; if he hath miſdemeaned himſelfe ſince, it is his owne fault, not mine, he is ſtill alive, and muſt anſwer for himſelfe, to the charge and impeachment exhibited againſt him. Fiftly, Doctor <hi>Lindſey</hi> was a very great Scholler, who deſerved well, neither did I know him to be an Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian; 'tis true, he was preferred to two Biſhopricks ſucceſſively, but it was by Biſhop <hi>Neale,</hi> whoſe Chaplaine he was, not by me; there is no Oath nor clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> evidence it was by my meanes, the Docquet book being no ſufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> Signet to me, as a ſervant, but not that I was the author of his preferments; the King may ſignifie his pleaſure to the Signet Office by whom he pleaſeth; as for Maſter <hi>Smarts</hi> teſtimony of him, there were ſome quarrels and differences at <hi>Durham,</hi> between Maſter <hi>Smart</hi> and him, which may cauſe him to ſpeak the worſe of him: Maſter <hi>Walker</hi> ſaith onely, <hi>he was reputed a great Arminian,</hi> which is no Hereſie. Sixtly, however theſe were affected, yet none can charge me with any Popery or Arminianiſme.</p>
               <p>To this was replied, Firſt, that we have as cleerly proved as the Sunne at noon day, that <hi>Mountague</hi> was protected, advanced by him, and that in contempt of <note place="margin">Reply.</note> the Parliament, by his owne Diary, the Docquet Book, Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> owne Letter of thanks to him for his favour and preferments, which he hath no way anſwered; as for his preferment, that it was by Sir <hi>Dudly Carltons</hi> meanes, it is but a bare ſurmiſe of his owne, without proofe or colour; and for his preſence

at his conſecration, it was meerly voluntary to countenance him, not by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for ought appeares. Secondly, it appeares moſt cleerly by the Evidence given, that Doctor <hi>Manwaring</hi> was advanced both to his Deanary and Biſhoprick by his means &amp; recommendations alone, for the diſſervice he had done the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by thoſe Sermons for which he was juſtly ſentenced in Parliament, and the ill offices he had ſince done our Church, by introducing <hi>Stone-Altars, Copes,</hi> with other <hi>Popiſh Reliques, Ceremonies</hi> thereinto; that he was thus advanced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated a Biſhop by him in direct affront of the Parliaments cenſure, diſabling him from all future preferments, we have fully proved: And whereas he layes the <hi>Odium</hi> of his preferments onely upon the King to excuſe himſelfe, it is but his owne bare allegation, without any ſhadow of proofe, and that in his owne caſe, for his owne defence, therefore not to be credited: But admit it true, yet ſince himſelfe was preſent at his cenſure in the Lords Houſe, upon the Commons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of him, recorded it in his Diary, and was accuſed for having a finger in his Sermons, and licenſing them for the Preſſe, it was his duty to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his Majeſty with, and minded him of this his cenſure, diſabling him for ever from all ſuch preferments in our Church, to have oppoſed his preferment, and withſtood his conſecration and <hi>Mountagues</hi> too; the rather, becauſe every man before any Biſhops conſecration, hath free liberty to put in any juſt exceptions againſt him, there being a publike Inſtrument ſolemnly poſted up in the Arches at <hi>Bow,</hi> before every Biſhops conſecration (as a neceſſary formality) giving pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like notice, <hi>That ſuch a one is to be conſecrated the Biſhop of ſuch a Dioceſſe ſuch a day, and ſignifying, that if any perſon can take any juſt exceptions againſt him, and ſhew good cauſe why he ſhould not be conſecrated, he ſhall be heard.</hi> In regard whereof, this Archbiſhop <hi>ex Officio,</hi> might, yea ought to have ſhewed the Lords publike cenſure of <hi>Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> as a juſt legall Plea, why he ſhould not be conſecrated a Biſhop (as Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> the Printer did in a legall way object Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Popiſh and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Books, with the proceedings pending againſt him in Parliament for the ſame, is a juſt cauſe why he ſhould not be made a Biſhop, yet he could not be heard nor prevaile therein:) therefore the neglect of this his truſt, duty, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Law, and his recommending, conſecrating him to be a Biſhop, in affront of the Parliaments Judgement which diſabled him, muſt needs be a tranſcendent crime, no wayes mittigated, but aggravated, by his falſe diſloyall excuſes. Thirdly, for Biſhop <hi>Neale,</hi> he was ever reputed a <hi>Popiſh and Arminian Prelate,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of all orthodox, godly Miniſters, a preferrer of popiſh Arminian Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, making choyce of ſuch for his Chaplaines, for ſuch a one was he accuſed to his Majeſty by the Houſe of Commons in their Remonſtrance <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. and complained of in ſundry Parliaments before his advancement to <hi>Winchester</hi> or <hi>Yorke:</hi> For his pretended worth, all the Court knew very well he had little worth or learning in him, being unable to preach, write, diſpute, not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once in a dozen yeers or more: For his preferments and Court-offices, they were gained, maintained by flattery, ſymony, and his baſe temporizing ſervility, he ſerving as a ready Inſtrument upon all occaſions to introduce anypopiſh Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions in the Church, and ſet on foot any oppreſſing projects in the State: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his preferment of ſuch an ill Inſtrument (who firſt advanced and brought this Arch-Prelat into favour at Court) is no wayes excuſable. Fourthly, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Wren</hi> was before his advancement to a Biſhoprick, a profeſſed Arminian, a ſuperſtitious, popiſh, diſſolute, impious, corrupt Clergy-man, and ſo reputed by all; therefore a fit Chaplaine to promote the Spaniſh Match and Deſigne, to ſeduce his Majeſty, when in <hi>Spaine,</hi> from our Religion; and his tyrannicall, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, popiſh proceedings ſince he was made Biſhop, have more fully diſcovered what he was before: All or moſt of which being in purſuance of the Archbiſhops Inſtructions, Injunctions to him (as his Annuall Account of his proceedings to him evidence) himſelfe who promoted him and them, muſt be more guilty of, and reſponſible for them, then <hi>Wren</hi> himſelfe, who yet may ſuffer for them in due
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:61245:273"/>
time. Fiftly, Doctor <hi>Linſeys</hi> ſchollerſhip is not in queſtion, but his Arminian, popiſh inclination and opinions, which were ſo much the more dangerous, by reaſon of his great reputed learning and ſchollerſhip; the greateſt Schollers, if unſound, being the moſt pernicious ſeducers, and unfitteſt to be preferred of all others: That he was promoted by Biſhop <hi>Neales</hi> meanes, is a bare allegation of his owne without proofe; that himſelfe preferred him is cleere by the <hi>Docquet Booke;</hi> how much he was tainted with Popery and Arminianiſme, Maſter <hi>Smart</hi> and Maſter <hi>Walker</hi> have depoſed upon Oath, and his preſumption in bringing <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> to him, even when he was about to publiſh his Book, to acquaint him with his perſon and deſigne of reconciling us thereby to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which himſelfe records under his owne hand) is a ſufficient confirmation of their teſtimony and his intimacy with him, after which he yet preferred him; For Maſter <hi>Smarts</hi> quarrell with him at <hi>Durham,</hi> it was onely for his Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, popiſh Tenets, and Innovations there broached, introduced, and ſo his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony the more credible, he then complaining againſt him in Parliament for it; for the <hi>Docquet Booke,</hi> it is not ſimply, that the King ſignified his pleaſure by this Archbiſhops for Doctor <hi>Linſeys,</hi> and thoſe others preferments, but that it was by <hi>Order from the Archbiſhop of Canterbury,</hi> therefore no doubt by his procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſent and approbation, who had engroſſed the ſole diſpoſall of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments Eccleſiaſticall. Sixtly, to that he objects, that however theſe were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, yet none can object any Arminianiſme or Popery to him: We reply, that his conſtant advancing and favouring of ſuch perſons, is a very ſtrong evidence of his inclination to both; and our evidence already produced to prove it, is ſo full, that it unavoidably manifeſts him guilty in the higheſt Degree of both. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he gives no anſwer to the other popiſh and Arminian Biſhops preferments by himſelfe, and ſo confeſſeth it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I am <note n="n" place="margin">Here p. 350.</note> charged with, is the preferring of Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 2.</note> Doctor <hi>Jackson,</hi> both Arminians, and Popiſh Doctor <hi>Coſins</hi> to Deanaries.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> was a learned man, an there was no proofe <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> he is an Arminian, but by hear-ſay. Secondly, for Doctor <hi>Coſins,</hi> I named foure to the King for the Deanary of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> whereof he was one, and the King pitched upon him by reaſon of his poverty and loſſes by the Scots. Thirdly, for Doctor <hi>Jackson,</hi> he was a learned man and honeſt, for which cauſe I did prefer him.</p>
               <p>To which was replied, Firſt, that we proved directly Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Arminian, by Doctor <hi>Featlies</hi> teſtimony, and ſo known, reputed to be by all <note place="margin">Reply.</note> in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſo as none can deny it; yea he preferred him as he was thus inclined, not as a learned man; his learning making him onely capable of doing more miſchiefe in propagating his <hi>Arminian errours.</hi> Secondly, that he recommended Doctor <hi>Coſins</hi> to the King, and th Deanary, is cleer by the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet Book</hi> and his own confeſſion; that he put any other in competition with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is uncertaine: Aowever, he carried the Deanary by his recommendation; and for him to advance a perſon ſo popiſh, ſo ſuperſttitious, ſo infamous, ſo oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained againſt in Parliament for popery, as this Doctor was, who had done ſo much miſchiefe in our Church, upon any pretext, was, no doubt, a grand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Thirdly, Doctor <hi>Jacksons</hi> civill converſation and learning, made his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and preferment more dangerous, more pernicious; his Arminian errours, not his Learning or Honeſty being the ground of his advancement to this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of thoſe other Deanes preferments, to which he hath given no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>The third thing <note n="o" place="margin">Here p. 336. 337. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> objected againſt me, is my encroachment upon the Lord Chamberlaines Office, and preferring Popiſh and Arminian Chaplains in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> to the King and Prince.</p>
               <p>For this, I deny I did ever encroach upon the <hi>Lord Chamberlaines Office,</hi> or that I preferred any ſuch Chaplaines in ordinary to the King or Prince, neither is
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:61245:273"/>
there any proofe that they were preferred by me; as for Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> he was preferred by the Earle of <hi>Danby,</hi> Doctor <hi>Coſins</hi> by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Baker</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Doctor <hi>Pocklington</hi> and the reſt, by I know not whom; as for Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> he was none of my Chaplaine, but the Biſhop of <hi>Londons,</hi> and by him preferred.</p>
               <p>To which was replied, Firſt, that Maſter <hi>Oldſworth</hi> expreſly depoſed, and the Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> himſelfe averred the contrary, that he encroached on the <hi>Lord</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reply.</note> 
                  <hi>Chamberlaines</hi> Office, and preferred theſe Chaplaines to the King. Secondly, that many of them were his owne Chaplaines, therefore doubtleſſe ſpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the King by himſelfe, and no other. Thirdly, the King entruſting him with all Eccleſiaſticall affaires and preferments, no man elſe but himſelfe could preferre any to be Chaplaines to the King, but by his approbation or aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance firſt obtained; yea, no other perſon durſt encroach upon the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaines Office in this kind but he. Fourthly, we ſhall prove Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> to be his owne Chaplaine, by a <hi>Catalogue of his Chaplaines,</hi> written with his owne hand, affixed to the end of his <hi>Diary,</hi> which was produced and read; in which Catalogue Doctor <hi>Weekes</hi> his name was found Regiſtred among others of his Chaplaines; therefore his impudency and falſhood in denying it, was moſt into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable: Hereupon the Archbiſhop being ſo confounded, that he could not deny it; confeſſed he was his Chaplain, but he had quite forgotten it, by reaſon he lived at <hi>London-houſe,</hi> and was that Biſhops houſhold Chaplaine, which the Commons Counſell ſaid, was a very poore excuſe for ſo palpable, ſo groſſe an untruth, aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſo much confidence.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing <note n="p" place="margin">Here p. 359.</note> objected againſt me is, my preferring of Arminians, and perſons popiſhly affected, in the Univerſities; as Doctor <hi>Jackson</hi> and others in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Oxford,</hi> Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Chapple</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; Firſt, that Doctor <hi>Jackson</hi> was a learned man, and honeſt, and for ought I know orthodox. Secondly, Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> was my houſhold Chaplain <note place="margin">Anſwer,</note> for a time, but not knowne to me to be an Arminian. Thirdly, Maſter <hi>Chapple</hi> had a great name in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> for a great Scoller, which made me preferre him; what he did maintaine in <hi>Ireland</hi> is but by hear-ſay, ſince I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him, and there was no complaint ever made to me againſt him, by Doctor <hi>Hoyle</hi> or any other.</p>
               <p>To which was replied; Firſt, that he anſwered not to the maine charge, againſt him, in making ill Vice-Chancellours as well as Heads of houſes in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reply.</note> To that to which he offers an anſwer, we give this Reply; that Doctor <hi>Jackson</hi> was a profeſſed Arminian, though learned and honeſt, therefore no fit man to be Preſident of ſo famous a Colledge as <hi>Corpus Christi.</hi> Secondly, that Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> was a profeſſed Arminian, and declared himſelfe ſo by licenſing Arminian Books, and maintaining Arminian errous in his Sermon at <hi>Pauls-Croſſe</hi> when he was his owne houſhold Chaplaine; all which was knowne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to himſelfe; therefore unfit to be made Maſter of a Colledge in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> or any other of his ſtraine, to which he gives no anſwer. Thirdly, that Maſter <hi>Chapple</hi> had a great name in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and in <hi>London</hi> is true, but it was onely for a moſt dangerous <hi>Arminian,</hi> who leavened the whole Colledge wherein he lived, and many of the Univerſity with his peſtilent errors; therefore a moſt unfitting man for him to make Provoſt and chiefe Governour of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity and Colledge in Dublin,</hi> where Doctor <hi>Hoyle</hi> expreſly depoſeth, that he broached not onely <hi>Arminian,</hi> but <hi>dangerous Popiſh Errours,</hi> of which it was in vaine to complaine to the Archbiſhop, who advanced and countenanced him herein.</p>
               <p>The fift <note n="q" place="margin">Pa. 359, 360</note> objection is, my encroachment upon the Lord Keepers and Maſter of the Wards Rights, of preſenting to the Kings livings, with my preferment of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5.</note> divers <hi>Arminians,</hi> and perſons popiſhly affected to <hi>Prebendaries</hi> and <hi>Benefices</hi> of beſt value; as Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> Doctor <hi>Weekes,</hi> Doctor <hi>Baker,</hi> Doctor <hi>Bray,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:61245:274"/>
To this I anſwer; Firſt, that I encroached not upon either of their rights: True it is, there being a difference between the Lord <hi>Keeper Coventry</hi> and the Lord <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
                  <hi>Cottington,</hi> Maſter of the Court of Wards, about the preſentation towards livings in the Kings gift; I took occaſion thereupon to informe his Majeſty, that till the controverſie were decided between them, he might doe well to diſpoſe of theſe livings himſelfe, for the encouragement and reward of ſuch young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that went to Sea as Chaplaines in his Ships, who had nothing to live on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their returne from Sea, till they went forth againe; which motion the King approving of very well, committed the diſpoſing of theſe livings according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my charge, without my deſire or ſuit. Secondly, I diſpoſed of livings to divers good and orthodox men, as to Doctor <hi>Jackson</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and others, as well as to the perſons objected, who were not all preferred by me; for Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> was promoted to his livings by the <hi>Earle of Danby,</hi> Doctor <hi>Baker</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Weekes</hi> were preferred by the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which was replyed; Firſt, that moſt of the living belonging to the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> and <hi>Master of the Wards,</hi> were beſtowed by him, of which both of them oft <note place="margin">Reply.</note> complained; therefore he encroached upon both, which none of his Predeceſſors did: For thoſe belonging to the Maſterſhip of the Wards, he confeſſeth he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of them by the Kings appointment, but that it was upon the pretended oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, without his ſeeking or deſire (though occaſioned onely his motion) we know not how to credit his bare word, without better evidence, who hath had the impudency to deny his owne hand-writing very often ſince his Tryal, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards been enforced to confeſſe it. Secondly, his collation of Livings upon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox good men are ſo few, that he names but one <hi>[Doctor Jackson of Canterbury]</hi> and that when he had ſo farre prevailed upon his weakneſſe, by a new Cathedrall Statute and Oath, as to induce him to <hi>Bow to the Altar, &amp;c.</hi> as frequently as other Prebends (which he hath depoſed) to his great ſhame, and re-greet ſince; this one Swallow therefore will prove no Spring, no proofe of his ordinary prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring orthodox godly men to livings, which he commonly beſtowed on the moſt rotten Arminians and popiſh Clergy-men he could cull out. Thirdly, the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet Booke</hi> is expreſſe, that Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> was promoted to his livings and Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary by himſelfe, not by the Earle; that Doctor <hi>Baker</hi> and <hi>Weekes</hi> too were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by him, not by the Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Weekes</hi> being his owne Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and <hi>Baker</hi> made a Prebend of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (where no man durſt interpoſe but he) no doubt they were both preferred by him, as the DOCQUET witneſſeth on Record, againſt his impudent Deniall, without other proofe or truth.</p>
               <p>The fixt Objection is, that I uſurped to me the conferring of moſt Biſhopricks and Eccleſiaſticall preferments in <hi>Ireland.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objection</hi> 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; firſt, that I preferred none there, but at the requeſt of the <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and others of that Kingdome, who firſt recommended them to me <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> by their Letters. Secondly, that I was a meanes, at their requeſt, to recover the Patrimony of the Churches in that Kingdome, which had been long defrauded of it; to reſtore Impropriations, and increaſe the Revenues of Biſhopricks and Church-livings there, for the encouragement of Learning, and better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Preaching; in which regard, they were deſirous I ſhould be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the perſons they thought meet to have recommended to them. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the ſubſtance of moſt of the Letters that paſſed between the Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and other Biſhops of <hi>Ireland</hi> and me.</p>
               <p>To which was replied: Firſt, that we inſtanced in his beſtowing Biſhopricks, Deaneries and other Church-preferments in <hi>Ireland,</hi> onely to demonſtrate the <note place="margin">Reply.</note> 
                  <hi>Papall uſurpation,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchicall Juriſdiction</hi> he there encroached even whiles he was <hi>Biſhop of London;</hi> and to evidence his power in diſpoſing of all Eccleſiaſtical preferments then at home, ſince he diſpoſed of theſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he had no Epiſcopall or Archiepiſcopall Juriſdiction. Secondly, that moſt of thoſe he there preferred, were never recommended from thence, though ſome of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:61245:274"/>
were. Thirdly, that although the recovery of the uſurped depopulated Patrimony of that Church in <hi>Ireland</hi> was a commendable worke, if done in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall way; yet to recover it, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> as he did it, by the meere arbitrary power of the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> &amp; <hi>Councell Table</hi> there, by oppreſſing, ruining, diſpoſſeſſing men of what they had lawfully purchaſed againſt their wils, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration or legall proceeding, was a moſt unjuſt and wicked act. Fourthly, juſtly to recover and get in Impropriations to maintaine Preaching, was a very good worke; had this beene his end; but certainly this was but a meere pretence; for would he, thinke you, ſet up ſincere Preaching in <hi>Ireland;</hi> who ſuppreſſed it all he could in <hi>England?</hi> Would he who ſubverted the <hi>Feoffees for purchaſing in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations</hi> to the Church, to ſupport Preaching and Preaching Miniſters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> recover and get in <hi>Impropriations</hi> to the Church in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſupport Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preaching Miniſters there? No verily: He did it onely to maintain the Pompe, Power, Pride, State of the Prelates and Clergy there; as he did in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> not to maintain, or ſet up godly Preaching Miniſters, which he both here and there ſuppreſſed all he could.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth thing objected againſt me is, my proſecution and ſevere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 14.</note> againſt godly Miniſters, for Preaching againſt Arminianiſme, Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and its dangerous increaſe among us; as namely againſt Maſter <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> Maſter <hi>Chauncy</hi> and Maſter <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; firſt, that theſe perſons Cenſures were the Act of the whole <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> High-Commiſſion (which is but one body aggregate, for whoſe Act no one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man is liable to be queſtioned, but the whole Court;) not mine alone (as an Act of Parliament is the Act of both Houſes, not of any particular Member) who gave my voyce alwayes laſt, or laſt but one; and ſo could not ſway the Court with my opinion, not knowne to the Court till I delivered it, after all had declared theirs. Secondly, that the Act of Parliament which lately aboliſhed the <hi>Star-chamber and High-Commiſſion</hi> hath no retroſpect to nullifie the Sentences given in them, but admits them good and valid in Law, not ſubjecting the Judges who gave them to any puniſhment. Thirdly, their Sentences appeared to me to be juſt, upon juſt grounds; and admit the Sentences or Proceedings unjuſt, yet it is but a miſdemenour in others of the Commiſſioners that gave them; therefore no Treaſon in me. Fourthly, the Paſſages and Sermons for which they were Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced were, partly Schiſmaticall againſt the laudable Ceremonies of the Church and the Kings Declaration; partly Seditious, to infuſe feares and jealouſies of the increaſe of Popery into the peoples mindes, and caſting aſperſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Governours of the Church; For Maſter <hi>Bernards</hi> proſecution it was upon the Complaint of Doctor <hi>Cumber,</hi> Vice-Chancellour of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Fiftly, for other Miniſters that were queſtioned, or fled from hence to <hi>New-England;</hi> they were <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> queſtioned upon juſt complaints; and moſt of them fled hence, out of a conſciouſneſſe of guilt or of a panick feare, before they were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned or purſued.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed; firſt, that we <note n="t" place="margin">Exod, 23. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt not follow a multitude to doe evill;</hi> and <note place="margin">Reply.</note> injuſtice done by a whole Court, is a greater crime in every particular perſon who votes or concurres in it, then if he had done an act of Injuſtice alone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more dangerous, more inexcuſable, a greater perverting of Juſtice; <note n="v" place="margin">Pſal. 94. 20. to 24.</note>

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:61245:275"/>
queſtioned, impeached this preſent Parliament for their falſe Judgement given in the caſe of <hi>Ship-money;</hi> who might have pleaded as well as the Archbiſhop, each for himſelfe, the judgement we gave in theſe caſes was the Act and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Bench; therefore we ought not to be ſeverally impeached for it; but none of them were ſo inconſiderate, as to make ſuch a childiſh plea, which himſelfe refuſed to admit in the <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> in the caſe of the men of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> cenſured for granting an Annuity to Maſter <hi>Workman</hi> their <hi>Minister,</hi> under the <hi>City Seale;</hi> an Act of the whole Corporation; yet they were there Sentenced for it in their naturall capacities, as ſingle men. And if this Plea ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, no corrupt Judges in any <hi>Court</hi> of Juſtice ſhould be ſeverally proceeded againſt for any illegall Judgement or proceedings of the Court, which would be the very bane of publicke Juſtice, and encourage ill Judges to doe what they liſt. Secondly, the objected Act of Parliament leaves the Judgments of both Courts as it found them, neither better nor worſe; and the Judges that gave them in the ſame condition as before, not in a better. If the Judgment be unjuſt, it leaves both them and the Judges, as far forth liable to examination, repeal, cenſure, as formerly; as appeares by divers of them now queſtioned in Parliament for unjuſt Sentences therein given. Thirdly, the Proceedings, Sentences againſt theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were certainly moſt unjuſt, being onely for Preaching neceſſary Truths; and that which is but a Miſdemeanour in others, ſimply conſiderated as a ſingle offence; may prove high-treaſon in him, being conjoynedwith, and done in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of his other Treaſonable practiſes to ſubvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce popery &amp; an arbitrary tyrannicall government, which we have fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. Fourthly, the paſſages for which they were cenſured, were neither ſciſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nor ſeditious, nor ſcandalous, but neceſſary for thoſe ſecure times, to mind the people of the dangerous covert encreaſe of popery, Arminianiſme, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of our Religion, which all now viſibly diſcerne, but few then obſerved; and to ruine godly Miniſters for diſcharging their conſciences, duties, in warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of thoſe dangers and ſpeaking for the ſafety of that endangered Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we all profeſſe, was a moſt unjuſt and monſtrous miſdemeanour, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in an Arch-prelat, who ſhould have encouraged, rewarded, advanced them for this their faithfulneſſe: as for the aſperſions pretended to be caſt upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church therein, they were in truth meer generall cenſures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out particularizing of ſuch who juſtly deſerved them: And it is no calumny, but a neceſſary duty for Miniſters to tell negligent or unfaithfull Prelates of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reprehend them for their ſupineſſe when they are faulty, as well as other men. For Maſter <hi>Bernard</hi> and the reſt, they were proſecuted onely by this Archbiſhops own inſtigation: for all the paſſages and proceedings againſt them were found in his ſtudy, endorſed with his own hand; he was the perſon to whom they made their humble addreſſes though without relief, and the only inexorable enemy they met with; their unjuſt cenſures therfore muſt reſt principally on him, who though he voted laſt in their condemnation, yet appeared firſt in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and pre-directed their cenſures in private, before they were given in open Court. Fiftly, all the forementioned godly Miniſters were unjuſty mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by him, and few fled from hence, but ſuch who were actually proſecuted or threatned with ruine ere they left the Kingdom; moſt of them being then confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to all Rites and Ceremonies by Law eſtabliſhed in our Church, though not to his popiſh Innovations, Ceremonies, and Book of Sports, againſt our Lawes and their conſciences too: This charge therefore ſtill reſts entirely upon him, notwithſtanding his evaſions.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth charge objected againſt me is, my endeavours, practiſes, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to ſuppreſſe preaching, Lecturers, Lectures on Lords-dayes and week-days; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 15.</note> and that firſt, by a paper of Conſiderations which I tendred to the King. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Inſtructions extracted out of them, and ſent as the Kings, in his name and authority to both the Archiſhops and all Biſhops of the Realm, to be put in ſtrict
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:61245:275"/>
execution; by colour whereof many Lectures, Lecturers were ſuppreſſed in my owne Dioceſſe of <hi>London,</hi> and in other Dioceſſes, eſpecially by <hi>Biſhop Mountague, Biſhop Wren, and Biſhop Peice;</hi> as appeares by their Articles and proceedings. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: orders for Combination Lectures. Fourthly, the Kings Letters that none ſhould be ordained without a Title. Fiftly, the ſilencing of Maſter <hi>Leigh</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by my own direction and Letters ſigned by me. Sixtly, by ſuppreſſing the Feoffees for Impropriations, alledged to be my act and project.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; firſt, that theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> were originally drawne by <hi>Biſhop Harſnet,</hi> not me, who onely tranſcribed them out of his Copy. Secondly, that theſe Inſtructions of the King were before I was made Archbiſhop, and were ſent unto me by my Predeceſſour in the Kings name to be put in execution in my Dioceſſe; whereupon I was bound in duty to ſee them executed, being good and neceſſary; the intent of them being principally to bring all Lecturers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, to ſuppreſſe ſingle Lecturers where there were Preaching Miniſters, to preſerve peace between the Miniſter and people, betwixt whom Lecturers in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places made great contentions, alienating the peoples affections from their Miniſters perſon, Miniſtry, and raiſing divers Schiſmes, to the diſturbance of the Churches peace. As for the Articles, Proceedings and Miſdemeanours of <hi>Biſhop Wren, Biſhop Mountague</hi> and <hi>Biſhop Peirce,</hi> they are nothing to me; they muſt anſwer for themſelves. Thirdly, the Orders for Combination Lectures were none of mine, and tended onely to bring men to conformity. Fourthly, the Kings Letter, that none ſhould be made without a Title, was to prevent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Ordinations, agreeable to ancient Canons, and no harme therein. Fiftly, for Maſter <hi>Leigh,</hi> I received many complaints againſt him, that he was a ſciſmaticall &amp; ſeditious perſon, wherupon I writ thus to my Vicar generall; If you can faſten any thing on him, whereby he may be juſtly cenſured, then to proceed againſt him, and he finding juſt cauſe did ſuſpend him for his non-conformity; ſo as in this I did but diſcharge my duty, and deſerve no blame. Sixtly, as to the Feoffees for impropriations, there was great complaint made to me againſt them, that their end was to take away the right of patronages from the Church to make thoſe Miniſters they preferred independent on the Biſhops, &amp; dependent wholly on them, and to engroſſe moſt Eccleſiaſticall preferments into their own hands, which I conceiving to be true in it ſelfe, and that it would prove miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to the Church, did thereupon by the Kings command, cauſe an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be exhibited againſt them, in a legall way, in the Exchequer; where upon a full and faire hearing, they were ſuppreſſed, not by me, but by the Judges of that Court, who gave ſentence againſt them; which ſentence was either legall or illegall, juſt or unjuſt; if juſt and legall, then there was no wrong nor injuſtice at all done in the caſe, and ſo no cauſe of accuſation or complaint againſt me, or thoſe who gave it; if illegall and unjuſt, the Judges who gave the ſentence muſt anſwer for it, not I, who proſecuted them onely in a legall way, and left them to judge according to Law and Juſtice: Beſides, ſome of the profits of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed impropriations, were beſtowed towards the maintainance of Lecturers at Saint <hi>Antholins,</hi> contrary to the truſt and intention, and Parſons not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Church of <hi>England</hi> were put into ſome of them; therefore I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that I did but my duty in queſtioning &amp; ſuppeſſing them as I did: For Doctor <hi>Heylins</hi> Sermon, it concernes not me, he ſpake therein of the Feoffees, according as he conceived of them, and if any thing be miſtaken he muſt anſwer for it: As for Maſter <hi>Foxly,</hi> I did onely check him for his forwardneſſe in this work, which I conceived would prove miſchievous to the Church.</p>
               <p>To which was replied; Firſt, that the originall draught of theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was produced under his owne hand; that it was but a tranſcript out of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">Reply.</note> 
                  <hi>Harſnets</hi> Copy, the originall Author of them, is but his owne bare ſurmiſe, without any proofe or colour: But admit <hi>Harſnet</hi> firſt contrived them, yet he was the onely man that preſented them to the King, and cauſed them to be put
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:61245:276"/>
in execution, to the ſuppreſſion of Lecturers, Lectures, preaching; therefore the miſchiefe produced by them muſt reſt on him alone. Secondly, it is true, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were ſent to him by his Predeceſſor <hi>Abbot,</hi> as from the King; but we have proved, that himſelfe firſt procured, contrived, preſented them to the King, to be put in execution, and cauſed the King to ſend them to Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to all the Biſhops of his Province; and ſo zealous was he in the purſuit of them in his owne Dioceſſe of <hi>London,</hi> that he ſuppreſſed many Lectures and Lecturers by colour of them; yea, ſuch was his activity in their originall contrivance and ſubſequent execution, that the Deane and Chapter of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> certified all their proceedings on them, not to Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> but to him, being then but Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and complained to him of the Archbiſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſſe in ſeeing them duly executed in ſuch ſort as they deſired, as we have fully manifeſted: Therefore all the miſchiefe in ſuppreſſing of Lectures and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by meanes or colour of them, muſt light upon his head, the originall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver and chiefe proſecutor of them; yea, all Biſhop <hi>Wrens,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Mountagues,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Pierces</hi> Viſitations Articles, and ſuppreſſions of preaching, Lecturers and Lectures, muſt be attributed to &amp; charged upon him, becauſe they originally ſprang from theſe Injunctions of his contrivance; becauſe he was acquainted with, and countenanced, approved them in all their wicked proceedings, of which they gave a particular annuall account to him in writing, found in his Study under their owne hands, and never checked but animated them in their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuppreſſions of godly Miniſters, Lectures, Preaching, <hi>Et qui non prohibet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum quod poteſt, jubet,</hi> is the very reſolution of the <hi>Canon Law.</hi> Thirdly, the Orders for Combination Lectures, tending to ſuppreſſe or make them meerly ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or ceremoniall uſeleſſe Ordinances, though not made immediately by him, did yet ſpring originally from him, were ſent up to, and not revoked, but appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, and Sir <hi>John Lambe</hi> his creature, and no Biſhops durſt to have made or enjoyned them without his previous approbation or direction; therefore he muſt beare the blame and guilt of them. Fourthly, for the Kings Letter touching Ordination of Miniſters, we have proved it to be his owne (the Originall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being penned, corrected by himſelfe) not the Kings, whom he over-reached, abuſed in it: For though the pretence and letter of it ſeemed very faire and neceſſary, yet the intention and execution of it by the Archbiſhop, was moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, deteſtable, to ſuppreſſe Lecturers, Lectures, Preaching, and deter all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, conſcientious Schollers from the Miniſtery, as we have plentifully manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, to which he hath offered no reply; nor yet to his preſſing of the Book of Sports, for the like purpoſe. Fiftly, for his ſilencing Maſter <hi>Leigh</hi> and others Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers, his anſwer is very defective, ſince he cannot prove him factious or ſciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, nor yet Maſter <hi>Randall,</hi> they being known to be orthodox and conformable: The onely crime they were guilty of was, that they were diligent, painfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and did much good among the people; and therefore his Letter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter <hi>Leigh</hi> is poſitive, <hi>That if nothing can be fastened on him, whereby he may be cenſured; HOWEVER let him not obtaine any licenſe to Lecture there, &amp;c. for the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See here p. 381.</note> 
                  <hi>Church hath not need of ſuch men:</hi> And Maſter <hi>Randalls</hi> fault was onely this, that he preached long Sermons on Sundayes in the afternoon, and for this they muſt be and were ſuſpended from preaching. Sixtly, for the Feoffees to purchaſe in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations, it was a moſt pious work, to the great benefit of the Church and peoples ſoules, approved generally by the worſt of men and Biſhops; that the overthrow of it was his owne act and deſigne, we have undeniably proved it by his owne DIARY, and ſundry witneſſes from his owne mouth; that any ever complained to him thereof as dangerous to the Church, is but his owne bare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, void of truth; he naming neither the perſons complaining, nor the time of their complaint: That it would introduce a Miniſtery independent on the Biſhops, is a falſe ſurmiſe, ſince none were recommended to officiate or preach at any of the purchaſed Impropriations, but by ſpeciall licenſe of the Biſhops in
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:61245:276"/>
whoſe they were, and none were preſented to them but conformable men, free from all juſt exceptions, &amp; if he could juſtly except againſt ought in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, Maſter <hi>White</hi> depoſeth, he offered that he himſelfe ſhould rectifie it, ſo as the work might proceed; but this would not content him, but they muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and criminally proceeded againſt: That he did it in a legall way, is no juſtification nor excuſe, ſince thoſe who work and accompliſh miſchiefe by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Law, are worſe then open Tyrants: For the ſentence, no doubt it was moſt unjuſt, and ſo the <hi>Earle of Dorſet,</hi> who was preſent at it, told the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, affirming the buying in of Impropriations to be the beſt work that ever was ſet on foot, for the Churches good; his owne beging the Impropriations in <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Crowne, for the pretended good of the Church, proves it infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly againſt himſelfe: But that the Judges onely muſt anſwer for this unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, not he, is a meer Nonſequitur; becauſe the Law reſolves, that <hi>Plus peccat Author quàm Actor;</hi> and the Judges had never given ſuch an unjuſt ſentence in this cauſe, had not he by his violence, power, fraud, interreſſing the King himſelfe againſt the Feoffees, over-awed, ſwayed the Judges to ſwarve from the rules of Piety and Juſtice: That ſome of the revenues of purchaſed Impropriations were contributed towards the maintainance of Saint <hi>Antholins</hi> Lecturers, is true; but that it was a miſ-imploying by them contrary to truſt, or that any unworthy or unconformable Miniſters were put into them, is a groſſe falſhood, diſproved by Maſter <hi>White</hi> upon Oath: However, had it been true, he ſhould then have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the abuſe, not utterly deſtroyed the good work, ſo much conducing to Gods glory, and the peoples edification: For <hi>Heylins</hi> Sermon, it was preſented to, retained, approved, yea himſelfe advanced by him, and no doubt he preached it by his direction: As for Maſter <hi>Foxly,</hi> he did not onely check, but perſecute, impriſon, and moſt barbarouſly handle him to his undoing, onely for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting this pious project, even after he had quite overthrowne it, and openly vaunted of this his wickedneſſe: All which conſidered, each branch of this charge ſticks moſt immovably upon him, notwithſtanding all his evaſions to ſhake it off.</p>
               <p>The ſixteenth charge urged againſt me is, That I have endeavoured to cauſe diviſion and diſcord between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 16.</note> and endeavoured to ſuppreſſe the Priviledges &amp; Immunities of the reformed Dutch and French Churches in this Kingdome; wherein it was objected: Firſt, that I eſteemed them no Churches of God or Chriſt at all, becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nted Biſhope which they endeavoured to prove by mine owne <hi>Conference with Fiſher,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hals Propoſitions,</hi> approved by me, and Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Book, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by my Chaplaine. Secondly, that I deemed their Religion and ours not to be one, but different, and their Religion not to be the true Religion: Upon which ground I grew angry with Maſter <hi>Ruly,</hi> and cauſed the Letters-Patents granted by the King for a Collection for the Palatinate Miniſters, to be revoked after they had paſſed the great Seale, and a clauſe in them to be expunged, to their great injury and ſcandall, as Maſter <hi>Wakerly</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hartlib</hi> atteſted. Thirdly, that I cauſed the Declaration of the Faith and Ceremonies of the Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Church to be called in and ſuppreſſed. Fourthly, That I moleſted the DUTCH, FRENCH and WALLOONE reformed Churches in <hi>England</hi> ſundry yeers, and infringed their ancient Priviledges by my Injunctions in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer in generall, that I deny both the Charge and Article, and that I have endeavoured to promote and preſerve peace between the Proteſtant <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Churches abroad, and encouraged Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> who was imployed to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation between the Calviniſts and Lutherans beyond the Seas, as I could evidence by ſundry of his Letters; therefore I had a good affection to theſe Churches, and no intent to make any diſcord between them: To the objected particulars I anſwer;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="540" facs="tcp:61245:277"/>
Firſt, that in my Conference with <hi>Fiſher,</hi> I cite only S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Jeroms words,</hi> to prove a difference in order and degree, between a Biſhop and ordinary Presbyter, and inferre from his words, as his opinion, not mine; <hi>ſo even with him, no Biſhop, no Church.</hi> But it hath been objected, that Biſh. <hi>Mountagues</hi> Book determines expreſly, that there can be no Church without Biſhops, nor Miniſters but ſuch who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Dioceſian Biſh. diſtinct from an ordinary Miniſter, and that no Miniſter (no not in caſe of neceſſity) can be ordained by any other; therefore the forraign Proteſtant Churches, which have no ſuch Biſhops, and their Miniſters, being not ordained by Biſhops, but other Presbyters, can be no Churches nor Miniſters: I anſwer, that this Book and opinion of his concernes not me, being none of mine but the Authors: Yea, but I maintained and approved the ſame opinion in effect in Biſhop <hi>Hals Propoſitions</hi> touching Epiſcopacy, to which I endeavoured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a generall ſubſcription, preſſing it upon others; and therein I determine, <hi>That there was no Church of Chriſt upon earth ever ſince the Apostles times governed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by Biſhops; and that this government is unalterable, and ought to be perpetuated in the Church to the end of the world:</hi> Which doth wholly unchurch all the reformed Churches, and reſolve them to be no Churches of Chriſt. I anſwer, that theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were ſent me by Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> of his owne accord, that what I did in them was by his conſent, neither were any preſſed to ſubſcribe them, nor they propounded concludingly: And though Epiſcopacy be not alterable, yet it may be regulated: That it is unalterable, Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> hath proved it long ſince, it continuing ſo in all Churches at leaſt fifteen hundred yeers after Chriſt, and is allowed, approved by the Book of Ordination; yea Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe on that of <hi>John, As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> acknowledgeth the perpetuity of Biſhops in the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deny that I eſteem the Reformed Churches Religion &amp; ours not to be the ſame; true it is, we &amp; they differ in ſome particular points of Doctrin as wel as in Diſciplin; but this makes us not wholly to differ in Religion, nor did I deny their Religion to be true: As for Maſter <hi>Ruly,</hi> I uſed him very civilly with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and promoted the Collection for the Palatinate all I could, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Letter from the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> for that purpoſe: True it is, I cauſed the objected clauſe in the firſt Patent of the Collection to be altered, but it was by the Kings direction, who gave order for it, upon my acquainting him therwith; and I conceive there was ground enough to doe it: Firſt, becauſe ſome of the Palatinate Divines (as <hi>Paraus</hi> upon the <hi>Romans)</hi> differed from our Church in ſome points of Doctrine touching the Kings Supremacy, concurring therein with the Papiſts;) for which his Book was here publickly condemned, burnt, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſome other points,) therefore it could not be properly ſaid that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ours was the ſame in all particulars: Secondly, it ſeemed to determine a great controverſie between Proteſtant Divines among themſelves, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe between them and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> whether the Pope be Antichriſt? which was never yet determined by any Councell, and of which there is great doubt and difference in opinion even among the learned: Now I conceived it a very unfitting thing to determine ſuch a doubtfull controverſie definitively by Letters. Patents under the great Seale, which is not yet reſolved in the Schooles. Upon theſe grounds the King thought fit to revoke the Patent, though it were under the Great Seale, which I had no power to recall, but the KING onely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I deny that I called in the <hi>Declaration of the Palſgraves Religion,</hi> neither doe I rememeber any ſuch thing: Fourthly, it is true, that I queſtioned the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Walloone</hi> Churches, but not for any ancient Priviledges, but onely for their encroachments beyond their priviledges, to the prejudice of our Engliſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Pariſhes wherein they lived; yet my Injunctions and proceedings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in this kind, were ſo faire and juſt, that they reſted ſatisfied with them, and returned me ſpeciall thanks for my favour towards them and their
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:61245:277"/>
Congregations; therefore I much mervaile that this my carriage ſhould be ſo much blamed, as to make it a CAPITALL CRIME and CHARGE a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed in the generall, that the premiſed proofes, with his late military proceedings againſt the Scots, for complying with thoſe Churches in <note place="margin">Reply.</note> their Doctrine, Diſcipline, Government, ſufficiently evidence his enmity to, his oppoſition againſt thoſe forraigne Proteſtant Churches, becauſe they had no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; inſomuch that he blamed Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> for dealing ſo mildly with them in his Book for Epiſcopacy, which he ſubmitted to his cenſure, where on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he is ſo zealous of the Popes honour, that he could not but complaine to the King of ſome harſh paſſages in it, beſtowing the Title of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> on his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and procured a ſpeciall command from his Majeſty to the Biſhop to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge them, to gratifie the Pope; yea, his purging out the objected clauſe in the Kings <hi>Patent,</hi> and ſuppreſſing of the <hi>Declaration</hi> of Palatinate Churches Faith and Religion, argues little affection in him to thoſe Churches, and much inward rancour againſt them, but a very high eſteem of <hi>Rome:</hi> As for his encouraging of Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> in his deſigne of reconciling the <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> undertook this worke without his privity or advice, and found ſo ſmall encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from him, that he oft complained thereof to his friends, as we are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed.</p>
               <p>To the particulars we reply; Firſt, that in his <hi>Conference with Fiſher,</hi> he doth not recite, but miſrecite and pervert Saint <hi>Jeroms</hi> words and opinion; who dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally reſolves in his very Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> which this Archbiſhop quotes, and elſwhere; <hi>That Biſhops and Presbyters Jure Divino, are both one and the ſame, as well in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction as Office, and that Presbyters have the power of Ordination as well as Biſhops:</hi> Therefore his appropriating of the word <hi>Sacerdos</hi> and <hi>Jeroms</hi> ſaying, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi non eſt Sacerdos non eſt Eccleſia;</hi> to Dioceſian Biſhops, which he cleerly meanes of Prieſts and Miniſters in generall, is a groſſe perverting of <hi>Jeroms</hi> meaning; and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferene thence: <hi>So even with him, NO BISHOP and NO CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH,</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Declaration of his owne private opinion, not of <hi>Jeroms,</hi> who held no ſuch Prelaticall Paradox: For Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Book, it was licenſed by his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, preſented to, received, approved by himſelfe: Biſhop <hi>Hals</hi> Propoſitions were not onely interlined with, but allowed under his owne hand, as fit for a generall ſubſcription, and now he juſtifies them not onely by Biſhop <hi>Bilſons</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but likewiſe by Maſter <hi>Calvins,</hi> as great an enemy to Biſhops as Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> whoſe words he wilfully perverts as he did his, in applying that to Dioceſian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which he ſpake onely of ordinary Miniſters, who ſucceeded the Apoſtles in their Miniſteriall Function: In briefe, his owne <hi>Conference,</hi> together with <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> Book, and Biſhop <hi>Hals</hi> Propoſitions, approved by him, doe neceſſarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church all the reformed Proteſtant Curches, un-miniſter all their Miniſters, and make them no Churches no Miniſters of Chriſt; whereas he averres the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, and her Prieſts to be true Miniſters, as we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved; therefore he muſt needs be guilty of the extreameſt malignity and anmity againſt them, what ever he pretends to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he denies, and yet at laſt juſtifies and maintains what we charge him with, <hi>to wit,</hi> that he denies the Religion of forraign Proteſtant Churches to be the ſame with ours, or to be true Religion; &amp; he inſtanceth in the opinion of <hi>Paraeus,</hi> whoſe Commentary on the <hi>Romans</hi> he cauſed to be burnt as erronious, when as he writes no more then <hi>Bilſon</hi> did before him (whom himſelf hath cited in defence of Epiſcopacy) &amp; other orthodox Writers of our Church have maintained publickly for truth before &amp; ſince: As for the burning of <hi>Paraus</hi> his Book, being of a forraign Nation and no Subject to our King, without ſummoning him to defend himſelfe, it was an unjuſt, raſh, inconſiderate action, to ſay no more, as his Son hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the world in print, who hath juſtified his Fathers opinion to the full, as orthodox: However, the extravagant opinion of one Palatinate Divine, in
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:61245:278"/>
point onely of the Kings Supremacy (not about any Article of Faith) cannot make the reformed Churches and ours to be of different Religions, eſpecially ſince he argues in his Star-chamber Speech, that the Papiſts Religion and ours are both one, though we differ in ſome private Tenets: Yea, his deniall of the Proteſtants Religion in forraigne parts to be the <hi>true Religion,</hi> when as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that <hi>Rome is a true Church,</hi> argues his virulency againſt the one, and good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the other. Thirdly, the calling in of the <hi>Declaration of the Palſgraves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is directly and punctually proved to be his act; its impudency therefore in him to deny it, and policy not to remember it. Fourthly, for the purgation and revocation of the Letters-Patents, he not onely confeſſeth, but ſhameleſly juſtifies it (moſt undutifully laying the blame, the ſcandall of it on the King himſelfe, who did naught therein but by his inſtigation) and that upon two falſe, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous grounds: Firſt, that the Religion of the forraigne Palatinate Churches and ours differ and are not the ſame: then which falſhood nothing can procure a greater ſciſme and juſter ground of ſcandall between us and thoſe Churches. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that no Councill had defined the Pope to be Antichriſt, of which there was great variety of opinions amongſt Proteſtant Divines touching the ſame, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be decided by the Kings Letters-Patents. Therefore he purged it out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it intimated the Pope to be Antichriſt, and ſubjection to him an <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Yoke</hi> of bondage; both which compared with his Purgations out of Biſhop <hi>Hals</hi> Book of Epiſcopacy to the ſame effect) proves him a Papiſt with a witneſſe, and a ſpeciall friend to the Popes Holineſſe, of whoſe honour among us he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary tender: That the Pope is the Antichriſt, all <note n="a" place="margin">See here p. 276. to 279. <hi>Catalogus Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtium veritatis</hi>

Fiftly, the premiſes abundantly manifeſt to all, that the Archbiſhop invaded, diminiſhed the ancient Immunities and Priviledges of the Dutch and Walloon Churches in all parts, not their pretended encroachments onely upon our Churches Priviledges, and that he was ſo farre from being their friend, that they eſteemed him then their greateſt enemy: If they formerly returned him any thanks (by way of Court-complement) for not taking away all their priviledges, as well as ſome of them, after many yeers hot conteſt, we are certaine they juſtly complained of him ten times more for invading, depriving them of ſundry of their ancient Immunities, which almoſt brought their Churches to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine: In few words, his owne forecited Papers, and <hi>Monſieur Bulteels</hi> Booke of the manifold troubles of thoſe Churches by this Arch-Prelats proſecution, will abundantly falſifie this his pretended friendſhip towards them, and remaine as a laſting Record againſt him to Poſterity. All which conſidered, the whole Bulk and every particle of all the proofs and evidences produced by us to make good the firſt branch of the Commons firſt generall Charge of High-treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, remaine altogether unſhaken, unavoyded, maugre all his ſophiſticall evaſions, proteſtations and ſhifting anſwers to them.

               </head>
               <p>I Proceed now to the Archbiſhops <hi>Defence</hi> againſt the Second Branch of the Commons firſt Generall Charge; to wit, his <hi>Endevours to reconcile the Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>of England to the Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he gave ſome general Anſwers in his Generall Defence at the Lords Barre, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 2. 1644. to this effect: My Lords (ſaid he) I am charged for ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> to introduce Popery, and reconcile the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I ſhall recite the ſum of the Evidence and Arguments given in for to prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I have in my firſt Speech, nominated divers perſons of Eminency, whom I reduced from Popery to our Church. And if this be ſo, then the Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me is this; I converted many from Popery, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I went about to bring in Popery, and to reconcile the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I am charged to be the Author of the, &amp;c. Oath in the New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, parcell of which Oath is to abjure Popery, and that I will not ſubject the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> (A more ſtrict Oath then ever was made againſt Popery in any age or Church.) And then the argument againſt me is this; I made and tooke an Oath to abjure Popery, and not to ſubject the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore I was inclinable to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and endeavoured to ſubject the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the third Canon (of the late New ones) was made by me, which is againſt Popery; and then the Argument is; I made a Canon againſt Popery; <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> I was inclinable to, and endevoured to introduce it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I was twice ſeriouſly offered a Cardinalſhip, and I refuſed it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not be ſubject to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome; Ergo,</hi> I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Popery, and endevoured to reduce the Church of <hi>England</hi> into ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, I writ a Booke againſt Popery, in Anſwer to <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuit; and then the Argument is this; I writ a Book againſt Popery; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am inclinable to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and laboured to introduce it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, it is alledged, I concealed and cheriſhed the Plot of the Jeſuits diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Habernfeild;</hi> and therefore I intended to bring in Popery, and reduce the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I amſwer, either this Plot was not reall; and if ſo, then <hi>Romes Masterpeece</hi> is quite blowne up, and publiſhed in vaine. Or elſe it was reall, &amp; then I was really in danger of my life, for oppoſing Popery and this Plot. Then the Argument from it muſt be this; I was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of my life for cheriſhing the Jeſuites Plot of reducing the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome; Ergo,</hi> I cheriſhed and endevoured to effect this Plot.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, I laboured to make a reconciliation between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists; Ergo,</hi> I laboured to introduce Popery, and make a reconciliation between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

This generall defence and ſcoffing anſwer of his at the Lords Barre, ſeemed very ſpecious to ſome ignorant Auditors, who took theſe feined objections of <note place="margin">Reply.</note> his owne forging, to be the arguments, and maine ſtrength of the Commons E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence produced, to convict him of a ſerious endeavour to ſubvert the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, introduce popery, and reconcile the Church of <hi>England</hi> unto <hi>Rome;</hi> when as the Commons made no ſuch objections from the Evidence and proofs againſt him: Wherupon they replyed, that he did but fight with his owne ſhadow, and abſurd arguments of his owne framing (as he did in his Sear-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Speech) inſtead of repeating and anſwering their reall Objections and proofs againſt him, transforming his owne defence into their Charge and Evidence; a meer ſophiſticall, Jeſuiticall practice, of which he made uſe throughout his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to which we ſhall reply in order.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Commons never objected, that ever he reduced any from popery, but that many were ſeduced to, and hardened in it by his meanes: Their Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being; He was a meanes of ſeducing many to, and obdurating thouſands in popery, by his introducing popiſh Doctrines, Innovations, Ceremonies, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he went about to bring in popery, and reduce us back to <hi>Rome:</hi> That he reduced any from popery, is but his owne bare allegation in his firſt Speech and generall Defence, without any proofe at all, but his owne bare word, which the Commons denied; himſelfe confeſſing, that ſome of the eminenteſt of them preſently relapſed after their converſion, and lived and dyed Papiſts: See then the falſhood and fallacy of this miſ-repeating Sophiſter, in the very firſt entrance and principall argument of his generall Defence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to his ſecond and third arguments we retort; That the Commons never gave in evidence againſt his making or impoſing the &amp;c. Oath, or third new Canon, to prove him guilty of introducing popery, or endeavoring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to <hi>Rome,</hi> but to two other different purpoſes, which he wholly preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; therefore his two arguments from them, as the Commons own, are meer forgeries, impoſtures of his owne: As for the &amp;c. Oath, it hath no ſuch clauſe in it as is pretended; indeed it hath this clauſe, <hi>That I will not endeavour by my ſelfe or any other directly or indirectly, to bring in any Popiſh Doctrine, contrary to that which is establiſhed;</hi> which is but a meere pretence and policy, all or moſt popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins and Ceremonies being introduced, licenſed, eſtabliſhed among us when this Oath was made, as the premiſes evidence, and no Doctrine being then eſteemed Popiſh but what the Archbiſhop pleaſed, though truly ſuch: As for the third Canon, it enjoynes onely private conference with popiſh Recuſants, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, excommunications of ſuch of them who are obſtinate, and if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme not, then that their names ſhall be preſented to the Judges of the Aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at all, and was but a meer State-policy to ſtay the preſent elamours of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Scots againſt the Prelats, for their connivance at popery and confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 65, 66.</note> with Papiſts, againſt thoſe they ſtiled Puritans, and a thing not really inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but pretended onely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his fourth, fift and fixt arguments are of the ſame nature, meer Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraes of his owne forging, which he would father on the Commons, who preſſed theſe particulars againſt him in a far other manner, to which he gives no anſwer: His refuſing of a Cardinals Cap, was onely becauſe he deſired to be an abſolute independent Patriarch and Pope within the Kings Dominions: His Book againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> was publiſhed in his owne name upon entreaty of others, onely to blind the world, and ſtop the clamours againſt him, in making them beleeve thereby he was no friend to Papiſts or popery, when as we have proved the contrary out of that and other of his books. To that of <hi>Habernfield</hi> we ſhall anſwer in due ſeaſon; ſome deeming it onely a forgery or plot of his owne devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to juſtifie himſelfe, others a reall truth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, his ſeventh argument is a moſt wilfull perverſion of the Commons
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:61245:279"/>
charge, who expreſly impeach him for <hi>endeavouring to cauſe diviſion and diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our owne and other reformed Churches, that ſo Papists might have the more advantage;</hi> which we have abundantly proved. And he makes the charge to be, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a reconciliatiou between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> (of which good act he was never guilty in the leaſt degree, for ought he makes appeare, but of the quite contrary) <hi>Ergo,</hi> to reconcile the Church of ENGLAND to the Church of ROME.</p>
               <p>By which ſtrange prevarication and Jeſuiticall ſophiſtry, the world may cleerly diſcerne, the ſophiſtry, fallacy, and apparent Legerdemaine of this his generall Defence, and impertinency of his Anſwers, encountring onely his owne ridiculous fictions, not the Commons reall Objections.</p>
               <p>Having recited theſe his generall Anſwers, we ſhall purſue him to his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar evaſions to the evidence and proofes produced, to make good the ſecond Branch of his firſt generall Charge, wherein he thus proceeded.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing objected againſt me is, That I have ever been generally reputed a Papiſt, or perſon popiſhly affected, both in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> whiles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 1. Page 409. to 415.</note> there, and ever ſince; as likewiſe in <hi>Rome</hi> and in other forraigne parts; for proofe whereof, the teſtimonies of Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> Doctor <hi>Abbots</hi> Sermon, Doctor <hi>Hals</hi> Letter, <hi>Francis Harris</hi> his Depoſition, with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> Maſter <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> have been produced.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; Firſt, that all theſe are but hear-ſayes or reports, and no <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> convincing Evidence, that I was really a Papiſt, or inclined unto popery: Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Featlies</hi> teſtimony is but a report from one who ſaid he was my Pupill, and that at <hi>Paris</hi> many yeers ſince, in forraigne parts: Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brents</hi> teſtimony is but a report from Maſter <hi>Dale,</hi> of a thing long ſince, that my ſuppoſition was taken out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which I deny: His further teſtimony is onely this, That <hi>Browne,</hi> with whom I kept company, was but a reputed (not an actuall) Papiſt during his life, and what he ſubjoynes, that he was found to be ſuch a one after his death, is very conſecturall; for it appeares not that the Book objected was of his owne penning, though it were his hand-writing, for it might be a tranſcript: That I petitioned to <hi>King James,</hi> that I was traduced to be a Papiſt, is true, and I had good reaſon ſo to doe when I was thus traduced; and upon my Petition, the buſineſſe was referred to the examination of divers worthy perſons, and I cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon full hearing by the King: For Doctor <hi>Abbots</hi> Sermon, I complained of it, as I had cauſe, as being traduced by it; he was knowne to be my enemy, and to doe me wrong herein, therefore his words are not to be valued in this caſe; nor Doctor <hi>Hals</hi> Letter to <hi>W. L.</hi> which might be to ſome other as well as to me, who am not nominated therein: For <hi>Francis Harris</hi> his teſtimony, I never knew nor ſaw the man to my knowledge, and it is but a hearſay from one <hi>Ireland</hi> many yeers ſince, and that beyondthe Sea; for <hi>Ireland</hi> himſelfe I onely knew, but had nofamiliar acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for Sir <hi>Henry Mildmayes</hi> teſtimony, it is onely a bare rumour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from ſome perſons at <hi>Rome,</hi> unknowne both to me and him, purpoſely rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Papiſts to blaſt or wound my reputation, and what he now atteſted is quite contrary to that himſelfe informed me at my Table at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after his returne from <hi>Rome,</hi> as I am ready to depoſe upon my corporall Oath, if I may be permitted: His Brother Maſter <hi>Anthony Mildmay</hi> his teſtimony is but an incertaine report from I know not whom at <hi>Rome,</hi> that I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more favourable to their Religion then my Predeceſſors; and what he heard from Father <hi>Fitton,</hi> is but his report, and a falſe one too, of purpoſe to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, or deceive their Proſelites there: For Maſter <hi>Challoners</hi> teſtimony, it is but a report too, from I know not whom, and a diſcourſe of others to him, without any ground ariſing from me; and I have cauſe to feare, that what he teſtified was meerly out of ſpleen, and a meer engine to ruine me, becauſe upon
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:61245:280"/>
complaint I cauſed him to be Committed for ſome high Offences charged againſt him, amounting to little leſſe then Treaſon; to avoyd which, he was enforced to fly beyond the Seas, where he heard theſe reports concerning me, it we may beleeve him; which are no evidence at all in Law.</p>
               <p>To this the Commons replied; Firſt, that though common fame be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing <note place="margin">Reply.</note> evidence of it ſelf, yet in many caſes both in common, Civill and Canon Law, it is a good ground of ſuſpition, <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 13. 12, 13, 14.

when he was there, together with the reaſons of their opinions and report; and he depoſeth the truth hereof quite contrary to what the Archbiſhop ſuggeſted: whoſe Oath is not to be credited in his owne caſe, to impeach Sir <hi>Henries</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, fortified with two others concurring with it: The like we anſwer to Captaine <hi>Anthony Mildmayes</hi> and Maſter <hi>Challoners</hi> teſtimonies; they both depoſe what opinions and reports the Popes Nuncio <hi>Con,</hi> Father <hi>Fitton,</hi> Father <hi>Talbot,</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh Jeſuits, Priests</hi> and forraigne <hi>Papists</hi> had of the Archbiſhops good affection to their Religion, and how inſtrumentall he was to introduce Popery, and reduce us backe to ROME, declaring punctually each particular: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their teſtimonies are all reall, and no hear-ſayes or bare reports, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. As for Maſter <hi>Challoners</hi> pretended malice, it is but a bare ſurmiſe, and being a Gentleman of quality and integrity, this poore pretence is altogether inſufficient to diſparage his teſtimony upon Oath: The rather, becauſe the Archbiſhops endeavours to impriſon and bring him into the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion heretofore, was, onely for ſpeaking of the Prieſts and Jeſuits Plots to bring in Popery, and ſome of our Biſhops compliance with them; the party who complained againſt him, being both a Prieſt and Jeſuit, now in actuall Armes againſt the Parliament, in the Kings Army, (as Maſter <hi>Challoner</hi> depoſed;) a great confirmation of the truth of his Teſtimony, and of the Archbiſhops guilt. In few words, all theſe recited teſtimonies, what opinion they had at <hi>Oxford</hi> heretofore, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places ſince, of his being a Papiſt, and confederating with them in their Deſigne of introducing Popery by inches, and reducing us backe to <hi>Rome,</hi> compared with his preceding practiſes, doe fix this charge ſo faſt upon him, that all his Sophiſtry or Oratory cannot ſhake it off.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing objected is this, That there was a dangerous Plot laid and ſeriouſly purſued, to introduce Popery, and reconcile the Church of <hi>England</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which I was privy, and had certaine notice of it, yet I complyed with it, and never laboured to prevent it; which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons laboured to prove by divers generall inſtances: Firſt, by the Spaniſh Match, propounded to the King when Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and his ſending over into <hi>Spaine,</hi> of purpoſe to pervert him in his Religion, as appeares by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty; the Popes Letters to the Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Conchen</hi> when in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Articles of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> againſt him in full Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1626. To which they Object I was privy, becauſe I was Confeſſor to the Duke, and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Counſell at that time, and becauſe my Letter to Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> my owne Diary, and Letters to and from the Duke, whiles in <hi>Spaine,</hi> with the Note in my Maſſe Booke diſcover and confirme it: Secondly, by the French Match with the Queen promoted purpoſely to uſher in Popery, and to reconcile us unto <hi>Rome;</hi> to which they Object I was privy and aſſiſtant, as my Letters to the Duke, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy and compliance with the Queen, my inhibitng Miniſters to pray, and puniſhing them for praying for the Queens converſion, my cenſuring of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>How</hi> for praying, That the <hi>young Prince might not be brought up in Popery,</hi> with my magnifying of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, and depreſſing King <hi>Edwards</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by ſundry particular inſtances; as Firſt, <hi>Ludovicus a Sancta Maria</hi> his Concluſiones Theologicae: Secondly, the Plot diſcovered to me by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berufield:</hi> Thirdly, the Dedicating of <hi>Faſtidius</hi> his Works to the King by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Barbarino:</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> his <hi>Deus, Natura, Gratia,</hi> writ of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reconcile us to <hi>Rome,</hi> with which I was acquainted, and maintained the Author of it, Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> a moſt dangerous ſeducing Prieſt, in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Oxford:</hi> Fifthly, the proffers of Cardinalſhips to Engliſh men, and twice to my ſelfe: Sixthly, the ſtrange encreaſe and proceedings of Papiſts, Prieſts, Jeſuits, and the Popiſh Hierarchy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which I was privy,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:61245:281"/>
yet denied it, and incenſed the King, againſt the Commons for complaining of it: Seventhly, the Popes ſending of divers Nuncioes ſucceſſively into <hi>England,</hi> where they reſided, and were publickly entertained, with our reciprocall ſending and maintaining Agents at <hi>Rome,</hi> to work a Reducement of us back to that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian See.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that I was neither the Author nor Fomenter of the <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Spaniſh Match, nor of the Kings Voyage into <hi>Spaine,</hi> which was charged on the Duke and the Lord <hi>Dighy:</hi> It is true, my Lord Duke was pleaſed to enter into a neer familiarity with me, and to make me his Confeſſor, and that I writ Letters to him into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and received Letters from him thence; but this proves not that I was privy to that Plot; as for the Popes Letters to the Prince and the Biſhop of <hi>Conchen</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to pervert him in his Religion, they are nothing to me, and my Letter to Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> was many yeers after that Match broken off.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is no proofe of my furthering the Match with <hi>France,</hi> or that the end of it was to reduce us back to <hi>Rome;</hi> the reſpects and ſervices I did for the Queen, were no more then in civility and duty I ought to performe out of the duty I bare to the King my Maſter, whoſe Conſort and Wife ſhe is; her gracious favour towards me, proceeded only from her owne gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, not from my deſerts or ſeeking; and I had no reaſon to reject it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be a meanes for me to work the more effectually upon her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: For my giving Order in my Metropolitical Viſitation to my Viſitor, to inhibit Miniſters to pray for the Queens converſion, or queſtioning any for praying for it, I abſolutely deny it; and for Maſter <hi>How,</hi> he was juſtly cenſured for his prayer, it being ſcandalous to his Majeſty in queſtioning his care of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces education in the true Religion, and infuſing jealouſies into the peoples heads, of his education in Popery, and inclination to it. As for my pretended magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, and depreſſing of King <hi>Edwards</hi> and Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths,</hi> in the Preface to the OXFORD STATUTES, I anſwer, that that Preface is none of mine, nor proved to be ſo; and if it were, yet the words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the State and Statutes of the Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> only in their dayes, not of our Church and Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to the particular Inſtances, I anſwer, that the firſt, ſecond and third of them concerne not me: I was neither the cauſe, nor author of, nor privy to them, nor could I hinder them, and the ſecond of them is a ſtrong evidence for me; For the fourth of them, <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> his Book, it was printed at <hi>Lyons,</hi> not at <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Saint Giles</hi> was not the Author of it, but another Fryar, I had no hand in it, nor was privy to it; yet it was diſliked by many of the Papiſts, becauſe it gave much advantage to our Church and Religion: For his being at <hi>Oxford,</hi> it was much againſt my will, by the Kings ſpeciall Warrant, for which I have his hand, and I maintained him not there, but the King. To the fifth, the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Cardinals Caps to others, is nothing to me; and for the offer of a Cardinalſhip to my ſelfe two ſeverall times, as I could not hinder the offers, ſo I rejected them, and acquainted the King both <hi>with the perſon and thing,</hi> which is all I could doe, expreſſing the cauſe of my refuſall thereof, to be, <hi>That ſomething dwelt within me that would not ſuffer that till</hi> Rome <hi>were other then it is, as appeares by my owne Diary:</hi> The ſtrongeſt Evidence that can be to acquit me from any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliancy with <hi>Rome.</hi> To the ſixth I anſwer, that the encreaſe and proceedings of the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> mentioned in the Objected Letters and Papers, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me, I was not the cauſe nor author thereof; the <hi>Monaſteries</hi> and <hi>Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>meries</hi> mentioned in them, were but poor little houſes; My anſwer to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi> was penned by the Kings ſpeciall command, as appears by the endorſment, &amp; I knew not of theſe Iriſh papers, nor of the encreaſe of popery there, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an <hi>anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Remonſtr. An.</hi> 1628. theſe <hi>Proclamations, letters, papers</hi> being dated ſince that time: for the Deputies letters they are nothing to me, I could not hinder
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:61245:281"/>
the writing and directing of them to me, and himſelfe hath already been impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, condemned for his Actions, for which I am not to anſwer. To the ſeventh I ſay, it was not in my power to hinder the Popes ſending his <hi>Nuncioes</hi> hither, which the <hi>King</hi> condiſcended to upon the <hi>Queens</hi> earneſt deſire, to accommodate and ſatisfie her Majeſty in ſome things which concerned her in her Religion. For the Agents ſent and reſiding in <hi>Rome</hi> they were hers, not mine, ſent thither by her <hi>Majesty</hi> without my privity, and againſt my liking.</p>
               <p>To this was replied; Firſt, that the forementioned Evidence fully demonſtrats <note place="margin">Reply.</note> that the Archbiſhop was both privy, conſenting, aſſiſting to the <hi>Spaniſh Match,</hi> Voyage, and to the very <hi>Instructions</hi> given to the <hi>Prince</hi> before he went into <hi>Spaine,</hi> how he ought to ſatisfie the Pope about <hi>King James</hi> his proving him to be the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in his publique writings; therefore the Popes Letter to the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Biſhop of Conehen,</hi> to pervert the Prince in his Religion; with the <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Lord Digbies</hi> attempts there, to ſeduce him to popery, and reconcile our <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> by this meanes (contained in their mutuall Articles of <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the Copies of which <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> were found in his owne Study by Maſter <hi>Prynne)</hi> muſt needs concerne him, ſince he could not be ignorant, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Inſtruments would uſe their utmoſt diligence to ſeduce the Prince to their Religion, when they had him thus ſent, and betrayed into their power for that very purpoſe; and his Letter to <hi>Biſhop Hall,</hi> though written but of late, long after that intended Match, yet fully relates his privity to the moſt ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions before it, to gratifie and pleaſe the very <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe, and prevent his Objections againſt the <hi>Match,</hi> or <hi>King James.</hi> For the <hi>French Match,</hi> the Evidence proves he was both privy, conſenting and aſſiſting to it, even after he knew the danger of it in point of Religion, both to the King and Kingdome, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and Articles in the Spaniſh Treaty, being both the very ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; whereas his intimacy, power with the <hi>King, Duke,</hi> and quality of his place as he was a Biſhop, yea <hi>Confeſſor</hi> to one or both of them, ſhould have engaged him (had he been a reall Proteſtant) to have uſed his utmoſt endeavours to diſſwade the King and Duke from both theſe <hi>Popiſh Matches,</hi> as moſt perilous, deſtructive to our Religion; the ſad effects whereof we now viſibly behold in our civill wars, and read In Characters written with our owne blood. For his intimacy with the <hi>Queen,</hi> it favours of farre more then civility or duty, and her extaordinary favours to him proceeded from no other cauſe, but his compliance with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to introduce popery, and reduce us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> as appeares by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt Maſter <hi>Gellibrand</hi> in the High Commiſſion for his <hi>Almanack</hi> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the popiſh Saints were expunged, and our Martyrs inſerted) at her Majeſties requeſt, by his prohibiting Miniſters to pray, and cenſuring them for praying for her converſion to our Religion, which we have punctually proved, and of Maſter <hi>Howe</hi> for praying to <hi>God to preſerve the young Prince from being brought up in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, of which there was great feare;</hi> a harmleſſe yea neceſſary prayer, both in reſpect of the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> then too neer him, and the <hi>Queen,</hi> who by the Articles of the <hi>Match,</hi> was to have a great hand in his <hi>Education till he was fourteen yeers of age,</hi> as alſo in regard of the <hi>Popes Nuncioes,</hi> the ſeducing <hi>Jeſuits, Priests</hi> and <hi>Capucines</hi> about the Queen, Court, Him, and childrens naturall proueneſſe unto errour: Which prayers, admit they had been an overſight, yet proceeding from a godly Chriſtian Zeale, deſerved onely a private admonition, not open proſecution, or High Commiſſion cenſure; but his making of them ſo publickly criminall, and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe ſo ſeverely for them, of purpoſe to deterre all others from praying for the <hi>Queens converſion,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Princes perverſion,</hi> is an undeniable argument of his good affection to <hi>Popery,</hi> and attempts to reduce us thereunto: For his extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Queen Maries,</hi> and depreſſing <hi>King Edwards,</hi> and <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> dayes, the words ſufficiently declare, it was as well in reference to the <hi>Religion</hi> then profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Statutes,</hi> and the Preface it ſelfe is of his owne making as well as the <hi>Statutes,</hi> as we ſhall more fully manifeſt in due place by his own letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="550" facs="tcp:61245:282"/>
Secondly, to the particular inſtances, the Commons made this reply; Firſt, that their maine end in producing them was onely to demonſtrate, that <hi>the Pope and his Instruments had a reall Plot and deſigne to introduce Popery, and reduce us back to</hi> Rome, <hi>and that the Archbiſhop could not but know and take ſpeciall notice thereof by all theſe particular Letters, Papers, Books, found in his owne Study, ſent, written to himſelfe, endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his owne hand, or recorded in his Diary;</hi> which ſhould have engaged him with greater vigilancy, care, animoſity, to have oppoſed them and their deſignes: In which regard, the three firſt of them, with all the reſt moſt neerly concerned him, neither doth, nor can he plead ignorance of them: Secondly, that though all theſe particulars prove not, that he promoted, confederated with them in their deſignes, yet ſome of them directly prove it, as his countenancing of <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> his Books, his maintaining of <hi>Saint Giles</hi> (a moſt dangerous ſeducing Popiſh Prieſt) many yeers in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford;</hi> his oppoſing, anſwering the <hi>Commons Remonstrance</hi> againſt the dangerous open encreaſe and practiſes of <hi>Papists in Ireland</hi> to ſet up Popery there, and branding it as a ſcandalous untruth: Thirdly, for <hi>Habernfields</hi> plot, we ſhall prove how it makes againſt him in due time; and for <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> his Book of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> we have proved; Firſt, that he knew of it, and had both the Book and Author brought to him by his Favourite Doctor <hi>Linſey</hi> before it was printed; this we have under his owne hand, therefore it is monſtrous impudency in him to deny it: Secondly, that this Book when prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was preſented to, reſerved by him in his ſtudy, and the Author with him there ſome three or four times afterwards: Thirdly, that it was printed and publickly ſold here in <hi>Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> without controll: Fourthly, that his creatures both abroad and at home much applauded it: Fiftly, that <hi>Saint Giles</hi> was the Author of it, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſt whom himſelfe ſent to, and maintained in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to pervert and ſeduce Schollers there; That he had the Kings Warrant for it, is no excuſe, and the Warrant being without date, written with his owne hand, and ſigned by the King to help at a dead liſt, ſavours of meer fraud, circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will amount to an aggravation, but no extenuation of his crime: Fourthly, the proffer of a Cardinalſhip twice unto him, even at Court, ſo ſoon as he was nominated Archbiſhop, proves the good opinion that the popiſh party had of his inclination to their party and Religion; his concealing the names of the parties that made him the offer (which he will not diſcloſe) and his not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting and complaining againſt them to bring them to publique juſtice, prove that he deemed this proffer no injury nor diſparagement: if a poor <hi>Puritan</hi> did but write againſt <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Popiſh Innovations,</hi> he preſently proſecuted him in the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> or <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> where he was ſure to be fined, impriſoned, pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſtigmatized, ſcourged, baniſhed; but he that ſeriouſly tendred him a <hi>Cardinals Cap</hi> twice one after another, eſcaped ſcot-free, without ſo much as being once queſtioned for it: As for his informing the King thereof, it was not by way of complaint, but advice; and his anſwer to the King, if true, is no abſolute reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Dignity, but rather an adjournment for the preſent, his ambitious itching deſire of being a <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Patriarch</hi> throughout his Majeſties Dominions, teſtified by Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> with Maſter <hi>Challoner,</hi> making him refuſe the preſent offer, not any deteſtation of <hi>Popery,</hi> or reconciliation with <hi>Rome:</hi> To the ſixt was replied, that it appeared by the <hi>Biſhops Protestation in Ireland,</hi> that he knew of the great growth and power of Papiſts there even in the yeer 1626. two yeers before his Anſwer to the Commons Remonſtrance, which lyes on him ſubſtantially to prove, that it was made by the <hi>Kings command,</hi> as to this particular, not yet attempted by him, his owne bare endorſment being no proofe in his owne caſe: The Letters, Papers afterwards received by him from <hi>Ireland,</hi> moſt cleerly manifeſt his exact intelligence of popiſh Prieſts and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts dangerous encreaſe and proceedings there, without the leaſt oppoſition from him, or complaint againſt them: The ſmalneſſe of their <hi>Monasteries, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries</hi> there erected, is no extenuation of his guilt: Small evils not ſuppreſſed
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:61245:282"/>
will prove grand univerſall miſchiefes in ſhort time, as thoſe their Monaſteries and Nunneries there have done: For the Lord <hi>Deputies</hi> Letters, it's true, he could not hinder the directing and ſending of them to him, but he might have hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prevented the execution of his deſperate popiſh project related in them, and have cruſhed it in the ſhell, which he never did. To the ſeventh was anſwered, that his extraordinary former power both with the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> might and ſhould have engaged him ſo farre, as to prevent thoſe <hi>Roman Nuncioes</hi> arrivall, here, and our Agents at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom he never ſo much as once oppoſed for ought appeares, but complied with, by his Agents, <hi>Biſhop Mountague</hi> and <hi>Secretary Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debank,</hi> as we have fully manifeſted, when as he ſhould rather have loſt his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, liberty, life, then have any way conſented to it in the leaſt degree, and openly reſiſted it to his utmoſt power.</p>
               <p>The third Objection againſt me is, my compliance with the popiſh party, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Pag. 441, 442.</note> endeavours to introduce Popery, advance the Papiſts Deſignes, and reduce us back to <hi>Rome</hi> by ſeven particulars formerly inſiſted on, and now onely recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with reference to the former proofs.</p>
               <p>To moſt of all theſe I have given full anſwers before, and therefore ſhall be <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> the briefer in giving further anſwers to them now. The firſt, ſecond, fourth, fifth, ſixth and ſeventh inſtances I deny, in the ſenſe they are preſſed, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted my ſelfe from them in the premiſes: To the third I ſhall give ſome further Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is there objected, that I maintaintained <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be a true Church,</hi> and that ſhe <hi>erred not in Fundamentals, no not in the worſt times, bue onely</hi> Circa Fundamentalia: And that I juſtified <hi>Chownaeus</hi> his Book, who maintained the ſame. I anſwer, that I did &amp; doe maintain her to be a true Church <hi>Veritate entis,</hi> not <hi>Moris,</hi> though corrupt &amp; erronious in ſome points, as a thief is a true man, though a thiefe: And in my Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> I charge her with <hi>ſome groſſe corruptions, errours, to the very endangering of ſalvation, and with ſuperstition too.</hi> Secondly, I am charged that I did maintaine at Doctor <hi>Bastwicks</hi> cenſure, that ſhe erred not in <hi>Fundamentalibus,</hi> but <hi>Circa Fundamentalia;</hi> this diſtinction I ſhall ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. There is a great difference between <hi>Fundamentalia</hi> and <hi>Superstructoria,</hi> and yet ſome circumſtantials may deſtroy the foundation: For example; Firſt, <hi>Quid</hi> What it is a man beleeves; if a man beleeves the Trinity without the Unity, or the Unity without the Trinity, this plucks up the Foundation: Secondly, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> the circumſtance of place; for if any ſhould deny that Chriſt was borne, or took his fleſh in <hi>Judea,</hi> this grates upon the very foundation: Thirdly, <hi>Quibus Auxiliis,</hi> we beleeve, convert and doe works of piety; by nature or grace? If by the ſtrength of nature onely, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> held, this endangers the foundation: Fourthly, <hi>Quando,</hi> as to deny that Chriſt is not already come in the fleſh, this ſubverts the foundation, though but a circumſtance: And it is a rule in the Schools, <hi>Aliqua circumstantia dat ſpeciem morali actioni;</hi> and in this ſenſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth erre about fundamentals. Thirdly, it is alleaged, that I hold <hi>the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Rome <hi>is both one;</hi> Conference with <hi>Fiſher,</hi> page 576. I anſwer, that it is one and the ſame Religion in the generall; <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion:</hi> But yet I there write; <hi>That we differ in the ſame Religion, though we ſet not up a different Religion; and the difference is in certaine groſſe corruptions, to the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of ſalvation, which each ſide ſayes the other is guilty of.</hi> Fourthly, that I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>people may be ſaved in the Roman Church and Religion;</hi> I anſwer, that other learned Proteſtants are of the ſame opinion, not generally of all, but of thoſe among them who want meanes of better inſtruction; yet I hold it is very dangerous to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that Church and Religion, for any who have means to come out of them. Fiftly, that I hold the <hi>Pope</hi> is not the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and therefore I cauſed this Title given him to be expunged, &amp; authorized, received, printed Books denying him to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as <hi>Shelfords</hi> and others, contrary to our <hi>Homilies, Writers,</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Ireland:</hi> I anſwer, that no man can charge me, that I hold the <hi>Pope</hi> not to
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:61245:283"/>
be <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> It is a great queſtion even among learned Proteſtants, whether he be ſo o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not. The <hi>Church of England</hi> hath not poſitively reſolved him to be ſo: The <hi>Homilies</hi> define him not to be <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> and the <hi>Articles of Ireland</hi> binde not us here. My expunging of this Title and others of that nature was upon other grounds. However, it is no ſuch undoubted Article of Faith, as <hi>Powell</hi> in his Booke <hi>De Antichristo,</hi> with others, make it. As for the objected Books, I neither Licenſed nor approved them, though I had them in my Study. Sixtly, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that I hold the <hi>Pope</hi> to be ſupreame head of the Church; Though <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Sales,</hi> and others ſtile him ſo, they muſt anſwer for it, its nothing at all to me who hold it not. As for his titles given me by <hi>Croxton</hi> &amp; the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> in their Letters, it was without my privity, I could not hinder it; and the ſame Titles have been uſually given to Biſhops in former ages, as appeares by the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Cyprian, Auguſtine</hi> and others. Seventhly, for <hi>Pocklingtons</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagues</hi> deriving my Succeſſion from <hi>Auguſtin, Gregory,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peters Chaire at Rome;</hi> it was without my privity: It is no more then Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> hath prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long before my time; and the Papiſts would give you harty thanks, could you diſprove this lineall Succeſſion of our Biſhops.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed in generall, that all the ſeven objected particulars prove a moſt apparant deſigne in him to introduce Popery, and reconcile us to <hi>Rome;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reply.</note> and that all his Anſwers to them had been formerly diſproved as falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. In particular, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was no true Church at all, but a falſe, Antichriſtian, as well as a corrupt Church. for Firſt, it hath no true Foundation, being not built upon the Apoſtles, Prophets, and Chriſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Stone. Secondly, no true Head, Ordinances, Sacraments, Worſhip, but a falſe adulterous head, the Pope; corrupt Ordinances, Sacraments, and a meere Idolatrous, ſuperſticious wil-worſhip. Thirdly, no true Miniſtry, nor govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts inſtitution. Fourthly, ſhe yeelds no true Subjection nor Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt, his laws, word, ſpirit, but oppoſeth him and them in all. Fiftly, ſhe is over-ſpread with a Leproſie of damnable Errours in Doctrine, corruptions in Faith, Manners, Ordinances, Government. Sixtly, the definition of a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church in our <hi>Homilies</hi> and Writers agrees not to her. Seventhly, our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> Writers define her to be a falſe Church, not a true, who are all muſtered up together by Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> in his <hi>Babell no Bethell,</hi> where ſhe is largely proved to be <hi>no true Church.</hi> For his diſtinction, that ſhe is a true Church <hi>Veritate Entis,</hi> though not <hi>Moris,</hi> as a Thiefe is a true man; it is a meere childiſh evaſion: For it is not the meere entity and being of a company of men, that makes up a Church, or true Church; for if ſo, the Turks, Pagans, or any aſſembly elſe ſhould be a true Church, as well as the Proteſtants; but <hi>a company of men</hi> rightly qualified, to wit; <hi>profeſſing the true Chriſtian Faith, among whom the Word of God is truly Preached, and the Sacraments duly administed.</hi> To ſet then the diſtinction and compariſon right. If one ſhould demand of the Archbiſhop, <hi>Whether a Theefe be a true man or no?</hi> as this phraſe <hi>true man,</hi> in our ordinary language ſignifies an <hi>honeſt juſt-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling man,</hi> with reference to his qualities, morals, not his Entity or being as a meer man: himſelf grants that he is no true man, but a falſe one, in this ſenſe, in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinction; and to anſwer, that he is a true man in regard of his eſſence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a true man in reſpect of his Morals, were a meer impertinency, &amp; Nonſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. By the ſelfe-ſame reaſon, when we demand of him, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be a true Church? and he anſwers She is ſo, <hi>Veritate entis,</hi> for ſhe conſiſts of a company of perſons, or reall men; not <hi>veritate moris,</hi> for that they are not ſo truly qualified in thoſe Morals, or rather ſupernaturall principles which makes them to be a true Church: Himſelfe muſt needs grant, that his diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fallacious, in applying this <hi>veritas entis</hi> to them as they are a Church, not men; or elſe yeeld that they are a <hi>falſe,</hi> but no true Church, becauſe his not <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate Moris,</hi> can be applyed to nothing elſe but to ſuch morall and divine quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, as ſhould make them a true Church; ſo as his owne diſtinction di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:61245:283"/>
ſubverts this his falſe concluſion of her being a true Church; and his charging her with <hi>groſſe Corruptions, Errors, Superſtitions,</hi> to the <hi>endangering of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> doth the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was retorted, that his diſtinction of her erring onely <hi>circa funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalia,</hi> not in <hi>Fundamentalibus,</hi> was a falſhood: For firſt, her affirming the <hi>Church to be built upon Peter</hi> and <hi>the Pope, not Chriſt</hi> the chiefe corner-ſtone. Her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Scriptures to be Scriptures but as they are grounded on, confirmed and expounded by the Authority of the Church and Pope, Her making Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryphall Scriptures Canonicall, and ſo adding to the Scriptures. Her giving the Pope power to null and diſpence with things againſt the Scriptures. Her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the foundation of all our Faith into the Church; <hi>To beleeve as the Church beleeves,</hi> not into the Scriptures themſelves. Her deifying of the <hi>Virgin Mary, Saints, Images,</hi> in praying to and adoring them with divine worſhip. Her joyning of Saints Merits and Mediations with Chriſts, and making them joynt Saviours, Mediators &amp; Advocates with him. Her turning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper into a Propitiatory Maſſing Sacrifice, of as great or greater Merit as Chriſts own Sacrifice on the croſſe; adoring the conſecrated Bread, as their Lord God and Chriſt himſelfe. Her taking away the Sacramentall Cup from the Laity, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blanke againſt Chriſts owne Inſtitution. Her giving Chriſt an ubiquitary body on earth, inſtead of a glorified body in heaven; her tying people to pray to God in an unknown tongue, with her creating a new head of the Church in Chriſts ſtead, the Pope, who hath the Keyes of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory too; and can pardon ſins, releaſe Soules out of Hell and Purgatory at his pleaſure; with her aboliſhing the ſecond Commandement out of the Decalogue; What are they all but <hi>Fundamentall Errors,</hi> nullifying that Church which maintaines them, and not Errors onely about the foundation?</p>
               <p>For his foure inſtances, that circumſtances may undermine and deſtroy the Foundation: We anſwer, Firſt, that neither of all theſe inſtances concerne the Papiſts or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſubject in queſtion; therefore altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Secondly, they are not meer circumſtantials, but fundamentals; becauſe directly contrary to the expreſſe words of Scripture and Articles of our Faith, of which they are unſeparable parts; which if falſe in any part, may and will be falſe in the whole, and no ground of Faith at all. For the rule of the Schools we agree it, but how he applyes it to his diſtinction, or the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we cannot yet diſcerne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it was replyed; That the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not one and the ſame; For that which they repute the maine part of their Religion, is no Chriſtian Religion at all, nor part of the Chriſtian Religion, but meere Antichriſtian Errour, Superſtition, corruption, Idolatry. And in his Booke he doth no more charge her with ſome groſſe corruptions endangering Salvation, then ſhe chargeth us, as the peruſall of his words demonſtrates. Fourthly, his juſtifying ſalvation to be had in this falſe Antichriſtian Church and Religion, denying the foundation, is contrary to the opinion of all Otthodox Proteſtants, who make her damnable Errours the ground of their ſeparation from her. And though ſome affirme, that divers in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; yet none are ſaved by being of that Church, or by that Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ſhe properly cals her Faith and Religion, wherein ſhe differs from us, but by their relying onely on Chriſts merits, which ſhe diſclaimes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, his deleting all phraſes, clauſes calling or intimating the Pope to be <hi>the Antichriſt,</hi> is a cleer evidence, that he holds him not to be ſo: Elſe his ſinne, fault will prove the greater in purging out that as Heterodox and ſcandalous, which himſelfe beleeves to be a truth. For our <hi>Statutes, Homilies, Writers,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Pope either in direct termes, or equivalent expreſſions to be <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and our Church, yea State in them, at leaſtwiſe in our forecited Statutes, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy, Act 3. <hi>Jac.</hi> penned by the Convocation. As for the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:61245:284"/>
they bind us not, yet being taken out of the Articles and Homilies of <hi>England,</hi> they ſufficiently declare the reſolution of our Church as well as theirs, that the Pope is Antichriſt; and Doctor <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher Primate of Armagh,</hi> in a Letter of his to the Archbiſhop himſelfe, <hi>Jan.</hi> 4. 1635. (the very day of his birth) writes, <hi>That this conceit is ſo rife in the minds and mouths of the Papists now adayes,</hi> THAT WE ARE COMMING ON AND EVERY DAY DRAWING NIGHER UNTO THEM THEN OTHER; <hi>for the ſtopping of whoſe ſlanderous mouths, let this ſuffice, That whatſoever others imagine of the matter, I ſtand fully convinced in my conſcience,</hi> THAT THE POPE IS ANTICHRIST; <hi>and therefore if I ſhould be ſo mad as to worſhip the Beaſt, or receive the marke of his name, I muſt be</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and juſtly expect the revenge that is threatned againſt ſuch,</hi> Apoc. 14. 10, 11. Wherefore for this Arch-Prelat to queſtion it, to purge out all paſſages ſtiling him <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> after ſuch a Letter, to ſuffer ſuch Books to be printed, and retaine them in his Study, which deny him to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> without any cenſure of them or their Authors, is a grand offence, ſavourng of his good affection to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, though himſelf gives not this title of <hi>Supream head</hi> to the Pope in direct terms, yet he doth it in effect in his owne Book, and his Chaplaine licenſed it in <hi>Sales,</hi> for which himſelf muſt anſwer. As for the papall titles given him by Maſter <hi>Croxton</hi> &amp; the whole Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in ſeverall Letters, it was certainly with his approbation, elſe he would have reprehended them for it, which he never did: Theſe titles are ſuch as of later times have been appropriated only to the Pope, and were never given to any of his Predeceſſors in any Age, much leſſe to any Proteſtant Biſhop: And though one of them (as <hi>Sanctiſſime Pater)</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance be found in <hi>Cyprians</hi> and <hi>Auguſtines</hi> genuine Epiſtles; yet <hi>Sanctitas</hi> in the abſtract, can hardly be ſhewed in any of their true Epiſtles, nor was ever appropriated to any for many hundred of Ages, but to the Pope: As for the other exorbitant and blaſphemous titles, no Father nor ancient Author was ever guilty of giving or affirming them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, for <hi>Pocklingtons</hi> and <hi>Mountagues</hi> deriving his pedegree and ſucceſſion from <hi>Rome,</hi> it is in ſuch phraſe and language, as was never uſed by <hi>Maſon,</hi> or any <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 4.</note> elſe in former times, with a meere intention to reconconcile, reduce our Church and Prelats to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence they derive their pedegree; the end of all theſe new poſitions and objected particulars againſt the Archbiſhop, the guilt whereof ſtill reſt upon him, notwithſtanding all his Evaſions to ſhake it off.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing charged againſt me to make good this Branch, is my hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence, correſpondence with the Popes Nuncioes, Agents, Prieſts, Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, by my Favourites and Inſtruments, as by Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> and Secretary <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debanke,</hi> advanced by my meanes; the later of them, as appeares by many produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Letters and Teſtimonies, holding intelligence with Cardinall <hi>Barbarino</hi> (who entertained his Sonnes at <hi>Rome)</hi> the Popes Nuncioes, and with divers dangerous Prieſts, Jeſuits, whom he protected, releaſed out of priſon, and impriſoned the Meſſengers who uſually apprehended them, <hi>till they gave bond, never to apprehend nor proſecute Prieſts any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that there is no cleer proofe of Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement by me, or intelligence or compliance with the Popes Nuncio, Prieſts, <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> or Jeſuits; but if there were, it is nothing to me, being without my privity, knowledge, or approbation: Secondly, for Secretary <hi>Windebanke,</hi> it is very true, I was the meanes of advancing him to the Secretaries place (being my anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent friend and acquaintance) but not with any intent to advance Popery, protect or releaſe Prieſts, Jeſuits, or hold any correſpondency with the Pope or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; if he proved ſo ill an inſtrument after his advancement, it was beyond my expectation, himſelfe muſt anſwer, and hath been impeached for it, not I: For the Letters he received from the Popes Nuncio <hi>Panzani,</hi> the Queens Prieſts, or his Sonnes, with their going to, and entertainment at <hi>Rome,</hi> they concerne
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:61245:284"/>
not me, who was not privy to them nor their entertainment: But it is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that we continued our friendſhip ſtill, notwithſtanding I knew his correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with, releaſing and protecting Prieſts, Jeſuits, and joyned with him in ſome Warrants: I anſwer, that it is well knowne that he and I were at variance and diſtance of later times, he deſerting me in the buſineſſe of the late Lord <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer Weston,</hi> and for my hand to one Warrant jointly with his and others for a Prieſts releaſe, it was but caſuall, we being then both together at the Counſell Table, where his Releaſe was condeſcended to, upon ſufficient baile and caution, at the Queens requeſt.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed; Firſt, that <hi>Mountagues</hi> correſpondency with the Popes <note place="margin">Reply.</note> Nuncio, Prieſts, Jeſuits, his popiſh inclination and endeavours to reconcile and reduce us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> are abundantly proved in the premiſes, with his good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to, and compliance with him in this deſigne, the end and cauſe of his advancing him to two ſeverall Biſhopricks, the laſt wherof was <hi>Norwich:</hi> In his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from whence to the Archbiſh. himſelf for the yeer 1638. (written with his owne hand, endorſed with the Archbiſhops, and found in his Study) there is this notable clauſe concerning <hi>King Henry the eighth,</hi> the firſt ſuppreſſor of the Popes power among us; <hi>The Biſhoprick of</hi> Norwich, <hi>ſince the totall deſolation and diſſolution of the former Biſhoprick by</hi> King Henry the eighth, WHO STOLE THE SHEEP, AND GAVE NOT SO MUCH AS THE TROT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS FOR GODS SAKE, <hi>is a meane thing,</hi> (though worth above one thouſand pounds <hi>per annum)</hi> A moſt ingrate and ſcandalous expreſſion of an ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious popiſh Prelat, unworthy of ſo fat a Biſhoprick, who inſtead of being Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, became a Wolfe, devouring not onely the Sheep, but Shepheards of his Dioceſſe, and vexing them more with his popiſh Viſitation, Articles, then ever KING HENRY the 8. did the Prelates by diminiſhing their over-large Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for <hi>Secretary Windebank,</hi> it is undeniable; Firſt, that the Archbiſhop was the onely meanes of his advancement to that place of truſt: Secondly, that he was his meer creature, inſtrument, boſome-friend, and privy to all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Thirdly, this intimacy and friendſhip of theirs, continued till <hi>Windebanks</hi> flight hence in to <hi>France,</hi> upon the Parliaments impeachment againſt him for harbouring and releaſing Prieſts and Jeſuits, and that the tranſitory ſhort diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerence between them about the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weston,</hi> had no relation at all to any thing concerning Prieſts or Religion, wherein they both accorded: Fourthly, that the ſame Prieſts and Jeſuits, as Sir <hi>Toby Mattehw, Smith, Leander, Sancta Clara</hi> and <hi>Price,</hi> were intimate and familiar with them both: Fiftly, that they both concurred in checking, diſcouraging, impriſoning, <hi>Gray, That<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, Waddeſworth,</hi> and others for apprehending Prieſts, Jeſuits, and in calling <hi>Gray</hi> a Prieſt-catching knave; Sixtly, that they both joyned together in ſome Warrants for the releaſe of Prieſts; and his excuſe, that it was by caſualty when they were both at the Counſell Table, where others joyned with them, is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of his offence; where he being the over-potent member, ſhould have engaged all the reſt to oppoſe ſuch an illegall ſcandalous action, and not have drawne them on thereto, by ſetting his hand firſt to the Warrant: But it was to gratifie the Queen, and promote the Roman Catholick Cauſe, therefore to ſhew his forwardneſſe, his hand muſt be firſt to this Prieſts diſcharge, that ſo he might the more freely walk abroad to ſeduce his Majeſties Subjects: Seventhly, for <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanies,</hi> Father <hi>Joſephs,</hi> Father <hi>Phillips,</hi> with his ſonnes and the Lord <hi>Scudamores</hi> Letters to Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> though they are nothing to the Archbiſhop in point of charge, ſimply conſidered (in which ſenſe we urge them not) yet they are infallible evidences of Secretary <hi>Windebanks</hi> correſpondency and intelligence with the Popes Nuncioes, Prieſts, Jeſuits, of Cardinall <hi>Barbarinoes,</hi> and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to him and his Sonnes, of his extraordinary protection of Prieſts, Jeſuits, and that he was their inſtrument, the onely end for which we produced them;
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:61245:285"/>
and being compared with his advancement of, and intimacy with <hi>Windebank,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the frequent complaints to himſelfe and the Counſell of his relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, protecting Prieſts, Jeſuits, and with that generall good opinion the Prieſts and Papiſts had generally at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other forraigne parts of of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops owne reall endeavours to promote their Religion here, and reduce us back to <hi>Rome</hi> (teſtified by Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> Maſter <hi>Challoner</hi> and others) it will amount to a full proof of a confederacy between them to effect this dangerous Romiſh Deſigne, notwithſtanding all his evaſions; to accompliſh which, this Secretary was as active an inſtrument for him in the State, as <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> and other Prelats in the Church.</p>
               <p>The fift thing objected to prove my reall intentions, endeavours to introduce popery, and reconcile us unto <hi>Rome,</hi> is my intimacy and correſpondency with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5.</note> divers dangerous Prieſts and Jeſuits, as <hi>Saint Giles,</hi> Sir <hi>Toby Matthew, Smith</hi> the Jeſuit, <hi>Leander, Price,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Calcedon</hi> Doctor <hi>Smith,</hi> and others; one of which <hi>[Saint Giles]</hi> I am charged to have maintained in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſundry yeers, to corrupt and ſeduce Schollers there; my diſcouraging, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and abuſing Purſevants for their diligence in apprehending Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; my not committing Prieſts, or diſcharging them when brought unto me by them; my impriſoning <hi>Gray,</hi> and calling him Prieſt-catching knave; my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at the liberty that Prieſts and Jeſuits had in the New-priſon, Clink and elſwhere; my cauſing many popiſh Books to be reſtored to the owners when ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed (contrary to the Statute) that ſo they might be diſperſed to ſeduce his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects; ſome of which particulars are proved by papers under my owne hand, ſeized by Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> who ranſackt my Study and Chamber; others, by the teſtimonies of <hi>Waddeſworth, Newton, Deuxell, Mayo, Goldſmith, Cooke, Egerton, Elizabeth Gray</hi> and <hi>Thatcher:</hi> And out of my owne Book they alleage, I never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded nor practiſed any perſecution againſt popiſh Prieſts or Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer in generall; Firſt, that if the deſigne charged againſt me, were onely to reconcile the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> together in a juſt and Cſtriſtian way, ſo farre as it might ſtand with truth and piety, I hope no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can blame, but rather commend me for ſuch an enterprize; Such a reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation between both Churches as this, I confeſſe I have long deſired, endeavoured, and publiſhed as much to the world in my <hi>Reply to Fiſher,</hi> p. 388. in theſe words; <hi>I have with a faithfull and ſingle heart, laboured the meeting, the bleſſed meeting of</hi> TRUTH AND PEACE <hi>in Christs Church, which God I hope will in due time effect:</hi> But other reconciliation then this to the prejudice of truth and piety, I never attempted, as my Epiſtle to that Book will manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for my pretended intimacy, correſpondency with Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, I dare confidently affirme, that never any man that ſate in my place ſince <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Reformation, had leſſe acquaintance, familiarity, correſpondence with Prieſts and Jeſuits then I; ſome of my late Predeceſſors, by name, Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> and <hi>Abbot</hi> (never ſuſpected of any inclination to popery) have uſually held intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with, and received ſundry Letters from Prieſts, Jeſuits in forraigne parts yea entertained ſome of them at their Tables, and that no doubt for good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and the advancement of the Proteſtant Religion: But I for my part never held correſpondency, nor received Letters from any of them; and I bleſſe God for it; for had I done it, I muſt have ſuffered very deeply; and my Chamber, Study, Cloſet, being ſo diligently ſearched, no doubt their Letters would have been ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and given in evidence by Maſter <hi>Prynne,</hi> as well as others; but no ſuch Letters are or can be produced; and to my knowledge I never entertained knowingly any Prieſt or Jeſuit at my Table, nor gave them any countenance, though my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have uſually done it; to prove which, I deſire Maſter <hi>Dobſon</hi> may be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: who being examined accordingly without Oath, affirmed; That he was an houſhold ſervant to Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who received divers Letters of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence from Prieſts and Jeſuits in forraigne parts, and ſometimes admitted them
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:61245:285"/>
to his Table; that he was after ſervant to Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who for a moneth or two, dieted one <hi>Julius Maria,</hi> and another popiſh Prieſt, as he taketh it, (the one a Spaniard, the other an Italian) at his Table, in hopes of their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who faltered wish him in the end, and were thereupon diſcarded: That he was likewiſe a ſervant to this Archbiſhop, and never ſaw Sir <hi>Toby Matthewes,</hi> nor any other Prieſt or Jeſuit to his knowledge at his Table: Who being croſſe interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, Whether he knew <hi>Julius Maria</hi> and the other to be popiſh Prieſts? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he did not certainly know them to be ſo, but they were ſo reputed, and profeſſed Papiſts: To which the Archbiſhop added, That King <hi>James</hi> had confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with, and extended favour to ſome Prieſts, making good uſe thereof, to ſet them at variance among themſelves, and induce them for to write one againſt another, as <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Preston,</hi> who wrote divers Books in defence of the Oath of Alleagiance, and did good ſervice therein; whereupon my Predeceſſor <hi>Abbot</hi> granted <hi>Preston</hi> a kind of protection under his hand and Seale: And why I might not doe as much as my predeceſſors in countenancing <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> (were I guilty of it) without any Guilt of TREASON or juſt Offence, I yet know not any reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I utterly deny that I held any correſpondency with Sir <hi>Toby Matthew, Smith, Price, Leander, Sancta Clara</hi> or <hi>Saint Giles,</hi> neither is there any cleer proofe thereof: but admit I did, yet there's no proof at all that I knew them to be Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prieſts; and if I knew them not to be Prieſts, no Law takes hold upon me, though I harboured them, which I never did.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the witneſſes produced to prove my intimacy with theſe Prieſts, are perſons of very meane condition, againſt whom there have been many great complaints made heretofore at the Counſell-Table, and againſt one or two of them of late, for diſhoneſt practiſes, in ſeizing other mens goods and moneys, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of ſearching after Prieſts and Jeſuits, pretending the goods were theirs: which complaints were referred to ſome Juſtices of Peace to examine and how far their teſtimonies will ſway with your Lordſhips, I moſt humbly ſubmit to your grave judgements, they being formerly offended with me, for preſſing the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the many complaints againſt them in this kind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to the particular teſtimonies I anſwer; Firſt, that <hi>Saint Giles</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding and maintainance in <hi>Oxford,</hi> was by the Kings ſpeciall Warrant, which hath been produced, much againſt my will; and I never heard he exerciſed his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Function, or ſeduced any there, but onely ſtudied metaphyſicall learning, according to his engagement: Secondly, For Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> I did not know that he was either a Prieſt or Jeſuit, and utterly deny that he was ever with me in my Coach or Barge, or uſually repaired to me to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> though being an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Archbiſhops Son, I might in that regard have permitted him more free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe unto me: And my Secretary, Maſter <hi>Dell,</hi> remembers not that ever he told <hi>Newton</hi> that Sir <hi>Toby Matthewes</hi> was with me in the Garden at <hi>Lambeth:</hi> Beſides, <hi>Newton,</hi> is but a ſingle witneſſe; and Maſter <hi>Dobſon</hi> atteſts, that he never ſaw Sir <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> with me at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> As for his releaſe when apprehended by the Lords Warrant, it was only by the Earle of <hi>Straflords</hi> order, not mine. For <hi>Smith</hi> the Jeſuit, there is no proofe that ever he was with me at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> but onely that he was ſeen there talking familiarly with my Secretary, Maſter <hi>Dell,</hi> neere my Study doore, who denies and remembers not any ſuch thing: As for his words to <hi>Newton,</hi> that he had done his errand to me, they are but the reports of a Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it to ſlander me, there being no proofe that ever he ſpake with me: For my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Biſhop of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> Doctor <hi>Smith,</hi> there is no proofe but conjecturall from my Diary: For <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> their reſorting to me, it is but a report, without proofe at all: And for <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> I never ſaw him above three or four times, according as I have truly related under my owne hand: Fourthly, Saint <hi>Giles</hi> and he were Aliens borne out of the Kings Dominions,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:61245:286"/>
and no naturall born Subjects; therefore admit I had harboured and maintained them, it is no fellony nor treaſon by our Lawes, and directly out of the Statute of 27. <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> Fiftly, <hi>Waddeſworths</hi> teſtimony, it is but a hearſay; for my ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four pound to pay his Fees, I think it is true, and it was upon this occaſion; He pretended that he had been a Roman Catholick, but was now really conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our Religion, and thereupon releaſed, but wanted money to pay his Fees; whereupon I ſent him four pound, thinking him to be a new convert to us, and it was upon his own ſending to, and acquainting me with his poverty and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Sixtly, for my releaſing and refuſing to meddle with <hi>Wilford</hi> the Prieſt, it neede no other anſwer then what the Witneſſe ſweares, that he had a protection and Letter of diſcharge from Secretary <hi>Windebanke,</hi> and this was the cauſe I refuſed to meddle with him: Seventhly, for <hi>Gray,</hi> he was committed by the Lords of the Counſell, not by me; he gave me very ill language, and uſed approbrious ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſpeeches of me in my owne houſe, for which he was committed: As for my calling of him <hi>Prieſt-catching knave,</hi> it is proved but by one Witneſſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there were many complaints againſt him for abuſing his authority in ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſearching after Prieſts, to the prejudice of thoſe who were not ſuch: whereupon I commanded the reſt of the Meſſengers belonging to the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion not to keep him company, to avoid the like abuſes and complaints: Eightly, for <hi>Egertons</hi> teſtimony, it is but a report from <hi>Motterſheads</hi> mouth, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Witneſſe, formerly cenſured in the High Commiſſion for his abuſes in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting prohibited Books, and therefore his teſtimony is to be ſuſpected; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Jones</hi> is not produced to make good his teſtimony, but his papers onely, which are no evidence: Ninthly, for the liberty and freedome of Prieſts in their priſons, it was unkowne to me, and their Keepers fault, not mine, who would have reſtrained them: Finally, <hi>Mayo</hi> witneſſeth thus much for me, that I gave him command to watch the Embaſſadours and Popes Nuncioes houſes, to ſee who reſorted thither to Maſſe; which he did, giving me an account thereof; and <hi>Thatcher</hi> confeſſeth, that I gave him a Warrant to apprehend Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; though I denied it to another, whom I thought not fit to truſt in ſuch an imployment; a cleer evidence I was no friend unto, and held no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with them. Whereas it is objected, that I confeſſe I never perſwaded nor practized <hi>any perſecution againſt popiſh Priests and Jeſuits,</hi> though I perſwaded and practized it too againſt Puritans, and thoſe who oppoſed popery: I anſwer, that I hope it is no offence not to be a perſecutor, or not to give ill language to Jeſuits; and for my perſecuting of orthodox Miniſters and Puritans, I never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted any, though I proſecuted ſome for their ſchiſme and miſdemeanours: Wherefore this heavy charge which hath made ſo great a noyſe in your Lordſhips and the peoples eares, is I hope quite wiped off, and fallen to the ground.</p>
               <p>To this was replyed in generall; Firſt, that the Deſigne charged upon him is, not his reconciling of ROME to us, but of the Church of ENGLAND <note place="margin">Reply.</note> to the errours and corruptions of the Church of ROME; and how active he was, how farre he proceeded to accompliſh this, and how neer he had brought it to perfection, both in point of Doctrine, Ceremonies, practiſe, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed evidences have abundantly manifeſted, notwithſtanding all flouriſhes to the contrary in his Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> publiſhed not out of any zeale againſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, but meerly in policy upon other mens ſolicitations, to ſtop the peoples clamours againſt his popiſh practiſes and proceedings, as himſelfe relates in his Epiſtle thereunto: And his ſetting up ALTARS, CRUCIFIXES, IMAGES, TAPERS, introducing bowing to ALTARS, COPES, Conſecration of <hi>Flagons, Churches, Chappels,</hi> purging out all paſſages againſt popiſh Doctrines, Popes, Jeſuits, popiſh Prieſts, &amp;c. his permitting all kind of ARMINIAN ER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROURS and <hi>Popiſh Tenents,</hi> to be Preached in our <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and publiſhed in Print
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:61245:286"/>
with his Chaplaines ſpeciall approbations prefixed to them; together with his countenancing; advancing the Authors, fomenters, and perſecuting the oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of them, ſpeak farre cleerer, louder againſt him, then all his empty wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and teſtimonies of himſelfe can poſſibly plead for his juſtification, being ſo palpably contradicted by the whole ſtreame of his actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that his intimacy, correſpondency with popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits is ſufficiently proved by our former evidence: Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> the moſt active pernicious Jeſuited Prieſt in the Kingdome, we have proved to be riding with him ſometimes in his Barge, ſometimes in his Coach, ſometimes in private ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt diſcourſe with him in his Garden, and frequently with him at his Table; what greater familiarity or intimacy could there be between them then this? That he knew him to be a Prieſt and Jeſuit, is cleere by <hi>Habernfields</hi> plot, found in his Study, informing him to be ſo; and by the Popes Bull to him, common in many Courtiers hands: For <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> his favourite Doctor <hi>Lindſey</hi> brought him to his Study, with his Book to reconcile us to <hi>Rome,</hi> to peruſe it of purpoſe before it went to the Preſſe; after which he came thrice to him, writ a Book in defence of Epiſcopacy by divine Right, with an intention to gratifie him, and tendred it to him for his licenſe, as himſelfe confeſſeth under his <note n="a" place="margin">See here p. 427.</note> own hand in a written paper, where he extenuates this fact all he could; and is this no intimacy nor correſpondency? For St <hi>Giles,</hi> his own <note n="b" place="margin">See here p: 428.</note> hand-writing, teſtifies that he knew him to be a Prieſt, yet notwithſtanding he permitted him to reſide ſundry yeers in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where himſelfe was Chancellour, to have the uſe of the Library there; yea he provided him a large maintainance, &amp; conſtantly paid it to him there, during his reſidence, he repairing oft times to him to receive it; and is all this no intimacy, no correſpondency? For <hi>Leander,</hi> he denies not but that he was with him once or twice, and if common reports both among popiſh Prieſts, Papiſts or Proteſtants may be credited, he was once his Chamber-fellow in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and moſt intimate, powerfull with him here, being purpoſely ſent hither by meanes of his intereſt in him, to compleat our reconciliation and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Smith,</hi> a moſt dangerous Jeſuit, we have proved his being at <hi>Lambeth</hi> neere his Study, his familiarity with Maſter <hi>Dell</hi> his Secretary, who uſed him with great reſpect; his intimacy with Secretary <hi>Windebanke,</hi> the Arch-biſhops greateſt confederate; his ſending of meſſages to the Archbiſhop by Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> to remember the buſineſſe he told his Grace of when he was laſt with him; and his frequent threatning of Maſter <hi>Newton</hi> the Meſſenger when he met him in the open ſtreets, that he would complaine of him, or doe his errand to the Archbiſhop, and that he had done it; And are theſe no badges of his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy? For his acquaintance and correſpondence with the Biſhop of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> Doctor <hi>Smith,</hi> it is apparent by his owne Diary, and <hi>Windebanks</hi> Letter to his Son, himſelfe not daring to deny, that Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> mentioned in his Diary, is any other then <hi>Calcedon:</hi> For <hi>Price</hi> the Provinall of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> we have proved that he hath been ſeen at <hi>Lambeth</hi> talking familiarly with Maſter <hi>Dell,</hi> and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer the Archbiſhops Study doore to ſpeak with him in private; that he and <hi>Leander</hi> have been oft times met, going, as themſelves affirmed, to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to ſpeak with the Archbiſhop, who cannot deny but they were with him; and by whoſe means we know not, this <hi>Price</hi> procured the Searchers place at <hi>Dover</hi> for the uſe of the Benedictines, and put two profeſſed Papiſts into it, for the freer paſſage of Prieſts and Jeſuits into the Kingdome, and more ſecure conveying intelligence to and from <hi>Rome:</hi> Now lay all this together, and we dare confidently averre, that all his predeceſſors ſince the Reformation put together, had not halfe that intimacy, correſpondency with Prieſts and Jeſuits as he; and if the truth were knowne, the party or parties who two ſeverall times ſeriouſly tendred him a Cardinals Cap, avowing ability to performe it, was either the Popes owne Nuncio, or ſome Prieſts, Jeſuits or popiſh Agents, who had inſtructions
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:61245:287"/>
from the Pope himſelfe to make this offer to him; which none durſt nor could without hazard of their lives, have tendred ſo much as once, much leſſe twice to any of his proteſtant predeceſſors: That he received no Letters from Prieſts and Jeſuits, is a thing not credible; the double proffer of a Cardinalſhip to him from <hi>Rome,</hi> is a ſtronger evidence that he received Letters likewiſe from thence, then his owne bare word, he received none: It is true, we met with no ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his Study or Cloſet, but the reaſon was, himſelfe before his commitment and afterward, when he went to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to fetch papers thence (his Cloſet and Study being not ſealed up till ſome moneths after his commitment) had time and wiſdome enough to convey all ſuch Letters out of the way, or burne them, leaſt they ſhould riſe up in judgement to condemne him, though he removed not others thence, wherein he conceived leaſt danger, the better to colour his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall and burning of the moſt dangerous.</p>
               <p>For Maſter <hi>Dobſons</hi> Teſtimony, he is but <hi>testis domesticus,</hi> his owne meniall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a meer ſingle Witneſſe, and unſworn too, therfore not ſo much to be valued; but take it as it is, it proves little for him: He ſaith, that Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> received Letters of intelligence from forraigne Prieſts and Jeſuits, but he knowes neither their perſons nor names, much leſſe that they were either prieſts or Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and that any ſuch reſorted to his Table, he cannot certainly affirme it: for he cannot nominate any one prieſt in particular, and conceives onely they were prieſts but knowes it not but by conceit, without other evidence: For <hi>Julius Maria</hi> and the other forraigner, who dieted for a time at Archbiſhop <hi>Abbots</hi> Table, he confeſſeth he did not know them to be prieſts, but ſtrangers they were, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who made ſome ſhewes and promiſes to that Archbiſhop of turning Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, the onely ground why he thus entertained them, to further and perfect their converſion; but as ſoon as they faltred with him, they were preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded: But what is this to this Archbiſhops caſe, who kept correſpondency with theſe Prieſts and Jeſuits, of purpoſe to pervert and reduce us back to <hi>Rome,</hi> not to convert them unto us; certainly neither of theſe two (though <hi>Bancroft</hi> was none of the greateſt enemies to <hi>Rome)</hi> ever entertained a Jeſuit, or moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious known ſeducers into their Coaches, Barges, Cloſets, Gardens, as he did Sir <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> and <hi>Sancta Clara;</hi> never maintained any <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the Univerſity to ſeduce young Schollers, and inſtruct the Doctors there, as he did <hi>Saint Giles,</hi> who profeſſed, that <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">See p. 428.</note> 
                  <hi>Archb. was very cordiall for their Romiſh Religion;</hi> never checked, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned purſivants for being too active in apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Prieſts, nor reviled them by the name of <hi>Priest-catching kndves,</hi> as he hath done; their caſes and his therefore are very different: For Maſter <hi>Dobſons</hi> not ſeeing Sir <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> at <hi>Lambeth; Ergo,</hi> he was never there with the Archbiſhop; it is a meer <hi>Nonſequitur;</hi> Maſter <hi>Dobſon</hi> is ancient, perchance his eyes were ſo dimme he could not diſcerne him, or he was out of the way when Sir <hi>Toby</hi> was there; but divers others ſweare they ſaw him there; Maſter <hi>Dell</hi> informed Maſter <hi>Newton,</hi> that his Lord was buſie with Sir <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> in the Garden: yea therefore the Archbiſhop dares not produce him to teſtifie his knowledge, leaſt he ſhould confeſſe the truth.</p>
               <p>For King <hi>James</hi> his encouraging <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Preston</hi> to write againſt the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its and other of their Orders, no doubt it was a lawfull policy, and if this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop made uſe of theſe Prieſts, Jeſuits for the like good ends, we ſhould have commended, not accuſed him for it; but he makes uſe of them the quite contrary way, to poyſon, corrupt our Univerſities, to ſophiſticate our Articles of Religion, to put ſuch a <hi>Roman gloſſe</hi> upon them, as might make them ſeem to be Roman Catholiques and to reconcile us ſpeedily to <hi>Rome,</hi> not <hi>Rome</hi> to us, as <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> his Book (written in <hi>England,</hi> and <note n="d" place="margin">See p. 427.</note> ſhewed to his Grace by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelfe, accompanied with his great favourite Biſhop <hi>Linſey</hi> before its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, as himſelfe acknowledgeth under his owne hand-writing) manifeſts paſt all contradiction; therefore the caſe of <hi>Preston</hi> (to whom he himſelfe hath given
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:61245:287"/>
a protection under his hand and Seale as well as <hi>Abbot)</hi> is altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for his correſpondency with Sir <hi>Toby Matthew, Sancta Clara, Saint Giles, Leander, Smith</hi> and <hi>Price,</hi> we have ſo fully proved it, that impudency it ſelfe would bluſh to deny it: OurWitneſſes have ſworne all of them to be popiſh Prieſts, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe under his hand confeſſeth <hi>Saint Giles</hi> to be ſuch a Prieſt, and that he was charged not to exerciſe his <note n="e" place="margin">See p. 428</note> Prieſtly Function during his reſidence in <hi>Oxford;</hi> it is ſtrange audacity therefore in him to deny, that he knew any of them to be Prieſts, when he infallibly confeſſeth he knew him, and no doubt knew all the reſt to be ſo too, eſpecially <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> who ſtiles himſelfe ſo in his Book, yea Father <hi>Price</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> too, were moſt notoriouſly knowne to all to be ſuch, and to exerciſe their Prieſtly Function in <hi>London,</hi> if not in the Court it ſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, therefore knowne no doubt to be prieſts to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for the Witneſſes produced, we very much wonder at his excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt them, moſt of them, as Maſter <hi>Waddeſworth, Newton, Mayo, Thatcher, Goldſmith</hi> and <hi>Cooke,</hi> being perſons imployed by the Lords of the Counſell, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the high Commiſſioners to apprehend Prieſts and other Delinquents, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in that imployment after the pretended complaints againſt them: If they were men ſo diſhoneſt, ſo uncredible as he pretends, why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did himſelf, the Lords and high Commiſſioners make choice or imploy ſuch for their Meſſengers, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo great a truſt unto them? If they be perſons worthy to be truſted with ſuch an employment by perſons of honour, quality and himſelfe too, then certainly moſt competent Witneſſes, atteſting onely that they know, with reference to the Arch-biſhop, in the very execution of their Office, about the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Prieſts and Jeſuits, wherein none can give ſo full or punctuall teſtimony as themſelves, who are moſt privy to their own Actions. For the pretended abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes committed, they concerne onely two or three of them, not all; that they are guilty of ought complained againſt them, there is not the leaſt ſhadow of proofe offered by the Archbi. and admit there were, yet it would no wayes invalid their teſtimony, being not in the things for which they were accuſed, and fortified with other concurrent teſtimonies, as Maſter <hi>Thatchers,</hi> Maſter <hi>Deuxels</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Grayes,</hi> againſt which there is no juſt exception; for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Egertons</hi> cenſure in the High Commiſſion, it was moſt unjuſt and illegall; he was ſentented there to be deprived of his Searchers place, and fined forty pounds, onely for giving way, and conniving at the importation of ſome ENGLISH BIBLES with GENEVA NOTES, and ſelling ſome of them to others: A dangerous crime, which will rather improve then impeach his teſtimony in all honeſtmens opinions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for his particular anſwers, we ſhall returne this replication; Firſt, that the Warrant under the Kings hand for <hi>Saint Giles</hi> his reſidence and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in <hi>Oxford,</hi> is without date, written with the Archbiſhops owne hand, and a meer circumvention; yea, it ſeems a very ſtrong argument of his guilt; for if himſelfe did not place and provide for him in <hi>Oxford,</hi> what need he procure ſuch a Warrant from the King to doe it? and if he had been cordiall to our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would never have accepted ſuch a Warrant, nor intermedled with ſuch a dangerous ſcandalous Deſigne as this, to poyſon and ſeduce the whole Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (who took publick notice of it) in ſuch a time of generall defection and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding unto popery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for his intimacy with Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> and knowing him to be a Prieſt, our Witneſſes evidences are ſo cleere, we ſhall rather pitty his impudency in denying it, then trouble your Lordſhips in repeating them; Maſter <hi>Dobſons</hi> not ſeeing him at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> is no proofe he was not there, and the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> releaſing him, was ſeconded with his owne approbation who ſaid <hi>it is well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for <hi>Smiths, Leanders</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> their reſorts unto him, we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:61245:288"/>
cleered it, and ſhall not repeat; <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> his addreſſes to him, with his Books to reconcile us, is confeſſed under his owne hand, we need no other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> and <hi>Saint Giles</hi> were Aliens, is no extenuation of his guilt, but aggravation; for they were therefore the fitter, the likelier to be imployed hither by papall authority, to reduce us back to <hi>Rome;</hi> But admit them Aliens, which he hath hath not as yet proved, yet Sir <hi>Toby Matthew, Leander</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> were native Engliſhmen, and ſo within the Statutes of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. &amp; 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 2. which he would evade.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, for Maſter <hi>Waddeſworths</hi> teſtimony, it is very full, the Deſigne was to ſend him over-ſea, or to impriſon him, till he ſhould enter into bond never to proſecute or apprehend Prieſts more, to which plot the Archbiſhop was privy, whoſe name was uſed to him, himſelf confeſſing he ſent him four peeces to be rid of him; He pretends it was becauſe he pretended himſelfe a convert: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is but a pretext, he being a convert many yeers before, and one imployed to apprehend Prieſts long before his impriſonment, his diligence herein being the cauſe of his troubles.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, his refuſall to commit <hi>Wilford,</hi> a moſt dangerous ſeducing Prieſt, before he knew he had any protection, and diſcharging him afterwards, onely becauſe he had a protection from Secretary <hi>Windebanke,</hi> with Maſter <hi>Dels</hi> anſwer, <hi>that his Lord would not meddle with ſuch trifles;</hi> ſhewes the coldneſſe of his zeale to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and his good affection to popery: If a godly Proteſtant Miniſter had but ſcrupled at the reading of the Book for Sabbathday-ſport, or omitted the leſt Ceremony, or preached but a Sermon on a Lords-day after-noon, theſe were ſuch hainous crimes, and matters of ſo grand importance, that they muſt be forthwith ſuſpended, committed, deprived, and all buſineſſes ſet aſide to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, notwithſtanding any protection of Law or Goſpell; but if a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prieſt, who had perverted above two hundred ſoules, be brought before his Grace, alas his zeale is ſo frozen, he will not meddle with the buſineſſe, and his friend Secretary <hi>Windebanks</hi> Warrant muſt ſet him free, and ſecure him againſt all lawes and proſecutions: A plaine proofe of a confederacy between them to protect theſe Traytors, and reduce us back to popery, by granting liberty to ſuch pernicious ſeducers.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, for <hi>Gray,</hi> his onely fault as our Witneſſes depoſe, was, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained againſt, his expertneſſe and diligence in diſcovering prieſts, and aſſiſting other Meſſengers to apprehend them; for this hainous crime alone, <hi>Windebanke</hi> complained of him to the Queen; and for this very cauſe <hi>Thatcher</hi> is ſpecially charged by the Arciſhop himſelfe, not to keep company with him, under paine of being turned out of his place; and <hi>Goldſmith</hi> depoſeth, that the Archbiſhop himſelfe gave a publick charge to all the Meſſengers of the High Commiſſion not to keep company with <hi>Gray</hi> any more, for if they did he would lay them by the heels, pull their Coats off their backs, and turne them out of their places; Committed he was to the Fleet upon the Archbiſhops complaint, only for uſing words implying his coldneſſe in proſecuting prieſts, &amp; hoping to ſee better times; a very poor cauſe to impriſon him ſo long: His own hand (as we proved) is to the Warrant for his commitment: He oft times petitioned for his enlargement by his wife, but his petitions were ſtill rejected with ſcorn; He anſwers, <hi>He will have nothing to doe with that Prieſt-catching knave,</hi> proved by two Witieſſes, <hi>Elizabeth Gray</hi> and <hi>Goldſmith. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi dolor ibi digitus;</hi> here was the cauſe of all the malice againſt <hi>Gray,</hi> this was his grand crime, he was a prieſt-catcher, and a knave for catching them; ſtrange language from an Archbiſhop: But what followes? his favourite <hi>Windebank</hi> muſt come in to act the ſecond part and cloſe up the Tragedy; <hi>Gray</hi> muſt not be enlarged after many moneths impriſonment, till he put in baile <hi>never to diſcover or proſecute Priests more,</hi> and then they ſhould all be quiet in ſhort time
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:61245:288"/>
with our prelats and popiſh Clergies concurrence, quickly reduce us all to <hi>Rome:</hi> This is the upſhot of the Deſigne, which this evidence concerning <hi>Gray</hi> moſt cleerly diſcovers and proves too.</p>
               <p>Eightly, for <hi>Egertons</hi> teſtimony, concerning his reſtoring of popiſh Books, it is more then a report, it was from the mouth of <hi>Motterſhead</hi> a ſworne Officer to the Archbiſhop, now dead, who durſt not report an untruth of this nature, and the Archbiſhop himſelfe confeſſeth, the many Books forementioned, were reſtored by order of the High Commiſſion Court, whereof himſelfe was a chiefe member, therefore by him; a cleer confirmation of <hi>Motterſheau's</hi> words, <hi>Egerton's</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his papers.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, for the liberty of Prieſts, Jeſuits, and their ſaying Maſſe in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it was his owne negligence and connivance, the Keepers being under his command, &amp; the High Commiſſioners, who could look narrowly enough to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans and godly Miniſters: and indeed their commitment thither to ſecure them from our common Goales and all legall proſecutions, was but a meer fallacy to delude the people, and advance the Catholick cauſe with greater facility and leſſe ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>Mayoes</hi> teſtimony and <hi>Thatchers,</hi> are ſo farre from extenuating, that they aggravate his offence; their Warrants and imployments being meer diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and ſhadowes to gull the people; for naught was done upon the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the one, to whom he refuſed to grant a Warrant, becauſe he was too hot againſt Prieſts; and no Prieſts apprehended by the other, who had his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant upon this condition, Not to imploy or keep company with <hi>Gray,</hi> the onely man that could diſcover Prieſts and Jeſuits to him, and help him in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending.</p>
               <p>Finally, his owne objected confeſſion in his Epiſtle to the King, <hi>God forbid I ſhould ever offer to perſwide a perſecution in any kind, or practice it in the leaſt, &amp;c.</hi> againſt Prieſts and Jeſuits, coupled with the premiſes, when as he was ſo terrible, ſo bloody a perſecutor of Orthodox godly Miniſters, and zealous Proteſtants, unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably proues his connivance at, his protection of, and confederacy with them, to re-enthrall us in their Romiſh bondage: So that this whole charge, however he conceives he hath ſhaken it quite off and laid it in the duſt, recoiles upon him with greater vigor, and reſts heavier on his back then ever.</p>
               <p>The laſt charge of this nature againſt me is, <note n="a" place="margin">Page 459, 460.</note> that I complyed with Papiſts, Prieſts and Jeſuits, in concealing their very Treaſonable plots and conſpiracies <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obje.</hi> 6.</note> both againſt our State, Church and Religion, to reduce us unto <hi>Rome,</hi> for which they produce two inſtances; my threatning and committing Miſtris <hi>Huſſey,</hi> for diſcovering a dangerous plot of the Queen. Mother and others to cut the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants throats; and my concealing of <hi>Habernfields</hi> plot diſcoverd to me, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting or revealing it to the Parliament or Lords, to fift it to the bottome.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer that I did not conceale nor diſcourage the diſcoverers of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two plots: For the firſt of them, I conceived it very improbable, <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and I thought <hi>Anne Huſſey</hi> to be crazy when ſhe revealed it, and ſo much I told her; For her commitment to the Sheriffes, it was at her owne deſire, for her greater ſafety; and there was as ſtrict an examination as poſſible of this conſpiracy, but no cleer evidence: For the latter plot, as ſoon as I received intelligence of it, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently revealed it to the King, as appeares by my Letter, and the Kings Anſwer to it in the margin, under his owne hand, which Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> hath printed; and the ſubſequent Letters prove, that I did all I could therein, but could make nothing of it; This I beleeve a noble Lord here preſent well remembers, to whom I diſcloſed it, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (who preſently replyed, <hi>he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no ſuch thing:)</hi> However, it is one of the greateſt evidences that can be of my ſteadfaſtneſſe in the proteſtant Religion, and oppoſition againſt popery, if the plot were reall, and if but counterfeit, then no crime to conceale it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="564" facs="tcp:61245:289"/>
To which was replyed; Firſt, that all the premiſes abundantly prove, that he <note place="margin">Reply.</note> was privy and aſſiſtant to many Jeſuiticall plots and devices to uſher in popery, and reduce us to <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore it is no wonder that he oppoſed not, nor proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but ſmothered them all he could: Secondly, that the firſt of the plots which he then conceived improbable, hath ſince experimentally proved reall both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> yea his <hi rend="sup">b</hi>

His own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>viction therfore of its reality ſhould have enduced him, if not to proſecute, yet at leaſtwiſe to have revealed itto the Parliament, that they might have fifted it to the Bran, which he never did; Maſter <hi>Prynnes</hi> ſeizing it in his Chamber, to his great griefe, being the onely meanes to bring it unto light: His argument, that it makes moſt of any thing for the juſtification of his ſincerity to our Religion, and oppoſition to Popery, aggravates, not extenuates his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in concealing it, becauſe then he had more reaſon to diſcloſe it, as well for his owne vindication from ſcandal, as the publike ſafety of our King, Church, Religion; but his engagements to this confederated Popiſh party, and the Advancment of their cauſe were ſuch, that he preferred them before his owne private pretended juſtification, or the ſafety of all theſe coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Wherefore he ſtill remaines under the guilt, weight of this and all other
