         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſcended from Heaven, with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Arch-angell, and with the Trump of God.</p>
            <p>And the ſea, the earth, yea all things are now giving up their dead. And all things that ever were, are, or ſhall be viſible—are the Grave wherein the King of Glory (the eternall, inviſible Almightineſſe, hath lain as it were) dead and buried.</p>
            <p>But behold, behold, he is now riſen with a witneſſe, to ſave <hi>Zion</hi> with vengeance, or to confound and plague all things into himſelf; who by his mighty Angell is proclaiming (with a loud voyce) That Sin and Tranſgreſſion is finiſhed and ended; and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſſe brought in; and the everlaſting Goſpell preaching; Which everlaſting Goſpell is brought in with moſt terrible earth-quakes, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-quakes, and with ſignes and wonders following. <hi>Amen.</hi>

[I am free from the blood of all men] though (I ſay) all things are reconciled to me, the eternall God (IN HIM) yet ſword levelling, or digging-levelling, are neither of them his principle.</p>
               <p>Both are as farre from his principle, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, or the Heavens from the Earth, (though, I ſay, reconciled to both, as to all things elſe) and though he hath more juſtice, righteouſneſſe, truth, and ſincerity, ſhining in thoſe low dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils, (as they are eſteemed) then in the Sunne, Moone, and all the Stars.</p>

               <p>4 And now thus ſaith the Lord:</p>
               <p>Though you can as little endure the word LEVELLING, as could the lat-ſlaine or dead <hi>Charles</hi> (your foretunner, who is gone before you—) and had as live heare the Devill named, as heare of the Levellers (M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>5 Behold, behold, behold, I the eternall God, the Lord of Hoſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who am that mighty Leveller, am comming (yea even at the doores) to Levell in good earneſt, to Levell to ſome purpoſe, to Levell with a witneſſe, to Levell the Hills with the Valleyes, and to lay the Mountaines low.</p>
               <p>6 High Mountaines! lofty Cedars! its high time for you to enter into the Rocks, and to hide you in the duſt, for feare of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty. For the lofty looks of man ſhall be humbled, and the haughtineſſe of men ſhall be bowed downe, and the Lord ALONE ſhall be exalted in that day; For the day of the Lord of Hoaſts, ſhall be upon every one that is proud, and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low.

               <p>And the LOFTINESSE of man ſhall be bowed down, and the haughtineſſe of men ſhall be laid low. And the Lord ALONE ſhall be exalted in that day, and the Idols he ſhall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſh.</p>
               <p>And they ſhall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the Caves of the Earth, for ſcare of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth.</p>
               <p>In that day a man ſhall caſt his Idols of Silver, and Idols of Gold—to the bats, and to the Moles.

               <p>14 Wherefore bow downe, bow downe, you ſturdy Oakes, and tall Cedars; bow, or by my ſelf Ile break you.</p>

               <p>1 O <hi>London, London,</hi> my bowels are rolled together (in me) for thee, and my compaſſions within me, are kindled towards thee.</p>
               <p>And now I onely tell thee, that it was not in vaine that this forme hath been brought ſo farre to thee, to proclaime the day of the Lord throughout thy ſtreets, day and night, for twelve or thirteen dayes together.</p>
               <p>And that I have been made ſuch a ſigne, and a wonder before many of thine Inhabitants faces.</p>
               <p>2 Many of them (among other ſtrange exploits) beholding me, fall down flat at the feet of creeples, beggers, lazars, kiſſing their feet, and reſigning up my money to them; being ſeverall times over-emptied of money, that I have not had one penny left, and yet have recruited againe—</p>
               <p>3 And now my hearts! you have been forwardly in all the appearances of God,</p>
               <p>There is a ſtrange one (now on foot) judge it not, leaſt you be judged with a vengeance.</p>
               <p>4 Turne not away your eyes from it, leaſt you (to your tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) heare this voyce—<hi>I was a Stranger, and ye tooke me not in.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117697:12"/>Well! bow down before Eternall Majeſty, who is univerſall love, bow down to equality, or free community, that no more of your blood be ſplit; that pride, arrogance, covetuouſneſſe, malice, hypocriſie, ſelf ſeeking, &amp;c. may live no longer. Elſe I tremble at whats comming upon you.</p>
               <p>Remember you have been warned with a witneſſe.</p>

               <p>1. HE that hath an eare to heare, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith againſt the Churches.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaith the Lord: Woe be to thee <note n="*" place="margin">The houſe of vanity.</note>

Publicans and Harlots ſhall, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Harlots do ſooner enter into the Kingdome of heaven, then you.</p>
               <p>I'le give thee this fatall blow, and leave thee.</p>
               <p>3 Thou haſt affronted, and defied the Almighty, more then the vileſt of men (upon the face of the earth) and that ſo much the more, by how much the more thou takeſt upon thee the name of Saint, and aſſumeſt it to thy ſelf onely, damning all thoſe that are not of thy S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4 Wherefore be it knowne to all Tongues, Kinreds, Nations, and languages upon earth, That my moſt Excellent Majeſty, the King of glory, the Eternall God, who dwelleth in the forme of the Writer of this Roll (among many other ſtrange and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits) hath i'th open ſtreets, with his hand fiercely ſtretcht out, his hat cockt up, his eyes ſet as if they would ſparkle out; and with

a mighty loud voyce charged 100. of Coaches, 100. of men and women of the greater ranke, and many notorious, deboiſt, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, royſtering roaring Cavalliers (ſo called) and other wilde ſparks of the Gentry: And have proclaimed the notable day of the Lord to them, and that through the ſtreets of the great Citie, and in Southwark; Many times great multitudes following him up and down, and this for the ſpace of 12. or 13. dayes: And yet (all this while) not one of them lifting up one finger, not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one haire of his head, or laying one hand on his raiment.</p>
               <p>But many, yea many notorious vile ones, in the eſteeme of men (yea of great quality among men) trembling and bowing to the God of heaven, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But when I came to proclaim (alſo) the great day of the Lord (among you) O ye carnall Goſpellers.</p>
               <p>The Devill (in you) roared out, who was tormented to ſome purpoſe, though not before his time.</p>
               <p>He there ſhewed both his phangs and pawes, and would have torn me to pieces, and have eaten me up. Thy pride, envy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, arrogance, &amp;c. was powred out like a river of Brimſtone, crying out, a Blaſphemer, a Blaſphemer, away with him: At length threatning me, and being at laſt raving mad, ſome tooke hold of my Cloak on one ſide, ſome on another, endeavouring to throw me from the place where I ſtood (to proclaime his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties meſſage) making a great uproar in a great congregation of people: Till at length I wrapt up my ſelf in ſilence (for a ſeaſon) for the welfavour'd harlots confuſion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And to thine eternall ſhame and damnation (O mother of witchcrafts, who dwelleſt in gathered Churches) let this be told abroad: And let her FLESH be burnt with FIRE.</p>
