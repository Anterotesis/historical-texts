            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE been ſome time conſidering with my ſelf, whether it might be convenient to return an Anſwer to thoſe many diſ-ingenuous Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and unhandſom Inſinuations, againſt the preſent Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> which I find in <hi>a Sermon preached by Mr.</hi> Jenkyn <hi>upon occaſion of Dr.</hi> Seaman<hi>'s Death.</hi> It can be no pleaſing Employment to any ſober Perſon, to have no better Argument to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, but only to expoſe a few opprobrious and paſſionate Expreſſions; and it would be more for the Credit and common Intereſt of our Religion, if ſuch Rudeneſſes as theſe could be buried in ſilence. But I fear they have taken too much air, and been blown abroad too far already, and that therefore the greateſt innocency will not be able to protect us any longer;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65721:3"/>
for if we ſhould continue to hear our ſelves reviled in ſuch a manner, without any Reply, it would be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by ſome, that we were really guilty of what has been ſo confidently laid to our charge. Had he contented himſelf, to have called us only <hi>a company of uncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts, poor Shrubs, empty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompliſhed Predicants,</hi> with ſuch other civilities, wherewith he abounds; I'll aſſure you, Sir, all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in the World ſhould have never prevailed with me to have returned his Complement. But ſince he has been pleaſed to tax us with nothing leſs than Hereſie, and other Crimes of the fouleſt nature, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have ſuffered my ſelf to be byaſſed, contrary to my inclination, to attempt ſomething by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. I therefore now ſend you theſe Papers; and, if the ſame thing be not done before by ſome better hand, I leave them wholly to your diſpoſal, either to ſuppreſs or make them publick, as you ſhall ſee cauſe; provided you diſcover nothing that may be juſtly ſcandalous, or offenſive in them. I ſhall moſt ſtudiouſly endeavour to avoid all manner of bitterneſs and paſſion; though this Gentleman has treated us with ſo much inſolence, as might be enough to provoke the moſt patient man to ſome degree of reſentment. When I caſt my eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of the firſt Pages of the Sermon, I was in good hopes that he would have <hi>dipped the Nail of Exhortation in the Oyl of love and ſweetneſs;</hi> but I <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 5.</note> quickly found my miſtake here; eſpecially when I came towards the latter end, I perceived plainly then, that the angry man was reſolved to <hi>drive us with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knocks, and ſtrokes, and blows.</hi> But we muſt bear <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> all this ſeverity as well as we can; for my part I intend to preſerve my ſelf from all intemperate heats, and not conſider what ſuch a one as he might poſſibly deſerve to hear, but what becomes me to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65721:3"/>
There is no queſtion but that he hath ſuffered very deeply in his reputation, by this great imprudence, amongſt the more grave and moderate of our diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren themſelves; and that he ſtands condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the opinion of all ſober and unprejudiced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all perſwaſions. For if he had no more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than to vent ſuch Ribaldry amongſt his Hearers, yet it might be expected that, at his age, a Man ſhould have been Maſter of more diſcretion, than to expoſe all his Follies to the publick view. When they were firſt delivered they might haply have eſcaped without a cenſure; when the people were very attentive to catch every ſentence, and take all for Goſpel that drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from his lips; but he muſt not therefore think that the reſt of the World will be ſo eaſily impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſo ready to believe him upon his bare word. No; thoſe, he talks of, are Crimes of a higher nature, than ever to be taken for granted upon truſt, without the leaſt ſhew or offer of a proof. He gives us a great many very hard words, and that is all. Now if his Blood had been inflamed to the higheſt pitch, and that he had had never ſo great abundance of the <hi>poyſon of Aſps under his tongue,</hi> and if Religion could not, yet good Manners might have obliged him not to have ſpit it up in the Pulpit. For what language may we expect from the poor People, when he that calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their Paſtor, ſhall mingle ſo much of the very Spirit of Gall and Wormwood in that which they ſwallow down greedily as the Food of their Souls?</p>
            <p>In his Epiſtle <hi>to that part of the Flock of Chriſt, of the which the Reverend Dr.</hi> Seaman <hi>was the late vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant OVERSEER;</hi> he makes a very unſeaſonable Apology for his <hi>unpreparedneſs,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed avocations, and ſhort warning.</hi> Now, beſides the Doctors <hi>dying-requeſt,</hi> the time allowed him by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65721:4"/>
the People was from <hi>Tueſday</hi> to <hi>Sunday.</hi> And I am pretty confident that there are ſome of thoſe <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Predicants,</hi> which this Great Man menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afterwards with ſo much ſcorn, that, bating but <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 56.</note> his railing, would have made almoſt as good a diſcourſe as his, in leſs than half the time, notwithſtanding their <hi>multiplyed avocations.</hi> But theſe excuſes may give us to underſtand, that if he had been bleſſed with lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enough, he could have made a moſt admirable piece; and yet this was ſo well liked, that there is no remedy, but out it muſt, with a black Liſt about the Title, and we muſt now be beſpattered from the Preſs, as we had been in the Pulpit before.</p>
            <p>After this formal craving of Pardon, where there was no need, he proceeds in this manner; <hi>Neither could my own beloved Flock,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſome of whom were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the time of my preaching, find here any Exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (unleſs in my Diſcourſe concerning the Doctor) above their conſtant Sabbath-days Proviſions.</hi> Well; this is a mighty lucky Man at a Parentheſis; and it was happy for him that he brought in this here. For otherwiſe the people coming together in expectation of a Feaſt, might have been like enough to have been a little peeviſh, as hungry men many times are, and they might have juſtly complained of unkindneſs. What? ſo many Strangers invited and no more reſpect ſhewn them? Nothing beyond the <hi>conſtant Sabbath-days Proviſions</hi> which he makes for his own Family? No <hi>Exceedings</hi> upon ſuch a ſolemn occaſion? This is not civil. Therefore it is not ſaid none at all, but none <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs in the Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctor.)</hi> And there you ſhall be ſure to have ſomething more than ordinary, ſome delicate Fare, purpoſely reſerved for the ſecond Courſe. But really I cannot perceive what it ſhould be, beſides the moſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65721:4"/>
contumelious and reproachful language that he prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally throws away upon the Conforming Clergy. And I could wiſh that this were <hi>Exceedings</hi> with him too; and that he would make ſuch Entertainments only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on High Days. And yet I muſt tell you, that moſt of the Caſuiſts, I have yet ſeen, do humbly conceive that this is as ſcandalous and Antichriſtian Diet as Plumb-Porridge, or Minc'd-Pyes; though it may relliſh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſome kind of Palates. But let him ſay what he pleaſes, I have told you before I will not be angry; but if he chance to provoke me to laughter a little now and then, that ſhall be the worſt, and I muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, I cannot help it. For when I ſee this cholerick Gentleman ſtanding up in the middle of his Pulpit, and brandiſhing his Arms about him, and beating the air moſt furiouſly, and making a moſt heavy noiſe, and crying out; <hi>O uncouth, and till of late unheard of word! (how it ſounds!)</hi> Oh this <hi>company of uncate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts!</hi> Oh <hi>this young brood of Theologues!</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag</hi> 53<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 55, 56.</note> 
               <hi>Oh what poor Shrubs are theſe!</hi> Oh how I could cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe <hi>their malapart and ſaucy Ignorance!</hi> Oh <hi>theſe empty and unaccompliſhed Predicants, who preach the Sermons of their Non-conforming Predeceſſors!</hi> Oh ſtop the Thief there, ſtop the Thief! Oh he is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away with abundance of very choice Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties! Oh that I had him here in my Clutches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, I ſay, to ſee a pretty elderly Man in ſuch an ecſtaſie of paſſion, no body knows why, is enough, I think, to make any one ſmile. And he has ſuch a rare happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of expreſſing himſelf to the life, that whenever I read the latter end of his Sermon, I cannot chuſe but fancy ſometimes that I have him before my eyes juſt in ſuch a poſture, as I have deſcribed. Oh the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful power of Eloquence! But what need all this ado? <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts, ſaucy, malapart, &amp;c.</hi> He knew well
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65721:5"/>
enough that none of theſe Gentlemen were there to hear him. Yes, that's true; but however it was right valiantly ſpoken, juſt like Mr. <hi>Jenkyn;</hi> bold as a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while danger is at a convenient diſtance: But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his heart begins to fail him by this time, and that he wiſhes that he had <hi>eat</hi> his words, at leaſt <hi>the Paper of the whole Impreſſion,</hi> before it ever came abroad; for I cannot yet have ſo mean an opinion of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 56.</note> or honeſty, as to think he would have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many of the groſſeſt, and moſt undeſerved Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies to be publiſhed under his name, if he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his thoughts a little time and liberty to cool. Therefore I hope we may ſee his Recantation out in print very ſuddenly; this is in the mean while to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the over-credulous part of the world, that the perſons, whom he hath moſt wrongfully aſperſed, are not ſo bad as they are repreſented by him.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, Sir, that I have been ſomething long already, before I come to my principal deſign, which is to wipe off thoſe aſperſions which have been moſt unworthily caſt upon us. But there is one thing more which, I think, will not be improper to be premiſed. It cannot be unknown to many men, what a great cry there has been raiſed within theſe few years, as if many of the Conforming Clergy were ſinking apace into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>heretical</hi> opinions, and that thoſe of <hi>London</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially were deeply tainted with the <hi>Cracovian</hi> Divinity. The thing is notorious, that ſuch Reports have been ſpread abroad, and you ſee how boldly this confident Man raves at us, as if they were true. I have often wondred what ſhould be the cauſe of theſe unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clamours. I thought I had been as well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many of theſe Men, converſed as familiarly with them, known their minds, and read their Books as much, as ſome of thoſe who make the loudeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65721:5"/>
againſt them; and I muſt here profeſs to all the world, that I never heard in any Diſcourſe of any of them, either publick or private, neither have I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any paſſage in any of their Writings, which was not very eaſily reconcileable to the Articles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So far are they from deſerving the leaſt imputation of <hi>Hereſie;</hi> unleſs Men will purpoſely pervert their meaning, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know their judgments better than they do themſelves, and wreſt their expreſſions, and put ſuch a ſenſe upon their words, as they never intended.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange, that we that have ſo many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of underſtanding theſe Mens opinions, ſhould not be able to diſcern their moſt dangerous errours all this while, when others can do it preſently with leſs than half an eye. Therefore you muſt know that 'tis a mighty thing to be well <hi>accompliſhed.</hi> There are ſome Men that will ſmell a Hereſie farther off, than a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall a rotten Carcaſs; and as ſoon as ever they have ſpyed it out, they ſoar aloft immediately, and hover a little in the air, and then down they come, with their Pounces right upon it: and wo be to the Man where they light! they fall upon him, and claw and tear him, without any mercy; and before they have done, they commonly eat him up without either Bread or Salt. Though you know there are ſome Birds of prey that uſe to roaſt their <hi>Hereticks</hi> firſt; but theſe ſeem to be of a more ſavage kind, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a little patience till they be dreſſed, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them raw, without any more ado. The other call them to a formal Tryal, and when they have paſſed ſentence upon them, they deliver them over to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Powers; but theſe only cry out <hi>Heretick, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> like Boys in the Streets; and ſo expoſe whom they think fit, under that name, to the odium and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65721:6"/>
of the undiſcerning multitude. This is certainly a very ſevere, and extremely unjuſt way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee if we can find what ſhould be the cauſe of theſe grievous complaints. And there are but two things that I can imagine that may have given the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. And one of them is, that Non-Conformity not being able to defend it ſelf with its old Weapons, ſome of the Diſſenters have thought fit to ſtore their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines with better Furniture, as they think. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that was in uſe in Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>'s days, is now grown ruſty, and out of faſhion; and they ſeem to be aſhamed of it themſelves, and afraid they ſhould be laughed at, if they ſhould put it on. And therefore being in ſo much danger of a total Rout, and happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very fortunately to hear ſome whiſpering, as if the preſent Clergy, or, at leaſt, many of them did open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favour ſome very dangerous Doctrines; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve immediately to lay hold of the Report. And this perhaps they might firſt have from a few indiſcreet perſons that have had a petty ambition of being eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the only true Sons of the Church, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon given themſelves a great deal more liberty of talking at ſuch a rate, than was either for the Churches credit, or their own. But however, I ſay, the former receiving the hint, ſome way or other, they have not been wanting to improve it to their beſt advantage. And now we can hear of nothing but <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and wonderful jealouſies of a new Edition of the <hi>Craco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Catechiſm</hi> to be ſhortly printed at <hi>London.</hi> And here they have ſecured a good retreat, if they ſhould ever chance any more to be worſted in the field. They cannot but ſuppoſe, as <hi>unaccompliſhed</hi> as we may be, that we are not ignorant how often they have been forced to change their Plea; a great ſign of a bad
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65721:6"/>
Cauſe. Sometimes the things in debate betwixt us are unlawful in themſelves; ſometimes they are allowed to be indifferent, but then it is abſolutely unlawful to impoſe them, or to ſubmit unto them being impoſed: ſometimes they are bitter enemies to Toleration, and ſometimes there is nothing ſo good as Liberty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. And when men do thus ſhift their opinions, and face about ſo many times as their circumſtances alter; there is none ſo weak but muſt needs ſuſpect that they never ſtood upon any very ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. Beſides moſt of the matters that have always made the greateſt noiſe, are ſuch as cannot likely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a ſcruple of any long continuance in any mans breaſt. For how can it be thought that God ſhould be angry with us for the doing of that which he never forbad us to do? This is not any tranſgreſſion of the Law, and therefore may not be eſteemed a ſin. For who can have the leaſt Reaſon to imagine that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can poſſibly be defiled by ſeeing another wear a Surplice; or by kneeling himſelf, when he partakes of the holy Euchariſt; or by beholding a ſign of the Croſs made upon the forehead of an Infant after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? He that has been a little terrified and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the hideous cryes that have been made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Popery, and Superſtition, may be like enough to have ſome doubts within himſelf for a time, when he ſhall hear theſe things ſo vehemently accuſed, as they have been, for Idolatrous and Antichriſtian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. But when he ſhall begin ſeriouſly to examine himſelf, by the ſtanding Rules and Meaſures of Good and Evil, he cannot reaſonably take them to be ſinful, becauſe it cannot be made appear that they are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to any Law of God, or Nature. So that when once the fright is over, theſe cannot be effectual any longer to keep any great numbers of the more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65721:7"/>
part of the People from returning to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Communion of the Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I gueſs, but will not be peremptory, that thoſe Diſſenters, who are unwilling to be convinced, may have a deſign to twiſt in ſome Doctrinal Controverſies, with thoſe of Diſcipline, which now begin to be leſs odious than once they were. If it were not ſo, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand what ſhould make them ſo ready, as ſome of them have been, to fix a charge of no leſs than <hi>Hereſie,</hi> where they have ſo little occaſion for it. When all their ancient Ramparts and Bullworks are either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, or battered to the ground, they muſt throw up ſomething to defend themſelves, in caſe of aſſault, till freſh ſuccours can arrive, and be put into the place.</p>
            <p>And now methinks I ſee Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> again, ſtanding within the Breach with his Doublet off, and his Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe lying by, and his Shovel in his hand, and caſting up Dirt, as hard as he can drive, and crying out once more; <hi>What a company of uncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts do we now behold, venting as confidently their heretical Notions,</hi> as I do throw this Dirt in their Faces? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fear <hi>their malapart and ſaucy Ignorance, theſe empty and unaccompliſhed Predicants, that preach our Sermons;</hi> if we ſhould chance to fall into the hands of <hi>this young brood of Theologues,</hi> they'll certainly plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us of all that we have, <hi>to ſay no worſe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come on my brave Boys, let us fight gallantly, and reſolve to ſtand it out to the laſt Man; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do, be ſure to cry out <hi>Hereſie, Hereſie,</hi> as loud as ever you are able; that's the thing muſt do our buſineſs when all is done. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what influence the Rhetorick and Example of ſo great a Commander may have upon the common Men, to put them into a deſperate fit; but this I dare aſſure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65721:7"/>
you, that if they had no abler Souldiers in the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than he, you would hear of a ſurrender very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Non tali auxilio.</hi> However, Good Man! he was willing to do the beſt he could; and hearing, it may be, from ſome or other, that it might be of excellent uſe towards the ſupport of the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> if the people could be perſwaded that the Conformiſts were a company of <hi>uncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts, that did confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently vent their heretical Notions, &amp;c.</hi> as he is, I gueſs, a Man of ſomething a hottiſh temper, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently takes the Alarm, and away he runs with it, and the next occaſion he rattles it out; but with ſo little artifice and cunning, and ſo very impertinently, and without the leaſt ſhadow of a Reaſon, that I believe hereafter we ſhall be eſteemed very ſober and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox perſons, and he will never be accounted by thoſe that know him, a Man of a ſound judgment more. But ſtill there is need of all Devices imaginable to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a tottering Cauſe, and there is none more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, than to lay <hi>Hereſie</hi> to the charge of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: For whether they be guilty, or no, it is but to affirm it boldly, as Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> has done, and there will be always ſome wiſe enough to believe whatever is ſaid. And this I take to be one occaſion that this ſcandalous Report has ſpread ſo far.</p>
            <p>Another may poſſibly be the calmneſs and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the greateſt part of the Conforming Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are wont to uſe, when they happen to diſcourſe of a controverted point. They do not confute their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent with a rude and inſignificant noiſe; nor think that they ſhall ever convince him by hard words, and ill names; which are the only Arguments that ſome Men are able to manage. But they conſider, and are willing to make allowances for the common infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Humane Underſtandings, and the ſtrong preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65721:8"/>
of Education; and therefore they treat all Men gently, and are not rudely clamorous in their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but hope the beſt, and think as charitably as they can of thoſe that are of a different Perſwaſion. This you know to be the judgment and practice of great numbers of the Conformable Divines. They aim at the peace and good of the World. And this is that that hath raiſed them ſo many Enemies of all ſorts, this is that which hath made them <hi>Hereticks.</hi> If it were not too ſad a thing to think that ſo excellent and Chriſtian a deſign, as this of theirs ſeems to be, ſhould meet with ſuch violent and bitter oppoſition, it were no unpleaſant ſight to behold how eagerly they are purſued by the ſeveral petty intereſts, that agree in nothing elſe; and how quietly they do ſtand their ground, and receive the ſhock of them all, with as much unconcernedneſs, as the Rock breaks the Waves that daſh againſt it. But that you may ſee that there are hot-brain'd Men of all parties, ſome of their own Robe will needs ſuſpect them to be ſhrewdly inclined to Non-Conformity; becauſe they are not always rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Fanaticks. Others hold them to be <hi>Soeini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> preſently; becauſe they are able to confute them, without running into an unſeemly paſſion. Others look upon them as well affected to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe though poſſibly they believe it, yet they do not make it a fundamental Article, that the Pope is Antichriſt. Others imagine they can prove them Heathens; becauſe they are not continually paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſentence upon the Souls of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato.</hi> And thus if you examine them all through, you will find that it is nothing but their ſober and modeſt behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in Diſputes, and the greatneſs of their Charity, that can be charged with <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or any diſaffection to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For their Opinions cannot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65721:8"/>
be accuſed of this; they are perfectly agreeable to the Nine and thirty Articles, as I told you before, though not to the falſe and ſpurious Gloſſes that ſome have been pleaſed to put upon them. I will juſt mention ſome few things they hold, which may be ſufficient to clear them of the groſſeſt of thoſe imputations they have ſuffered under. They hold the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity; <hi>that the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghoſt God.</hi> They hold that the Eternal and only begotten Son of God was in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time incarnate of the bleſſed Virgin, and that <hi>he ſuffered Death upon the Croſs for our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made there (by his own Oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once offered) a full, perfect, ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation, and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> They hold that we are <hi>juſtified by Faith;</hi> but not that this Faith excludes the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Salvation, that are indiſpenſably required in the Goſpel. I might alledge other Inſtances, but theſe are enough to take away the ſcandal of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm at leaſt.</p>
            <p>And thus have I given you my Opinion freely, what I conceive to be the Cauſes of the great Apprehenſions that ſome have entertained, as if the <hi>Conforming Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> were turning <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and I can find them to be no other, than that there is need enough of ſome New Pretences for Separation; and that many of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts are of more mild and peaceable Diſpoſitions, and treat their Adverſaries with more Civility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect than others do. As you know they that have a good Cauſe, and are able to defend it, are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but rather pleaſed to have their Opinions enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into. But thoſe that are conſcious of their own Weakneſs, or diſtruſt the Truth of what they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, cannot endure to have it queſtioned, and are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65721:9"/>
extremely impatient of any Contradiction.</p>
            <p>But it is time to return to Mr. <hi>Jenkyn,</hi> and to make a Reply to ſome of thoſe reproachful words which he uſes againſt us. I ſhall confine my ſelf chiefly to that part of the Sermon where he ſhews <hi>the inſufficiency of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>his Dwarfiſh endeavours to reach the height of Dr.</hi> Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<hi>'s worth.</hi> Where I ſhall not in the leaſt detract from the Doctor, for I obſerve that Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, however he like them whilſt they are living, ſeems to have a ſpecial kindneſs for dead Biſhops; as appears by divers Inſtances in this Sermon, and ſome others. And I ſhall not be more uncivil to his departed Friend, than he is to ours. I had thought, had it been poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to have put his Extravagances into ſome order; and to have digeſted my Anſwers into the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. But becauſe I find that very difficult, I ſhall content my ſelf to take them generally as they lye. Only whereas he uſually mingles his Invective, and his Panegyrick together, I ſhall take the boldneſs to part them; and firſt conſider ſome of the things for which he commends the Doctor; and then take notice of thoſe matters for which he does inveigh at us.</p>
            <p>And he praiſes the Doctor for his excellency in the <hi>Theological School,</hi> in his <hi>Paſtoral Employment,</hi> and in his <hi>Chriſtian Capacity.</hi> And I ſhall not queſtion any thing of all this; let him be a moſt acute <hi>Diſputant,</hi> a <hi>profound Caſuiſt,</hi> a skilful <hi>Interpreter,</hi> an <hi>Orthodox Divine,</hi> an <hi>able Preacher,</hi> and, which is more than all, <hi>a good Chriſtian.</hi> I am as glad to hear it as any man is; and I could wiſh, for the Doctor's ſake, that Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> had deſerved ſo much credit that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it all upon his authority. But yet I am reſolved to hope the beſt. But towards the very beginning of this large Encomium he brings in a kind of an unlucky Apology for ill-nature. Now if the Doctor had any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65721:9"/>
ſuch defect in his temper, as he ſeems to ſuppoſe; yet I hope it was corrected in good meaſure, and Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyn</hi> might have ſpared him there. But I believe he intended to ſpeak one good word for the Doctor, and two for himſelf: for he has as little Reaſon, as any Man I know, to be much in love with <hi>natural ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> But let that paſs.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething elſe more material that muſt be conſidered. And he tells us that when the Doctor kept his Divinity Act, <hi>The deſign of his Poſition which therein he maintained, was to aſſert the Providence of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 52.</note> 
               <hi>God in diſpoſing of Political Governments:</hi> a thing which no ſober man ever deny'd: and yet he ſays that it was <hi>a Point till that time little ſtudied.</hi> That's ſtrange; did he never hear of the Diſputations the Platoniſts, and Stoicks, and Epicureans had concerning this? And ſome of theſe, 'tis thought, were a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctor's time. But it <hi>was not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 53.</note> till the Doctor made this moſt happy diſcovery; <hi>though ſince that time ſeveral have received light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, from this burning, and ſhining light.</hi> 'Tis very well if they have: And I believe he could tell us too, if he pleaſes, who they are that have been thus illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; and amongſt the reſt, no doubt, he himſelf has had a very ſignal advantage by it, and has the moſt Reaſon of any man living, always to admire and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Doctor's Opinion. 'Tis a moſt excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervative againſt <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi> But what was this famed Poſition of the Doctor's? As far as I can learn, it was laid down in theſe very words, or to this purpoſe; <hi>Regimen Politicum fundatur in Providentiâ Dei Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> calls <hi>his aſſerting Providential</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Diſpoſal.</hi> Though one might conjecture what this means, yet it had not been ſo clear, without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he has made upon it, in the beginning of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65721:10"/>
his <hi>Humble Petition to the Supreme Authority the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the Commonwealth of</hi> England; and in ſhort it is this; that whoever they be that get the Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, <hi>the Providence of God evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in removing others, and inveſting them with the Government: And he looks upon it as his duty to yield to this Authority all active and chearful obedience, even for conſcience ſake.</hi> This is a fine plyable principle as a man can wiſh, 'twill lap about your finger like <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> Gold. Thus when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed memory, had the Power in his hands, this was an <hi>Extraordinary Providence,</hi> and the Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in Him. But ſtay, it may be, the Doctor had not ſtudied the Point himſelf ſo ſoon. But to be ſure when the Parliament got the better, that was an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Providence</hi> indeed, and then, without doubt, they were the Supreme Authority, as their <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner</hi> ſtiles them; and ſo was <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Richard,</hi> and ſo was <hi>the Rump,</hi> and ſo was the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> and ſo was I know not who, and ſo round, until his Majeſties moſt happy Reſtauration; and then, becauſe there was an <hi>Extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in that, ſo is He too; and ſo Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> is as good a Subject as can be deſired; and ſo he had been whoever had come. And thus if the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to overrun the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and deliver the People from Popiſh Tyranny, this were an <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Providence,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> would preſently become the lawful Sovereign of that Realm; and that (which the proud <hi>Mahometan</hi> little thinks of) by virtue of a Poſition made at <hi>Cambridge</hi> above twenty Years ago. I have conſidered it as well as I am able, and cannot make the Doctors <hi>Providentia Extraordinaria</hi> to ſignifie any more in effect than what they call Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his <hi>Potentia Irreſiſtibilis.</hi> And then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65721:10"/>
the Doctor, and he, and our Author, have been the only three, for ought I know, that have perfectly agreed in this <hi>uncouth and till of late unheard of Point;</hi> that unſettles the Foundations of the Earth, and gives liberty to every bold Uſurper to invade the Crown; at leaſt, legitimates his claim, if he be but ſucceſsful enough to place it on his own head. But Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> muſt know, that though this Aſſertion be a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſecure ones neck under an illegal and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Power; yet it can never make him a faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his natural and lawful Prince. For it robs him of the Title which he has by Inheritance, and juſtifies every thing by the Event only; it adds affliction to the Miſeries of unfortunate Kings; and flatters the proſperous Traytor as if he were the Darling and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Heaven. Before I leave this, I ſhall ask Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> but this one queſtion: What is the Reaſon, if he ſubmits to his Majeſty's Authority becauſe of an <hi>Extraordinary Providence,</hi> that he does not yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Power upon the ſame account? For that may plead an <hi>Extraordinary Providence</hi> too, in that it was re-eſtabliſhed in ſpight of the greateſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, when many were violently bent againſt that, who ſeemed contented with his Majeſty's return. I eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſee what he will anſwer; That the Poſition muſt be reſtrained to the <hi>Political Government;</hi> and that it will do miſchief enough there; but that he is able to find many Pretences to diſturb the Church, without the help of this Engine. It may be ſo; but yet I think ſtill the demand will not be impertinent. And if he will maintain that it muſt be allowed in <hi>Civil,</hi> I will undertake to prove, by as good Arguments as his, that it muſt be of as much force in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Affairs. But let him go for a wonderful Stateſman, as he is.</p>
            <p>Another thing for which he commends the Doctor,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65721:11"/>
is his <hi>great ſtability and ſteadineſs in the Truth:</hi> And to give him his due, I have often heard that he was the only Man in <hi>England,</hi> almoſt, that remained conſtant to his firſt Principles, when moſt of the reſt were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently warping another way. Then a little after he goes on in the ſame Character of him ſtill; <hi>I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he valued one Truth of Christ above all the Wealth of both the Indies.</hi> 'Tis well he was never tempted for all that. <hi>One Truth?</hi> What <hi>One Truth</hi> was that I pray, which the Doctor eſteemed ſo highly? Was it that concerning Diſcipline and Church Government? If it were; then I believe Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> is as well fixed as he. For he will ſooner tell a great many notorious Falſhoods, and print them too, than ever be ſo baſe as to betray that <hi>One Truth.</hi> O no, by no means. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Muſick, nor Furnace, Flatteries nor Threats:</hi> But yet, I think, the laſt may do, when nothing elſe will; for we have known by Experience, for all his hufling, that ſome things are able at leaſt to affright him from <hi>the Truth.</hi> But the Doctor <hi>was not a ſilken Diotrephes, that would debauch his Conſcience for a Preferment.</hi> 'Tis like enough: but what then? is there any body elſe that does ſo? Yes, I'll warrant you, amongſt theſe Conformiſts: he can tell—But you muſt excuſe him; 'tis a ſubtle Man; he does not uſe to ſpeak all he knows. But ſome ſuch thing muſt be imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe this Elogium here were very childiſh, and cold, and too far from the temper of him that made it; and Mr. <hi>Jenkyn,</hi> I'm ſure, is a better Rhetorician than ſo, ever to think to commend the Doctor for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of that, which no body in the World is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. But what if I ſhould prove now that this <hi>ſilken Diotrephes</hi> was a Non-Conformiſt? This were a moſt ſcurvy thing indeed, and would quite ſpoil Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi>'s conceit. And yet I muſt needs ſay, that by all that I can find
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65721:11"/>
of him, he may be judged to be ſuch a one, and in ſome things juſt like Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> himſelf. For he was not one that by right had, but only that <hi>loved,</hi> deſired, and affected to have, or, it may be, one that in the abſence of his lawful Superior, actually uſurped the <hi>Preeminence.</hi> He was one that ſcornfully rejected the Injunctions that the Apoſtle ſent in writing to the Church, and was ſo far from ſubmitting to them, that he preſumed to Excommunicate thoſe that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated by his Authority. And that he might be complete, he was one that ruled his Tongue too, like ſome body elſe, and that muſt be always <hi>prating againſt</hi> his betters <hi>with malicious words.</hi> And S. <hi>John,</hi> the moſt loving and compaſſionate ſpirit in the World, was a little moved with this <hi>malapart and ſaucy</hi> carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and threatens to remember him for it, if he did come in his Viſitation into thoſe parts. And I hope he might be reclaimed by theſe Threats. If he were as like Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> in this, as he was in ſome other things, he would certainly recant, petition, or any thing, before he would feel the ſmart of the Rod, eſpecially if there were any Axes near it. But whatever became of him, I think it pretty clear that this <hi>ſilken Diotrephes</hi> was not a Biſhop, as, I doubt me, Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> holds; but one that deny'd the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Power. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Doctor was a <hi>ſilken Diotrephes. Q. E. D.</hi> Well, if there be no remedy for it, let it be ſo; but here's above half the Jeſt abſolutely ruined by the ſhift. What ſhall we do now? Why then, though it ſhould be confeſſed that he were a <hi>ſilken Diotrephes,</hi> yet he was not one of that ſort, <hi>that would debauch his Conſcience for a Preferment.</hi> No ſure. And indeed I have not heard that ever he had a Biſhoprick offered him, to try it, whether he would or no. And for Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> too, if he will but promiſe for the future, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65721:12"/>
he will never more do it by Preaching, and Printing of falſe and ſlanderous things, which he cannot pretend to prove, I dare almoſt paſs my word for him, that he ſhall never have his <hi>Conſcience debauched with a Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is but one thing more in his Panegyrick of the Doctor, which I ſhall take notice of, and that is, that he ſays that he <hi>did both fluently, and yet rationally</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 57.</note> 
               <hi>deliver his Notions, without the leaſt impedition or heſitation.</hi> Here I believe he is almoſt ſingular in his opinion concerning the Doctor. What? <hi>Without the leaſt impedition or heſitation?</hi> That's a mighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But what ſhould be the Reaſon then, that when he had the liberty to preach in a Church, his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was uſually ſo very thin, as I have heard it was? Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> knows by his own Experience, that a Man that has not one quarter of the Parts and Learning, that he ſays the Doctor had, yet, if he can but ſpeak <hi>fluently,</hi> 'tis no matter whether it be <hi>rationally,</hi> or no, and deliver his Notions <hi>without the leaſt impedition or heſitation,</hi> though he be otherwiſe as <hi>empty and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed a Predicant,</hi> as any Conformiſt can be, yet the place where he preaches ſhall ſcarce fail to be crowded, eſpecially if it be a <hi>Funeral Sermon</hi> for a great Doctor, then they will be clambring up at the very Windows, and juſtling one another, and all that they may hear the brave Man that ſpeaks, any thing, he cares not what, <hi>without the leaſt impedition or heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This he knows well enough; and then what was the matter, I ſay, that the Doctor was wont heretofore to have ſuch a ſlender Auditory? Why the Reaſon was, that what Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> affirms of him in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, at leaſt, is almoſt as falſe as any of thoſe black Forgeries he has made of us. This every one that has ever heard the Doctor knows to be true. And I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65721:12"/>
with what brow the Man was able to talk at this rate, amongſt thoſe that were acquainted with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors natural imperfection well enough. But you may ſee by this how far you may truſt this eloquent <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miaſter.</hi> But he that is ſo Eagle-ey'd at diſcovering of Excellencies, and Faults too, where there are none; is able, no doubt, if he pleaſes, to outſtare the Sun. I have not been forward to pick holes in the Doctor's <hi>Mantle (that I mean of his ſweet memorial)</hi> but this I muſt be forced to confeſs, that when he ſupplyed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 50.</note> the place of a Maſter of a College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> his great abilities in all kinds were not ſo well diſcovered there; but I will not diſparage my ſelf ſo far as to ſay, that Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi>'s ſingle opinion, may not outweigh the judgment of a whole Univerſity. Therefore I ſhall not queſtion his Panegyrick any farther.</p>
            <p>I come now to conſider the other part of his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Invective that he occaſionally makes againſt us. And though I have been much ſurpriſed that ſo great an Artiſt, as this is, could not ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Perſon of ſuch known Abilities, as he ſays the Doctor was, without rifling the very Oyſter-Boats, and Duſt-Carts for the chief Flowers of his Rhetorick; yet I ſhould not have been ſo much concerned, if he had done it in any kind of handſome way. But he aſſaults us in ſuch a clowniſh and lubberly faſhion; that I can reſemble him to nothing better than ſome haſty Country Fellow, in Leather Breeches, that ſnatches up his Flail in a mighty rage, and flyes amongſt us, and threſhes us moſt unmercifully, without either fear or wit; as the Proverb is. It may be he may complain, that I play with him ſometimes, and I acknowledge I do. And I cannot imagine when he printed this Sermon; that he could expect any thing elſe, but only to be laughed at. I knew Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi>'s Talent too well
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65721:13"/>
ever to hope to compare with him at downright Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if I could have allowed my ſelf in it. And there is no way in the World to be ſerious with him; though, if it could have been, I ſhould have liked it far better than this kind of trifling, that I am now conſtrained to uſe ſometimes, contrary to my own Temper and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in moſt caſes. But in this it could not always be avoided. It was neceſſary that ſo much ſcorn and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, and ſo many Slanders and Calumnies, as this man loads us withall, ſhould not be paſſed over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any notice. And if I had gone about gravely to prove that we were not <hi>a company of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhould have made my ſelf almoſt as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as He. It would have given too much repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his Rudeneſs; as if it could be thought that any ſober Man did believe him, when he ſputters, and raves, and foams at mouth in ſuch a manner, that 'tis hard to gueſs what the matter ſhould be. And if after all his Provocations, I can ſtill make my ſelf merry with him, without running into choler, as he does, I think I am not much to be blamed. I have frequent occaſion to ſpeak a little Ironically of him; and truly I judge there was never more cauſe to uſe that ſcheme of ſpeech, than when I ſee Mr. <hi>Jenkyns</hi> moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and Gigantick conceit of himſelf, marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a moſt ſtately and majeſtick gate; and the pretty little puling <hi>inſufficiency of his Dwarfiſh Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> tripping lightly away before it; like one of the Great <hi>Mogols Dwarfs</hi> leading an Elephant along in Triumph. If I ſeem at any time to ſlight him too much, it has been his own moſt unſufferable contempt, and unworthy vilifying of others, that has given the occaſion.</p>
            <p>But it is time to come up nearer to this mighty Man, and to ſee what it is that he charges us with. And the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65721:13"/>
firſt thing is where he thus ſpeaks; <hi>Though the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 53.</note> 
               <hi>of Caſuitical Divines be as great as their rarity, both for the directing, and eaſing of Conſcience, a thing little regarded in theſe days of Latitudinarianiſm.</hi> And as ſoon as ever he had got out that, he ſtarts back, and makes a moſt lamentable outcry, as if the Town were on fire, <hi>O uncouth, and till of late unheard of word! (how it ſounds!) horrid to the ears of (Pious) Grammarians.</hi> I wonder what's the matter with the Man: would any one ever think that Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> ſhould be ſo grievouſly frighted with one ill favoured word? If he be, I muſt tell him that Lying, and Slandering, and the baſeſt detraction in the mouth of one that would be thought a great Divine, is more <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncouth,</hi> and <hi>ſounds</hi> worſe, and more <hi>horrid to the ears of Pious Grammarians,</hi> than the harſheſt and moſt untunable word that he can invent; though I muſt needs allow him to be every way a great Maſter of bad Language. But yet what ſhould be the meaning of this moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble word, that was like to put this <hi>profound Caſuiſt</hi> beſide himſelf? Indeed, to ſpeak the truth, I cannot tell; and I believe he knows as well as I: only he thought it <hi>ſounded</hi> ill, and might therefore be for his purpoſe, and ſo away he runs with it, and coffers it up amongſt his other choice Expreſſions; and when he had a mind to diſplay all the glory of his Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, out he brings it with a great many very patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Exclamations; <hi>O uncouth, &amp;c.</hi> You know what an ordinary Artifice it has been in the World, to find or to make ſome odious Names, and then to fix them where they pleaſe: and ſo the generality of Men, who are very ſuſpicious, and judge of things only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame, are ſtrongly inclined to imagine, that there is ſome moſt grievous <hi>Hereſie</hi> or other lurking under every one of theſe ugly words. And this is the trick that this Gentleman plays us here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65721:14"/>
There has been a great deal of talk of late years of a certain ſort of Men which they call <hi>Latitudinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> But I could never yet learn who they are, or what they hold, or where they dwell. After ſo much prattle as has been about them, I am as unreſolved in all theſe points, as Geographers are in determining the Country of the <hi>Pygmies,</hi> or <hi>Amazons;</hi> and, it may be, it is becauſe that indeed there are no ſuch People; notwithſtanding all the noiſe, and the many pretty ſtories that have paſſed concerning them. It has been generally fabled, that they are Men that can ſtretch their Conſciences any way, and that are ready to comply with whatſoever is Uppermoſt; juſt according to Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi>'s own Principle of <hi>Extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> I think I can remember where, and when this odd Name was firſt invented; and, if I miſtake not, it was in one of the Univerſities of this Land, ſomething before his Majeſty's moſt happy Return. And I am ſure that they that then were branded with it, were looked upon as no Friends to the Uſurpers Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either in Church or State; and if they undertook the Miniſtry they were always Epiſcopally ordained; which was no great Complyance with that which was Uppermoſt in thoſe days. And thoſe Perſons who are ſtill traduced under the ſame Notion by ſome impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, paſſionate, heady Men, are known to have a moſt hearty affection for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and they do pray and endeavour for the proſperity of it; they have a high eſteem for the Ancient Fathers, and are often reading their Writings; they have a juſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for the Authority of General Councils; though, that they may perfectly agree with the Church, <note place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> they do not hold that they cannot erre. And they being thus conformable both to the Diſcipline and Doctrine profeſſed amongſt us, there is no Reaſon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65721:14"/>
imaginable why they ſhould be ſcandalized as they are; unleſs it be that ſome Men have no way to make themſelves ſeem conſiderable, but by their moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy detracting from others. But there are Names enough of Diviſion already, and it is but an ill Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to be forging of more. I wiſh therefore that hereafter we may not hear of this ſo often as we have done: for it is but an empty ſound, and ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and it can be of no other uſe, but only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get an ill opinion of ſome Church-men, that are far enough from ſuch a <hi>Latitude,</hi> as they have been moſt unjuſtly accuſed of.</p>
            <p>But I have ſtepped a little out of my way; I return to Mr. <hi>Jenkyn;</hi> and let us ſee what he underſtands by this fearful Bugbear of <hi>Latitudinarianiſm;</hi> his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very much to be valued in the caſe. And he cunningly ſuggeſts that it is a thing <hi>Giving too much eaſe to Practice, and too little to Pronunciation.</hi> And <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 53.</note> for this laſt I am not much troubled, I could wiſh it had ſtuck in his throat, and that he had never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it at all. But that it ſhould give <hi>too much eaſe to Practice.</hi> This were a great fault, indeed, if he could prove it to be true. Alas! you muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that from him; it is not his cuſtom. If you pleaſe to believe him, you may; but if you will examine any farther, and deſire to have any thing made appear, 'tis unkindly done of you, you ſtop his mouth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; and the fluent Man is as mute as a Fiſh. For can he tell who they are that maintain ſuch looſe and licentious Principles, that give <hi>too much eaſe to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice?</hi> or is there any credible Evidence and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that there are any ſuch? No: it is not yet proved. Why then does he talk ſo very confidently, as if it were ſo? Why, if you mark it, it is a moſt curious kind of ſentence, and makes a delicate noiſe, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65721:15"/>
jingles mighty finely; and therefore 'twas great pity to leave that out which was like to be ſuch an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the whole Diſcourſe. And what an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing is it for any Man to expect that all Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi>'s pretty ſayings ſhould be true? But to return to this terrible word once more. If it imports any ſuch thing as he intimates, let him ſhew us who are guilty of it. As for thoſe perſons he ſeems to aim at, it is their charitable diſpoſition, and favourable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the <hi>Latitude</hi> they give to others, and not to themſelves that has occaſioned all this clamour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy againſt them. And he himſelf is the greateſt <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian</hi> in his own ſenſe that I know; for whatever he does, you ſee he ſpeaks ſo very broadly, that he may be juſtly entitled to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncouth</hi> Name, which is ſo <hi>horrid to the ears of Pious Grammarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another place he breaks out into a kind of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical flouriſh (as you may obſerve he is good at it) and cryes out, <hi>What a company of uncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts do we now behold, venting as confidently their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 55.</note> 
               <hi>heretical Notions, &amp;c.</hi> What need is there of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Exclamations? If he knows any ſuch Men as he deſcribes, why does he not tell us plainly what a company of them there is, without asking the People ſuch malicious Queſtions; as if they did ſwarm ſo, that he was not able to expreſs what huge multitudes of them there were? But let us not urge him too far here, where he's able to give noreaſonable anſwer, but examine the Character he makes of them. He tells us then firſt that they are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncateohiſed.</hi> As ſure as can be this <hi>vigilant OVERSEER</hi> has kept Men on purpoſe to watch us, when we went to School with our Satchels at our backs; and they have informed him, that we never learned our <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> He is a Man of a moſt prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious foreſight, and yet he is miſtaken; for we have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65721:15"/>
learned it, and amongſt other good things, we have been taught, <hi>to keep our hands from picking and ſtealing, and our tongues from evil ſpeaking, lying, and ſlandering:</hi> And if he could be perſwaded <hi>to be degraded to a School-boy,</hi> as he deſerves, <hi>and to ſit at our feet to reap the bleſſing of our heads,</hi> I would adviſe him to con that Leſſon a little better than he has done; and let not his ill-will to the Common-Prayer make him utterly forget his <hi>Duty towards his Neighbour.</hi> But he calls us <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts</hi> too. And we have reaſon to take this a little ill. For we Conformiſts uſe to ſtand much upon our Gentility, and think our ſelves to be of a very Ancient and Honourable Family; and that we are able, upon occaſion, to derive our Pedigree as far as the Primitive and Apoſtolical times: and let him do ſo much, if he can, for thoſe who deny that the Church hath any Authority to make <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> for the more orderly Government of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Members of it.</p>
            <p>But theſe are but light matters, the ordinary terms of the Courtſhip he uſes, and ſerve only to uſher in the blackeſt and moſt unconſcionable Accuſation of all, and that is that he <hi>beholds us venting very confidently our heretical Notions in oppoſition to our famous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Divines; Jewell, Whitaker, Davenant, Downham, Renolds, Abbot, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, &amp;c.</hi> Men for whom we have as great a reverence, as he can pretend. But does he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that this is a thing ſo lightly to be paſſed over? Can he inform us what heretical Notions theſe are which he complains are ſo <hi>confidently vented?</hi> Can he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us who the perſons be, that are ſo bold to maintain them? Can he tell us when and where they have been deliver'd? Is he able to make any tolerable Reply to theſe Demands? If he be, let him ſpeak the truth; we do not deſire any favour at his hands: if he be not, let
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65721:16"/>
him make us ſatisfaction, and tell the World openly, and in Print, that it was but an impudent Calumny, and nothing elſe but the overflowing of his Choler, and a fit of blind and ungovernable Zeal. Does he know what a foul Crime that of Hereſie is, and what ſevere Puniſhments ſome Statutes ſtill in force, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon it? Can he be ignorant of the opinion of ſome of the firſt Reformers, who agree with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this, and make it no leſs than a Capital Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? And had he no other device to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Clergy odious; no other expedient to fright the People from the Church, and make them flock to his Meeting-Houſe, but only by inſinuating ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable jealouſies into their heads? Theſe things might ſerve to gratifie the ruder ſort, who delight in groſs and reviling language; but I am confident the more civil and judicious of his own Hearers were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at him. And all his Party have Reaſon to be angry; for when he aſſaults us with nothing elſe but ſlanderous Reports, which he has pick'd up, I know not where, he does in a manner confeſs, that their cauſe is not to be defended, but by the help of ſuch baſe and diſhoneſt Arts. But I have ſaid ſomething before to excuſe us from this pretended Charge of Hereſie.</p>
            <p>He goes on in his uſual ſtrain; <hi>Yea as if to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>ſubverſion had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when ſubſcription was performed:</hi> This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his pretty ſtarched ſentences, and if there be any meaning in it, it muſt be this; That the <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> do ſubſcribe to the Nine and thirty Articles, and yet deny, ſome of them at leaſt, to be true. But what then? Did Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> never ſubſcribe himſelf? And have no others of the preſent Diſſenters done it? and yet they do not think themſelves obliged by this to a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65721:16"/>
perfect agreement with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all particulars. And why ſhould they not grant us the ſame Liberty which they claim themſelves? Or, if they be not, why ſhould we be bound up by theſe ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? I might argue thus with him; but there is no need of ſuch a Plea in our preſent caſe. For we do not <hi>ſubvert,</hi> we do not deny any part of the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but are ready to maintain it, againſt all Oppoſers, whatever this confident Man talk to the contrary. His ſuggeſtion here is as true as his former concerning <hi>Heretical Notions.</hi> But it is to be admired what has made this Gentleman, and ſome others, ſuch mighty Friends to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> all of a ſudden. They will not ſubmit to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but they tell us they like the Doctrine of it very well; and therefore would perſwade us that <hi>they</hi> are the true Sons of the <hi>Church.</hi> As if they ſhould tell his Majeſty that they take him to be a very Orthodox Prince, and that they are generally of his opinion, and therefore are the beſt Subjects in all his Dominions; only they cannot obſerve the Laws that he has enacted, nor be obedient to his Government by any means.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds: <hi>Nay, as if the Scripture it ſelf were to be hectored down.</hi> This is I ſuppoſe when we take the boldneſs ſometimes to interpret any paſſage contrary to his infallible judgment. But I think that to ſwagger, and rail, and revile our Brethren, without any cauſe, as he does, is a greater affront to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more like <hi>Hectoring,</hi> than to take a modeſt liberty of diſſenting from him in ſome diſputable Points. But however he implies that we do this, <hi>by our malapert and ſaucy Ignorance.</hi> Why ſo? Had we done like ſome of late, told the <hi>Parliament</hi> they had wronged us, and demanded ſatisfaction; had we wrote a <hi>Peaceable Deſign</hi> to ſhew that it may be lawful, in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65721:17"/>
ſome caſes, to take up Arms againſt the King; this had been <hi>malapart, and ſaucy</hi> indeed, and it may be <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> too: which is the next good word that he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly beſtows upon us. I could wiſh that this very knowing Man had been pleaſed rather to have taken a little pains to have inſtructed us, than only to have reproached us with our <hi>Ignorance.</hi> But ſince ſo much condeſcenſion cannot be expected; however we thank him, he has acquainted us with one thing, which he may think very conſiderable, and that is, that now the moſt <hi>ignorant</hi> of us all knows Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> a great deal better than he knows himſelf.</p>
            <p>But he goes on ſtill: <hi>Nor do I with ſo much (holy I hope) Indignation mention, &amp;c.</hi> This is ſtrange, and ſurpriſing: After he had expreſſed as much bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt us as well he was able, he thinks to excuſe all by <hi>hoping</hi> it may be a <hi>holy Indignation.</hi> No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he complains of our want of Caſuiſtical Divinity; for there is none of us that can juſtifie a Man's doing a thing before he be fully reſolved and ſatisfied in his Conſcience, whether it be Good and <hi>Holy,</hi> or no. But it ſeems he is ſo skilful, that he can: I ſuppoſe he had conſulted Father <hi>Eſcobar</hi> in the Caſe. But this fit he is in, <hi>Indignation</hi> it is, that's confeſſed; whether it be <hi>Holy,</hi> there's the Queſtion. But till he has brought better proof of his Charge, it will be eſteemed by all impartial Men not a <hi>holy Indignation,</hi> but a moſt rude, churliſh, and unmannerly Paſſion.</p>
            <p>After this he terms us very wittily, <hi>This young brood of Theologues:</hi> I marvel at my heart where it was hatched? in ſome very ill place, I dare ſay; if he can tell where it was: <hi>I hope</hi> too, that he will be ſo civil as not to ſpeak out the worſt he may think.</p>
            <p>Then adding a word of the Doctor's <hi>Scholaſtical abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> he falls immediately into another of his Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65721:17"/>
               <hi>(Oh what poor Shrubs are theſe to this (till death fell'd him) lofty Cedar!) Poor Shrubs;</hi> there's the jeſt. I am grievouſly afraid now, leſt this fiery Man ſhould clap on his hedging Mittons, and catch up his Bill, and in his fury cut down all this unhappy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, that harbours nothing but a company of wild <hi>Notions,</hi> and faggot it up, and away with it to <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and there ſet the Torch to it himſelf, and when 'tis burnt, ſcatter the Aſhes, in his <hi>(holy he hopes) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,</hi> into the <hi>Thames:</hi> And ſo there is an end of all theſe <hi>poor Heretical Shrubs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well: but, as bad as it is, <hi>he congratulates the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this Age, in enjoying the excellent Labours (thoſe poyſon-expelling Antidotes) of Mr.</hi> Polhil <hi>and</hi> Antiſozzo, <hi>the Antagoniſt to the latter of which pair of worthy Writers, I muſt needs commend,</hi> ſays he, and that's a wonder; but there comes an exception by and by; <hi>though not for his Learning, yet for his Prudence;</hi> and I wiſh this Man could be commended for ſo much as that; but how has that other ſhewed himſelf ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prudent that he cannot chuſe but ſtroak him upon the head for it? Why thus; <hi>Who paſſeth over,</hi> as he tells you, <hi>with a childiſh ſcoff, inſtead of a Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Confutation, a Book that he is no more able ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to anſwer, than to eat the Paper of the whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 46.</note> I am not concerned at that. And for Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi>'s part too, though I know not whether he has ever been ſuch a mighty Book-worm in his time, yet I believe he will ſwallow a great deal of <hi>Paper</hi> himſelf, before he will <hi>rationally</hi> excuſe all thoſe falſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous things which he has publiſhed towards the end of this one Sermon. But why does he talk of <hi>paſſing over the Book with a childiſh ſcoff?</hi> I conceive the paſſage he intends is this; <hi>But as for</hi> Antiſozzo, <hi>I had no mind to play the Buffoon, as he does, and I know</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65721:18"/>
               <hi>no other way of anſwering him;</hi> and again in the very laſt words of the Diſcourſe; <hi>But others may do as they pleaſe, as for my part I am reſolved this Controverſie ſhall never end in a tryal of Wit.</hi> Now if this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſozzo</hi> be ſuch an Author, as he is repreſented to be, that drolls with every thing, then this was no <hi>childiſh ſcoff,</hi> but a very ſerious manly ſaying; for there is a reverence always due to ſacred things; and grave mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be gravely ſpoken. But as for ſuch a Subject as Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> has made himſelf, it ought to be handled in another manner.</p>
            <p>But he goes on again: <hi>But for the preſent I diſmiſs the Trifler, he may poſſibly be call'd for again hereafter in another way, if better Employment hinder not.</hi> This is very lofty and ſupercilious, and ſeems to have ſomething of threatning in it. I doubt, by what I can gather, that he intends to write againſt this <hi>young Theologue</hi> himſelf. Ah! cruel Man! Does he not ſee what a company he has about his ears already? and how ſtoutly they do belabour his Coat with <hi>many knocks and ſtroaks and blows?</hi> And one of them is ſuch a doughty Adverſary, that he dares not ſo much as lift up a Finger, or mutter the leaſt word; if he does, ſowce, he has him in the Chops immediately? Does he not ſee, I ſay, how terribly he is handled amongſt them, and yet will this mighty Champion fall upon him too? This is moſt barbarous, and inhumane; it pities me to think on't. Pray, Sir, if you have any acquaintance with the poor Gentleman, pleaſe to give him notice of the danger. The Clouds are gathering, and Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> begins to bluſter, and there is a moſt horrible Storm a coming: bid him get into ſhelter ſomewhere as ſoon as he can. But hold; upon ſecond thoughts, I believe he need not be ſo very much afraid: this is not ſuch a grievous formidable Man as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65721:18"/>
he would make himſelf: if any one will be confuted by being called <hi>Malapert, ſancy, Ignorent, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncatechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtart;</hi> or the like: there is none I know better able to do it, than he: But you may gueſs him to be a Coward by his big words. He does not care for a cloſe fight; his beſt weapon is an ill tongue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his moſt incomparable gift of ſcolding, he ſeems otherwiſe to be but meanly furniſhed for a <hi>Polemical</hi> Divine. And after all I dare warrant you almoſt that he will find out ſome <hi>better Employment</hi> to be excuſed from this Encounter. But if it ſhould chance at laſt to come to a quarrel, 'twill be beſt to leave him and the <hi>Trifler</hi> together, to try it out: for my part I reſolve not to venter <hi>many knocks, and ſtroaks, and blows,</hi> by ſtepping in to part the fray.</p>
            <p>After he had thus inſulted, and ſhook his wand over his Antagoniſt, that may be, he proceeds a while in his commendation of the Doctor, and amongſt other things he informs us that, <hi>He was one that could draw out of his richly ſtored ſelf, whatever was needful to draw out to others.</hi> And then, becauſe he can ſeldom praiſe him ſufficiently without ſome unhappy compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſet him off, he adds; <hi>How unlike in this reſpect</hi> (and ſome others that I can tell of) <hi>to thoſe empty and unaccompliſhed Predicants, who preach the Sermons of their Non-conforming Predeceſſors.</hi> And theſe that do ſo, they are <hi>empty Predicants,</hi> as he tells you: And this, I confeſs, is none of his faults; for he is very full, and abounds with matter, ſuch as it is, and, which you would little think, with Reaſons too; for he has no leſs than ſeven together to prove that Prophets or Miniſters muſt dye: but he has not one to confirm any of thoſe foul Aſperſions which he caſts upon us; and yet moſt Men are of opinion that this was a thing that ſtood in need of a proof as much as that. But thus
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65721:19"/>
it is for a Man to be prodigal of a ſmall ſtock; he ſhall be ſure to want, when he has the greateſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>But, if you will believe him, theſe are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,</hi> as well as <hi>Empty Predicants.</hi> And this gives me the faireſt opportunity that may be to enquire a little into the moſt mighty <hi>Accompliſhments</hi> of this great Man, that make him deſpiſe us all at ſuch a rate. And of theſe, you may judge, he has very many: I ſhall give you a taſte of a few of them. And one is a great knack he has gotten of fine quibling ſentences, ſuch as you ſhall rarely meet with in <hi>Tully</hi> or <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> or any good Orator; but in this Author very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and they look moſt wondrous featly; ſome of them you have had already; and I ſhall bring three or four Examples more. As, How can you and I deny <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.</note> a ſhort endeavour ſeverally to bear our parts in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whereſore was that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 6.</note> wherefore put down. The unkind world ſtorms them, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 37.</note> do not you ſtarve them. Every Saint loves company to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 45.</note> Glory, he loves to be ſaved ſurely, but not ſolitarily. To loſe ſuch a Doctor, is to loſe, if not your ſight, yet <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 54.</note> your Seer. Here are ſome, and many more ſuch Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances as theſe might be eaſily found, if it were worth the while to be picking of ſtraws. But theſe are <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments</hi> that a Man of ordinary <hi>Conforming</hi> Parts muſt never hope to arrive unto; and truly I admire how this Gentleman retains them ſo freſh, now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to grow old: but you may perceive by him that his Fancy is as ſtrong and youthful, and unmanageable ſtill, as if he were but newly come from School.</p>
            <p>Another Accompliſhment, which is worth your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, is his making uſe of the ſame conceits ſeveral times within the compaſs of a few leaves. One there is amongſt the reſt that betrays it ſelf, like the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65721:19"/>
Senator, by the very ſcent. <hi>God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will break</hi>

               <hi>breathes forth even after, yea, by the breaking the little Boxes of their bodies.</hi> Not much after he has ſuch another kind of ſimilitude; <hi>Service is that that makes us live when we are dead; and makes the places where</hi>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 44.</note> 
               <hi>we lived, like the Civet-box when the Civet is taken out of it, to ſavour of our holy Endeavours, when we our ſelves are gone from and out of them.</hi> And once more about the beginning of his commendation of the Doctor, ſpeaking of <hi>the Mantle of his ſweet memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 50.</note> 
               <hi>and that,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſo richly perfumed, that it muſt a little, though but a little while, perfume the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit where now I ſtand, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo you ſee that he pulls out his Civet-Boxes and ſuch things, ſo very often, that a Man would imagine he intended by this to preſerve his People from the infection of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be the raging Diſeaſe of the Times. And he ſeems ſo mightily delighted with <hi>Ointments</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,</hi> that I wonder how he could endure the ſmell of very many of his own Expreſſions. But ſtill it might have been expected, that one of ſuch a large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, as he has approved himſelf to be, in his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions concerning us, ſhould not have brought in the ſame, or very like things, three or four times in one Sermon. But 'tis an <hi>Accompliſhment,</hi> it ſeems, that he has.</p>
            <p>I ſhall trouble you but with one more, and that is his moſt excellent Faculty of ſticking a <hi>Parentheſis</hi> into a ſentence, which I have given you one Inſtance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but he has a very great abundance of them. In one place he gives the Pope a notable rub, and makes <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 30.</note>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65721:20"/>
ſhrewd Remarks upon the whole Catalogue of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> and all this within a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> or two; which would have coſt another Man many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes. Another time he writes Doctor <hi>Whataker</hi>'s life <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 34.</note> pretty particularly, and moſt of it is in one compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive <hi>Parentheſis</hi> again. At another place he has a Character of Biſhop <hi>Brownrig,</hi> a witty ſaying of his about <hi>Dubbing of Doctors,</hi> an Apology for ſome that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 52.</note> had taken that Degree by Mandate, and ſome other obſervables incloſed ſtill within a <hi>Parentheſis.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he has I know not how many little young ſucking ones, crept into the belly of one huge old over grown <hi>Parentheſis:</hi> And they make the poor thing ſtrut out ſo, that it looks like a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gennet that is big with Foal, by the Wind. And there is one of theſe which, I think, it had been more prudence to have left out; it has given occaſion of enquiry into ſome things, where all the skill he has, and a little more, will ſcarce bring him off with a clear reputation. It is where he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>That ſweet name and man of affection</hi> Love, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 39.</note> 
               <hi>whoſe great love to me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was matched with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than my fidelity to him;</hi> and then comes in the daring <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> wadling along with another or two in its Womb <hi>(and I would kiſs even the feet (though elſe I perfectly deſpiſe the tongue) of Calumny, would they be, which yet they never durſt be, the bearers to me of the leaſt proof to the contrary.)</hi> You may ſee that he talks here, as if he were in a maze, and almoſt bewildered in his own thoughts. But certainly this <hi>Calumny</hi> is a thing for which the Man has a very ſtrange reſpect; for you know he is not wont to uſe ſo much courtſhip with other Folks. And, for ought I ſee, he muſt be contented <hi>to kiſs even the feet of</hi> this dear Friend of his. For I have been told by ſome, that they cannot eſteem it any great fidelity to <hi>that</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65721:20"/>
               <hi>ſweet name and man of affection,</hi> not to have acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, in due time, That <hi>upon earneſt ſeeking of God, and diligently enquiring into his Will, he was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the alterations of Civil Government are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by, and founded upon the wiſe and righteous Providence of God, who removeth Kings, and ſetteth up Rulers for the Kingdoms of Men, and giveth them to whomſoever he will;</hi> but notwithſtanding theſe great diſcoveries, to let him dye in ſuch a Cauſe, and <hi>ſuch an oppoſing of the Government ſet up by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord of Heaven and Earth, as none could have peace, either in acting or ſuffering for;</hi> as the <hi>Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> own expreſſions are. He muſt therefore either ſhew this concealing of his opinion to be <hi>fidelity;</hi> or elſe <hi>kiſs even the feet of Calumny,</hi> which he ſeems as ready to do, as any Man whatſoever. But by this his ordinary way of a moſt tedious <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> if I had no other arguments for it, I ſhould gueſs Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> to be a Man of ſomething a warm and unſettled head: he does ſo often ſtart, and ſo eagerly purſue ſo many conceits, ſo very little or nothing to the purpoſe; which is another moſt rare <hi>Accompliſhment,</hi> for which we do not envy him at all. But theſe <hi>empty and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Predicants,</hi> who muſt never think to attain to thoſe wonderful perfections, which he has been a great while Maſter of, they do moſt feloniouſly <hi>preach the Sermons of their Non-Conforming Predeceſſors.</hi> And I wiſh heartily they could be perſwaded to preach none elſe; for then ſure we ſhould not be peſtered with any more of their <hi>Heretical Notions.</hi> But alack aday! 'tis a hard caſe, that he ſhould tell them of this. He knew well enough, I ſuppoſe, that they were able to make no Sermons of their own, eſpecially ſuch as his are: No, ſcarce though they ſhould beat out that little brain that they have. And what ſhould they do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65721:21"/>
then? but like other <hi>Hectoring</hi> blades, go a padding upon the High-way; and when they are come to a convenient ſtand, out with the Proſpective-glaſs, and as ſoon as they ken one of their <hi>Non-Conforming Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> jogging along in the bottom, they put Spurs to their Horſes, and up they come with him, and when they have coaſted about him once or twice, and take him to be a Prize, they clap a Piſtol to his breaſt, and bid him deliver, or he's a dead Man. Come, come, Sir, never parley for the matter. 'Tis Sermons we want, and Sermons we know you have good ſtore. Come, come, Sir, quickly. Upon the preſent terrour, which was enough to have made the ſtout Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> to have yielded, the good Man alights with a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, and as ſoon as he is down, theſe deſperate Fellows ſlip his Bridle, and cut his Girts, and whip off the Portmantle, and away they ride with it; and 'tis not unlikely but ſome body may know at what Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe it was they divided this moſt rich booty that fell thus unluckily into their hands. The Robbery might be committed betwixt Sun and Sun, but I fear the whole Hundred will never be able to repair the loſs. But who ſhould this be, I wonder, to whom this great misfortune happened? I do begin to ſuſpect that it was e'en Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> himſelf, and that by an ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb that he hath hedged in with the Notes of a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis; <hi>(though loſers may have leave to ſpeak)</hi> it ſhould ſeem then that he that ſpoke this, was the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. And if it were ſo, I admire no longer at the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive paſſion he is in: ſuch an unhappineſs as this is not to be endured by a Man of an ordinary patience. And I am half afraid theſe waggiſh Cutters might ſtrap him over the ſhoulders too, or offer him ſome other great indignity, he ſeems to be ſo very highly diſpleaſed. But what if there never were any ſuch Aſſault upon his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65721:21"/>
perſon, as is pretended; but only that ſome of theſe <hi>empty, and unaccompliſhed Predicants</hi> had been dab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ſame Authors, and had chanced to make ſome of the very ſame Obſervations that he had done before? For I have heard that there is a certain Man, who, meeting with an old <hi>Conforming Predeceſſor</hi> of his that had written upon <hi>Peter,</hi> has taken the boldneſs to cull out ſome of the fineſt Slips, and Flowers he could find in him, and has moſt dextrouſly tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into that which he calls his own Expoſition upon <hi>Jude.</hi> As for Example,</p>

            <p>You may ſee by this taſte how much this Gentleman is obliged to his Neighbours for very many of his quaint ſayings. Sometimes he tranſcribes them word for word, ſometimes with very little alteration; but he is ſure never to miſs of the Conceit. You muſt not think that I have read over and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both the Books to make theſe Obſervations: they are ſuch as came to hand almoſt by chance. If I ſhould be more diligent, I believe I might eaſily make very large Collections of the ſame kind; but by theſe few I have given you, you may judge how fit this Man was to accuſe others for Preaching of other Mens Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: But I hope he cannot charge us for having the impudence to Print them afterwards under our own Names. But though he be as guilty as any Man of what he would fain affix upon us, yet I would defire him to name the perſons who have been taken filch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well as himſelf; and if there be no other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be inflicted, let them ſuffer the ſhame of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65721:25"/>
it, and be publickly convinced that they are as very Plagiaries as He. But I would adviſe Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> for his own credit, not to talk any more of any ones <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Printing</hi> of other Mens Works; unleſs he intends to Monopolize them all for his own uſe; and can procure a Patent for the whole Trade of Old Sermons. For what he ſpeaks concerning any that <hi>reproach the perſons of their Non-Conforming Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors;</hi> I ſuppoſe he will be ſilent in this for the time to come; for if any affront has been offered in that kind, he has now revenged himſelf to the full, and may reſt ſatisfied without any diſparagement to a Man of Honour. What he adds of our <hi>deriding repetition of Sermons</hi> is nothing elſe but another popular device to make us odious; and can deſerve no farther An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. I ſhall mention but one thing more, for which he accuſes us; and that is where he tells us, that the Doctor <hi>was induſtrious and indefatigable in his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and to make this appear ſo much the more he complains, that <hi>We are fallen into times of as much ſenſuality in practice, as of Hereticalneſs in judgement.</hi>

               <hi>Abilities, but a company of Pygmies and Dwarfs to this Eminent Servant of Chriſt, that was taller by the head and ſhoulders in Learning, and all points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity than theſe ever yet, or are like to arrive to, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they ſtudy more at home, and leſs in the Tavern?</hi> Now here, at leaſt, it is evident enough whom he drives at: But for all this, I hope there may be ſome of thoſe <hi>pittifull Novices,</hi> as he is there pleaſed to call us, that, upon occaſion, may be able to give as good <note place="margin">MS.</note> an account of their Studies as this Learned Man, though poſſibly they have not thumbed <hi>Adams upon Peter,</hi> nor made him ſo much their own, as he has done. But why does he accuſe any for ſtudying at the Tavern? I wiſh he could be prevailed with, to do it at any place, and to lay aſide his <hi>multiplyed avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and betake himſelf to his Book at laſt. And a man would judge too, by ſome expreſſions that are to be met with in thoſe Notes, I told you of, that this ſevere man was no ſuch enemy to the Tavern himſelf; for there he ſays, That <hi>God gave him</hi> (the Doctor) <hi>a rare faculty, and admirable abilities to broach with his tongue, that which he had tunn'd in his ſtudy.</hi> 'Tis <note place="margin">MS.</note> plain that theſe Metaphors were borrowed from the Cellar, and they ſhew that he underſtands a Hogshead

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion were not ſufficient to ſuggeſt Trifles enough to his roving fancy, it might be thought that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a Cup too much, when he penned this ſtrange rambling Diſcourſe. But ſtill I would deſire to know in particular, who they are that uſe to make ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tedious <hi>mornings-draughts:</hi> I believe he will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and the <hi>Hereticks</hi> together.</p>
            <p>It is not improbable but that amongſt eight or ten thouſand men or more, an envious eye may be able to diſcern ſome few perſons whoſe lives may not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo blameleſs, as I wiſh they were. And if every City and Town in the Nation were furniſhed with ſuch an excellent Hiſtorical Cobler, as that of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> once enjoyed, 'tis likely we might have as pleaſant, and as credible Legends of debauched Conformiſts, as the Fryars were wont to write of the Lives of their Saints. And if our Tranſlators were ſuch very Knaves, and were as well skilled in making of ſcurrilous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, as they are at clouting of Shoes, they might chance to ſtick ſome of their Wax upon the ſhort Cloak, and make a moſt foul ſpot upon it. For I doubt there was ſcarce ever any great number of men ſo far beyond the reach of Detraction, but that if their Adverſaries were as diligent, as ſome have been, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering all manner of flying Reports, never examining whether true, or falſe, they might be traduced upon as probable grounds, and ſet forth in as bad Colours, as the very worſt of the Conformable Clergy. But I admire that when that famous Chronicler, I named but now, was dead and gone, there ſhould be none ſo fit to ſucceed in his place, as this learned man. It had certainly been a far more honeſt and honourable Employment for him to have taken up the other part of his Trade, and to have packed up his Auls, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65721:27"/>
hired a Stall, and fet himſelf bodily to vamping of Boots. And I think that here at leaſt he might have done pretty well: for it is obſerved, you know, that he has a great knack at tacking of ſeveral pieces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he can moſt cunningly underlay <hi>the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of his dwarfiſh endeavours,</hi> and ſet them upright by ſtitching in the ſhreds, nay many times whole ſoles, of other mens Labours. But I leave him under a Bulk whetting his crooked Knife, and hammering and thump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his old Hides.</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell you ſeriouſly, that upon the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial obſervation I could ever make, and the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that I could procure, I cannot find but that the generally of the preſent Clergy of <hi>England</hi> are Men of known and approved ſobriety, and of a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inoffenſive Converſation: though this pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Man, and ſome others as charitable as he, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to perſwade the World, that they are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of diſſolute and licentious Livers. And, if there be indeed any ſuch amongſt them, we are heartily grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and deſire that neither He, nor any of his Party would rejoice at it: for we know that it is the only thing that can effectually ruine this Church. For that is a Body of ſo firm a Conſtitution, and ſo excellently temper'd, and ſo well ſhaped, and of ſo clear a ſtrength and vigour in all its Limbs, that no outward Force is able to injure it: nothing but ſome inward corruption and decay in the vital parts that can poſſibly bring it to the ground. And ſuch a looſneſs, and debauchery in the Miniſters of it, as is pretended, is enough alone to do that, which hitherto, God be praiſed, all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ſubtile machinations of thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the unadviſed perverſneſs of ſome others, have attempted without any great ſucceſs. And if there be any ſuch vicious perſons amongſt us, they owe their increaſe and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65721:27"/>
impunity to nothing more, than the untameable obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of thoſe that have weakened the hands of all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and made but a mock of Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. But ſtill, as bad as the caſe is, if Mr. <hi>Jenkyn,</hi> or any of his Friends, inſtead of reviling, will be pleaſed to proſecute theſe ſcandalous Men, if they know of any, in a legal way, not out of any ill-will, but in a real zeal to the honour of Chriſtianity; they ſhall not fail to have them puniſhed by Suſpenſion or Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in ſuch a manner as the nature of their Crime requires. And what is there more that can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? And if they ſhall refuſe to do this, now they are minded of it, they muſt give us leave to ſuſpect that it may not be ſo much the Reformation, as the Deſtruction of the Church, which they aim at, in theſe unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Complaints againſt the <hi>Taverns,</hi> and <hi>Mornings-draughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now upon a review of the whole Charge, I find theſe few things that ſeem neceſſary to be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Confident Man. And one is, How he came to ſuch a particular knowledge of theſe matters for which he accuſes us? A Man would think that he had been a conſtant frequenter of our Aſſemblies; and that he had heard moſt of the Sermons that ever we made. But ſince he neither can, nor will pretend this; he muſt receive his information from the report of others; and all wiſe and good Men know what faithful relations that uſes to make in ſuch caſes. And then I would beg him to tell me, how much skill a Man muſt have in <hi>Caſuiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity,</hi> before he can ſatisfie his Conſcience in the open defamation of a whole Order of Men, upon no better evidence than a few popular ſtories, and the impertinent tattle of the People? Another thing which I would be gladly reſolved in, is, Whether he means all, or only ſome of the Clergy, when he moſt civilly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65721:28"/>
calls them <hi>a Company of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtaris, &amp;c?</hi> If he means all; it will be no hard matter to convince him of the folly and maliciouſneſs of ſuch a baſe and unworthy Slander: If he intends but ſome; then why does he not acquaint us who they are? Why has he drawn up his Accuſation in ſuch general terms? Why does he not limit it to thoſe it concerns? Why has he not any the leaſt exception in all his vehement Invective? Why does he not put in ſo much as one ſingle word at any place, to diſtinguiſh the innocent, from thoſe that he would have us ſuppoſe to be guilty of <hi>Heretical Notions, &amp;c?</hi> Once more, and I ſhall trouble him no farther; granting all he ſays to be true, (which would be a great courteſie) yet what good and honeſt end or deſign could he propoſe to himſelf in preaching and publiſhing of theſe things? Did they tend ſo very much to the edification of Doctor <hi>Seaman's Flock,</hi> and thoſe of his <hi>own</hi> that were there? Was the World grown ſo unſufferably charitable, that they muſt needs be ſtirred up to thoſe admirable <hi>Accompliſhments</hi> of hatred and contempt? Was it ſo extremely neceſſary, that they ſhould be inſtructed, by ſuch an eminent example, to vilifie their Brethren in a godly manner? 'Tis not eaſie to conjecture what other occaſion there could be for all the bitterneſs that has been expreſſed by this Man. If he had any better end for which he reviled us, let him tell us what it was; but if it were only to make the People hate us, which is all that yet appears, then you may plainly perceive what a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Caſuiſt</hi> he is, and how little <hi>eaſe he gives to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have conſidered all the particulars that Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> has been pleaſed to object againſt us in this Sermon, and given ſuch Anſwers to the moſt material, at leaſt, as I hope may be ſufficient to ſtop the mouths of malicious
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65721:28"/>
Men, till he afford us ſome ſubſtantial proof of what he has ſaid; and then, if I find his Arguments convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, I ſhall be content to be of his opinion. In the mean time I have met with ſomething which I would commend to his ſerious conſideration; and it may be he may think it worth a few thoughts; for it is his own: as I find it in a Latine Sermon of his; and though I do not greatly admire the cleanneſs of the ſtile, yet becauſe it is ſo proper for his preſent uſe, I ſhall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the whole paſſage as it lyes there.</p>

            <p>I have written this out at large, that if you ſhould chance to make theſe Papers publick, Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> may read it, and ſee how he likes it now; for I doubt he has never a Copy of that Sermon left; or elſe he has forgot it, as he had done his Catechiſm before. You ſee the paſſage is pretty remarkable, and ſomething long, I need not tranſlate it all. But it ſeems to be a kind of a ſevere declamation againſt <hi>Detractors;</hi> and he gives them a great many ill-words, as his manner is, and as they very well deſerve. He ſays they reſemble the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and that they are the <hi>firſt-born of the Devil;</hi> he compares them to <hi>Butchers Dogs,</hi> and tells us that they are worſe than Hell it ſelf; he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulates moſt vehemently with them, and intimates how unworthy their practices are for all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Miniſters.</hi> I will not treat him with his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65721:29"/>
but only deſire him to examine himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and try whether his Conſcience does wholly excuſe him of this hateful ſin; and whether he do not <hi>deny, blacken, or at leaſt neglect the merits</hi> of others, and <hi>forge</hi> and <hi>feign</hi> moſt heinous Crimes againſt them, which he cannot prove them to be guilty of. And if he do; he is then bound to retract that old Latine one, or elſe this late Engliſh Sermon he has made. One of theſe in all Reaſon and Juſtice ought to be done; but I leave him perfectly at his own liberty to chuſe which he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>I have now done with him; and as for thoſe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable names of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts, malapert, ſaucy,</hi> and the like; I ſhall not urge him to give any farther account; but ſhall look upon them only as tokens of his great modeſty, and the kindneſs he has for us, and the natural effects of a more than ordinary civil breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But where he charges us with any thing that may ſeem any way material, as <hi>Latitudinarianiſm that gives too much eaſe to Practice, Mornings-draughts that laſt from ſeven or eight, to one or two in the Afternoon, Preaching the Sermons of our Non-Conforming Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> and above all, <hi>confidently venting of Heretical Notions;</hi> theſe are things that deſerve to be farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into; and I muſt here challenge him, and all the world, either to forbear the ſpreading abroad ſuch groundleſs, and uncharitable rumours, and ſo make amends for the injury already done, by publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their miſtake, and asking pardon of thoſe whom they have moſt unjuſtly traduced; or elſe to make good the Accuſation by ſufficient proofs, not in general terms only, as has been hitherto moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly done, and whereby the innocent may ſuffer as well as the guilty; but to tell us openly who the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are, and what the particular faults are, whereof
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65721:30"/>
they impeach them. If he or any Man will do this, we ſhall look upon him as a generous Adverſary; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Friend. And if Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> will pleaſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, he ſhall have the hearty thanks of a great many; and, if the Ceremony be not too Popiſh, we ſhall <hi>kiſs even his feet,</hi> with as low a reverence, as ever he did thoſe of <hi>Calumny</hi> in all his life, not excepting the time when he ſet himſelf to writing this <hi>Funeral Sermon.</hi> And in this humble poſture I take my leave of this Great Man.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, you might hope to have ſeen an end of the trouble I give you; and ſo you had, but that I have met with another Sermon preached before his Majeſty; which ſome would perſwade us is enough to juſtifie all Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> has ſaid. However it has ſerved to increaſe the cry; and now we are told that they are not only our Diſſenting Brethren, but ſome that ſeem the moſt zealous Friends of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that have taxed us for maintaining the moſt dangerous Hereſies. And this has made many inclinable to think that poſſibly there may be ſome juſt occaſion for it, when Men of ſuch different Judgments ſhall join in the ſame Accuſation againſt us. I think it neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make ſome ſhort Reply to this Gentleman as well as the other. It muſt be confeſſed that he hath ſhewed himſelf a Perſon of the far greater civility of the two, and that he hath none of thoſe ſordid and Boriſh Expreſſions, which is the beſt Language the other can allow us: But that his ſtyle is much more neat, and clean, ſmooth and eaſie, and ſuch as being pronounced with a becoming Grace, (as he knows, as well as any Man, how to do it) I do not queſtion but that it might give a very great preſent ſatisfaction to that moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and Royal Audience, where he had the honour
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65721:30"/>
firſt to deliver it. But when his Majeſty was pleaſed to command it to the Preſs, it cannot be imagined that a Prince of ſo much Candour, and Goodneſs, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, did intend by that act to give the leaſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to any thing in that Diſcourſe, that might reflect unhandſomly upon any of his Clergy. But only when that Gentleman had taken the boldneſs to diſcover ſome ſuſpicions of his own before his Majeſty; His Majeſty was then moſt graciouſly pleaſed to order them to be publiſhed; that any that might otherwiſe ſuffer under thoſe imputations, might have free liberty to defend themſelves before the World.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore make a little uſe of the freedom which may be reaſonably ſuppoſed to be granted to us all, by briefly examining a paſſage or two. And one of them is to be found under that head, where he tells us, that <hi>An Ambaſſador is preſumed to be one of more</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>than common Prudence, Sagacity, and Judgment.</hi> And then after a while, ſpeaking of Chriſts <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> he acquaints us, that <hi>They ſhould not handle profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>(though never ſo carnal) as</hi> Origen, Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, <hi>or</hi> Tertullian <hi>did rank Heathen; nor lay out all their pains and Oyl about the firſt Elements, though it be to demonstrate our Religion to be the best of all others, and most perfective of Humane Nature.</hi> This he conceives not to be <hi>Prudence;</hi> and I, for my part, am perfectly of his mind. But then I believe he does ſcarce know one Man that is at all concerned in this grave rebuke; for who is there that <hi>lays out All his Pains and Oyl about the first Elements?</hi> And ſome of it, I think, they may deſerve. For it is not only <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> but Neceſſary, that the People ſhould be told and made to know the great Excellency of Chriſtianity, and the moſt ſolid and undeniable Evidences upon which we have received it. For, if they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65721:31"/>
underſtand theſe things; they can neither praiſe God for the great bleſſing of the Goſpel of his Grace; nor are they like to continue conſtant in the Exerciſe and Profeſſion of our Holy Religion, if they be not taught how far it excels all others, and what ſolid Foundations it is built upon.</p>
            <p>But what an eaſie matter is it to queſtion the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of the very beſt of any Man's actions? If I were deſirous to find fault with this Sermon, the firſt thing I would do, ſhould be to ſay that it was not <hi>Prudently</hi> written; that it argued not <hi>a more than common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity and Judgment,</hi> to join with the adverſe Party in accuſing his Brethren, and to put Arms into their hands, when there are ſo many Enemies, of ſeveral ſorts, that wait but an opportunity to ruine the Church. Others might be apt to pretend, that in this Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> his deſign was either to ſhew his own skill in the Myſteries of State, or to adviſe his Majeſty, how thoſe he employed abroad ought to be qualified, or to tell thoſe Reverend Perſons, that might chance to hear him, what ſubjects were moſt proper to be treated of, or to remind the reſt of his Auditors when their Preachers were to be blamed: And they might be like enough to ſay, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as <hi>Prudently</hi> done, to ſhew an ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation the true grounds of their Belief; as for any one to vaunt himſelf for being a great Politician, or to teach his Majeſty how to chuſe his Foreign Miniſters, or to inſtruct the Clergy how to Preach, or to acquaint the People how to pick quarrels with their ſpiritual Guides. As for that particular with which he ſeems not to be ſatisfied, I have heard many as good, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſolid Diſcourſes upon it, as this of his is; but I never knew any Man that was wont to preach of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. Or if there be any ſuch, as this reproof
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65721:31"/>
that is given them ſeems to imply, I think it may be altogether as <hi>Prudent,</hi> and to as good purpoſe to be continually magnifying of our Religion; as to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſowing of groundleſs jealouſies in the Minds of Men, to the great ſcandal and diſhonour of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The other place that I ſhall take notice of is, where he ſays he <hi>cannot but animadvert a while upon thoſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 24:</note> 
               <hi>falſe Apoſtles, and deceitful Workers, who instead of building, are ever pecking at the Foundation of our Faith, with their Axes and Hammers, in great Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and leſſer Criticiſms, to change the old ſound word of Reconciliation, for new Ideas, and devices of their own, and other mens brains.</hi> I am not able to conceive whom he deſcribes by this Character he gives. But he goes on; <hi>That would ſupplant Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with Natural Theologie.</hi> And who theſe ſhould be too, I cannot conjecture. There is undoubtedly a Reverence of our Maker, that is required by thoſe Principles and common Notions that are imprinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Souls. And we are no more abſolved from the obligation that lyes upon us to worſhip him on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than we are from Juſtice, and Temperance, or any other Duty which the ſame Law of Nature does moſt ſtrictly enjoin. And I do not apprehend how this ſhould be ſo much a <hi>ſupplanting,</hi> as a confirmation of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> when it ſhall be made appear to be extremely conſonant, and agreeable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of our own minds; and that in very many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our obedience to Almighty God we have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tye by which we are bound; that of Nature, and that of his written, and moſt Holy Word.</p>
            <p>But it follows; <hi>And turn the Grace of God into a wanton Notion of Morality.</hi> I know of no Offenders in this kind. But there are many Duties of the Goſpel
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65721:32"/>
which may methinks, without any ſcandal, be called mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues, in reſpect of the matter of them; and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with reference to the Divine Power, by which we are inabled to perform them. And this I take to be as much as any Man amongſt us will contend for. But let Men call things by what Names they pleaſe, if they be but conſcientious to practiſe as they ſhould, I ſhall move no controverſie about a word.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds to the heavieſt part of the charge: <hi>That impiouſly deny both the Lord that bought them,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 25.</note> 
               <hi>and his Holy Spirit, that ſhould ſeal them to the day of Redemption.</hi> This is as much as can be ſaid, unleſs he will accuſe us of profeſſed Atheiſm. And if he know of any ſuch as he mentions, let him diſcover them, let them be openly branded for the worſt of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and let them ſuffer the utmoſt rigour and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Law: But if he be not able to convince us of the truth of what he has ſaid, how will he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to his own Conſcience; and what Recompence will he make to the Church of God, that has been high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcandalized by this bold affront that he has offered unto it?</p>
            <p>But let us ſee how he goes on; <hi>Making Reaſon, Reaſon, Reaſon, their only Trinity:</hi> This is as much as to ſay, that they are <hi>Socinians,</hi> and utterly deny the Doctrine of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity.</hi> This is a thing that I have ſpoken of before, and I need ſay no more of it here. But what if I ſhould ſay that ſome Men make <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, Applauſe, Applauſe, their only Trinity:</hi> there are more, I fear, that would be found guilty of this error, than of the other; and it is not <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but a vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humour, and a deſire of being admired, that is wont to deſtroy Mens Principles, and to incline them to <hi>Heretical</hi> Opinions. All conſiderative Men of all Perſwaſions do grant us a ſober uſe of our <hi>Reaſon</hi> in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65721:32"/>
matters of Religion; but I have not been acquainted with any that do Idolize and adore it in ſuch a manner as is pretended. I have yet heard of none in this Church, who do not firmly believe that it is neceſſary to have our Underſtandings illuminated by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and to have all our Faculties ſtrengthened by the efficacious Aſſiſtances of the Holy Ghoſt. Which is far enough ſure from <hi>preaching up Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, without the Grace of God, and Faith in Chriſt;</hi> as this Gentleman tells us they do.</p>
            <p>After this, amongſt other things, he has a good ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Socrates;</hi> and he might have gathered a great many of other Mens to the ſame purpoſe; but then he brings in his cutting <hi>Epiphonema; ſo far do they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip a very Heathen, that teach—a good life will carry</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag</hi> 26.</note> 
               <hi>men to Heaven, though they be Jews, Turks, Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or never ſuch damnable Hereticks in point of Faith.</hi> This is ſtrange Doctrine indeed, but the beſt of it is, I never knew any Man ſo bold that durſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
            <p>Then he tells us what need there is of a <hi>Teſt</hi> for ſuch as theſe, and <hi>beſeeches</hi> his Hearers <hi>to boware of them: Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits, as He himſelf fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells you:</hi> ſays he, <hi>He does not mean the Fruits of their lives:</hi> and then he ſeems to excuſe them from notorious and ſcandalous ſins, in a very charitable Parentheſis; and I am glad of this teſtimony he gives them, and think his authority good enough to oppoſe Mr. <hi>Jenkyn</hi> upon this occaſion. <hi>But the Fruits and Conſequents of their Doctrine,</hi> as he goes on. But for all this I am not fully ſatisfied, but that our Saviour might mean the <hi>Fruits of their lives,</hi> in that place which he alludes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For Mens Opinions are not ſo eaſily diſcerned; and when they are known, it is not every one that is ſo good a <hi>Logician,</hi> and ſo well verſed in gathering of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65721:33"/>
as he is. But thoſe that he has collected, I know not from whence, <hi>are diſmal enough (one would think) to make themſelves afraid, as</hi> Moſes <hi>was of his own Rod turned into a Serpent.</hi> And 'tis ſtrange too, that he is not <hi>afraid</hi> of his own Sermon, it looks ſo like ſuch a Creature as that; not ſo much for the great <hi>Prudence</hi> and Subtilty of it, as for ſome other <hi>Serpentine</hi> qualities that it has. But let us hear theſe dreadful Conſequents; <hi>they are,</hi> if you will believe him, <hi>ſuch as theſe —That there is no ſuch thing as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Grace, —That Christ dyed in vain, —That ye are yet in your ſins, —and every man muſt be his own Saviour, or he is damned for ever.</hi> Sure this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman uſes to be frighted with his own Dreams. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did I hear of any ſuch <hi>Conſequents,</hi> or any <hi>Doctrine</hi> for which any amongſt us could be reaſonably ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from whence they could be poſſibly drawn, by any tolerable way of arguing. But however they have had this good effect upon him, that they have ſcared him into a fit of Devotion, and made him compoſe an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional kind of <hi>Letany;</hi> wherein I do moſt heartily join with him; eſpecially as to that which concerns <hi>blackmouth'd Authors bearing date from</hi> Irenopolis; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 27.</note> and <hi>that we may never live to ſee our Youth trained up in the</hi> Cracovian <hi>Catechiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There has been much whiſpering of late of ſtrange <hi>Hereſies</hi> that were creeping into the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and this Gentleman has been ſo free with us, as to acquaint the World, what ſome of them are. But I have often heard divers perſons, that have ſuffered by theſe Reports, diſcourſe publickly upon many of theſe ſuſpected points; and, as I have had occaſion, I have deſired in private to know their Opinions, where they were like to deliver their minds with the greateſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and I could never diſcern but that they were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65721:33"/>
Orthodox, and ſound, and no way repugnant to the Articles of Religion which we all own. But this notwithſtanding, if this Gentleman, or any other, can detect theſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> that are ſaid to lurk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; it is moſt earneſtly deſired that they would do it ſpeedily, before the Poyſon ſpread too far: There is nothing that can do more ſervice to the Church, or more right to many of our Brethren, who have been very much injured by theſe looſe and general ſurmiſes. But it will not be enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any Man, without manifeſt and particular proofs. For it has been often known when a whole Town or Country has rung with a great noiſe of ſome very debauched, or, it may be, Heretical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and they that have made the loudeſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, have been thereupon invited, and ſollicited to-appear in Court, and bring in their Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, they have neglected to do it; and yet have murmured becauſe the Offenders have eſcaped without a Cenſure. As if it could be expected that the Biſhops, and others that have any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Juriſdiction could be ſo unjuſt and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as ſome have been, to paſs ſentence before the Parties could be heard, and when they have been accuſed by none but Common Fame. But if this Gentleman can bring any more credible Witneſs than that, for what he ſays, if the Hereticks be not puniſhed, it will not be for want of Diſcipline, but by the neglect of him that refuſes to Proſecute. And if he ſhall not think fit to do this; there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing which I hope he will not deny us; and that is, becauſe I preſume he has leiſure, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough for ſuch a Work, I wiſh he would be perſwaded to write a ſolid Treatiſe in confutation of thoſe Errors, which he thinks have taken root
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65721:34"/>
amongſt us. This in appearance is a better way to prevent their growth, than by buzzing of jealouſies into Mens heads, which all the wit in his will never prove. But I leave him to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>And here, Sir, I cannot but reflect a little, with ſome trouble, upon the preſent unhappineſs of this Church. If any of a Proteſtant Profeſſion can be ſo fooliſh as to imagine it their intereſt to have it deſtroyed, we need not admire to ſee ſome of them buſie in ſpreading abroad ſcandalous Reports of the Members of it. But when thoſe that would be thought its greateſt Friends, ſhall ſecond theſe Men in their unjuſt imputations, it is difficult to conceive what honeſt deſign they can have. This is but to raiſe cauſeleſs ſuſpicions, and conſequently ſome kind of diſlike one of another, and to ſow the ſeeds of a growing Diſcord amongſt our ſelves. And after all that can be pretended, it is but as if a Man ſhould ſet fire to his Houſe, as the beſt expedient to diſlodge the Vermine that he fears may harbour in it. But the caſe is not ſo deplorable yet, that we ſhould ſtand in need of ſuch a deſperate Cure. And I wiſh heartily that, for the future, our Brethren would be more cautious of ſpeaking any thing that may have a worſe effect than they intended: For our Church is eſtabliſhed upon ſo good grounds, that in all probability it cannot be ruined, but by the Licentiouſneſs, or Diſſention of the Miniſters of it; and I hope that the vigilancy and fatherly care of our Superiors will uſe means to ſuppreſs the one, and that the Prudence and Brotherly Love of the inferiour Clergy will be ſufficient to prevent the other.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I have here made a ſtop, and taken time to read over, and a little conſider the Papers I ſend you. And upon the peruſal of them, I could wiſh that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence had been undertaken by ſome other, that had been able to manage ſo good a Cauſe with greater skill than I have done. However I cannot find but that I have made ſuch a Reply to all things that have been yet alledged againſt us, as may, I hope, give ſome ſatisfaction to all indifferent Perſons, that we have been moſt unjuſtly accuſed. Some Paſſages there are, in that part eſpecially that concerns Mr. <hi>Jenkyn,</hi> which may ſeem a little too light; and I had been the firſt Man that had condemned them my ſelf, but that I know that many of them may be excuſed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of the plain and familiar ſtile that is moſt proper for a Letter to a Friend. And the Objections he has been pleaſed to make, and the manner of his urging them is ſo very ridiculous, and extravagant, that any Man may eaſily judge what kind of Anſwer was fitteſt for him. But ſtill I have abſtained from all ſcurrilous and reproachful Language; though after ſuch affronts, and provocations as he has given us, it might have been ſomething pardonable, if I had dealt with him with greater ſharpneſs, than I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the liberty to uſe. I do not deſpiſe, and revile him in the ſame manner as he does us; I have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him for an Example there; though I know not where to meet with a more complete one in that kind. Where I ſeem to ſlight him the moſt, it is only to ſhew that the moſt <hi>Empty and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naccompliſhed Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi> are not <hi>to be Hector'd down</hi> by any mans <hi>malapert</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65721:35"/>
                  <hi>and ſaucy Ignorance.</hi> And beſides I take it to be the moſt juſt and natural Puniſhment for a haughty and inſolent Man, to have his Plumes a little pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is the likelieſt way to bring him to ſome degree of ſobriety, when he ſhall perceive that all the world has not ſuch a mighty opinion of him, as he has vainly entertained of himſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though I know not how he may receive them, yet I aſſure you that the ſevereſt expreſſion in theſe Sheets was intended in kindneſs to him: For I was willing, if it were poſſible, to have him brought to calm and moderate thoughts, by letting him ſee how eaſie it is to render the higheſt arrogance very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
               <p>It is to be admired what ſhould make him ſo bold as he is; for any one may ſoon diſcover that he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary in him, beſides his wonderful Confidence, and the extremity of ſcorn with which he uſually aſſaults, and thinks, it may be, to ſilence his Adverſaries. But when he had uſed us with ſo much rudeneſs, he could not certainly expect to be very gently handled. He had made himſelf look as fiercely as he could, and thought, 'tis likely, that none of us would have been ſo hardy as to take ſuch a Lyon by the Tooth; but he could not hope that we were all ſo very blind, as not to diſcern what Creature it was under that formidable Skin he had wrapped about him: He had roared ſo terribly at us, that he might think he had put us into ſuch a fit of trembling, as was enough to ſhake the Pens out of our hands; but if we had but the courage to take them up again, he might well conceive, that we ſhould not anſwer his loud noiſes, with nothing but ſoft and flattering words. And yet I have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him as much as I could; but I am afraid for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65721:35"/>
all this, that if he ſhould think theſe Papers worth his notice, he would treat me very ſeverely; for he that has boldneſs enough to defie a whole Order of Men, will ſcarce be inclinable to ſpare one of the moſt inconſiderable amongſt them. But let him do as he pleaſes, if you ſhall judge that any thing I have ſaid may ſerve to wipe off the ſcandal, and convince any part of the World, that we have been wrongfully accuſed of <hi>Hereſie, &amp;c.</hi> or if it may but put them upon enquiry to ſearch out the truth; I have all I deſigned in this Undertaking, and am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to run the hazard of it, and ſhall be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear as much contempt, as either his Anſwer, or his ſilence can caſt upon me. But if he ſhould think fit to make any Reply, I muſt ſtill deſire, that he would rail no more in general terms, but name the Perſons, and produce his Evidences; otherwiſe all that he can ſay may be juſtly eſteemed as idle, and impertinent, as any thing in all the Sermon that has occaſioned this Debate.</p>
               <p>Before I make an end, I ſhall juſt look back upon the principal part of the Charge that has been brought, and that is the moſt unreaſonable clamour that has been made concerning <hi>Hereſie;</hi> which is the only thing that did ingage me in the writing of this ſhort Vindication. All, or moſt of thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuſpect us for this, do openly diſſent in ſome very material Inſtances; and we that are accuſed do profeſſedly own the known Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that a Man would wonder how ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can have the confidence to tax us, for what they are guilty of themſelves; or that any ſhould give the leaſt credit to their moſt uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuggeſtions, when they are ſo contrary to the many Subſcriptions and Declarations which the Law
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65721:36"/>
requires us to make. Are we indeed no better than a company of faithleſs perjured perſons? Or can any man be ſuppoſed to be more intimately acquainted with our Opinions, than we our ſelves are? And how then can we be called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we profeſs is acknowledged to be Orthodox? Have they learned the Myſtery of peeping into our breaſts through <hi>Momus</hi> his Window? And have they diſcovered, by the help of that ingenious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that our hearts and our tongues do not agree, and that our thoughts are directly oppoſite to what we have ſo often declared by our words?</p>
               <p>It would be very hard to unriddle theſe things, but that it is commonly ſeen, that Men decide Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in Divinity, as they do other matters, not ſo much with their Underſtandings as their Paſſions. Upon the leaſt difference that happens to ariſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of debating the Queſtion calmly, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arguments on both ſides without partiality, every one is paſſionately concerned for his own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and they run preſently into heats, and ſo every Probleme begets a Quarrel. Men are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of their own Opinions, and love them dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatever they be; and if any chance to diſſent from them in the ſmalleſt punctilio, they are jealous that their judgments are deſpiſed, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves affronted by the contrary perſwaſion, and ſo they grow angry and impatient, and then the next thing is, they fall immediately to calling of names; and the ruder ſort uſe the groſſeſt language without any ſcruple; and thoſe that have had any thing a civil Education reproach their Adverſaries with as much bitterneſs, though their expreſſions be more Gentile: But it is the ſame ſpirit and temper of mind that acts them both, when the one reviles you in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65721:36"/>
the blunteſt manner, and the other rails with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a better grace. And if the thing they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about be a matter of Doctrine, they cannot uſe any more moderation, than they are wout to do in other caſes; and then becauſe that <hi>Heretick</hi> is the worſt word that can be found upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they catch up that, and beſtow it confidently upon the Diſſenting Parties; and let them hold and profeſs what they will, there is no help for it, they muſt be <hi>Hereticks;</hi> nay, it may be, <hi>Arrians, Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Socinians,</hi> or whatever theſe haſty Gentlemen pleaſe to call them; though they do abhor the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of thoſe men with all their hearts.</p>
               <p>And this violent and clamorous humour has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the more credit in the world, in that it has been uſually coloured over with the ſpecious title of zeal for the Truth; for this puts a gloſs upon it, and gives it a kind of falſe luſter, which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it extremely to the more ignorant part of the People, who think always that he diſputes the beſt that talks the loudeſt; and they take him to be the moſt affectionate lover of Piety, that diſcourſes with the moſt vehemency about it; when poſſibly this ſtretching of his Lungs, and great earneſtneſs which he uſes, may proceed from nothing elſe but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of his Conſtitution, or his private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or a vain-glorious deſire of baffling his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. However, by this means he often paſſes with the multitude, for a very Learned and Godly Man; when he that guides his words with more diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and underſtands the Genius of Chriſtianity bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than to ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported beyond what becomes his Profeſſion, ſhall be condemned for a Perſon of weak Parts, and accuſed for Coldneſs and Indifferency in the things of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65721:37"/>
The intent of this ſhort Digreſſion was only to ſhew that it is nothing but the Paſſion of the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, that has made the name of <hi>Heretick</hi> ſo very common as it is; for it is grown no more now than an ordinary term of Reproach for every angry man that would fain be dealing in Controverſial Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and it ſerves for one of the principal Topicks for the great Profeſſors of Artificial ſcolding. You know how very frequent it has been; and there is ſcarce any Man, I think, that has wholly eſcaped it, if he had but the miſhap to meet with a peeviſh and diſ-ingenuous Adverſary. It is ſtrange to conſider upon what frivolous pretences ſome men will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to call you ſo; any ſeeming diſagreement in Opinion ſhall be enough to juſtifie the fouleſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, though it do not appear that you <hi>are ever pecking at the foundation of our Faith with</hi> your <hi>Axes and Hammers.</hi> If you do but ſtate a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little otherwiſe than they would have you, if you do not tye your ſelf up to their beloved Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but make uſe of ſome others which you judge more proper, and expreſſive; if you reject any of their received Diſtinctions; if you take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to differ from the firſt little Syſtem that was put into their hands; if you endeavour to free any point from the perplexities wherewith it has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, and try to make it more plain, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; all, or any of theſe things ſhall be ſufficient with ſome to have you immediately voted an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiok:</hi> Nay, for ought I know, you may chance to be ſuſpected, if you have not ſuch a Band as they uſe to wear, or if your Caſſock be but buttoned down before. It concerns us highly therefore, you ſee, to get good Orthodox Semſtreſſes and Taylors; for without their help our judgments alone, though
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65721:37"/>
never ſo ſound, may not be able to clear us of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions. But then it cannot be eſteemed any great argument of Wiſdom to be ſo very jealous, as theſe Men are, without any cauſe. And upon an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conſideration of the whole matter, it cannot be thought, by what we have yet heard, that any thing but meer anger, or malice, or folly ſhould make thoſe accounted no better than <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who do heartily ſubſcribe, and readily ſubmit to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have heard that it has been given out by ſome, that there is a ſhrewd deſign on foot of making moſt ſtrange diſcoveries of abundance of theſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that skulk about no body knows where. And I am apt to conceive that the thing may be done, about the ſame time that our Mariners will open the North-Weſt Paſſage from hence to the Indies. But that there is ſuch a deſign indeed, I ſhould eaſily believe, if men of ſo much raſhneſs and credulity were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of managing any deſign. And if there be ſuch a one, as is ſaid, it will not be hard to conjecture whoſe it is, and who are like to be the greateſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by it. For it would quickly blaſt the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church abroad, and raiſe cauſeleſs fears and animoſities amongſt us at home, and diſparage ſome of the ableſt Divines that this Nation affords, and ſtagger and amaze the People with moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cryes and noiſes of they know not what: And when they were in this affrighted and unſettled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, what more compendious remedy could be made uſe of to quiet their minds, than to take ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in that Church which pretends to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to ſecure all its Members, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> from the danger of being tainted with <hi>Hereſie;</hi> which they are told by ſome of our ſelves, that they are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65721:38"/>
manifeſtly expoſed unto, if they continue in that Communion wherein they were bred? This might be like enough to be the iſſue. And there is no doubt, but that thoſe that expect to reap the Fruits of our Diviſions, have been watchful enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their advantage, and as diligent as any to blow abroad theſe terrible Rumours, which they know may procure the fall of that Church, which they have always found to be the ſtrongeſt Bulwork in Chriſtendom, againſt the Errours and Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is not <hi>amuſing the World with other Fears,</hi> as the laſt of our Authors inſinuates, but ſhewing them plainly what a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 26.</note> we may be brought unto, and fairly warning them of the danger we are in; if it be not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Providence of Almighty God: as we hope it may, when we obſerve the great care and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his Majeſty has been pleaſed ſo often to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, for the preſervation of the eſtabliſhed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion. And I wiſh with all my heart that the Example of ſo good a Prince, or any thing elſe, could prevail with our Brethren, to forbear to carry on the Plots of our Enemies. And one would think they ſhould be aſhamed at laſt of reviling us any longer, when they ſee their honeſt meaning abuſed by the over-reaching ſubtilty of others, and may be convinced that they are only made the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Engines for more cunning Artiſts, to work out their own Ends. But if they will proceed ſtill as they have begun, whatever they pleaſe to think of us, they muſt give us leave to judge of them, that they are ſurprized with ſuch a fit as <hi>Ajax</hi> in the Tragedy was, and that they may have the glory of ſuch another Heroical Atchievement as he had, when he laid about him in a moſt furious manner, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65721:38"/>
hacked, and ſlaſhed, and butchered a Flock of poor innocent Sheep; and fancied all the while that he was ſlaughtering, and binding, and whipping his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; who had been guilty, as he thought, of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groſs miſtake in their Judgment.</p>
               <p>I have been longer than I intended in drawing to a Concluſion, but now your trouble is almoſt at an end. I have often wondered at the great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Hereſie</hi> that we have had; and they have been ſo ſtrong, that to tell you the truth, I was once a little afraid that there might be ſomething in them; but I was ſoon undeceived, and found it to be nothing but a pitiful Flam, when I had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be better acquainted with ſome that I had known to be particularly ſuſpected. And if our Brethren, whom I take to be in the greateſt Errour here, would be pleaſed to be ſilent in this matter, till they may have the ſame convenience of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, I do not queſtion but that they might receive the ſame ſatisfaction that I have done; and the Peace of the Church would not be in ſo much danger of being diſturbed, by vain, and uncertain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. In the mean time, if they can tell of any <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> they are again deſired not to ſpare them, but to make it known who they are, that they may be puniſhed according as they deſerve; and that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe that cannot be taxed for the like Crimes, may be no more troubled with the extravagant ſuſpicions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and jealous Men.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid what came to my mind in this caſe; and am glad that I have had the honour of pleading the Cauſe of oppreſſed Innocence, though I could have wiſhed it a better Advocate. I have drawn up my Thoughts in the way of a Letter, not becauſe it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65721:39"/>
is become the Faſhion to do ſo; but becauſe I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it fitteſt for my purpoſe: that you might diſpoſe of theſe Papers with the greater freedom, and that if you will needs have them come abroad, the fault only of writing them ſhould be accounted mine, and that you might bear the whole blame of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them to the World. I hope you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this little deſign I had upon you; and in any thing elſe I am,</p>
