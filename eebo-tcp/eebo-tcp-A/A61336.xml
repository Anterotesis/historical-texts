            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now Gentlemen of the long Robe look to your

Reformers of Religion ſhall likewiſe Reform your
Laws and Methods of Proceedings (as doubtleſs they
deſign it) and make twelve Jury-men, eleven of which
it's poſſible can neither write nor read, to be the ſole
Judges both of Law and Fact; farewel then to your
great Acquiſitions, your Year books then will be out of
date, and an <hi>Ouſter</hi> will be put to your Books of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
Theſe are the Beaſts of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that the late
Lord Mayor, Recorder, and Bench of Juſtices have
been contending withall; the Court aſſerting the Jury
to be Judge of the Fact only, and that it was the Courts
Prerogative to judge the Law, according to the old
Maxim, <hi>Ad queſtionem juris reſpondent Judices, ad
questionem facti reſpondent Juratores.</hi> And doth not
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſay in effect as much? (which they ſo
much glory in for their own Ends, although when it
toucheth them in point of obſerving the Laws of the
Holy Church and Gods Worſhip, they will call it <hi>Magna
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101062:3"/>
Fartha,</hi> or ſomething worſe.) Doth not the Great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made <hi>Anno</hi> 9. <hi>Hen. iij. Chap.</hi> 29, ſay, <hi>That no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhall be taken, or impriſoned; nor be diſſeized
of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Cuſtoms, or
be Out-lawed, or Exiled, or any other ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
nor we ſhall not paſs upon him, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers,
[or] by the Law of the Land.</hi> This <hi>[or]</hi> is disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
or copulative; if disjunctive, then it muſt imply
ſome other Judges beſides the Jury of twelve Men,
which are called the Peers or Equals; if it be taken
copulative <hi>(or</hi> for <hi>and)</hi> it ſtill implies another Juriſdiction
beſides that of the Peers, and <hi>per Legem terrae</hi> in that
place cannot (as this Novice of the Law doth infinuate)
be underſtood to be the Tryal of the Jury only, but to
be the Tryal both of Judge and Jury, according to that
Maxim, <hi>Ex facto jus oritur:</hi> Therefore the Form of Entry
of the Judgment is <hi>Ideo conſider at umi est per curiam, Vid.
Coke's Inſtitutes, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ſect.</hi> 234. <hi>fol.</hi> 154, 155. If the
Law be as this Youngſter would have it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Jury is both Judge of Law and Fact, and that the Kings
Juſtices cannot Fine for Contempt of the Court, nor
correct the Corruption or Miſdemeanor of Jury-men,
nor inform their Ignorance, nor rectifie their Miſtakes;
the Juſtices in <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> have that Name for
nothing, and the Juſtices will be but Cyphers, and ſit
there only to be derided and villified by every ſaucy
and impertinent Fellow.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, Gentlemen, if theſe things take place,
they will not only do as their Brethren, the late Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

he was a Trader in the City; and how he

            <p>But why do I endeavour to vindicate his Loyalty;

            <p>But I ſhall make this fair Offer for Sr. <hi>Samuel Starling,</hi>
and undertake for him, That if <hi>William Penn</hi> can make

Kings Friends either in Body, Goods, or Good Name,
one penny, that he ſhall reſtore to that Gentleman,

            <p>But I ſuppoſe this wild rambling Colt <hi>William Penn</hi>
miſtakes when he chargeth theſe things upon the late
Lord Mayor, he means his own <hi>Seir</hi> deceaſed, who
from a Captain, was made <hi>Olivers</hi> High Admiral for his

afterwards did eminent Service for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation at

               <hi>The</hi> Libeller <hi>proceeds to aſperſe Sir</hi> Thomas Bludworth,
vid. fol. 57, 58. Alderman <hi>Bludworth (ſaith he)</hi> being
conſcious to himſelf of his partial kindneſs to the <hi>Popiſh
Friers,</hi> hopes to make amends by his zealous proſecution of
the poor <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> for at the ſame Seſſions he moved to
have an Evidence (of no ſmall quality) againſt <hi>Harriſon,</hi>
the <hi>Frier,</hi> ſent to <hi>Bridewel</hi> and whipt; that he was earneſt
to have the Jury fined and impriſoned, becauſe they brought
not the Priſoners guilty, for only worſhipping their God:
Whence it may be eaſie to obſerve, That <hi>Popiſh Friers</hi> and
Prelatical Perſecutors are meer Confederates.</p>
            <p>This likewiſe is a Railing Accuſation, falſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious:
That worthy Knight never moved at that
Seſſions to have an Evidence againſt <hi>Harriſon</hi> the <hi>Frier,</hi>
ſent to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> and whipt, as this <hi>Libeller</hi> chargeth
him; neither was it ever proved at the Seſſions, That
the idle prating Fellow <hi>Harriſon</hi> was a <hi>Frier,</hi> or ever
attempted to ſet the City on Fire, as was falſely ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted;
but it was proved, that he had raiſed a rumour
that the City would be burnt, whereby great fears
and terrours was upon the ſpirits of the people; for
which cauſe, he was deſervedly Fined, Whipt, and Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Court.</p>
            <p>I could heartily wiſh, That theſe Libelling, Lying,
and Diſcontented People, were as free of the Deſign
of putting this whole Kingdom into a Flame, as he was
from the actual Firing of the City.</p>
            <p>But the malice of this Accuſation appears in the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101062:6"/>
the <hi>Libeller</hi> makes, <hi>viz. That</hi> Popiſh Friers, <hi>and
Prelatical Perſecutors, are meer Confederates.</hi> By which,
the <hi>Libeller</hi> would perſwade the too credulous World,
that the honeſt, ſober <hi>Protestant,</hi> who endevoureth to
put the Laws in Execution againſt ſeditious Meeters,
are Perſecutors: To which falſe, wicked, and diveliſh
Accuſation, I at preſent make no other reply, but what
<hi>Michael</hi> did to the Devil, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee:</hi> The
Lord in Heaven judge between us, and theſe lying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
People.</p>
            <p>The Accuſation againſt the Recorder is twofold;
firſt, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>That there would be a Law made
the next Seſſion of Parliament, That no man ſhould have
the protection of the Law, but ſuch as conformed to the
Church, fol.</hi> 68. This Saying of the Recorders is falſely
and maliciouſly recited; for he ſaid, <hi>That we ſhall not
be always at this trade with you, you will find the next
Seſſion of Parliament there will be a Law made. That thoſe
that will not conform to the Law, ſhall not have the protection
of the Law.</hi> And is it not moſt reaſonable, that they
which would have protection, ſhould give ſubjection?
And was it not the Opinion of thoſe bleſſed Saints,
whoſe ſteps theſe men follow, when they made a Law,
That thoſe that would not ſubſcribe the wicked Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
againſt King and Houſe of Lords, ſhould not have
the benefit of the Law? Was not that Law then eſteemed
by Men of their Principles a bleſſed Law? And is not
this <hi>Lex Talionis? Nec lex est juſtior ulla, quam necis
artifices arte perire ſuâ?</hi> And would not ſuch a Law,
if the wiſdom of Parlament think fit, ſave the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhtrates
from a great deal of trouble, and take more
effect upon theſe ſtubburn people, than all the Laws
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101062:6"/>
that have yet been made, or by the wit of man can be
invented?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Accuſation againſt the Recorder is, that
he ſhould ſay,</hi> Till now I never underſtood the reaſon of
the policy and prudence of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in ſuffering the
<hi>Inquiſition</hi> amongſt them: And certainly it will never be
well with us, till ſomething like the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
be in <hi>England. The Inference the</hi> Libellers <hi>Take
is,</hi> What does this but juſtifie that Helliſh Deſign of the
Papists to have prevented the first Reformation.</p>
            <p>This is a wicked and uncharitable conſtruction of the
Recorders words: Theſe words do no ways juſtifie the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> in preventing the firſt Reformation by the
Helliſh <hi>Inquiſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe <hi>Libellers</hi> had but the leaſt grain of Charity,
they would have conſtrued the words <hi>cum grano ſalis,
&amp; in initiori ſenſu,</hi> as the Rule of Charity directs all
words to be conſtrued; and they will admit of no other
conſtruction but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> be ſo
politick and prudent, by their <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> to preſerve
and maintain their falſe Religion; ſurely it will be the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> prudence, to find ways for the preſervation
of their true Religion.</p>

(2.) Becauſe it was no new thing, but what was uſual

overpow'ring the Conſtable and his Watchmen, and it is proved,

being of the Jury, at Juſtice-Hall in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi>
the laſt Seſſions, refuſed to find certain <hi>Quakers</hi> Guilty,
according to their Evidence; and upon that, they were
bound to appear in the Kings Bench the firſt day of the
next Term; they appeared accordingly, and the Court
directed an Information to be brought againſt them, and
upon that they were Fined.</p>
               <p>So that it plainly appears, The Fining of Jurors that
find contrary to their Evidence, is no Innovation, but
always practiced, and that by as learned Judges, as ever
<hi>England</hi> bred.</p>

                  <p>Fitz Herbert, Natura brevium, <hi>Title</hi> Attaint G. The
Writ of <hi>Attaint</hi> lieth where falſe Verdict is given in a Court
of Record, againſt the Plaintiff or Defendant, or againſt
the Demandant or Tenant, in a Plea, real or perſonal, ſued
by Writ or by Bill; if the Debt or Dammages do exceed
<hi>40 s.</hi> then he againſt whom the Verdict paſſed, ſhall have a
Writ of <hi>Attaint,</hi> and the Writ ſhall be ſuch; <hi>as is ſet down
there, which is between Party and Party,</hi> vid. H.</p>
                  <p>Coke, l. 3. Inſtit. ſect. 514. fol. 294. <hi>ſaith the ſame:
Attincta,</hi> is a Writ that lieth where a falſe Verdict, in a
Court of Record upon iſſue joyned betwixt Parties is
given.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Nota.</hi> If theſe Definitions are true, an <hi>Attaint</hi> lieth only betwixt
Party and Party: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Not in Indictments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is agreed by all ſides, That an <hi>Attaint</hi> lieth not in
an Indictment of Treaſon, Murder, or Felony; much
leſs in an Indictment of Treſpaſs, which, in the Eye of
the Law, is a far leſſer Offence than them aforenamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota.</hi> At Common-Law no <hi>Attaint</hi> did lie in Action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
before the Stat. 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. And by the Statute 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
<hi>cap.</hi> 7. it's Enacted; <q>That whereas it is contained in a Statute
late made at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the firſt Year of the Reign of Our
Soveraign Lord the King that now is, That <hi>Attaints</hi> ſhall be
granted in Writs of Treſpaſs: It is accorded and eſtabliſhed,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101062:20"/>
That Writs of <hi>Attaint</hi> ſhall be from henceforth granted, as well
in Pleas of Treſpaſs moved without Writ, as by Writ before
Juſtices of Record, if the Dammages judged, do paſs 40 <hi>s.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota.</hi> If at the Common-Law no <hi>Attaint</hi> lay in Actions of
Treſpaſs, ſurely then no <hi>Attaint</hi> did lie in Indictments of Treſpaſs,
where there is no Dammages given, <hi>à fortiori.</hi>

               <p>It is to be obſerved that the Common Law, as to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taints,</hi>
is altered ſince the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.
Doth not my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 8.
<hi>Sect.</hi> 514. affirm the ſame. <q>And ſeeing, ſaith he, That
all Trials of Real, Perſonal, and Mixt Actions depend
upon the Oath of Twelve men, prudent Antiquity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth
a ſtrange and ſevere puniſhment upon them if
they were attainted of Perjury.</q> 1. <hi>Quod amittat Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram

odious is this Perjury in the Eye of the Common Law.
But ſince <hi>Littleton</hi> wrote, ſaith <hi>Coke,</hi> 
                  <q>A Statute hath

that ever any <hi>Attaint</hi> was maintainable at the Common

               <p>
                  <hi>It appears by the Proeme of the</hi> Statute <hi>made</hi> 11. H. 7.
cap. 21. <hi>That no</hi> Attaint <hi>lay where</hi> Juries <hi>gave falſe
Verdicts in</hi> London: vid. <hi>the</hi> Statute, <hi>which ſaith;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Perjury is much and customably uſed within the City of
<hi>London,</hi> amongst ſuch perſons as paſſen and be impannelled
upon Iſſues joyned betwixt Party and Party in the Courts of
the ſaid City, to the great Diſpleaſure of Almighty God, and
alſo to the Diſinheritance and manifold Wrongs of the Kings
Subjects; for aſmuch as there is Enpannel in the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests

ſuch Perjured perſons before this time purveyed and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within the ſame City.</p>
               <p>So that that <hi>Statute</hi> and the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8.

               <p>Surely if <hi>Attaint</hi> lay not in <hi>London</hi> in Actions betwixt
Party and Party before that time, <hi>Attaints</hi> likewiſe in
<hi>Indictments</hi> could not lie. And this will be taken for

make it appear, by one or more Preſidents, That an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint</hi>

of this important Affair to the Honourable

Buſineſſes of Concernment, that God (the Great
