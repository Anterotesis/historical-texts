            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F my onelie name mentioned in the inſcription of this my recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhal make my diſcourſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, I can not meruell, ſeing I am becum for my treaſonable naughtineſſe lothſome and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my ſelfe, my conſcience not only ſtanding vp as a thouſand witneſſes againſt mee, teſtifying the heynouſneſſe of my tranſgreſſion, but alſo furniſhing within my ſelf, againſt my ſelf, all other neceſſarie members of a lawfull court to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne mee, ſhee being my actor, aſſiſe, Iudge, demp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and burreau, ieaning and tormenting mee with vnſpeakable terrors, whereof I neuer could finde reſt or quietneſſe, till God of his infinite mercie knowing my weakneſſe and imbecillitie to be ſuch, as without help I could neuer ryſe, did ſend vnto mee a Nathan, whereas I lay lethargicke in my former deſperation, without ſenſe or feeling of the dangerous eſtate I
<pb facs="tcp:8963:4"/>
was into, who letting mee ſee and feall the deepe &amp; dolour of my Apoſteme (which of before as a blinde and leprous perſon I did neither ſee nor feele) incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent I waxed exſtatick and aſtoniſhed, as if without my knowledge I had found a ſnake hid in my bosome not knowing the meanes how to be ridd thereof. So remaining ſome dayes in this inquietude the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Nathan, or rather Eliſeus appointed by God to cure my leproſie, finding mee in this perplexitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to comfort mee in manner following: ſaying, My friend, I haue let you ſee and feele an hid &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Apoſteme, the dolour whereof, if you haue an ſoule, muſt needes torment you in pitifull manner. Now to eaſe you of this dolour, I will miniſter vnto you an vnexſpected medecine, for the inexſpected wound that I haue opened vp vnto you: letting you vnderſtand that as your proud enormity is three-fold, ſo muſt you make a threefold ſatisfaction: one to God whome againſt your conſcience, as you your ſelfe confeſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you haue offended, in offending his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your Lord and Soueraigne, and in this point I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to your owne priuate meditation, wiſhing you to bewar of hypocriſie, as you would incurre or eſcape eternall damnation. Another ſatisfaction is due to your Prince, wherein you cannot better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your vnfeined repentance, than to bleſſe with the ſame tongue that hes blaſphemed: and with the ſame hand that did write againſt the veritie, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh your owne lewdnes and vnloyaltie, to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties

honour, &amp; your owne turpitude. And this forme of doing by all appearance ſhal alſo ſatisfie the third partie whome you haue exaſperate, to wit, all good ſubiectes ſcandalized by your preſumpteous and arrogant misbehauiour: the rather when as they ſhal ſee your repentance voluntare, and not conſtrained, &amp; your ſelf free and no priſoner. The Oliue branche was not more welcome to Noah, nor to the creple, <hi>Tolle grabatum tuum &amp; ambula,</hi> then this advyſe was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, for fulfilling whereof my verie ſecreat teares, (requiring neither vaunting nor witnes, <hi>Ille dolet verè, qui ſine teſte dolet</hi>) and this my publict recantation ſhal beare teſtimonie to the world. In which recantation, I will not go about to declare what pretended neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities may moue men vnto: but ſetting aſide all excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I acknowledge in humilitie that no ſuch occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be offered by a Prince, as can make a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect declyne, as I haue done.

to looſe our tongue, nor lift our hart nor hand, or animat the people againſt them, more nor Samuel &amp; Dauid the annointed ſucceſſor did againſt Saul, and Elias againſt Achab. And to this effect are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all thoſe golden ſentences, <hi>Omnis anima potestatibus ſuperioribus ſubdita ſit. Reddite Caeſari quod Caeſaris eſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedite Principibus etiam diſcolis.</hi> Together with the loua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of ſome Prophetes that did pray for the felicity of infidell Princes, obeying and exhorting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to obey them. I am not then to extenuat, but to aggrauat my offences, accuſing, not excuſing my ſelf: And in one word, Chriſtian Reader (vnto whoſe hands, this Recantation witnes of my vnworthines, may come) I pray thee read it with patience &amp; pitie, and iudge with thy ſelfe, if I haue not iuſt occaſion to lament my eſtate, ſince neither at God, nor my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hands I can look for anie thing, but iuſt deſerued punition, both heere and hence, except of grace they haue pitie on mee. Take mee for an example of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happines, and as a Mirrour wherein thou may ſee what is deforme and vnſeemlie to them that woulde remain in honeſt reputation, and howe eaſilie it may be loſt, that is moſt difficill to be found. Of one thing I may aſſure thee (as is before ſaid) that my behauior cannot ſeeme half ſo deteſtable to thee, as it is to my ſelf, wherof thou may in thy owne perſon haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in cace (which God forbid) thou fall as I haue done. Wherefore I pray Almightie God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that as my actions haue bene offenſiue to manie,
<pb facs="tcp:8963:5"/>
ſo my repentance may not only be acceptabil to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but alſo a caveat for all to flee ſuch dangerous &amp; diſloyall courſes, wherin skarce one of a thouſand ca eſcape. That ſame Almightie God graunt vnto thee a better minde and better fortune, and vnto mee a better anſwere, and end, nor my former lyfe hes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
            <p>AS the wounded Vrſe or wyldegoat ſeeking his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigane, doth with his filthie ſome and breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all other hearbes: and as the Waſpe of good and bad flowrs gathereth no thing but poiſon: Euen ſo a man wounded with malice and curioſitie, doth vitiat and wreſt whatſoeuer ſubiect he taketh in hand, dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more to defend lies nor trueth, improbabilities nor probabilities, paradoxes &amp; ſhadowes in ſtead of Orthodoxe and ſubſtance: and herevpon hes procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo manie idle and abſurde opinions, ſum impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſnow to be white, or the Sunne hore, ſome praiſing follie, Cupid, and manie other far more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous toyes, yea ſome preſuming to deny Gods providence and God him ſelfe. Lyke as out of this ſame puddle of malice &amp; curioſitie, did flow my late inuectiue againſt the King my ſoueraignes iuſte title to the crowne of England, wherin by Elenches, and by no good arguments, by ſophiſtrie, and no formal Syllogiſmes, I labour, to my eternall diſcredite, to make white black, and light darknes. But as the Sun cannot alwaies be obſcured with cloudes, and as the

gemme or pretious ſtone doeth not loſſe his vertue, though he be couered with filth &amp; villanie: no more can my partiall cavillations impeſhe his Maieſties poſſibilities, or diminiſh anie thing of his grandeur. For as the ſteill the more it is vſed the leſſe it doeth rouſte: a valiaunt knight the more he be aſſailed, the more appeareth his valour: and the more gold be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fire the more it is purified: Euen ſo the more his Maieſties title be oppugned with frivolous ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique contradiction: the equitie and iuſtneſſe therof is but the more manifeſted, as by this refutation of my former naughtineſſe, ſhall euidentlie appeare.</p>
            <p>Then to come to the purpoſe, the ſcope of al my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous ſatyre, was to proue that his Maieſtie had no iuſt title to the crown of England, neither by divyne nor humane Lawe, drawing my firſt Sophiſme from the Law of nature in this ſort.</p>
            <p>By right or lawe of nature nothing is myne nor thine: but all be common, nothing proper, and no proprietare: <hi>Ergo,</hi> be law of nature no proprietie can be acclaimed.</p>
            <p>Heervnto is anſwered, that in the libertie vſurped by mee in confounding <hi>Ius &amp; Legem,</hi> that is to ſay. Right and Law, (it being <hi>genus,</hi> and this <hi>ſpecies:</hi>) I hyde my ſelf in many ſtarting holes, whereof by diſtinction of theſe two words I am eaſily cut off. Next the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is fals. For in the originall creation of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, when as there could be no other Lawe but <hi>Ius naturae,</hi> no <hi>Ius gentium</hi> nor civill, becauſe there
<pb facs="tcp:8963:6"/>
was neither nation nor citie at that time, Adam was Lord and proprietar of that originall place, and of al naturall things therein contained: as in Geneſis the firſt and moſt ancient hiſtory is expreſſed. So the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent beeing falſe, the conſequent can inferre no verity.</p>
            <p>My ſecond caption is grounded vpon the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie or definition of the Law of Nations in this ſort.</p>
            <p>The right of Nations is that which equallie is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued among all Nations: but the right whereby his Maieſtie would poſſeſſe the crown of England is not equallie obſerued among all Nations: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By diſtinguiſhing or explaining the aſſumption the ſubtility of this caption is elided: for although the Law of proximitie of blood (wherupon his Maieſties title is grounded) be not equallie obſerued in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet all Nations admit the generall: that is to ſay, to haue Magiſtrates and ſuperior powers, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing therwithal that theſe Magiſtrats or powers haue iuſt titles either by ſucceſſion, election, or by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme aggreable to the nature of the countrie wher they are: ſo the particular diverſitie of cuſtomes in ſucceſſion proceeding from the diuerſitie of civill and municipall Lawes in euery Realme, doeth not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the generall vniformitie of all Nations which (ſauing in ſuch as be altogether barbarous, <hi>&amp; quae pro beluis habendae ſunt</hi>) doe all holde that Magiſtrates haue iuſt titles to ſuch kingdomes or Republiques as they be called vnto. And therfore his Majeſties tytle doth
<pb facs="tcp:8963:7"/>
not diſaccord, but accord with the right of Nations <hi>ingenere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My third captioun grounded on the civill Law is ſo confuſed and cautelous, that it cannot well bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to anie forme: I will therefore with this cleare demonſtration open vp and impugne the ſame. As for the ciuil Law, if we meane the Romane or Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall to the Emperours, their ſelues haue confirmed and obſerued <hi>Iura ſanguinis,</hi> following <hi>Edicta Praetorum, vnde Liberi, vnde Legitimi, vnde Cognati.</hi> And if thereby we ſhall vnderſtand the Municipall or common Law of cuerie Realme: then may it be evidentlie prooued that euery Realme hes prouided and eſtabliſhed fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Lawes for maintayning the blood Royall in the right line. Whereby it is euident, that by the Law Ciuill, in what ſenſe ſoeuer it be taken, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie hath a moſt iuſt claime and competition.</p>
            <p>As to the Law Diuine, by the hiſtorie of Iacob &amp; Eſau may appeare, what reſpect and preferment was giuen to <hi>Primogenitur,</hi> or firſt-birth, ſeing Iacob, thogh he was elected, did pretend no right thereto, vntill his elder brother did renounce and abiure the ſame. And in Numeri the ſame prerogatiue is confirmed to the eldeſt: and euerie one ordained to ſucceede accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to proximitie of blood. Heerewithall the line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſucceſſion of the Kings of Iuda, from father to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and failing thereof, to neereſt kinſmen, doeth manifeſtlie proue this <hi>Ius ſanguinis</hi> to haue bene auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized as wel in the Pallice, as amongſt the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8963:7"/>Neither can that of Moiſes in Deuteronom. be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: <hi>vbi Odioſae Filius primogenitus dilectae Filio praeferri iubetur,</hi> ſuch was the reſpect of <hi>primogenitur.</hi> And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it this right of <hi>primogenitur</hi> was altered in Iacob, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Salomon, and ſome others: yet ſuch few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular exceptions, done at the ſpeciall command of God, (whoſe pleaſure is reaſon, and whoſe power hes no limitation) doth not aboliſh the generall Law more nor the particular fact of Phineas doth aboliſh the general Law againſt homicide: or the Polygamy and inceſt of the Patriarkes, deſtroy the Lawe againſt Inceſt and Adulterie. Then the Law of God, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I haue wreſted the ſame in my former partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) doeth not derogate, but corroborate the title of my Soueraigne Lord, vnto the Realme foreſaid.</p>
            <p>But the chief queſtion wherein I doe moſt cavill, and calumniat is this, If a Prince hauing <hi>Ius ſanguinis</hi> to an other Realme, (as this preſent King of France, Henrie the 4. beeing but King of Nauarre had to the Realme of France, and as my ſoueraigne Lord hath to that of England) if anie Poſitiue Law of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme where he ſhould ſucceede, can iuſtlie ſeclude him? Whereunto my anſwere is negatiue: impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my former affirmation firſt in <hi>Theſi,</hi> ſyne in <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſi,</hi> by theſe vrgent reaſons and examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>In Theſi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Princes having no ſuperiour power but the ſupreame Godhead, they be only ſubiect to his lawes <hi>&amp; omnibus alijs legibus humanis ſoluti dicuntur,</hi> and if of
<pb facs="tcp:8963:8"/>
their naturall pietie or goodneſſe they ſhall humble them ſelf to be ſubiect therevnto, (as Theodoſius &amp; Valentinian ſeemed to advyſe them, ſaying, <hi>Digna vox Principe Legibus ſe ſubditum eſſe fateri</hi>) that ſubiection or rather moderation <hi>est voluntatis, non neceſſitatis officium.</hi> Which aſſertion is founded vpon good reaſon: for if forraine Lawes ſhould binde them, then were they vaſſals &amp; no Princes: if domeſtick lawes, then ſhoulde they be aſtricted to punition, in cace of tranſgreſſion, and to be aſtricted to punition, is a manifeſt ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no ſoveraignitie.</p>
            <p>Next, althogh it may be ſaid that the Prince in his<note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdlie, if anie Lawe may be extended to the crowne or Prince, they ſuld bee expreſhe mentioned therein: ſpeciallie, where the Law is excluſiue, dini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, or obligatorie: and for this cauſe the Law exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the femals <hi>à feudis,</hi> the Lawe of diviſion of heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <hi>inter fratres &amp; ſorores</hi> the Lawe obliſhing the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor with the goods of the defunct to pay his debts, binds not the crowne, when the crowne is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>&amp; per rationis sdentitatem,</hi> the Law <hi>contra peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> conceiued ſimply without mention of the crown

To affirme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary heerof, and to alleadge that <hi>Iura ſucceſſionis &amp; hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditaria</hi> which be made in any Realme ſuld binde the Prince aſwell as the people, becauſe they bee made within the Realme which he hes or pretends to haue is to ſturre vp ſedition: yea it is as abſurde and inept as to perſew a Shiref or a whole Prouince for fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all contracts made within his jurifdiction, or within the precinct of the ſaid Prouince, or as who ſhould think the Schoole-maiſter ſubiect to the order appointed by him ſelf for ruling his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Perdlie, to this houre there can bee no example exhibite where anie having the title of blood to the crowne of England, with power and courage to bear out the ſame, that any Poſitiue law hath barred them. For proof whereof, I will vſe onlie ſuch examples as be moſt recent. The Poſitiue lawes made in Henrie the ſixt his time, againſt Edward Duke of Yorke, did not impeſhe him, nor his race, from the crowne, nor the bitter ſtatuts made by Richard the vſurper againſt that moſt magnanime Prince of worthie memorie, Henrie the 7. did not ſeclude him from the right which he had both by God and nature. Yea in our dayes the manifold Lawes, and libels defamatours made againſt the moſt chriſtian King preſent, could not impeſh him from the crowne of France.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>in Hypotheſi:</hi> I cum to examine ſuch Poſitiue Lawes as bee obiected againſt the King my ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes title, of which kinde there bee ſpeciallie two:
<pb facs="tcp:8963:9"/>
One auncient, an other later. To impugne the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient I take my firſt argument from the Rubricke, or Intitulation thereof, bearing theſe words: <hi>De ceux qui ſont nez outre ou de la mer. i. De trans mare natis.</hi> By which Rubricke or argument, it is verie probable that this ſtature in the originall thereof, did not containe this word <hi>Peregrinis:</hi> for the tenour of a Lawe ſhoulde not exceed the nature or ſubſtance of the title, and ſo it ſhould not preiudge his Maieſtie, who is borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid Yland. As alſo to them that will indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie marke the drift and intention of that ſtatute, they ſhall finde ittend onelie againſt children borne without the four ſeas which compaſſe the ſaid yland: whereby Scotland is no more ſecluded nor Wales &amp; Cornewall. And ſo it is not improbable, (which ſome alleadge) that the Rubrique foreſaid ſhould be <hi>De Peregrinis trans mare natis, non De Peregrinis &amp; trans mare natis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondlie, becauſe the ſaid Law was proponed in the 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeare of the raigne of Edward the 3. vppon a queſtion mooued, If children borne out of his allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance might poſſeſſe heritage within England. Whereunto was anſwered and enacted, that all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren borne ouerſea, hauing their Parents at the time of their birth at the faith and obedience of the croun of England, ſhould enioy alike benefite &amp; priuiledge as other heires borne within the Realm: ſo the ſtatute is a generall affirmatiue for that particular: and the argument obiected therupon, is <hi>â contrario ſenſu,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:8963:9"/>
kinde of argument prooues nothing. For if I ſhould ſay, <hi>Omnis homo est animal: Ergo quod non est homo non eſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi> the conſequent wer falſe and therefore is the deciſion of the Law, <hi>Argumentum à contrario ſenſu no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit</hi>

vpon two reſpects which pertaine onlie to priuat men and not to Princes, it can no way ſtrike vppon them.

For which cauſe in France was made <hi>Ius albinatus,</hi> as the practiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans teſtifie. Now in the perſon of a Royall ſucceſſor<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">

               </note> theſe conſiderations of loyaltie, tranſport, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence are not to be feared.</p>
            <p>Fiftlie, in Realmes where moſt ſtrait Lawes bee kept againſt ſtrangers, as in France, that <hi>Ius albinatus</hi> forſaid, by which of neceſſity all ſtrangers that would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teſtate or ſucceed, they muſt be naturalized with this clauſe <hi>(modò ſint Regnicolae)</hi> yet Princes haue ſucceeded and do ſucceede to great lands and Dignities within that Realme without anie benefite of naturalization, as the old Kings of Nauarre borne out of France, to manie fair lands in Guyen and Languedok. The D. of Lorane to the Dukerie of Bar: yea of old the kings of England to the ample Dukeries of Aquitane, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iou, Normandie, and Britaignie, and that becauſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes are preſumed euerie one to be brethren to other: and being brethren, it wer indigne to eſteeme them externe or ſtrangers, and inept to make them ſubiect to Lawes of alleageance, which be onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

to ſubiects and vaſſals.</p>
            <p>Sixtlie, the clauſe conteined in the ſaid pretended act, excepting <hi>Les Enfans du Roy,</hi> doth exeeme the king my ſoveraigne out of the compaſſe thereof: for that word <hi>Enfans</hi> is in the Latine <hi>Liberi:</hi> and be <hi>Liberi</hi> in the <note place="margin">

            <p>Seuenthlie this Law foreſaid <hi>de albinatu,</hi> although conceaued generallie, yet could it not bee extended to the crowne aſwell as to the ſubiect: and therefore the wiſe and learned did deuiſe the Lawe Salique for the ſucceſſion Royall.</p>
            <p>Laſt, if this ſtatute againſt forrain birth take place, then ſhall manie abſurde inconuenients follow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Firſt Princes (the ornament, bewtie, and light of the world, without whome were nothing but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſorder, &amp; confuſion) they ſhould be in worſe condition nor the moſte ignoble ſubiect of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme: for by that Law ſubiects may euer ſucceed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their parents ſubiects: but Princes cannot haue that immunitie, becauſe their Parents were neuer ſubiects. Againe, if a Prince for honor of his Realm, or for ſecuritie or enlarging therof, ſhall matche him ſelf or his children with a forraine nation where hee or they beget children: what barbarous iniquitie wer it to preiudge the parents remaining abroad for ſo
<pb facs="tcp:8963:11"/>
honorable cauſes, or to hurte the innocent children for a matter which lay not in their power to mend.</p>
            <p>Now for particular examples to illuſtrate theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes, I alledge but a fewe both before and after the conqueſt, to ſhewe that forraine birth makes not incapabilitie to the crowne of England. Edward the King &amp; Confeſſor before the conqueſt, did cal home out of Hungarie his Nevoy, Edward ſurnamed V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlae borne in Hungarie, who deing before the king his Vncle, the ſame King Edward declared Edgar A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelin ſonne to the ſaid Vdiſlae borne alſo in Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to be iuſt heritor, albeit he was afterward defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereof. And after the Conqueſt, Richard the firſt going to conqueis Ieruſalem, inſtitute his Nevoy Arthur, who was borne in Britaignie, &amp; young Duke thereof, to be his ſucceſſor. Like as king Stephan and King Henrie the 2. were both borne in France, their Parents not being of the alleageance of England, &amp; yet they were capable of the crowne of England.</p>
            <p>The vther argument wherewith they impugne his Maieſties title, is grounded vppon a ſtatute made in the 28. yeare of the raigne of Henrie the 8. of worthy memorie, wherein by conſent of his Eſtates in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament is graunted vnto him full power by his letters Patents, or by his Teſtament ſigned with his hand, to declair, determine, and deſigne the ſucceſſour of the crowne in cace his owne children ſhould faile, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue of their owne bodies, and the ſaid crown to bee eſtabliſhed in the perſon of the ſaid ſucceſſor by
<pb facs="tcp:8963:11"/>
way of reverſion or retour, as they call it. By vertue of this authoritie or arreſt of Parliament giuen to the ſaid noble Prince, our aduerſares doe alledge that by his latter Will or Teſtament, he did inſtitute and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the ſucceſſion of Francoyſe Counteſſe of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, his Neice by Marie his youngeſt ſiſter to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, ſecluding altogether Margaret Queene of Scotland his eldeſt Siſter and her deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Wherunto I reply ſhortlie, firſt by coniectures, next by perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie anſweres.</p>
            <p>It is not probable that a Prince ſo righteous, ſo wiſe, ſo kinde, as King Henrie the eight was known to be, that he ſhould ſo vnkindlie and vnrighteouſlie deale with his eldeſt ſiſter germane, as to ſpoile and degrade her and her innocent ſucceſſion of all honor and exſpectation that God and nature had prouided for them.</p>
            <p>Next, hee could not forget the commendable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of Henrie the ſeaventh, his moſte prudent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who at the contract of mariage made betwixt King Iames the fourth of worthie memorie, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Margaret eldeſt daughter to the ſaid King Henry the ſeauenth: ſundry of his counſel labouring to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſh that mariage, ſaid vnto him, that it might come to the great diſhonour and diſcommoditie of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, in cace, which was verie poſſible, that England ſhoulde fall to bee ſubiect to the Kings of Scotland: Whereunto the ſaid noble Prince anſwered, that in cace it fell out ſo, there was no inconuenient to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:
<pb facs="tcp:8963:12"/>
for as William the Conquerour atteining to the crowne of England, did ioine and ſubiect Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie to England, and not England to Normandy, ſo Scotland beeing the leaſt of the two Realmes ſhould be ſubiected to England, if any ſuch accident ſhould arriue, becauſe the leſſer muſt cede and giue place to the greater. By which anſwere the ſaide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince Henrie the eight knew full wel it was not his Fathers meaning to defraud his eldeſt daughter, nor her ſucceſſion. And therfore it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that hee ſhould haue forget the mind and intention of his magnanime Father, in a matter ſo recentlie and righteouſlie done: and that with his owne ſpeciall conſent and good lyking.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, the ſaid noble King, knowing what torte and wrong his Father had receaued of Richard the 3. by ſuch partiall exceptions made againſt his title, and publiſhing ſo bitter lawes againſt him, he coulde not be ſo obliuious, much leſſe iniurious, as to fall in the ſame error, which both hee himſelfe, and all iuſt men did ſo much abhorre in the perſon of the ſaid vſurper.</p>
            <p>Ferdlie in reſpect that about the ſame time when the ſaid pretended Teſtament is alledged to be made it is certainlie knowne that the ſaid noble King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the eight, did treat a mariage betwixt Prince Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his ſonne &amp; Mary of Scotland his petite Niece, for which cauſe it were out of all purpoſe to think that hee ſhould at one time deale ſo kindelie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindelie:
<pb facs="tcp:8963:12"/>
as vnder pretext of ſuch newe affinitie to preiudge his neareſt Niece, of all her lawfull eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
            <p>Laſt, ſhall we beleeue that King Henrie the 8. who was a miracle, yea a mirrour in his age of all mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence appertaining to a Chriſtian Prince, ſhould haue bene inferior in iuſtice and pietie to Iohn Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas Duke of Millaine, who ſhall bee for euer praiſed for his equitie in preſeruing the prerogatiue of birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.

<pb facs="tcp:8963:13"/>
thereof, vppon remorſe of conſcience before Queene Marie their Soveraigne Lady and her hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Counſel, did depone, confeſſe, and ſweare, that the ſaid Teſtament was neuer ſigned by the ſaid king Henrie, but was ſealed by one William Clerk with the kings ſeale, when as the king was either dead, or in the laſt article or agonie of death, hauing no ſenſe, knowledge, or remembrance: and theſe three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were the Lord Paget, Sir Edmond Montague Knight cheef Iuſtice, and the ſaid William Clerk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixer of the ſeale as is aforeſaid. Vpon which teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſame beeing duelie tried, by all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces requiſit, that it was not by corruption, ſuborning, nor menaces exhibite by the ſaid witneſſes: the ſaide Queene Marie, to the honour of God and her Realm, for defence of the verity, iuſtice, and dignitie of the ſucceſſion Royall, and for auoyding of manie incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenients that thereof might haue enſued by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie of the ſaid pretended Teſtament, cauſed the examplar, memoriall thereof, which was in the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellarie, to be cancellat, lacerate, and deſtroyed as a thing indigne to haue place amongſt the true and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick regiſters of ſo noble a Realme.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8963:14"/>But fearing leaſt prolixitie make mee tedious, I retranche and omitt manie pithie allegations that might be pertinentlie opponed to the aduerſare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerring a more ample diſcourſe vpon this ſubiect, to more leaſure: or rather, to one more verſed in Lawes and hiſtories, nor I am: cloſing this ſection of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linod with a double admiration.</p>
            <p>In the one I cannot enough maruell howe our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries can obiect ſo confidently againſt vs this law poſitiue againſt ſtrangers, ſeeing they think the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Law ſalique ſhould haue no place nor power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their proximitie of blood in France. <hi>Et ſi iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titatis ratio ſequenda eſt, aequalium aequalis eſſe debet conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, &amp; quod ſibi fieri nolunt, alteri facere non debent.</hi> And ſo they ſhould in reaſon think their law tranſmarine, or peregrine, to haue no more authoritie againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ieſtie, nor they would wiſh the Lawe Salique to haue againſt their ſelf according to old deciſions. <hi>Patiendae ſunt Leges quas ipſi tulimus, &amp;, Quod quiſque iuris in alios ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, ipſe eodem iure teneatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My other admiration is, that a Nation ſo wiſe, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick and prudent, ſhould not for-ſee the inquenche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able combuſtion that may bee kindled within their owne bowels by eſtabliſhing, or maintaining Lawes vniuſtlie made againſt iuſt ſucceſſors to their crowne: which kind of partialitie as it hes euer beene the peſt &amp; perdition of all common wealthes vſing the ſame, ſpeciallie of ſuch as haue bene moſt famous and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo can it not in this age produce anie better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb facs="tcp:8963:14"/>
but to diſtract the people vpon diuerſitie of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, to follow diuerſe and dangerous factions.</p>
            <p>Which inconuenient no other Chriſtian Nation had more need to prevent nor the flouriſhing Realm of England: for as they are wealthy, ſo are they much enuied for their felicitie, whereby it cannot faile if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie debate be for their crowne betwixt contrair com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petitors, but their Realme ſhall be a ſtage or playing fielde to all Nations: the one pairtie inuyting ſome forainers to his aide, and his aduerſare dooing the like: knowing that no ſtranger ſhal be vnwilling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, ſome vpon auarice, ſome vpon malice, ſome for both: euerie one already attending to ſet vp their reſt vpon hope to repaire their aduerſe or baſe fortunes, with the ruine of that moſt noble, famous, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Realme, which of old for the fertilitie of the ſoile, and rare bewtie of the inhabitants was called the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme of God, whome of his great mercie with arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vowes and humble ſupplication I implore, long (yea euer) to preſerue them from ſuch deſtanie, dyſaſter, and deſolation.</p>
            <p>As to that where I moſte irreuerentlie and iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie alledge his Maieſtie to bee made incapable by reaſon of a clauſe contained in the act of Aſſociation, made at Weſtminſter, Anno <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

what her Maieſtie did conſent or yeeld vnto in her captiuitie <hi>(&amp; propter metum qui poteſt cadere inſexum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiorem)</hi> is not obligatorie to her ſelf, much leſſe to her innocent ſucceſſor, whoſe title is <hi>Maior omni ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione:</hi> For probation whereof, I will not reckon his auncient deſcent from the Royall blood of England, (as that of Malcolme the 3, called Canmore with the Niece of Edward the Confeſſor before the conqueſt, nor that of King Iames the firſt, with the petite Niece of Iohn of Gant Duke of Lancaſter) but I holde mee at a probation ſo patent and recent, as no man can pretend ignorance or obliuion thereof, affirming (as the trueth is) that his Maieſtie hes the iuſt title <hi>ex v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troque Parente:</hi> For being the vndoubted heire of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet eldeſt daughter to King Henry the 7. he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo be-he vndoubted heritour of the crowne, after the death of Queene Elizabeth her Maieſty preſent, who is the only graff or branche remaining of the maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line deſcent, or of the ſonnes of the ſaid Henry the 7. In whoſe perſon by vertue of his mariage with the righteous heire of the houſe of York, like as hee was the vndoubted heire of the houſe of Lancaſter, the crown of England was infallibly eſtabliſhed, and the two roſes vnited. And the cleerneſſe of this Pedegree ioined with the knowledge I had thereof, maketh my offence ſo much the more inexcuſable, I being a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Of which number although I may without oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation affirme my ſelfe, yet vnflattering my ſelf I muſt alſo confeſſe, that no ſatisfaction, no expiation, no merite of myne preſent or future, can deſerue mercy, without his Maieſties extraordinar grace: for in all degrees that a paſſionat lyer, calumniator, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yea an Atheiſt could in thoght, worde, or write offend his Prince, I haue offended: and in ſuch ſort, as if his Maieſtie ſhall think my crime irremiſſible, hee neither ceaſes to be mercifull, nor no other offender ſhould take occaſion to doubt thereof, becauſe none hes or can offend ſo deſperatlie as I haue done.

(which with great fulneſſe according to my meanneſſe I ſhall alwaies remember) I cannot omit to preſent vnto them this friendlie remonſtrance, wherin the captious interpretations of cunning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherunto I ſhal be ſubiect, cannot impeſhe mee to vtter the ſinceritie of a well affected friend, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the cheef worldly meane to continue their long enioyed proſperitie, is, tymouſlie to ſet their minde vpon the King my Soueraigne (their vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſecond perſon) by giuing vnto him ſome certain ſignification of his due, and of their dutie. For their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is not without probable ſuſpition that their mindes bee inclined and directed ſome other way, whereby his Maieſtie may take iuſt occaſion to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his pairtie by ſome other forraine courſe. It is not yet ſo long agoe ſince the calamitie procured by the doubtful ſucceſſion of the houſes of York &amp; Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, diſtracting that nation in contrair factions, but that the deplorable memorie thereof, may yet ſerue for a preſent caveat and inſtruction. To preuent ſuch dangerous inconuenients, God hes offred vnto them a meane and way, which they may (or rather ſhould) with reaſon, policie, and ſaue conſcience vſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, as a ſingular bleſſing prouided to increſſe their happineſſe, and to continue them in their former ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.

But if confiding in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue Lawes, and in their owne power, they minde to bar him, notwithſtanding his iuſt title, and all other commodities which he might import vnto them, let them at leaſt be terrified from ſuch deſperate indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by example of ſuch as heretofore haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and repented ſuch like machinations. For God Almightie is the authour and autorizer of all right, ſpeciallie in Realmes. For defence whereof amongſt his owne people, he hes not onelie raiſed vp extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarlie both men and women, as Ioſue, Sampſon, Debora, and the reſt of the Iudges to bee his champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but he hes vſed ſpirituall powers, yea ſometyme dumb elements, to execute his vengeance vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt vſurpers with their conſorts and complices.
