            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fresh, hath of late

of, and is of great
Consequence, not only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>Merchant-ships,</hi> but also,
as I conceive, to your <hi>Majesties
Navy</hi> and <hi>Garrisons,</hi> and to <hi>Sea-Port-Towns</hi>
in all parts of the
World, where good Water is
wanting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:31539:3"/>
All that is proper to be said
upon the Matter, will lie in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
good these three <hi>Assertions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> That <hi>Sea-water</hi> may easily,
safely, commodiously, in sufficient
quantities, be made Fresh for all
common Uses at <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> That so done, it is as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
to be Drunk, and us'd about
<hi>Dyet,</hi> as any other <hi>Water</hi> now in
use at <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> That being so, the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi>
are such, as will much more
than countervail the <hi>charge</hi> and
<hi>trouble</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>FOR the Truth of the First,
we have the Reputation of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31539:3"/>
Gentlemen who have your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<hi>Patent</hi> for it, and their
<hi>Interest</hi> also to assure Us. By
an Instrument scarce a yard
over, which may stand under
the Deck of any Ship, or very
well in the Cook-room, and
all Smoak and Fire avoided;
they can make about ninety
Gallons in twenty four hours:
Which at the largest Allowance,
of three quarts to a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kept at constant working,
will serve about a hundred and
Twenty men; although two
quarts a day, or three pints, in
time of scarcity, is counted a
good allowance for one man.</p>
            <p>We are likewise assured,
that it may be done with ease
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31539:4"/>
and ordinary attendance: For
although the <hi>Sea</hi> be <hi>Salter</hi> in
some places than in others, yet
the Operation is the same; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
that which comes first,
and last. And whatever is to
be put into the <hi>Engine</hi> with the
<hi>Water,</hi> may as easily be done,
as <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Oate-Meal</hi> into Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
So that one man may
serve both to make the <hi>Drink,</hi>
and for other uses of the <hi>Ship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> we are also
assured, <hi>That</hi> Sea Water <hi>thus
made Fresh, is as Wholesome to
be Drank, as any Water about
the Town, in its best condition.</hi>
And by an Ingenious <hi>Physician</hi>
of the Colledge, a proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31539:4"/>
hath been made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>This,</hi> and the best <hi>Water.</hi>
And so many of the Colledge,
as were desired, have not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to give it under their Hands,
<hi>That they were satisfied of the
Wholesomness of this</hi> Water.</p>
            <p>Notwithstandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which, to
give the World a little more
express proof of the matter;
I shall, with your Majesties
leave, undertake the same;
which I think, I may the more
properly do, because I have
no share either in the Profit of
it, or in the Credit of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.</p>
            <p>Now, all the Signes, which
either <hi>Physicians,</hi> or common
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31539:5"/>
Experience, have given of the
best <hi>Water,</hi> are these; <hi>viz.
Clearness, Thinness, Sweetness,
Softness, Lightness, Durableness,</hi>
and <hi>Pureness</hi> or <hi>Simplicity;</hi> with
all which good qualities, if this
<hi>Water</hi> stands in the first rank,
I suppose no rational man will
further d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>te whether it be
Good, or <hi>Oo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Clearness</hi> hereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may be pretty well
observ'd in a good <hi>Flint-Glass;</hi>
yet I consider'd, that as there
are degrees of Heat and Cold,
of which our Bodies being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,
can only be judg'd
of by a <hi>Weather-glass:</hi> So there
may be degrees of Perspicuity,
which the Eye, unless assisted,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31539:5"/>
will not easily reach; as may
appear by this easie Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If a few drops of <hi>Claret</hi> be
put into <hi>Fresh Sea-water,</hi> (such
as is made by the <hi>Patentees,</hi> and
with which I made This, and
all the following Experiments)
they will give it a kind of <hi>Light
Hiacynthine Red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But if the
same quantity of <hi>Claret</hi> be
drop'd into as much <hi>River-water,</hi>
and that after the <hi>Water</hi> hath
stood in a <hi>Cistern</hi> to settle a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time, it will look
Muddy; as if a drop of <hi>Ink</hi> had
been put into it; the <hi>Claret</hi>
discovering those <hi>Opacous</hi> parts,
which before were not easily
discern'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:31539:6"/>
The same is likewise an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the <hi>Thinness</hi> of this
<hi>Water.</hi> As is also the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it by <hi>Fire;</hi> for the
very <hi>Boiling</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> is one
way recommended by <hi>Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
and commonly used for
the <hi>Attenuating</hi> of it; that is,
the <hi>Separation</hi> of any <hi>Gross</hi> and
<hi>Heterogeneous</hi> parts, which
swim therein, and upon <hi>Boiling</hi>
use to <hi>Subside:</hi> And the greatest
part of <hi>Rain-water,</hi> which is as
<hi>Thin</hi> as any, is <hi>Distilled</hi> from
the <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its <hi>Sweetness</hi> recommends it,
both as to the <hi>Smell</hi> and <hi>Tast;</hi>
for the best <hi>Water</hi> hath no <hi>Scent,</hi>
neither hath this any. And so
for the <hi>Taste;</hi> 'tis true, a little
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31539:6"/>
               <hi>Alkaline Salt,</hi> in the opinion of
some <hi>Water-Drinkers,</hi> gives a
kind of <hi>Sweetness</hi> or <hi>Savouriness</hi>
to <hi>Water,</hi> as <hi>Salt</hi> to their <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;</hi>
for which cause, I have
known them to prefer <hi>Pump-water</hi>
before any other sort.
But the best <hi>Water,</hi> and that
which is generally, both by
<hi>Water-Drinkers</hi> and others most
esteem'd, is no otherwise <hi>Sweet,</hi>
than in being very <hi>Soft</hi> upon
the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and rather <hi>Insipid;</hi>
and such is this <hi>Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither doth it excel in <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
or <hi>Softness</hi> to the <hi>Taste</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
but also to the <hi>Touch:</hi>
Of which quality, <hi>Dyers</hi> and
<hi>Laundresses</hi> (who are very Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
at their <hi>Finger-ends)</hi> make
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31539:7"/>
the best Judgment in mixing
their <hi>Water</hi> with <hi>Soap.</hi> But a
different degree of <hi>Heat,</hi> or
proportion of <hi>Soap,</hi> will alter
the Case: And therefore, to
make the <hi>Tryal</hi> exact, let half
a Pint of <hi>Pump-water</hi> be War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to a convenient degree,
and half a <hi>Drachm</hi> of <hi>Common
Soap</hi> dissolv'd therein; in doing
of which, it will be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to raise a good <hi>Lather;</hi>
the <hi>Water</hi> underneath it will
look muddy and unequal, as if
it were <hi>Curdled,</hi> and when the
<hi>Lather</hi> falls, it lies on the <hi>Water,</hi>
or any thing it is put upon,
like <hi>Grease,</hi> yet feels <hi>Harsh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same quantity of <hi>Soap</hi>
and <hi>River-water,</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:31539:7"/>
Heated to the same degree, make
a high <hi>Lather,</hi> and that in a short
time, and the <hi>Water</hi> also under
it, is equal and <hi>Clear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which respects, this
<hi>Fresh-Sea Water</hi> doth not only
equal that of the <hi>New-River</hi>
or <hi>Thames,</hi> but excels it: For
besides, that, it is rather <hi>Clearer</hi>
when the <hi>Soap</hi> is dissolv'd; it
also makes as strong a <hi>Lather,</hi>
in a shorter time, and with less
<hi>Soap;</hi> insomuch, that the
Woman I caus'd to make the
Tryals, and compare them,
not knowing whence I had any
of the <hi>Waters,</hi> guess'd that
above a pound and a quarter
of <hi>Soap,</hi> would not go so far
with <hi>Thames Water,</hi> as a pound
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31539:8"/>
would do with this <hi>Fresh-sea-water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Circumstance is,
That if the <hi>Water</hi> be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Good, it will make a very
good <hi>Lather</hi> without being
Heated, which this <hi>Water</hi> will
also do.</p>
            <p>This same <hi>Water</hi> is also as
<hi>Light</hi> as any common <hi>Water</hi>
whatsoever; as may best be
prov'd by a <hi>Water-Poise,</hi> which
the <hi>Italians</hi> commonly use,
when they would try the <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and therein the <hi>Goodness</hi>
of their <hi>Water.</hi> For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I mark'd the neck of one
with several Degrees equally
distant, Immersed it in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31539:8"/>
seven following <hi>Waters;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>In <hi>Thames-water, New-River-water,
Water</hi> distill'd from <hi>Spring-water,</hi>
and in <hi>Fresh Sea-water,</hi>
to the third, or there about.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31539:9"/>
So that it is as <hi>Light,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Water</hi> distill'd,</p>
            <p>Neither is there any <hi>Water</hi>
more Durable or Uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible:
For all Corruption in
<hi>Water,</hi> sheweth it self one of these
four ways; either by some ill
<hi>Taste</hi> or <hi>Smell,</hi> or by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Muddy</hi> or <hi>Turbid,</hi> or by
gathering some <hi>Skin,</hi> or <hi>Bubbles</hi>
at the Top, or by letting some
<hi>Sedement</hi> fall to the Bottom;
none of all which happeneth
to this <hi>Water,</hi> though some of
it hath been kept, both in and
out of the <hi>Sun</hi> for nine Months;
and without all doubt, would
continue so much longer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:31539:9"/>
The last mention'd quality
of the best <hi>Water,</hi> was, its <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
that is, <hi>Simpleness,</hi> or
<hi>Homogenity</hi> of <hi>Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deny not, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
That there is a certain
<hi>Aerea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Nitre</hi> incorporated with
all <hi>Water;</hi> of a different nature
from <hi>Nitre</hi> commonly so call'd,
and such as by no means yet
known, can be visibly sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the <hi>Water:</hi> From
hence, chiefly it is, I conceive,
that <hi>Water</hi> obtains its <hi>Cooling</hi>
quality; and that when it
<hi>Freezes,</hi> it is not because it is
then only impregnated with
this <hi>Nitre;</hi> but because then
the <hi>Air</hi> being Surcharg'd,
throws off a greater quantity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31539:10"/>
into it: As when <hi>Water</hi> is
Sweeten'd or Season'd with a
little <hi>Sugar,</hi> it doth not follow
that there is none in it, because
not enough to make it <hi>Candy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
So there is of this invisible
<hi>Nitre</hi> in <hi>Water,</hi> always enough
to Season it, though not to
make it <hi>Candy,</hi> or turn to <hi>Ice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now allowing this <hi>Nitre,</hi>
that <hi>Water</hi> which in all other
respects is the most <hi>Simple;</hi> is
also justly to be esteem'd most
Wholesom, and always hath
been so. For as the Humours
of the <hi>Eye,</hi> which is the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the <hi>Air</hi> the <hi>Medium,</hi>
by which we discern all <hi>Colours,</hi>
ought to be themselves perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Transparent</hi> and <hi>Colourless:</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:31539:10"/>
So <hi>Water,</hi> which is only a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle</hi>
to our <hi>Food,</hi> should be it
self the most Simple, and
freest from all manner of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
besides those proper to
it as <hi>Water.</hi> For if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
at any time to be <hi>Embued</hi>
with any other <hi>Quality;</hi> it is
with respect to some <hi>Medicinal
Use,</hi> and not <hi>Common Diet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Purity,</hi> or <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genity</hi>
of <hi>Parts,</hi> doth eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong to this <hi>Fresh Sea-water,</hi>
as I shall make it appear several
ways; and therewithall, shew
the Reason of its other <hi>Good
Qualities;</hi> especially, of its
<hi>Softness, Lightness</hi> and <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:31539:11"/>
And first, the reason of its
<hi>Softness,</hi> is its <hi>Purity;</hi> or its
being undefiled with any kind
of <hi>Corrosive Salt,</hi> whether <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
Marine,</hi> or <hi>Acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For upon <hi>Evaporating</hi> of any
hard <hi>Pump-water,</hi> most <hi>Spring-waters,</hi>
and <hi>River-waters,</hi> in a
<hi>Glass-Vessel,</hi> or one very well
<hi>Glased;</hi> it is evident, that the
former contains a considerable
quantity of <hi>Salt:</hi> A <hi>Gallon</hi> from
the <hi>Pump</hi> in <hi>Chancery lane,</hi> which
is the <hi>Saltest-Water</hi> in this <hi>City,</hi>
will yield near three <hi>Drachms:</hi>
Not of an <hi>Alluminous Salt,</hi> as is
commonly thought, but an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline,</hi>
with the <hi>Taste</hi> and other
properties of a <hi>Lixiviall Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:31539:11"/>
That <hi>Spring-waters,</hi> though
they yield more or less of the
same <hi>Salt;</hi> yet in a far less
quantity, and that <hi>River-waters</hi>
yield the least of all: Of which
three sorts of <hi>Waters,</hi> the first
are the <hi>Hardest,</hi> the last the
<hi>Softest</hi> of any in common use;
yet excelled by <hi>Fresh Sea-water,</hi>
as appears by one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Experiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is there any <hi>Marine-Salt</hi>
herein. For whereas half
a Pint of this <hi>Fresh Sea-water,</hi>
or of <hi>River-water,</hi> and half a
<hi>Drachm</hi> of common <hi>Soap,</hi> will
of themselves make a very
good <hi>Lather:</hi> If but twelve or
thirteen <hi>Grains</hi> of common <hi>Salt</hi>
be added to the <hi>Water</hi> before
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31539:12"/>
the <hi>Soap</hi> be dissolv'd therein, it
will <hi>Curdle,</hi> and the <hi>Lather</hi> fall
like <hi>Grease</hi> upon it, as if it
were some <hi>Harsh Pump-water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet any <hi>Acid:</hi> For if
you put but seven or eight
drops of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> into half
a Pint of <hi>River-water,</hi> though
you increase the former quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Soap,</hi> yet it will never
make any <hi>Lather</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Or to come yet nearer;
should any suspect that some
kind of <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> may come
off with the <hi>Water;</hi> if but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight drops of <hi>Spirit of
Salt</hi> be put to half a Pint of
<hi>River-water,</hi> it will, in the
same manner, hinder it from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31539:12"/>
making any <hi>Lather.</hi> Nay, if
but two or three drops be put
into it, they will have the same
effect.</p>
            <p>So the reason why <hi>Fresh
Sea-water,</hi> as prepar'd by the
<hi>Patentees,</hi> is so extream <hi>Soft,</hi> is
its <hi>Purity,</hi> or freedom from all
manner of <hi>Salts,</hi> save only that
<hi>Aereal Nitre,</hi> which is common
to all <hi>Water,</hi> and chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to its <hi>Cooling</hi> quality.</p>
            <p>Or if any one should be so
Pertinaceous, as to say, that
yet there may be one <hi>Grain,</hi>
or part of a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> or
one drop or part of a drop of
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt;</hi> should thus
much be granted, then in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31539:13"/>
same quantity of <hi>Thames-water,</hi>
there is as much, or more;
this being a <hi>Softer Water,</hi> than
even <hi>Thames-water</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Purity</hi> of this <hi>Water</hi>
is also argu'd from its <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
The perfect Dissolution
of any <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> in <hi>Water,</hi>
in never so small a quantity,
adding weight to it. So, for
Example, if half a <hi>Drachm</hi> of
common <hi>Salt</hi> be dissolv'd in a
Pint of <hi>River-water,</hi> the <hi>Water-Poise</hi>
will dip no lower into it,
than into any <hi>Harsh Pump-water.</hi>
So that in a Pint of such <hi>Water,</hi>
there is about half a <hi>Drachm</hi> of
<hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Limy-Earth,</hi> more than
in <hi>River-water:</hi> For although
such <hi>Water</hi> be as <hi>Clear</hi> or <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:31539:13"/>
as any <hi>Distill'd-Water;</hi>
yet in the Evaporation, some
portion of <hi>Earth</hi> is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
together with the <hi>Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewise, if half a <hi>Drachm</hi>
of <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi>
be put to a Pint of <hi>River-water;</hi>
the <hi>Water-Poise</hi> will dip therein,
but to the same Degree, as if
the same quantity of <hi>Salt</hi> had
been put into it.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the <hi>Gravity</hi>
or <hi>Lightness</hi> of <hi>VVater,</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
upon the Dissolution of
more or fewer <hi>Salt, Acid,</hi>
or <hi>Earthy</hi> parts therein: And
that <hi>Fresh Sea-water</hi> is rather
<hi>Lighter</hi> than <hi>River-water,</hi> and
as <hi>Light</hi> as any common <hi>Water</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:31539:14"/>
Distill'd, as hath before been
prov'd: The one is as pure and
free from all kind of <hi>Salt, Acid,</hi>
or <hi>Earthy</hi> parts, as the other.</p>
            <p>From whence, and from its
being void of any <hi>Taste</hi> or
<hi>Smell,</hi> 'tis also easie to conclude
how it is so <hi>Permanent</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible:</hi>
For in this Case,
there can be no <hi>Corruption</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Fermentation;</hi> nor any <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi>
where there is no
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> nor any other <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Principles</hi> to be any way
discover'd: So that as the <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
of this <hi>Water,</hi> is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of its Duration: So this,
with the Premises, an evident
proof of its <hi>Pureness</hi> and <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity;</hi>
which still may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31539:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confirm'd by the following
<hi>Experiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take about half an <hi>Ounce</hi> of
<hi>Syrup of Violets</hi> be Dissolv'd in
half a Pint of some <hi>Harsh
Pump-water;</hi> in a short time,
the <hi>Water</hi> turns the <hi>Syrup</hi> to a
<hi>Muddy Green Colour:</hi> This I
have known to happen to some
<hi>Apothecaries,</hi> as much to their
<hi>loss,</hi> as their <hi>wonder,</hi> from
whence it should proceed. But
the reason was, though they
took sufficient care in picking
their <hi>Violets;</hi> yet not in the
choice of their <hi>VVater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Put a few drops of <hi>Oyl of
Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> to the
same quantity of <hi>River-water,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:31539:15"/>
and then let the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Syrup of Violets</hi> be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
therein, and it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turns <hi>Purple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Syrup</hi> be dissolved
in <hi>River-water</hi> alone; it turns
neither <hi>Green,</hi> nor <hi>Purple,</hi> but
holds its <hi>Blew Colour</hi> perfect;
and so it doth the like, if it be
dissolv'd in <hi>Fresh Sea-water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observing this, I proceed to
make the like <hi>Experiment</hi> with
<hi>Claret-wine,</hi> which I mixed with
several sorts of <hi>VVater,</hi> in some
good quantity, as I did the
<hi>Syrup:</hi> But without any discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
difference between them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:31539:15"/>
But considering that the
<hi>Colour</hi> of <hi>Claret</hi> being very full
and strong, might require a
much greater proportion of
<hi>Water</hi> to over-rule it: I put
three Spoonfulls of <hi>Pump-water</hi>
into a <hi>Flint-Glass,</hi> and drop'd
into it not above seven or eight
drops of <hi>Claret;</hi> which being
well mix'd, I perceiv'd, that
in a little time after, the <hi>Colour,</hi>
instead of being changed, was
wholly vanish'd, and the <hi>Water</hi>
become as <hi>Clear,</hi> as before the
<hi>Claret</hi> was drop'd into it. The
<hi>Alkaline</hi> parts in this <hi>Water,</hi>
destroying the <hi>Acid,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the <hi>colour</hi> of the <hi>Claret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same number of <hi>Drops,</hi>
being mix'd with the same
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31539:16"/>
quantity of <hi>Lambs-Conduit-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
in a <hi>Glass</hi> of the like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
Bigness and Shape; the
<hi>colour</hi> in a short time, did almost,
but not wholly vanish,</p>
            <p>Mix'd in like manner with
<hi>River-water,</hi> it gives a few
<hi>Permanent Rays</hi> of <hi>Red,</hi> but
<hi>Muddy;</hi> as was before observ'd,
and is here again to the present
purpose.</p>
            <p>But being mixed in the same
proportion, and <hi>Glass,</hi> with
<hi>River-water</hi> Distill'd, gives it
a <hi>Light, Clear,</hi> and <hi>Permanent
Hiacynthine Red.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:31539:16"/>
And the same Curious and
Durable <hi>Red,</hi> it likewise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
to <hi>Fresh Sea-water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence, and all that
hath been said before, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
To have the <hi>Clearness</hi>
and <hi>Durableness</hi> of <hi>Spring-water;</hi>
the <hi>Lightness</hi> or <hi>Softness</hi> of
<hi>Rain</hi> or <hi>River-water,</hi> the
<hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> of that
which is Distill'd: And in a
word, all the good Qualities
of the best <hi>Water,</hi> without any
bad one: Which may serve to
satisfy any Reasonable man,
not only to make Tryal of it;
but also to prefer it before any
other now in use at <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet because men will hardly
be brought to leave a known
Road, though a bad one; for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31539:17"/>
a better unknown, till they see
some body go before them:
Therefore, to discharge all
manner of scruple, I must not
omit to add, that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Persons of Quality, and
others, who have Drunk often
and liberally of this <hi>Water;</hi>
and though not much used to
Drink <hi>Water,</hi> yet have receiv'd
no prejudice thereby. And
amongst them, some <hi>Water-Drinkers;</hi>
whom I take to be
the most proper Judges in the
Case, and who give the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of it, <hi>To be very Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;</hi>
and that it will quench
the <hi>Thirst,</hi> as well as any other
ordinary <hi>Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Feazibleness of making
sufficient quantities of <hi>Sea-water
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31539:17"/>
Fresh,</hi> and the Wholesomness
hereof, being granted: The
Advantages which will arise
from the use of it at <hi>Sea,</hi> are
very obvious, with respect,
both to <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, as to <hi>Profit,</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Voyage to be made to
<hi>Surrat;</hi> for which, one Butt of
<hi>Water,</hi> for <hi>Drink</hi> alone, is the
ordinary Allowance for one
man. The quantity being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
laid in, not only according
to the length of this or any
other Voyage; but also for a
Reserve in case of a Calm;
which, if it happen not, they
have commonly more than
enough. So that if we suppose
a hundred men to be in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31539:18"/>
Ship, they will require so many
Butts for <hi>Drink.</hi> Whereas, if
there be no <hi>Water</hi> laid in, but
only an <hi>Instrument</hi> to make it,
as there is need: The <hi>Coals</hi> to
work it a day and half, that is,
to make about a Butt (126.
<hi>Gallons)</hi> of <hi>Fresh Water,</hi> may
be allowed to be something
more than a <hi>Bushell,</hi> which
will be the most; or for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Butts,</hi> to be about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ten <hi>Bushels.</hi> So that
one <hi>Butt</hi> containing fifteen
<hi>Bushels;</hi> a hundred and five
<hi>Bushels</hi> will lie in the room of
seven <hi>Butts.</hi> By which means,
about thirteen parts of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
now taken up for <hi>Water,</hi>
will be gain'd for <hi>Stowage;</hi>
saving that there must be some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31539:18"/>
few <hi>Cask</hi> for receiving the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
as it is wrought off from
the <hi>Engine.</hi> And the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
or near it, may be
made with respect to any other
<hi>Fewel,</hi> which may also be used
as well as <hi>Coal.</hi> Besides which,
the saving the Charge of the
<hi>Butts,</hi> will be very considerable;
the Price of a <hi>Butt</hi> being
twenty Shillings, being bound
with <hi>Iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides which, there are
other particulars, relating to
<hi>Profit,</hi> and the preventing of
<hi>Damages</hi> both at <hi>Sea,</hi> and in
<hi>Sea-port Towns;</hi> upon which
the Honourable Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi>
in his late Book, doth very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
insist.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore conclude with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31539:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the second great Advantage
which will hence arise, and
that is; in point of <hi>Health.</hi>
'Tis true, that <hi>Thames-water,</hi>
when first laid in, hath the
repute of no <hi>Unwholsom Drink.</hi>
And generally, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
good care is taken in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in, both at the best time,
which is at half Ebb: and in
case of great <hi>Tides,</hi> above the
<hi>Bridge,</hi> sometimes as high as
<hi>Chelsey.</hi> And though it <hi>Ferments</hi>
and <hi>Stinks</hi> in the <hi>Voyage,</hi> yet
grows <hi>Sweet</hi> again: And, as they
say, doth not <hi>Stink</hi> all at one time</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which, there
are very few, who would choose
a Suspicious <hi>Water,</hi> that may
have <hi>Spring-water,</hi> if they will,
or that which is as good; or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31539:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
better, if it be true, which some
say, That in a large <hi>Voyage,</hi>
even some <hi>Spring-waters</hi> will
<hi>Ferment</hi> a little. For the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Wine,</hi> or any other use,
it would be no small pleasure
to the <hi>Captain</hi> of a Ship, to be
sure of that which is the best.
And it is as a Rule among the
<hi>Seamen,</hi> that good <hi>Water</hi> shall
be valued, and go as far as
<hi>Brandy,</hi> when they Club toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a Bowl of <hi>Punch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In point of <hi>Health;</hi> perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
while the <hi>Thames-water</hi>
is in the heighth of its
Ferment, even the <hi>Seamen</hi> may
forbear to Drink it. Yet we
have no reason but to believe,
when that is over, before the
<hi>Water</hi> be throughly recover'd,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31539:20"/>
it often goes down well enough
with them; who living in so
Thick and Moist an <hi>Air,</hi> and
having their <hi>Mouths</hi> always
<hi>Fir'd</hi> with <hi>Salt-Meats,</hi> cannot
be very Critical either in their
<hi>Taste</hi> or <hi>Smell.</hi> So that though
the <hi>Scent</hi> and <hi>Taste</hi> of the
<hi>Water,</hi> with respect to the
<hi>Seamen,</hi> is not much to be
regarded, yet their constant
<hi>Drinking</hi> of a <hi>Fermenting Liquor,</hi>
though but for some days, may
be of ill consequence, and for
that time, the more encline
them to <hi>Calentures</hi> and other
<hi>Feavors;</hi> especially near the
<hi>Line,</hi> where they are more
subject to them, and the <hi>Water</hi>
to its highest <hi>Ferment.</hi> For the
maintaining whereof, there is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31539:20"/>
a considerable stock of <hi>Matter</hi>
in the <hi>Water,</hi> how simple so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may seem to be. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that after any long
<hi>Voyage,</hi> it will <hi>Burn</hi> or give a
<hi>Flash.</hi> Whereas <hi>Fresh Sea-water,</hi>
being free from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Inflammatory</hi> and <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Principles;</hi> it can no way
conduce to the production of
the fore-mention'd <hi>Diseases,</hi> but
will rather prevent them.</p>
            <p>But supposing <hi>Thames-water</hi>
were always <hi>Wholsom;</hi> yet the
<hi>Water</hi> in many other places,
where <hi>Ships</hi> are often forc'd to
take it in, is found to be very
bad, and to make the men
<hi>Sick.</hi> An <hi>English</hi> Ship, the
<hi>Faulkon,</hi> in a late Voyage to
<hi>Surrat,</hi> being upon the Coast
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31539:21"/>
of <hi>Malabar,</hi> was there forced
to take in <hi>Water:</hi> Of which, the
men who <hi>Drank,</hi> were taken
with <hi>Fluxes</hi> and <hi>Feavers</hi> of that
ill nature, that of about eighty
five in the Ship, thirteen, or near
one sixth part, died in a short
time, and some languish'd long
under dangerous Distempers.</p>
            <p>And sometimes <hi>Ships</hi> are
brought to that want of <hi>Water</hi>
as neither to have good nor
bad; as in a long <hi>Calm:</hi> Which
though it doth not often conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
so long as to <hi>Kill</hi> the men;
yet, besides the anguish of
<hi>Thirst,</hi> it sometimes makes
way for divers <hi>Diseases,</hi> as a <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
Dysenteries,</hi> or <hi>Cholick,</hi> upon
the first Immoderate Drinking.</p>
            <p>Sometimes also, it is an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31539:21"/>
of great danger both to
<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Ship.</hi> Not long since,
a <hi>Ship</hi> went to <hi>Sea,</hi> betwixt
<hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> pretty well
provided with <hi>Water.</hi> But
meeting with a <hi>Calm</hi> of some
days, the <hi>Passengers</hi> were forc'd
to Row several Leagues to the
<hi>Welsh</hi> shore; in which time, if
a Storm had happen'd, the
<hi>Passengers</hi> had been lost in the
Boat, and the <hi>Ship</hi> in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
had been lost for want of
the Hands that were made use
of in the Boat.</p>
            <p>Nay it hath been known,
that a whole Ship of men have
Perish'd for want of <hi>Water.</hi>
About five years since one came
in Laden with <hi>Tobacco</hi> from
<hi>Virginia,</hi> in which all the <hi>Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:31539:22"/>
were found dead; having
declar'd in a Writing which
they had Nail'd upon the <hi>Mast,
That they had Perish'd for want
of</hi> Water. All which Mischiefs
will be avoided by the constant
supply of <hi>Fresh Sea-water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not only in point of
<hi>Drink,</hi> but also in <hi>Meat;</hi> most
of which now Eaten is extream
<hi>Salt.</hi> For which, all the care
they have at <hi>Sea,</hi> is to Soak it
before it is Boil'd; not in <hi>Fresh-water</hi>
but in <hi>Salt.</hi> For if they
should use <hi>Fresh-water,</hi> they must
lay in near double the quantity,
the <hi>Meat</hi> being commonly
shifted once in four hours, for
three of four times. They say,
indeed, that the Soaking of it
in <hi>Salt-Water,</hi> fetcheth out the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31539:22"/>
               <hi>Salt</hi> better than in <hi>Fresh.</hi>
And for the first or second
<hi>Soaking,</hi> I believe it may; yet
also, that a <hi>Soak</hi> or two in
<hi>Fresh-water</hi> afterwards, will
do best: Which, to keep the
<hi>Meat</hi> from <hi>Stinking,</hi> as at that
time it is apt to do, may be
done so much the sooner.</p>
            <p>But many times the <hi>Sea-men</hi>
are put to straits, as not
only to <hi>Soak</hi> but also to <hi>Boil</hi>
their <hi>Meat</hi> in <hi>Salt-water.</hi> Which
instead of taking any <hi>Salt</hi> out
of it, doth rather add to it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Boiling</hi> of the <hi>Sea-water,</hi>
makes it to become <hi>Salter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from such <hi>Diet,</hi> as
this, what can be expected, but
besides the highest <hi>Scurveys,</hi> a
a Foundation also for <hi>Dropsies</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:31539:23"/>
and divers other <hi>Diseases,</hi> of
which the <hi>Patients</hi> either die
quickly, or are hereby so far
weakned, as with respect to
the Publick, to be worse than
dead: For a man that is dead,
is but one man lost; but one
that cannot work, is not only
lost himself, but also spends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Labours of another. All
which mischiefs will be very
much prevented, by having of
fresh Water enough for all uses
at hand.</p>
            <p>And this, not only by emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of bad Meat, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
in altering the very way
of Diet: For where there is fresh
Water, good Victuals may be
made at any time without Flesh.
This, with Bisquet, Wheat, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31539:23"/>
Rice, and a little Sugar, or But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
will make very good Food.</p>
            <p>I have thus comprized all
that is necessary to be said upon
this matter, in as few words as
I could, that I might not seem
to mis-spend those precious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
whereof your Majesty
hath so few to spare: nor
should I have presumed to have
intrench'd on them at all, had
