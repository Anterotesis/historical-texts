         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bondage and Slavery, here Demonstrated,

Who have a Power and Opportunity put into their

            <p>THere hath been a time when the prudent hath kept si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
but now Wisdom hath opened her mouth,
and will be justified of all her Children, for the
Lord is reviving the Spirit that hath been impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and taking the yoak from off the disciples necks, and is
going on in the Name of his power, to make his creature a free
creature, &amp; his people a free people, and the Nation that serves
him, &amp; obeys his Law, a free Nation; and the thundrings of his
power is gone forth, and his Light is risen to discover and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
that which hath deceived the Nations, and to give a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
unto all, of their freedom from their bondage, and
in what it stands; and that is to be cast out which gendreth to
the bondage of Soul, Spirit or Conscience, in any exercise
of worship, or obedience unto God, which springs from the
measure of his own life, which must not be hindered, nor
quenched by any Law, Power or Pretence whatsoever. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from the free Spirit of Life and Liberty in Christ Jesus,
this is Proclaimed to the whole Nation, and the Nations round
about, to take off their bondage, and to take away their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
which hath lain upon them for want of the Life of
Christ, which is now risen to do its own work, and perfect
its own praise, and to deliver its own seed wheresoever it hath
been in Captivity, the power of life must deliver it, from all
that which causeth shame and reproach, which is the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and transgression of the life of Christ, which is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Cause of bondage to every Nation, which the Lord
hath promised to take away in one day, <hi>Zac.</hi> 3. 9. And his
work and power shall be known by its fruit, <hi>Which is to take
away their sin, Esa.</hi> 27. 9. One great yoak of bondage which
is upon the subjects and seed of God in this Nation, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is, that ministery, which is not free, neither will Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
without money, and the people is not free to hear them,
yet a yoak of bondage is laid upon them, to pay them; and this
iniquity is established by a Law; so here is neither free preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor free hearing, unto which the free Spirit raised up
in this Nation, declareth thus;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102368:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That every one that will Minister, must do it freely, and as
of the Ability which God giveth him, and as the Oracle of
God, and that no profession of people may maintain anothers
Minister; but that there may be a free Preaching, and a free
Hearing among all People, that so it may be a free Nation,
and they that will have Teachers according to their own lusts
and judgements, they to maintain them; and that there
may never any such iniquity be established by a Law, as for
one sort of people to maintain anothers Minister, for this
hath caused heart-burnings, envy and strife, insomuch that
little Justice could be done for the Nation, by reason of the
cry of complainers and oppressors, as at every Parliament,
every high Court, every Assizes, and Sessions, and petty
Courts, there hath some (pretended Minister or other been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Addresses, Petitions or Complaints, and so hath stopt
the Just and Lawful proceedings of the affairs of the Nation;
which interruption may easily be prevented, and the Courts
of Justice freed from such brawling and unceaseable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
which hath been more interruption to Justice, then
any thing in the Nation besides, and hath more hindered the
peoples deliverance from being a free people, and a free Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then any thing in the Nation besides; so let every form
and profession of Religion maintain their own Minister, and
maintain their own Poor, which are crying at their Meeting-house
doors, and in the streets, in the Name of their God,
for some relief, that so there may not be a beggar in <hi>England;</hi>
for herein the Christians in name, are become even a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
among the Heathens, to see their own flesh stand naked
and uncovered in the streets, and Steeple-house doors, and
at their doors, and they turn their ears from the Poor, and
forgets God, and looses the bowels of Compassion, and are not
merciful, as the Father which is in Heaven is merciful; and
so walks not according to the Scriptures, but is a disgrace to
Religion, and even a reproach among the Heathen; so let no
more the cry of the Priests, nor of the poor be heard in our
land; the one crying for Laws, to persecute and receive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of those, who they preach not unto, which receives no
teaching from them; which cry is intollerable, to be heard or
suffered in a free Common-wealth; And the other for want
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102368:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the creatures of God, when as others spend the creatures
of God upon their lusts excessively, and so the Creation is out
of order; but those that are come into the Gospel Ministration,
and to be taught of the Lord, and have received Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
the Lord, and walk in him; it is not so amongst us, for the
creatures of God are not spent upon the lust, nor destroyed;
neither is there a beggar amongst us, who are truly of us, in
the obedience of truth; so that we do not desire that any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or profession in the Nation should maintain our poor, for
they are our own flesh, without respect of persons; for if any of
us have of this Worlds good, &amp; see our Brother stand in need,
&amp; shuts up the bowels of compassion from him, the love of God
doth not dwell in us; neither doth any other maintain those
that Minister unto us the Word and Doctrine; so we according
to the royal Law of Liberty, desire to do unto others, as we
would have them do unto us; and thus to be a free people and a
free Nation. So every form &amp; profession will enjoy their own
Minister, till they come to know Him, unto whom the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the people must be, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ; so that neither Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
Assizes, Sessions nor Courts will have any thing to do
in matters of Religion, but to keep the peace of the Nation;
And then he that hath the Word of God, may speak his Word
faithfully and freely, without interruption; so that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of God may have its free course, and be glorified. And
that great oppression of Tithes (which lyes heavy upon the
whole Nation) which God raised up his Spirit in the Army
once to testifie against, may be taken away, that what was then
pretended may be now fulfilled, and the people eased of their
oppressions which they have long felt the burthen of, and
groaned under, that so (as a free people) they may be delivered
from that bondage, and the Law may be disannulled by which
that bondage is imposed upon them. So this will beget love
in the nation, and all persecution, cruelty and bitterness
will cease, and every one may freely and quietly enjoy the
fruit of his own labour; then with much freedom and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
will every one Minister of his substance unto all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
uses, knowing that the earth and the fulness of it is the
Lords; and when this universal love and free Spirit is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
among people, then will Righteousness establish the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102368:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that will be brought forth, which many sincere
hearts and tender Consciences hath waited for, several years;
and many have been even almost weary and faint, in their
minds, in waiting for that, which they once had a lively sight
of, and hopes to enjoy, in the Lords Promise of Liberty and
Freedom opened in their understandings ten years since, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that some have been ready to tempt God, and say,
that he was slack concerning his Promise; and some, for want
of long patience, hath left off expecting that which they once
believed and hoped for; but God is reviving the hopes of the
contrite ones, and in them that had said, there was no hope
in them, is he renewing strength, to believe that God will
give Judges as at the first, and Councellors as at the beginning;
the Judges at the first, were not to Judge for gifts, nor for
rewards; nor the Priests was not to preach for hire, nor the
Prophets were not to Divine for money, but the Judges did Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
Justice freely between man and man; and the Priests
did Minister the Law freely, which was added upon all trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;
so in those dayes here were no Priests that troubled
the Courts, Judges, nor Councellors, with Addresses, Petitions,
or Complaints for maintenance; no suing at the Law, no
Imprisoning mens persons for wages, nor no spoiling of mens
goods, and there was not such delayes in executeing judgement
upon transgressors as is now, for the Judges sat in the gate,
and executed judgement speedily upon the offender, &amp; cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the land of evil doers, and so every one was to wait on his
Ministry, which he had received from the Lord, and are to do so
now, if they do it unto the Lord; he that judgeth for God, is not
to respect any mans person in judgement, and he that hath the
word of the Kingdom is to Minister it freely, and then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will Minister their carnal things, freely, to every one that
hath need; so that, whereas even from the Priest to the people, al
hath been given to covetousness, strife &amp; debate; every one now
will be given to love and freenesse one to another; for he that
hath spiritual things, will Minister them freely, and he that
hath carnal things, will Minister them freely, and so will all
come from under the execution of the Law, and from all strife
and contention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102368:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Another great oppression, wherein iniquity is upheld by a Law, is in the
Ministration of the Law between man and man, it not being done fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so not, as in the begining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE that doth Minister the Law, let him do it freely for
the Lord, and for righteousnesse sake; and let him be
as one of the Judges in the beginning, and as one of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
whose eyes were not blinded with gifts and rewards;
and so it will come to be a free nation, and then every man
will not seek his own, but every one anothers good, &amp; then will
pure love spring up to one another, &amp; one will seek to preserve
and save another, and not devour &amp; destroy one another about
earthly things as now they do; so Christs spirit will be found
among all sorts of people, Ministers of the Law, Ministers of
the Gospel, and subjects of the nation, which were to save mens
lives, not to destroy them; and then the Scriptures which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be broken will be fulfilled, and peace will be extended as
a river, and righteousnesse as a mighty stream.</p>
            <p>For it is this spirit which I have mentioned, in Lawyer &amp; Priests
(which did) not Minister freely, but for covetous ends hath made
merchandize of peoples souls and estates, that hath broken
the peace of this Nation, as many hath had a deep experience,
even when the Army was in its first purity and zeal for God
and his truth, that spirit did creep into their councels and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
them, and did creep into Parliaments, and corrupted
them, and when there was any appearance of a Monarchy, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
arising in that Nation, that spirit crept into every
high Court, and corrupted it, so that whole Nations are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with that spirit, so that till that spirit be purged out,
there is not like to be a free Nation, or a free people, for it
was that spirit which brought <hi>Israel</hi> into bondage, which
was once a free Nation, and not in bondage to any man,
while the Judges judged freely, and the Priest preached
freely, and the Prophets prophesied freely without mony,
or without price; then was <hi>Israel</hi> a free Nation, and a
free people, and the glory of all Nations; but when the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
judged for giftes and rewards, and the Priests preached for
hire, and the Prophets divined for money; then they became as
corrupt as the Nations of the Gentiles round about them, and
then they came into bondage and captivity, and then profain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102368:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
went forth from the Priests into all the earth, as it doth
from those in <hi>England</hi> which are in the same state; now see
that sin and covetousnesse is a reproach to any people, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 23. and it is that which brings them into
bondage from being a free people; now if none may Minister
the Law, but those that do it freely, as unto the Lord, and as his
Ministers, then that covetous, self-seeking spirit will be
purged out in Judges, Councellors, Lawyers, Attorneys, and
Solicitors, which would devour the creation, to spend upon
their own lusts, that seeks for great places, to inrich themselves
and destroy others, so that equity, Law and Justice is lost, and
the free Ministration of it in this Nation; so that in many cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
a man had better suffer himself to be defrauded, then to
seek to the Law for Justice, the administration of it is become
so corrupt, and the law is so perverted by them, that a man is
not suffered to plead his own cause, but is forced to hire a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
or an Attorney; and men are not suffered to bear a true
and faithful witnesse, nor to have the truth and justnesse of
their cause confirmed by the mouth of two or three witnesses,
without swearing, and so people is still kept in bondage by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and oppression from having the liberty of their pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
and so neither Law, Judges, nor Councellors are now
as at the beginning, nor such as ought to be in a free Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Now whereas in your late proceedings, it is ordered and
granted, that every one shall have their free liberty; first as an
<hi>English</hi> man; secondly, as a Christian, which liberty hitherto
we have not enjoyed; for as <hi>English</hi> men, we have not had our
just liberty in the Nation; first, as concerning the Law; secondly,
