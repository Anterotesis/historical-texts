            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He excellent uses of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> are manifold, yea uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall; for they are good for all spirituall uses and advantages. They have in them Instruction, to increase our knowledge; Spirituall Fervour, to inflame our zeale; Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to refresh &amp; revive our faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing soules; Praiers, to fetch bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings from God; and Praises, to returne to God for his blessings. Yea, the very afflictions of the Saints therein expressed (even their outward sufferings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dejections and desertions) are no small consolations to us. For, by them wee see that fiery Tryalls are no strange matters to Saints, and Saints wee may bee amid all these fiery Tryalls. But


<pb facs="tcp:55891:3"/>
withall, if wee marke the issue of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se Tryalls (often set forth in these Psalmes) then wee cannot but see strong and vehement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of Faith, and of that praier of Faith, which saveth the sick, even those that are sick at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>art: yea, sick at the very soule. For how often doe wee see a sick soule to begin a Psalme, even in the belly of Hell, and yet end it in Heaven? So that a Saints soul being as it were in Hell, yet is neare unto Heaven, if it can be earnest with God in these melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Praiers of Faith. For God, being thus called on, turnes in to the soule; and when God comes into a soule, hee makes a Heaven there, though a Hell were there before. And then naturally (I speak of a godly nature) do arise in the soule high Jubilations and Extasies, and not these onely, but glorious Thanksgivings to God; to whom alone must be ascribed the bringing of light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:


<pb facs="tcp:55891:3"/>
and that voice of joy and gladnesse, which the Saints doe heare even at the same time, when their bones are broken with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
            <p>Briefly, the <hi>Psalmes</hi> are chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters and representations of the thoughts, meditations, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a sanctified soule, throughout all the changes of her pilgrimage; so that a good man can be in no kind of estate, but he shall find his owne estate in a Psalme: and in a Psalme, he may find thoughts and expressions which doe well agree with that estate, and make it good unto him.</p>
            <p>Thus, while the Psalmes are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>itted to all the members of the Catholike Church in all their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, they may be truly called <hi>Catholike Songs,</hi> and accordingly should be ever ready for the use of the truly Catholike members of the Church, in all the changes of their severall estates. And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward


<pb facs="tcp:55891:4"/>
this universall use of them, divers well-affected persons have turned them into their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; and not onely so, but they have turned them also into har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Measures, that they may be still used as Psalmes, that is, as spirituall and heavenly Songs.</p>
            <p>For the advancement of this profitable use, apprehending many years past (which experience hath shewed to be a true conjecture) that a forme wholly new would not please many, who are fastned to things usuall and accustomed (though if Psalms of a new form be read before they be sung, there is no hinderance, but that they may be presently used; and after a little use will grow familiar, as the former) I assaied onely to change some pieces of the usuall version, even such as seemed to call aloud, and, as it were, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably for a change.</p>
            <p>These being seen, it was desired that they should bee increased;


<pb facs="tcp:55891:4"/>
which being done, they are here subjoyned. I doubt not but the reasons of the changes will most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare in the changes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and the <hi>Reader</hi> may easily find, that the places changed might well receive a change, for their <hi>Cadence</hi> or <hi>Currence,</hi> or for some old and abolished words; or, which is more, for agreeing lesse with the new Translation, yea, with the Originall it selfe.</p>
            <p>If hereby any Saint shal receive an increase of light in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or of fervour in his will and affections, I shall desire, first, that God may have the glory, who is the giver of every good gift; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> then, that he will requite the messenger by whom God hath sent him a blessing, with this praier (wherein hee may joyne himselfe as a Partner;) That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from the guilt, spot, and power of sin, and daily renewed in the inner man, amid the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes of the outward, by the free

mercy of a most gracious Father, and the precious Merits of a most sufficient Saviour, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a most holy and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Spirit, hee may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the heavenly Quire of glorified Saints and Angels, and with them sing everlasting <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs,</hi> to the most glorious Trinitie, in eternall felicity.</p>
