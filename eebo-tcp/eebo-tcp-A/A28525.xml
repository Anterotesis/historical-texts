         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:57401:5"/>
And in his Writings he hath diſcovered ſuch a Ground, and ſuch Principles, as do reach into the Deepeſt Myſteries of Nature, and lead to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the higheſt Powerful Natural Wiſdom, ſuch as was amongſt the Ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Hermes Trismegiſtus, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaſter, Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and other deep Men, converſant in the Operative Myſteries of Nature, and the Modern, <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſanus, Raymundus Lullius, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus, Sendivogius,</hi> and others: by which men will be ſatisfied, that not only they have gotten, but that we alſo may get that <hi>Lapis Philoſophorum,</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone, indeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57401:6"/>
Thoſe Principles do alſo lead to the attaining ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as was taught in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in all which Learning <hi>Moſes</hi> had skill; to the Wiſdom alſo which was taught in <hi>Babylon</hi> among the <hi>Caldeans, Aſtrologians,</hi> and wiſemen or <hi>Magi,</hi> with whom <hi>Daniel</hi> was brought up: Alſo to that Wiſdom of the Eaſt, from whence came the Three <hi>Magi,</hi> Mat. 2. 1. who ſaw the Star that led them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where they ſaw the Child Jeſus, and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and ſo returned, with whom God himſelf vouchſafed to ſpeak and direct them what to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57401:6"/>
The Ground and Principles in his Writings, lead to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the wiſdom, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the wiſdom of the Eaſt, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 30, 31. which <hi>Solomon</hi> had, and wrote in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and in a Book (which hath not yet been extant with us in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> but is reported to be found in the Eaſt Countrey ſome few years ſince,) wherein he wrote of all Plants, from the Cedar, to the Moſs that groweth upon the Wall, and of all Living Creatures, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 33.</p>
                  <p>His Ground diſcovereth the way, to attain not only the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Myſteries of Nature, but Divine Wiſdom alſo, <hi>Theoſophie</hi>

the Wiſdom of Faith, which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen with the outward Eys: this Wiſdom bringeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eyes to ſee ſuch things, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw in the Mount, when his Face ſhone like the Sun, that it could not be beheld: ſuch things as <hi>Gehazi</hi> ſaw, when his Maſter <hi>Eliſha</hi> had prayed that his Eyes might be opened, (his inward Eyes, for his outward were as open before, if not more then any of Ours, being he was Servant to ſo great a Prophet) ſo they were opened, and he ſaw Angels fighting for <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſuch things as <hi>Steven,</hi> who ſaw Jeſus

the Soul, it muſt have Charity, or elſe this Seed of Faith will not bear the Fruit of Eternal Life in Paradiſe for ever, where there is Nothing but an Eternal Miracle, of which all Miracles on Earth are but in Part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſhall be done away. This is the Wiſdom by which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought his Wonders above Nature; and all the Prophets from the Firſt along to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and it is that which Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf taught to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter doth continually teach
<pb facs="tcp:57401:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Holy Servants of God ever ſince: and by what is written by this Author, it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that both the ſame Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may be attained now, and the ſame Power of the Holy Ghoſt, by which they ſpeake and wrought their Miracles, and the Cauſe diſcerned why ſcarce any hath been wrought for ſo long a while: yes, men will believe that greater things ſhall be done, as our Saviour tells the Apoſtles, then they ſaw him do: for it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Power in one Man, even of one Thought in a Man, is able to change the whole Univerſe in a Moment:
<pb facs="tcp:57401:9"/>
This Power was in part in the Prophets and Apoſtles, who could raiſe the Dead; and when the time appointed is come, that all the Dead ſhall riſe, that Power will do it, though it ſhould be but as a Grain of Muſtard-Seed in one Man, and reſtore the whole Creature to the Glorious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sons of God: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will be worth our pains, to find ſuch wiſdom as this.</p>
                  <p>By the ſtudy of theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, men may come to know (every one according to his condition, property, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination) how all the real differences of Opinions, of all
<pb facs="tcp:57401:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſorts, may be <hi>reconciled;</hi> even the niceſt Differences of the moſt Learned Criticks in all Ages; that which ſeemeth different in the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Magical Myſtical Chymick Philoſophers,</hi> from that which we find in the Experimental <hi>Phyſicians; Philoſophers, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,</hi> may be reconciled by Conſidering what this Author Teacheth, that the Names which were given to the Seven Planets, do ſignifie the ſeven Properties of the Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are the cauſe of all thoſe things, which are by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Men accounted the firſt and deepeſt cauſes of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57401:10"/>
Alſo thereby the differences in Religion, may be ſo recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, that the Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all doubting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be ſatisfied about Predeſtination, Election, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Corruption, Salvation, and Reſtoration, ſo clearly, that all will love one another, &amp; that hard Leſſon, to love our Enemies, will be readily learnt, and Men will quickly Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the ſtudying that one neceſſary thing, that Treaſure hid in the Field, that Gold of the Kingdom of Heaven, that Precious Pearl, that All in All, Faith and Love, and Chriſt, and God, when they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:57401:10"/>
that all this lyeth hid in every Soul, in one Meaſure or other, and may be found, and the way ſet down ſo plain, that every Soul may find it.</p>
                  <p>Thereby the Writings of all Men will be underſtood, even the very darkeſt Myſteries, conteined in the VVritings of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, will be made plain and eaſie to the ſimpleſt Thirſty Soul; and then when that appeareth which is now hidden, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Glory, every one will not only ſee it, but walk in the way that leadeth to it, and ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in the higheſt Degree of every ones capacity and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57401:11"/>
While this Wiſdom is growing, it will ſo reform the Laws, the degrees in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation, that at length, the whole World will be governed in Peace to the joy of all.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will think this impoſſible, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that if they be told of a Curious City, and of the incredible things that are done there, by him that hath been there, and ſeen what he relateth, and he deſcribe the way ſo plain, that they may come thither themſelves, wil they not go? that they may know as well as he that told
<pb facs="tcp:57401:11"/>
them: do ſo by this Author; Read this Book diligently, and ſeriouſly, till you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the meaning but of ſome part of the way he here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, which may eaſily be done, and you will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the things are true, and that the way he ſheweth is true, and be able to walk in it; and alſo be very thirſty to labour in that way, more and more, till you attain your whole deſire: and then you will keep it as the beſt Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, a Memorial of all Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>But let every one read it themſelves, whether it be the
<pb facs="tcp:57401:12"/>
higheſt King that ſitteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Throne, or the meaneſt Maid that grindeth in a Mill, or hear it read with their own Ears, if they mean to partake of this ſo high a gift from the moſt High, or elſe the Devil may eaſily bereave them of it.</p>

                  <p>IF we knew the pretiouſneſs of our own Souls, we would confeſs and acknowledge with an inward feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs, the Anſwer to Chriſt's Queſtion, when he ſaid; <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man to gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul? Or, what ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> The Soul is ſo pretious that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can truly be valued at ſo high a Rate. To ſave it is the greateſt Gain, to loſe it is the greateſt loſs: then who will not highly prize the ſtudy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the way to ſave it? Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that will ſave his Soul ſhall loſe it, and he that will loſe his Soul ſhall ſave it:</hi> but who underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this? We know it is the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of every Soul to be ſaved, and to be happy and glorious, but the way is
<pb facs="tcp:57401:13"/>
very unknown to us poor fallen Souls, for we can hardly ſuppoſe that loſing will be the ſaving of our ſelves: Chriſt alſo taught <hi>that the way to Glory was through many tribulations &amp; Death;</hi> this way he entered into Glory, and ſo have all the Bleſſed from the beginning of the World, and can no otherwiſe to the end thereof: but how ſhall a Soul know the way to loſe and deny it ſelf, ſo that it may aſſuredly attain Eternal Salvation? Let it liſten, in its Heart and Conſcience inwardly to that Teacher, which it ſhall find there, who is God himſelf: We have the Teſtimony of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> for this; who told the Iſraelites, <hi>The Word, the Commandment is nigh thee, in thy Heart and in thy Mouth</hi> (not the outward but the inward Heart and Mouth.) As alſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Romans, That Chriſt <hi>the</hi> Eternal Eſſential <hi>Word</hi> of God, <hi>the Word of Faith which they,</hi> the Apoſtles <hi>preached, is nigh us, in
<pb facs="tcp:57401:13"/>
our Hearts and in our Mouths:</hi> and in another place he ſaith, <hi>Do you not know that Chriſt is in you, except you be paſt reproof, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> improbi? Futhermore the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God is love, and he that loveth; God dwelleth in him and he in God,</hi> which we all perceive is true, for <hi>in him we live and move and have our Being;</hi> And this may be known, though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had not ſaid ſo much, for one of the Poets of Old ſpake what he knew, and ſaid, <hi>We are all of his Off-ſpring,</hi> as the Apoſtle mentioneth it: Nay we all know that be that doth well is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, but he that doth Evil is the Servant of the Devil who ruleth in his Heart: And though there is none that doth Good, no not one, nor can do <hi>of himſelf,</hi> while he is in this Mortal-Life, yet through Chriſt in him, he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do well, and be ſorry when he hath been drawn away to do evil by the Luſts of his own Heart, by which the Devil
<pb facs="tcp:57401:14"/>
tempteth us to do Evil; but if we will reſiſt the Devil he will flie from us, if we will leave off to do evil, and deſire, trie, and learn to do well, without doubt we ſhall be able through God that dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us: and then he will teach us all things, and lead us into all Truth by his Spirit. All this we ſhall fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and all Myſteries, when God ſhall manifeſt himſelf in us, if we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire it with all Humility, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, loſing of Our Souls, and being Nothing in our ſelves; for then God will be All in All, and nothing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with God: All this, and much more hath the Author of this Anſwer to theſe Queſtions concerning the Soul, found true, and hath out of his inward Myſtery manifeſted many things in this, and other Writings of his, the knowing whereof will be exceeding uſeful to the furtherance of the Salvation of every Soul; which when I had read, I was very much ſatisfied in my own Soul, and
<pb facs="tcp:57401:14"/>
do deſire that others may be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of them, ſo far as lyeth in me: I have therefore taken in hand to put this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe into Engliſh, which I choſe to do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the Original then out of any Tranſlations, becauſe they many times come ſhort of the Authors own meaning, and becauſe I found many Errours in ſome of them, and he is ſo deep in his Writings, that we have need to deſire that our Souls may be put into ſuch a condition as his was in, elſe they cannot be fully underſtood: But the ſame God, that ſatisfied his deſires, will ſatisfie ours, if we caſt our ſelves upon him in Our Souls, and let him do with us what he pleaſeth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>JAcob Behme</hi> was born in the year, 1575. at <hi>Old Seidenburg,</hi> diſtant about two Miles from <hi>Gerlitz,</hi> a City in <hi>Upper Luſatia,</hi> highly Eſteemed by Learned Men: His Parents were <hi>Jacob</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; <hi>

In his youth he kept Cattel, and at length by advice of Friends was ſent to School, where he learned to Read and Write, together with the Fear of God; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was put to the Handicraft Trade of a Shoomaker; when he became Maſter of his Trade in the year, 1594. he marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Maid, one <hi>Catharine</hi> the Daughter of <hi>John Kunſhman</hi> a Butcher of <hi>Gerlitz,</hi> with whom he lived quietly and well for thirty
<pb facs="tcp:57401:15"/>
years together, and had four Sons, that learned Handicraft Trades.</p>
                  <p>Being from his youth inclined to the fear of God, and very diligent in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting to hear the Preaching of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he was at length ſtirred up by that ſaying and promiſe of our Saviours, <hi>Lube</hi> 11. 13. Your Heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him for it, and becauſe of the very many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in Religion, about which he could not ſatisfie himſelf, he was moved, in ſimplicity of Heart or Spirit, inwardly ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and unceſſantly to pray or ask ſeek and knock, that he might know or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the truth; whereby then according to the Divine Drawing and will in the Spirit or Heart, he was rapt into the Holy <note n="*" place="margin">Inward Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Reſt and ſatisfaction in his Soul.</note> Sabbath, wherein he continued ſeven whole dayes by his own Confeſſion, in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Joy. Afterwards, when he was come to himſelf, and having put off the folly of Youth, he was driven by Divine Zeal, vehemently to reprove all ſcandalous reproachful and blaſphemous Speeches, and withdrew from all unſeemly matters and actings with earneſtneſs for
<pb facs="tcp:57401:16"/>
Love to Vertue: By which way and Life, being contrary to the courſe of the world, he became but their ſcorn and deriſion. During which time he mentained himſelf with the labour of his hands in the ſweat of his Brows, till the beginning of the ſixth Seculum or Age, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1600. when he was a ſecond time touched by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, and by a ſudden Glimps of a Pewter Veſſel, he was introduced into the Inward Ground or Center of the Hidden Nature.</p>
                  <p>He not being yet ſufficiently ſatisfied with this, went forth into the open fields, and there perceived the wonderful or won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-works of the Creator in the Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Shapes, Figures and Qualities or Properties of all created things, very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly laid open; whereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with exceeding Joy, kept ſilence, praiſing God, and ſo contentedly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf therewith for a while.</p>

                  <head>Then followeth in the former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face Printed, <hi>1647.</hi> Thus.</head>
                  <p>IF it were not for the great Fruit that I conceive may grow to every one that ſtudieth it; I ſhould be ſorry that I am the Inſtrument, to make ſuch things known in my Native Language; and much more unwilling it ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the view of ſo many various Minds, as are now ſprung up: But my hope is, Goodneſs will get the upper Hand, and that the Fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will prevail to the ſubduing of the Luſts of the Fleſh: Now I readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Cenſure of thoſe who have that good deſire; and of thoſe who are not proudly and perverſly wedded to their own conceits, (when they have conſidered this Authors meaning) whether this will not be as beneficial to us as it hath been
<pb facs="tcp:57401:21"/>
to other Nations: Indeed my Mind is led to think, that our troubled doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls may receive much Comfort, leading to that inward Peace which paſſeth all underſtanding; that all the diſturbing Sects and Hereſies ariſing from the Darkneſs and Malice of Men and Devils, will be made to vaniſh and ceaſe, by that underſtanding which may be kindled in them from it: they that rule will perceive how to effect all their good purpoſes, to the joy and happineſs of them that are ſubjected to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; And Subjects will ſoon learn to obey in every thing, as the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Martyrs did, though they ſhould live under ſuch Governours as they had: So God ſhall be glorified by all mens love to one another, and Peace will flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh over all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſome will think it ſo hard to attain the underſtanding of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, when they read the Anſwer to the Firſt Queſtion (which is far more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

then any of the other, becauſe it contains the ſum of them all in brief) that they will forbear to take ſo much pains as they ſuppoſe is requiſite; but if it ſhould prove a little harder then other writings, the profit will counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the Labour with a hundred-fold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; yet let every One read it themſelves, or hear it read with their own Ears, that others miſreport, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them not from ſo great a benefit, and they ſhall no doubt attain it, for I am convinced by my own Experience, that every one may receive according to their vaſt or narrow Capacity, who have according to my own Meaſure been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, though I be</p>

                     <hi>Before the Catalogue to the</hi> 40. <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was this Preface to the Reader.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Author wrote this Anſwer to theſe Queſtions, chiefly for his Friends ſake that ſent them to him, as alſo for the Benefit of all ſuch as love the knowledge of Myſteries: this Friend of his was Doctor <hi>Balthaſar Walter,</hi> who travelled for Learning and hidden Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in his return home, hapned to hear of this Author in the City of <hi>Gerlitz,</hi> and when he had obtained acquaintance with him, he rejoyced that at laſt he had found at home in a poor Cottage, that which he had travelled for ſo far, and not received ſatisfaction: then he went to the ſeveral Univerſities in <hi>Germany;</hi> and did there collect ſuch Queſtions concerning the Soul, as were thought and accounted Impoſſible to be reſolved ſundamentally and convincingly: which he made this Catalogue of, and ſent to this Author, from whom he received theſe Anſwers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſire, wherein he and many others that ſaw them received full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57401:23"/>
When this Book was firſt Printed, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by a Friend to preſent one of them to his Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> that then was, who vouchſafed the peruſal of it; about a Month after was deſired to ſay what he thought of the Book, who anſwered that the Publiſher in Engliſh ſeemed to ſay of the Author, that he was no Scholar, and if he were not, he did believe that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was now in Men, but if he were a Scholar, it was one of the beſt Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever he read. I need not add the Cenſure of any other Perſon: knowing none to compare with this one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>THis outward World is to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, the beſt Looking-Glaſs to ſee what ever hath been, is or ſhall be in Eternity. Our Minds and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations therein, are our beſt Inward Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs, to ſee Eternity exactly in: <hi>In God are all things,</hi> therefore every thing hath been in all Eternity in God both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifeſted, and manifeſted only to himſelf in himſelf: but in the world and in our Minds they are unmanifeſted and hidden, and alſo Manifeſt or capable of being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in their real Truth and Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both as they are uncreaturally in God, and Creaturally in all things. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly one Text ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>The Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of him, that is, his Eternal Power and God head</hi> or Deity <hi>are ſeen by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, being conſidered in his works.</hi> Rom. 1. 19. And another ſays, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is poſſible to be known of God, he hath manifeſted in Man.</hi> John 17. 3. <hi>And it is life Eternal to know thee the only True God, and</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57401:24"/>
                     <hi>him whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> ſayes the Son of God himſelf Chriſt Jeſus. The Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infinite Powers both of Light and Darkneſs in their own Immenſities in God have alwayes been the ſame, and have Eternally wrought the ſame effects, and produced the ſame Subſtances Spiritually, and Inviſibly to any thing but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which they are Manifeſted to do in the inviſible inward world of God, Spirits and the Minds of Men, and in this viſible outward world; So that we may truly learn to know him who is all things, in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward World: all things that are manifeſted come out from him, and when they ceaſe to be manifeſted, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into him again as into their Center un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifeſted: So he is the cauſe of all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and when we know how he cauſes any thing to be, as it is manifeſted to be in it ſelf, then we underſtand the Thing, and him that is the cauſe of it: his works in all things whatſoever are good, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe to be ſo, but when a Creature to whom he has given the power of the World to come, doth uſe it otherwiſe then its true property requires, that only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes evil in and to the Creature not in
<pb facs="tcp:57401:24"/>
God. But God being every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his Total fulneſs, as himſelf ſayes, <hi>Am not I he that filleth all things?</hi> therefore the higheſt cauſe of every thing muſt needs be in the thing it ſelf. The inward heavenly and Helliſh Looking-Glaſs is in all our Minds, &amp; outwardly we want not a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Looking-Glaſs of whatſoever is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to inſtruct our Minds withal. So that if we conſider all the Works of God in the World, both inwardly and outwardly, we cannot but find and know him, and ſo know all things in our ſelves and in Him, and him in our ſelves, &amp; in all things elſe. This I thought convenient to hint in brief as an Introduction of the mind into the Center of All Myſteries.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. And though indeed we <hi>cannot</hi> ſay of God, that the pure Deity is Nature, but Majeſty in the number <hi>Three;</hi> yet we muſt <hi>ſay,</hi> that God is <hi>in</hi> Nature, though Nature doth not contain or comprehend him, as little as the Air can contain or comprehend the glance or ſhining of the Sun; yet we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57401:30"/>
muſt needs ſay, that Nature is <hi>generated</hi> in his Will, and is a Seeking, proceeded out of the Eternity:</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For, where there is no Will, there is alſo no Deſiring: But there is in God, an Eternal <hi>Will,</hi> which is Himſelf, to generate his Heart or Sonne; and that <hi>Will,</hi> maketh the ſtirring or the <hi>exit</hi> out of the will of the heart, which is a Spirit: ſo that the Eternity ſtandeth in <hi>Three</hi> Eternall <note n="*" place="margin">Different or diſtinct kinds or manners of Subſiſtences.</note> Forms, which are called <hi>Perſons,</hi> as we have very exactly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the <note n="†" place="margin">Threefold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life.</note> third Book.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And ſince we ſee and know, that there is not only <hi>Light</hi> and Majeſty, but alſo <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as is plain before our eyes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Therefore we ought to know, from whence <hi>Darkneſs</hi> originateth; for in the Eternity without or beſides Nature, <hi>no</hi> Darkneſs can be; for there is nothing that can afford it; we muſt only look into the Will, and into the Deſiring; for a Deſiring is an <hi>attracting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. And whereas yet in the Eternity it hath nothing, but only it ſelf, it <hi>attracts</hi> it ſelf in the Will, and maketh the Will fall; and that is its Darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57401:31"/>
10. Whereas otherwiſe if it were not <hi>deſirous,</hi> it would be nothing but an Eternal ſtillneſs without Being or Subſtance; the attracting therefore maketh <hi>Mobility</hi> and Eſſence, which otherwiſe in the ſtillneſs cannot be; and therefore <hi>alſo</hi> it maketh auſtere aſtringency, hardneſs, and groſneſs, as alſo ſharpneſs.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Yet we cannot ſay neither, that the Darkneſs <hi>ſwalloweth</hi> up the Light, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternal Liberty: for that which is Eternal, ſuffereth not it ſelf to be <hi>altered</hi> or changed: but we muſt ſay, that Light and Darkneſs are <hi>IN One another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now the Light is good, and hath pleaſant vertue or power; and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath auſtere or aſtringent, hard, cold; and the Wills Deſiring, maketh Eſſences and <hi>attracting,</hi> that is, a ſtirring in the hardneſs: thus the attracted ſtirreth from the drawing, and is a whirling, whereby in the ſharpneſs, Light and Darkneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>mingled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. And thus we are to conſider, how the free Light in the ſharp ſtirring, in the Subſtance is alſo ſharpned, where we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Fire flaſh of Lightning, and the earneſt ſeverity, and yet cannot ſay that any rending aſunder is there:</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57401:31"/>
14. For that which is Eternal from no beginning, hath <hi>no parting</hi> of one from another, but ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as a <note n="*" place="margin">Wheel or Orb, or Sphear, or Globe of Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs.</note> 
                     <hi>Wheel,</hi> that generates it ſelf in it ſelf; as you have a ſimilitude of it, in the <hi>Mind</hi> of a man, where there is indeed a will of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and flying, but no departing away; and the greater the will is, the greater alſo is the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and the more <note n="†" place="margin">Or, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</note> potent is the matter or the thing repreſented, ſeeing it is ſharpned.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Thus ſeeing the ſtill liberty, which is neither Light nor Darkneſs, becometh <hi>ſharpned</hi> in the ſharp deſiring &amp; attracting, ſo that it appeareth as a flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſhineth.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Therefore alſo we cannot ſay, that the Liberty holdeth or captivateth the Light, for from Eternity it hath had <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> but we may well ſay, that the Light and the Glance <hi>ſhineth</hi> in the Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. For that which is <note n="*" place="margin">Or, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent.</note> free, letteth in the Light; but that which is not free, as the harſh or auſtere aſtringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which maketh Darkneſs, and is Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; ſpoken after a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> manner, that receiveth not the Light.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57401:32"/>
18. But we may well ſay, that which is meek, and not holding or contracting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Light: as ye ſee in water, which receiveth the Light, and the harſh aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Earth, <hi>not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Alſo ye have in <hi>FIRE</hi> a ſufficient <note n="†" place="margin">Or Example or Inſtance.</note> 
                     <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> of the Subſtance of all Subſtances; for ye ſee that the Fire burneth out of a <hi>harſh</hi> aſtringent, tart, matter, for it is the ſharp Deſiring, which thus as a great <hi>Anguiſh</hi> entereth into it ſelf, and graſpeth after the Liberty, whereby it catcheth the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a <hi>flaſh,</hi> and with the Lightning kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it ſelf, ſo that it burneth or <hi>flameth.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <p n="32">32. Thus there is in the Eternity ſuch an Eye, which is God himſelf, and yet is not <hi>called</hi> GOD, but Eternity; yet as to the Eye, is A and O.

                     <p n="34">34. Now the Eye maketh the Globe, and is the Globe; and all this is together in the <hi>Will</hi> to ſeek it ſelf, and ſo to <hi>ſee</hi> what the Eternity is, which becometh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt or revealed in the Eye.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. For the Eye maketh a beginning and an end, and yet there is nothing that affordeth it, but in giveth or affordeth it ſelf, and is from Eternity in Eternity, and the <hi>Eternity it ſelf;</hi> it toucheth nothing, for it is in nothing, but in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="36">36.

                     <p n="37">37. The will of the Eye is <hi>ſtill</hi> or quiet, and the deſiring of the will maketh it full, and the Eye remaineth free in it ſelf; for it is from Eternity, <hi>free:</hi> and that we call the Eternal <hi>Liberty</hi> in all our Writings.</p>

                     <p n="58">58. And this, My beloved Sir, is the <hi>Higheſt Mystery,</hi> and therefore if you will find this, ſeek it not in me, but <hi>in your ſelf;</hi> but not in your <note n="*" place="margin">Outward Reaſon.</note>

                     <p n="59">59. And I exhort you brotherly, that you would not ſo toylſomely ſeek it; you will not fathom it ſo with ſearching, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you are known and beloved of God: and therefore alſo this is given you for a Rule or Meaſuring-line.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. Yet I have no power without me to give you; only follow my advice, and go out from your toylſome ſeeking in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> into God's Will, into God's Spirit, and caſt the outward Reaſon away; then is your Will <hi>God's</hi> Will, and God's Spirit will ſeek you <hi>within</hi> you.</p>

Let no fear deterre you, there is nothing can take it away but <hi>Your</hi> Imagination, let not that into your Will, and then you will work God's Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in his Spirit; and acknowledge me as a Brother in him, elſe I ſhall be as one ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or mute to you.

                     <p n="69">69. But now it is, ſo that the <hi>hidden thing</hi> ſhall be found, not by me alone, but by many who will be faithful, and humble themſelves in God, and ſeek in his Spirit and Will.

                     <p n="70">70. Seeing then the Eternity is thus, which yet is NOTHING; but therein is Light and Darkneſs, Life and Spirit, which is ALL; therefore there is and muſt be in both a ſeeking, <hi>viz.</hi> a deſiring continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to find it ſelf, where yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can find but the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="72">72. Now this is in <hi>Two</hi> wayes, one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Light,</hi> and one according to the <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> for the Seeking is in <hi>both,</hi> and yet there is no departing of one from the other: thus the Light is in the inward, and the Darkneſs in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; whereas yet the moſt inward of all, is alſo the moſt outward; but the Light is the middlemoſt.</p>
                     <p n="73">73. For it is in nothing, therefore it cannot be the <hi>innermoſt</hi> of all, for it hath no place or <hi>limit,</hi> it is its own finding, which the Darkneſs findeth not; but the will in the Darkneſs, which deſireth the Light, that goeth forth out of the Darkneſs, and that ſtandeth <hi>Eternally</hi> in the Light.</p>
                     <p n="74">74. Now the Light's deſiring, ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſelf a Model of its likeneſs, wherein the Eternity ſtandeth revealed or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, <hi>viz.</hi> all and every thing which the Spirit in the Eternal Power of God from Eternity in Eternity <hi>findeth</hi> in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. That Model is <hi>not</hi> God, the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

it ſelf, for it beginneth it ſelf in the Spirit, and is the Spirits wonder, which it from Eternity ſeeketh and findeth, and ſtandeth in Gods Eye as a <hi>Figure,</hi> and all Wonders of the Abyſſe of Eternity are therein, and become ſeen in the Light of the Majeſty, as one Wonder in many end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Wonders.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. And that is an Image of God, a <hi>Virgin</hi> full of purity, and chaſtity, and no Genetrix, for the holy Spirit alone openeth the Wonders in the Power.</p>

                     <p n="78">78. For it is without Ground and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as alſo unmeaſurable, as the Eye of God it ſelf is: there is Nothing like it, alſo Nothing can be found that may be likened to it; for it is the <hi>Eternal Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of the Deity, and the Spirit of God is its <note n="†" place="margin">Weſen, <hi>matter or work.</hi>
                        </note> ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                     <p n="79">79. It is a Circle and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, which openeth to us our mind, ſo that we behold it, and God IN it, for our will is caſt into it, and it ſtandeth in our
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57401:41"/>
will; and therefore ſpeak we of God, and ſee him in himſelf as in that which is our <hi>own,</hi> according to the hiddenneſs of the Humanity; which Seeing is very highly dear and pretious.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. Thus we ſhould alſo ſpeak as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Darkneſs, which is in it ſelf a bolting in, and there being nothing to bolt, it bolteth it ſelf, and generateth it ſelf, and is its own <hi>Enemy</hi> to it ſelf, for it maketh its own ſource or pain without Ground and Number, and hath no Giver that beſtoweth it, but the Darkneſſe's own <hi>Form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="81">81. And that originateth from the Firſt Deſiring, where the Deſiring <hi>attracteth</hi> into it ſelf, and impregnateth it ſelf, ſo that it is a ſtinging bitter aſtringent, or harſh, hard, cold, fierce, wrathful fire-ſpirit; for the Deſiring maketh aſtringent, auſtere or harſh from the attracting in the Will, and the attracting is ſtinging, and the ſuffering is bitter, which the Will willeth <hi>not,</hi> and thereupon in it ſelf goeth forth from the ſting, and maketh a Principle of its own; in which the Majeſty appeareth.</p>
                     <p n="82">82. Thus exiſteth in the bitter ſuffering, the great Anguiſh, whereas yet nothing is there that ſuffereth, but it is in it ſelf <hi>thus,</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57401:42"/>
and it is its own Life; and if this were not, the <hi>Glance</hi> of the Majeſty would not be neither, the one is the cauſe of the other, for in the Darkneſs is the flaſh of Lightning, and in the Liberty the Light with the Majeſty.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. And this now is the parting, that the Liberty is a ſtill nothing; which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty receiveth the Light, and maketh the Darkneſs <hi>Material,</hi> whereas yet there is no ſubſtance of palpability; but dark ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power, a filling of the Liberty in it ſelf, underſtand <hi>in</hi> the Deſiring not without, for <hi>without</hi> is the Liberty.</p>
                     <p n="84">84. Therefore is God the moſt ſecret, and alſo the moſt revealed; and that is <hi>Myſterium magnum,</hi> the great Myſtery. Thus the Abyſſe is alſo ſecret, and yet revealed, as the Darkneſs is before our eyes; but the ſource or pain is unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or unperceptible, till the will <note n="†" place="margin">Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</note> diveth thereinto, then it becometh felt and found, when the will <hi>loſeth</hi> the Light: and herein lyeth the ground of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, or true Faith. Let this be told you ye Teachers in <hi>Babel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="85">85. Since then there is an Abyſſe, which is called the Ground, in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57401:42"/>
of the Darkneſs, where the ſource or pain is as a cauſe of the Life <hi>within:</hi> for the fierce wrathfull ſlaſh of Lightening, is the awakening of the Life; whereas there is nothing there but in it ſelf, therefore it is alſo a Deſiring, and the Deſiring is a Seeking, and yet can find nothing but a <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> and a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the dark, fierce, wrathful ſource or pain, wherein <hi>nothing</hi> is.</p>
                     <p n="86">86. For it is a <note n="†" place="margin">Or, Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</note> figure of the earneſt, ſevere, fierce, wrathful flaſh of Lightning, and of the ſharp and ſtrong Might, which is God's, according to which he calleth himſelf, <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 4. 24.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p n="87">87. This Looking-glaſs is <hi>alſo</hi> without Ground, without Beginning and End, and yet hath an Eternal Beginning and End, and is the Eternal Only Cauſe that the Abyſſe is Blew Dusky and Fiery. It is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Stars and Elements; for the Firmament is the other or ſecond Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs generated out of <hi>this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="88">88. Since then there is in all things a Threefold Source, one whereof is the others <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> Generating and Cauſe, nor

thing excepted, All ſtandeth according to the Subſtance or Working of the Number <hi>Three.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="89">89. Now ſeeing there is a Looking-glaſs in the Abyſſe, wherein the ſource or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beholdeth it ſelf, therefore that alſo is a figure and image of the ſource or quality, which ſtandeth before the ſource or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and <hi>acteth</hi> or generateth nothing, but is a Virgin of the ſource quality or pain, wherein the fierce Wrath of the flaſh of Lightning diſcovers it ſelf in <hi>infinity</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Number, and continually openeth its wonders therein, with the bitter ſpirit of the ſtirring Eſſences, which in the flaſh of Lightening hath its Life, ſo that it goeth <hi>ſwifter</hi> than a Thought.</p>
                     <p n="90">90. Though indeed the <hi>THOUGHTS</hi> of the Creatures ſtand and move herein; and the Spirits of all living Creatures are with their Root ſtanding herein, every Life according to its Principle.</p>
                     <p n="91">91. And in this Spirit of the fire-flaſh, ſtandeth the Great Omnipotent Life, for it is conſuming, as the flaſh of Lightning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the Darkneſs, and that Fire all things, and yet continueth a Life in it ſelf, but it is an Hunger and Thirſt, and <hi>muſt</hi>

                     <p n="93">93. Since then there is ſuch an Eye of the fierce Wrath, wherein the earneſt ſevere ſtern fire-life originateth, yet is not at all <hi>ſundred</hi> from the Fire-Life, it is One and the ſame Life, and hath Two Principles; for it burneth in a twofold ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, one within another, and is One Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in <hi>Two</hi> diſtinctions with two Wills, the one dwelling in the Fire, the other in the Light.</p>
                     <p n="94">94. And know for certain aſſuredly that the Dark Fire-Life is the the Abyſſe of <hi>Hell,</hi> for it is the ſtern ſevere Anger of God.</p>
                     <p n="95">95. And ſeek it not ſo, as <hi>Babel</hi> the

In the <note n="†" place="margin">Three-fold Life.</note> Third Part of our Writings, it is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed, for that is ſomewhat <hi>eaſier</hi> to reach than this; but this is the deepeſt Ground of Eternity, as much as a Spirit can be capable of, for more it CANNOT bear, yet it may be expreſſed much more at large, but not more deeply, for it is comprized in the Abyſſe in both Principles; as indeed a Soul originateth in the Abyſſe in both Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and in the ſpiritual Will in the <hi>Eternity.</hi>

Thus then ſeeing <hi>Two</hi> Principles ſtand in <hi>One</hi> Subſtance, as none with reaſon can ſpeak againſt it; for every Life ſtandeth in Poyſon and Light, every one in its own Principle, according as it hath the Source or Fountain Quality, ſo hath it alſo its Light.

                     <p n="101">101. For if there were no Fire, there would alſo be no Light, and alſo no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and if there were no Spirit that did blow up the Fire, then the Fire would ſmother and extinguiſh, and would be a Darkneſs; and ſo one <hi>without the other</hi> would not be; thus they belong both to one another, and yet they ſever one from the other, but without <hi>flying</hi> away; and yet there is a flying of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="102">102.

                     <p n="107">107. And therefore it is Two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſince it giveth or affordeth a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Source or fountain Quality and <hi>Life;</hi> and is but one Root which affordeth that: the one giveth Life, the other giveth food to the Life; and this is a wonder, and yet Not a wonder, for there is nothing that it ſelf can wonder at, for it is it ſelf <hi>all things</hi> in <hi>One</hi> Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="108">108. Now behold, the Fire is firſt the ſeeking, to draw into it ſelf; that is the

Subſtantiality, the <hi>Phur;</hi> for the Seeking maketh that in the Deſiring, in reſpect of its <hi>drawing,</hi> elſe Nothing would be; and the Drawing is the bitter ſting, a Breaker, which cannot endure the Subſtantiality, nor <hi>will not</hi> endure it; and that not willing to endure, is an anguiſh in the will, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Subſtantiality with the bitter Sting; and the Anguiſh penitrateth or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into it ſelf, and reacheth after the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> is eſteemed a Light in reſpect of the Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="109">109. Now the Anguiſh is a horrible Sharpneſs; and thus is the Liberty capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and <hi>ſharpned,</hi> ſo that it is a Fire-flaſh of Lightning; and the Anguiſh Will in the ſharpneſs of the bitter Flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>conſumeth</hi> the Subſtantiality, be it wood or any thing elſe.</p>

111. Now obſerve, this is thus according to the <hi>outward</hi> Principle of this World, as is undeniable before our eyes: and ſo then there is in the <hi>Eternity</hi> ſuch a continual ſubſiſting Subſtance, which we demonſtrate to you thus.

                     <p n="112">112. The <hi>ſinking down</hi> of the Anguiſh in the eternal Darkneſs, is an eternal Hunger and Thirſt, and an eternal Deſiring, and the Darkneſs in it ſelf, attaineth in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, <hi>Nothing</hi> that it can have out of the Eternity for its ſatiating or fulfilling; therefore it is rightly the very Hunger and Thirſt of the Abyſſe of Hell, and of the Anger of God.</p>
                     <p n="113">113. But the will in the Anguiſh, being it can reach or find <hi>nothing,</hi> it maketh to it ſelf a figure and a ſimilitude in the <hi>Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> with the ſtern ſtrong drawing; and the ſtrong, aſtringent, bitter, dark Subſtance, is the <hi>material</hi> Similitude it ſelf; it devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſelf, and is it ſelf the Matter of the Fire, that ſo the Eternal Flaſh continueth perpetually, and the fierce Wrath is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually &amp; eternally ever burning, and <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eternally</hi> out of the Darkneſs, and hath its own Life it it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the bitter Sting

                     <p n="115">115. Thus is the Fire-will a ſeeking of the riſing Pride, a contemning of the <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> it contemneth its own Root; it is a covetous one, and willeth to devour more then it hath, or, then is its right; It hath all Luſt; for the deſirous Eſſences become revealed or <hi>manifeſted</hi> in the fire; and thence it comes, that in every will of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſſence, there is again a Center of a whole Subſtance.</p>

116.

                     <p n="123">123. Now ſince Man hath deſtroyed the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Body through his Imagination, and hath introduced it into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Number, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Outward Principle; therefore he is alſo <hi>therein,</hi> for

Therefore know aſſuredly, that the time is <hi>near,</hi> for in the ſixth Day after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, began the Reſt of the Eternal Day, and <hi>therefore</hi> hath God inſtituted the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Seventh Day for a Reſt, and continual perpetual <hi>Remembrance.</hi>

                     <p n="129">129.

                     <p n="133">133. Now ye ſee alſo that the burning Fire ſendeth a <hi>Smoke</hi> up from it, and in the Smoke is a Water, whence <hi>Soot</hi> cometh to be, which cleaves to the wall, eſpecially if the fire be <hi>cloſed in</hi> that it is not free, then is the Soot manifeſt as in a Furnace: this is Soot and Water mixed one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by which, underſtand the Material <hi>Earth</hi> out of the Eternal Fire, which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> kindled, where then in the fierce wrath, Time began, and the Creation proceeded, as in the <note n="†" place="margin">Threefold-Life.</note> Third Part is mentioned.</p>

ſee that Air goeth forth out of the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource or Quality: and ye underſtand ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that if the fire <hi>had not</hi> Air again, it would ſmother or go out, as all fires ſmother, if they have not Air, and yet they alſo generate Air; the Air is the Fires life, which originateth out of the anxious bitter ſtirring Source or fountain Quality of the Eſſences out of the Will.</p>
                     <p n="135">135. Now ye ſee alſo well, that Fire muſt have ſomewhat to <hi>conſume,</hi> elſe it is a Darkneſs; and though it devoureth it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> its ſtrong or ſtern attraction, yet that very fire is only a ſource or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>quality</hi> in the Darkneſs, whereby we underſtand the Abyſs of the Anger; which in God, is <hi>not</hi> revealed or manifeſted, but only as a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Life in the Kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p n="136">136. Ye ſee this, that every Fire muſt have ſubſtance, if it muſt <hi>burn:</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this thus, the Fire affordeth Air, the Air, Water; and it draweth the Air ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>again</hi> into it ſelf with the water, whence the Fires ſource or fountain quality of heat becometh <hi>mittigated</hi> or meekned, ſo that it ſhineth.</p>
                     <p n="137">137. For without <note n="*" place="margin">Or Liquor; that is Oyl.</note> Water, no Fire ſhineth, where in a thing, the Water is <hi>not</hi> to be

                        <hi>attained,</hi> there is no ſhining of the Fire, but only a glimps; as is to be ſeen in a glowing or red hot Stone, which hath the ſource or quality of Fire; &amp; of the ſhining it hath nothing but only glimps, it may be not that: but in the Iron ye ſee a glimps, wherein the Fire attaineth the Water. Therefore alſo Iron is at length <hi>conſumed,</hi> and getteth ruſt, and a Stone Not. This is thus to be underſtood according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle of this World. but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inward, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the Kingdom of God; obſerve <hi>this</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: the Eternal Fire burneth Eternally, but it is a Spirit, and in the Kingdom of God, <hi>not</hi> manifeſted or revealed in a fierce wrathful manner.</p>
                     <p n="138">138. Obſerve this thus, the flaſh maketh a ſhining, which originateth from the fire, and dwelleth not in the fierce wrath of the fire, but it <hi>ſatiateth</hi> or fulfilleth the fire totally, and giveth light alſo external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the fire, and is not held or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the fire, and bringeth alſo a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſource or quallity, as Meekneſs, and hath yet the <hi>Fires</hi> vertue or power, Wit or Ingenuity and Art; for in the Light is firſt, the Fires Source or Quality in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, manifeſted or revealed.</p>

139. Now the Light maketh no ſource or <hi>pain,</hi> but goeth in it ſelf into a Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is alſo deſirous, proceeding from the Fires ſource or Quality, and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring is alſo an attracting, as <hi>viz.</hi> of the meekneſs and vertue or power into it ſelf, and impregnaeth it ſelf with <hi>meekneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="140">140. For the Light is alſo a fire, a very yearning fire, a deſirous fire, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>finding</hi> fire, which continually findeth, what is generated in the Original.</p>
                     <p n="141">141. All the vertue and power which originateth in the fierce wrathful Fire, is <hi>manifeſted</hi> or revealed in the Light, and the Light deſireth that, in meekneſs; for the Fires fierce wrathfulneſs and the Lights ſhining, are <hi>Two</hi> Principles of a twofold Source or fountain Quality, each dwelleth in it ſelf, and the one comprehendeth <hi>not</hi> the Other, in Eternity, and yet the One is the others Life and Cauſe, Underſtand it thus:</p>
                     <p n="142">142. As we conſider, that a horrible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious Source or Quality, maketh a <hi>ſinking down</hi> in it ſelf, like a death, where then is the <hi>parting limit,</hi> and yet the Anguiſh in it ſelf retaineth its ſource or quality, but the ſincking into it ſelf, as a Death enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into its Aethen; where then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh-Life
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57401:52"/>
is <hi>no more</hi> apprehended, for the ſinking breaketh it ſelf forth out of the Anguiſh-ſource, <hi>like</hi> a dying, and is a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas yet in the Eternity is no dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſuch an Entrance into another World of another Principle, of another Source or fountain-Quality.</p>
                     <p n="143">143. For the ſinking goeth into the ſtill Eternity, as into the Liberty, and being the fierce wrathful fires-Source, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it ſelf in its life; therefore is the ſinking a going forth out of the Fire-Life, and yet is from the Fire-Life; but its ſource or fountain-ſpirit <hi>it hath not,</hi> for it is brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en off in Death, and is the parting-limit in Death, that ſo the ſinking preſſeth through Death, and hath <hi>another</hi> Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, <hi>viz.</hi> another Water wherein the Light ſhineth, wherein no fierce wrathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is.</p>
                     <p n="144">144. For in the Eternity is no Death that with-holdeth, but only ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in; for that which hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that hath alſo no end nor ground: and thus <hi>originateth</hi> the Light out of the Fires-Source.</p>
                     <p n="145">145. For the Light dwelleth in the Fire, &amp; alſo not in the Fire, it is in another world, and is <hi>another</hi> Fire, which is called Love,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57401:53"/>
Vertue or Power, Wonder, Sweet, Mild or Gentle, Pure or Clean; and is no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and alſo not Nature, but without or <hi>beſides</hi> Nature in another Principle.</p>

                     <p n="275">275. Ye know that in Fire 🜂 and Water 🜄, all Life ſtandeth or <hi>conſiſteth,</hi> and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality is its Body, and the Body is or exiſteth out of the Power or Vertue of the Spirit, for it is the Spirits <hi>Food,</hi> and the Spirit is again the Bodies <hi>Food,</hi> and the higheſt &amp; greateſt Nutriment is in it ſelf; for the outward would not hold or <hi>retain</hi> it, if the right or true Life were not in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="276">276. Therefore now the Fire, is the <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe of the Life, and the Light thereof is the <hi>ſecond</hi> cauſe, and the Spirit the <hi>third</hi> cauſe, and yet is but one ſubſtance or thing, which cloſeth it ſelf into a Body, and manifeſteth, and ſo with ſeeking find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p n="277">277. And every Subſtance is or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in <hi>two</hi> Subſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> in an outward and inward, the one ſeeketh and findeth the other; the <hi>outward</hi> is Nature, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> is Spirit above Nature, and yet there is no ſchiſm or rending aſunder, but only

Thus ye ſee alſo, how out of the Light, the <hi>right</hi> or true Subſtantiality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts; for it is a fulfilling or ſatiating of the Will: The Water exiſteth out of the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> of the fight, for the deſiring lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold of the Meekneſs, and retaineth it, for it is a good reliſh; thus is the Meekneſs Subſtantial, and a Subſtance of the Fire, a fulfilling of the deſirous fierce Wrath, an allaying of the fierce Wrath, and a corporeity of the Time; for when the <hi>Body</hi> falleth away, then is its Spirit in the Beginning, in that which hath given it forth, in that looking-glaſs it is.</p>
                     <p n="279">279. So then ſeeing the Source or fountain <hi>Quality</hi> is twofold, therefore is the Water alſo twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> an outward and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the one belongeth to the Spirit, the other to the outward Life; the outward is accompted a Death, the inward is its Life, the outward ſtandeth <hi>between</hi> the fierce Wrath and Paradiſe, in the in-ſunk down Death; and the inward is the Paradiſe it ſelf, for the Spirit ſprouteth <hi>therein</hi> out of the Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="280">
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57401:83"/>
280. And you may ſee that this is true thus; Conſider Winter and Summer, alſo Cold and Heat, and you will ſoon <hi>perceive</hi> it, if you be born or generated internally and not externally only, but with the <hi>firſt</hi> Magick Will or Deſire to find God, for that is done in the twinckling of an eye.</p>
                     <p n="281">281. For the Water in the Deep, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth from the Fire, yet <hi>not</hi> from the fierce Wrath, but from the Light, for the Light goeth forth from the Fire, and hath its own ſeeking or longing, it ſeeketh to it ſelf a Looking-Glaſs, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it ſelf, and have it for a habitation, and draweth it in the Deſiring into it ſelf, and dwelleth therein; and that which is drawn in, is <hi>Water,</hi> which apprehendeth the Light, elſe the Deep of the World would not apprehend the Light, if the Light did <hi>not dwell</hi> in the Water: the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the fulfilling or ſatiating of the Light, in its deſiring.</p>
                     <p n="282">282. And the Water ſeeketh again a Looking-Glaſs, and willeth to have a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, which is <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as ye ſee, that the Water, receiveth the glimps or ſhadow of all Subſtances or Things in their Body, ſo that the Body it ſelf is repreſented in the Water, which is becauſe the ſeeking of the Fire hath taken hold of it.</p>
                     <p n="283">
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57401:84"/>
283. Further herein is ſeen the End of Nature, for the Eye findeth its <hi>Life</hi> in the Water, and thus it goeth back into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Form, and ſeeketh its <hi>Body</hi> in the Water, and there is further no deſire more in the outward; this Body deſireth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body more in the outward, but it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>back</hi> after its mother, of which ye have a right and true Example in a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glaſs, which is <hi>Fire and Water,</hi> and that receiveth the Image very clearly.</p>
                     <p n="184">184. And thus ye ſee, that the End go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth back again, and ſeeketh the Beginning, and nothing further in the outward: for this World is at the <hi>limit,</hi> and is included in a Time, and runneth on to the Limit; and then the End findeth the Beginning, and this World ſtandeth as a <note n="*" place="margin">Or Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> 
                        <hi>Model,</hi> or as a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs, in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Let this ſerve you to the finding of the Myſtery, and remit your ſelf rightly into the Beginning, that ye may be <hi>apprehended</hi> or known to be a wonder in God's Love.</p>
                     <p n="285">285. And thus ye are to know, that the the ſecond Form of the Water, conſiſteth in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is its Fathers Looking-Glaſs, its Makers, which dwelleth in the Spirit,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57401:84"/>
and is found only by its Maker, it ſelf find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not it ſelf; for ſo long as a thing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forward <hi>externally,</hi> there is no finding in the Inward internally, only the Spirit which dwelleth in the Inward, findeth it ſelf in the Outward.</p>
                     <p n="286">286. But the outward <hi>Life</hi> findeth not the inward, unleſs it have the inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then is the finding, and it is done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>inward Spirit,</hi> and then the outward Life ſpeaketh of the inward, and yet knoweth it <hi>not;</hi> only the inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit filleth the outward, ſo that the outward is a Mouth, and the <hi>inward</hi> hath and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Word, ſo that the inward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſtandeth manifeſt in the outward in the ſound, and that now is a wonder.</p>
                     <p n="287">287. The inward is a Prophet, and the outward apprehendeth it not, but if it do come to apprehend it, then it hath God's <hi>Subſtantiality</hi> in it, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Fleſh, Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> Fleſh, the Virgins Fleſh, and yet the Prophet ſtandeth or conſiſteth in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but that Fleſh conceiveth its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Vertue, and aſſureth the outward Man, that he doth even that which his Maker willeth; as indeed this <hi>Pen</hi> is in ſuch a condition, and no otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="288">288. Thus we apprehend the ground of

                     <p n="289">289. Yet ye are to know, that this World, is not the Subſtance of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but a <note n="†" place="margin">Shadow, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, or Reſemblance.</note>

                     <p n="292">292. Seeing thus there is ONE Subſtance in TWO Forms, one that taketh on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Beginning in it ſelf, and holdeth it Eternally, and another that is the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Model, which compriſeth, and with its
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57401:86"/>
Body is included in a <hi>limit;</hi> therefore we are to conſider of the <hi>Turba,</hi> which break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the included compriſed Life, again, and ſetteth the Model of the compriſed Wonders in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and preſenteth ſuch things to the Beginning as were not from Eternity, but came to be in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed</hi> Time.</p>
                     <p n="293">293. Beloved Friend, to you and ſuch as you are, who ſeek the <hi>Beginning,</hi> is this thing ſhewn, for your Mind is our Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſeek it in U S, <hi>not</hi> in ME, I, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man have it not, but the Inward in the Virgin, in which God dwelleth, THAT hath it; and that calleth it ſelf <hi>twofold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="294">294. My outward Man is not worthy of the Myſtery, but God hath ſo ordained it, that he might manifeſt or reveal it to you by means, that you might know him by <hi>Means,</hi> and not ſay, it is from my <hi>own</hi> wit and underſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="295">295. And ſeeing you are a learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you ſhould know, that God loveth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſilly and <hi>deſpiſed</hi> of this World, if he ſeek God, as indeed I have done, and that the right and true finding or inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſticketh not in <hi>Art,</hi> but in Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and <hi>Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="296">296. For this hand is ſimple, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57401:86"/>
fooliſh in the <hi>eſteem</hi> of the World, as you know, and yet there lyeth ſuch a hidden ſecret or <hi>Arcanum</hi> therein, as is unſearchable to Reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="297">297. Therefore have a care, pour Oyl into the Wounds that deſire or require healing, and conſider well what Chriſt ſaith, <note n="*" place="margin">Mark 10. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>How hard it is for a man to enter into the Kingdom of God, who is captivated with cares of the Belly,</hi> in Might or Potency and <hi>Honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="298">298. You will not find this Plant in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Exaltation of the world, for you cannot, you are a <hi>Myſtery</hi> to them: The Spirit it ſelf ſeeketh the Beginning; look to it, flatter none; for the Beginning is Paradiſical, that the impure come not into the pure, and at laſt the <hi>Serpent beguile Eve again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="299">299. Let there be no fair gloſs in you, but ſpeak roundly or ſincerely with your Mouth, with Yea and Nay; alſo <hi>fear not,</hi> for that which is Eternal, remaineth ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is only the filth and <hi>vanity,</hi> that cauſeth, that the <hi>Turba</hi> together inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57401:87"/>
it ſelf as a breaker or corrupter; have a care of that, for the Old Serpent is ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that ye may be <hi>pure</hi> in the Beginning and in the End.</p>
                     <p n="300">300. For, this work, ſuffereth not much <hi>Gloſſing</hi> upon, it hath a clear ground, alſo it belongeth not to the <hi>Turba,</hi> but in and to the Beginning of the Clarity, or bright Transfiguration or Glory: Therefore take heed of thoſe who are born, or become of a wolfiſh diſpoſition, whoſe <hi>Spirit</hi> is a ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Serpent; this we ſpeak out of Good will towards you.</p>
                     <p n="301">301. Every thing that beginneth it ſelf, is ſought of the Beginning, for the Beginning ſeeketh through the <hi>Deep,</hi> and willeth to find the ground: If now the Beginning do find the ground, that there be a limit in a Thing, then the Beginning, ſlips into the limit, and leaveth or forſaketh the firſt, and ſeeketh further ſo long, till it findeth the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> and there it muſt ſtand in it ſelf, and can go no further, for there is nothing more.</p>
                     <p n="302">302. But if the firſt be <hi>forſaken</hi> of the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then it is fallen home to the <hi>Turba,</hi> which breaketh it, and maketh it again,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57401:87"/>
what it was in the Beginning.</p>
                     <p n="303">303. And then if the Thing be broken, then the <hi>Turba</hi> ſtandeth naked without a Body, and it ſelf alſo ſeeketh it ſelf, and findeth it ſelf, but without Subſtance, and then it entereth into it ſelf, and ſeeketh it ſelf even in the Abyſs, and then the firſt Eye becometh found, out of which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came generated.</p>
                     <p n="304">304. But being it is bare and raw without Subſtance, therefore it is put <hi>back</hi> or home to the Fire, for it putteth it ſelf therein, and is in the Fire a Deſiring, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeek its Body again, and ſo the Fire of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> becometh awakened.</p>
                     <p n="305">305. And hereby apprehend we the laſt <hi>Judgement</hi> in the Fire, and the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Fleſh, for the <hi>Turba</hi> in the Fire, is deſirous of the Body which it hath had, but was broken in the limit; and its deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, was the Bodies Life, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="306">306. Therefore being the Fires are TWO, the <hi>Turba</hi> alſo muſt be apprehended in a <hi>Twofold</hi> Form or Kind, <hi>viz.</hi> in a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body, and in an incorruptible Body, <hi>viz.</hi> one in the fierce wrathful Fire, and one in the Light-Fire, wherein or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57401:88"/>
we underſtand God's Body, and in the fierce wrathful Fire, the <hi>Earthly</hi> Body, which the <hi>Turba</hi> corrupteth or breaketh, for it findeth its Limit.</p>
                     <p n="307">307. Therefore now the <hi>Eternal Fire</hi> in God's Eye, is, to be underſtood, both the fierce wrathful; and alſo the Light-Love-Fire: And we give you to underſtand, that the Spirit without a Body, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the fierce wrathful Fire, for it hath <hi>loſt</hi> its Subſtantiality, the <hi>Turba</hi> hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it up in the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="308">308. But the Spirit with a Body, which the <hi>Turba</hi> is not able to devour, remaineth Eternally in the Subſtantiality in God's Body, wherein his Spirit ſtandeth; <hi>viz.</hi> the Body in the Love of God, which is the <hi>hidden Man,</hi> in the Old Adamical, which there hath Chriſt's Fleſh in the corruptible or <hi>fragile Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="309">309. Thus we underſtand the Soul to be an awakened Life out of God's Eye, its Original is in the Fire, and the Fire is its Life; and ſo if it <hi>goeth not</hi> out from the Fire with its Will and Imagination into the Light, <hi>viz.</hi> through the fierce wrathful Death into the <hi>Second Principle</hi> into the Love-Fire, then it remaineth in its own <hi>Original Fire,</hi> and hath nothing but the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57401:88"/>
                        <hi>Turba</hi> for a Body, <hi>viz.</hi> the aſtringent fierce Wrath, a deſiring in the Fire, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming and a hunger, and yet an Eternal Seeking, which is the Eternal Anguiſh.</p>
                     <p n="310">310. But the Soul which with its deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous will, entereth into it ſelf, and in its reaſon, that is, in its deſiring, <hi>ſinketh down,</hi> and ſeeketh not it ſelf, but God's Love, is in its Fire as it were <hi>dead,</hi> for its will which awakeneth the Fire, is dead to the Fire-Life, and is gone out from it ſelf, into the Love-Fire; that Soul is fallen home to the Love-Fire, and hath alſo the Love-Fires Body, for it is entered thereunto, and is a great Wonder in <hi>God's Body,</hi> and it is no more it ſelf, for it hath killed its will, and ſo its <hi>Turba</hi> alſo is as it were dead, and the Love-will filleth or ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Fire of the Original, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it <hi>liveth</hi> Eternally.</p>
                     <p n="311">311. But thoſe Souls which have awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Turba,</hi> they have loſt the Image: For the <hi>Turba</hi> hath ſwallowed THAT into it ſelf, and therefore thoſe Souls get or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the Anger and in Hell, <hi>Beaſtial</hi> Images, according as the <hi>Turba</hi> is in them, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> got a Serpents Image, all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Will or Mind hath here been <hi>figured</hi> or framed, ſo it ſtandeth then naked and apparent.</p>
                     <p n="312">
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:57401:89"/>
312. For, the fierce wrathful <hi>Turba,</hi> ſeeketh continually the Image, and findeth it not, therefore it figureth or frameth the Image according to the <hi>Will;</hi> for the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deſire ſticketh in the Will, and ſuch an Image ſtandeth now in God's Wonders, in the Eye of the fierce wrathful Principle.</p>
                     <p n="313">313. And here we underſtand the eighth Form to be the <hi>Turba,</hi> which ſeeketh the Image, and if it findeth the <hi>Limit,</hi> it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and goeth into it, and ſeeketh fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into it ſelf, and findeth at laſt the <hi>Abomination</hi> of that, which the Soul had done here in this life.</p>
                     <p n="314">314. And then we underſtand here, the Fire which at the End <hi>ſhall purge the Floar,</hi> and the earneſt ſevere Judgement: And we underſtand how every Fire, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its <hi>Subſtance</hi> from the <hi>Turba,</hi> and what that is.</p>
                     <p n="315">315. Where then the Fire, will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up the Earth, and draw the Elements with the <hi>Wonders</hi> in them into the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where then the Firſt will be again, and the Elements in <hi>One;</hi> And every thing will ſet forth its wonders there, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in its own Fire, into which the Will is entered.</p>
                     <p n="316">316. Let this be ſaid to you ye Children
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57401:89"/>
of Men, it concerneth you, for <hi>No Beaſt</hi> is come out of the Eternal Beginning, but out of the Model of the Eternal, and in its Spirit reacheth not the Eternal, as the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man doth.</p>
                     <p n="317">317. Alſo the corrupt or periſhed Body, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſeſs the Eternal, it is fallen home back to the <hi>Turba,</hi> but the New Man ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated or born in God, will poſſeſs the Eternal, for it is gone forth from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and hath put on God in Chriſt, which hath God's Body <hi>in</hi> the Old <hi>Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="318">318. The earthly ſource or fountain quality, the <hi>Turba</hi> taketh that along with it, the outward Body from the Earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth with the <hi>Earth,</hi> but the will tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Subſtance doings or works along in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf, for they ſtand in the <hi>New</hi> Body, and follow after it, therefore a Man ſhould <hi>conſider</hi> what he doth in this Life.</p>

                     <p n="319">319. Thus we underſtand that all proceedeth out of the Beginning, and ſo one goeth out

of the other; and we underſtand, how the <hi>Fire</hi> is a cauſe of the Life, and how the Life divides it ſelf into <hi>two</hi> parts, and yet breaketh not; but only the outward Life, which falleth home back to the <hi>Turba,</hi> which breaketh or deſtroyeth it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to conſider, <hi>wherein</hi> it is that the Eternal Life conſiſteth, what its pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſervation is, that the <hi>Body</hi> breaketh not; for <hi>Subſtantiality</hi> hath a beginning.</p>

It is ſaid before, how all muſt go or paſs quite through the Fire, that will endure Eternally, for that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Fire, the <hi>Turba</hi> taketh that: there is no ſpirit created in the Fire, that it ſhould remain in the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="322">322. Only the <hi>Turba</hi> hath captivated mary of them, but not from or by God's will or purpoſe; for God's will is only

                        <hi>Love;</hi> but the <hi>Turba</hi> is his <hi>Anger-</hi>will, which hath with its vehement hunger, brought a great Kingdom of its Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Revelation into his wonders; <hi>viz.</hi> the Devils and wicked Souls of Men.</p>
                     <p n="323">323. But being the Eternal Life ſtandeth in <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and hath no Death nor <hi>Turba</hi> in it: Therefore we muſt needs ſay, that the Soul and Spirit, ſtand not in the <hi>Turba,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Soule Body, elſe the <hi>Turba</hi> would break or deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p n="324">324. To be underſtood as above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, thus; that the Will in the Anguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource or quality, in the Fire, underſtand the Souls Will, ſinketh down into it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> into Death, and <hi>ſhould not</hi> live in the Fire, and then that very Will falleth into another will, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Beginning; or to expreſs it better, into the <hi>Free Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> into the Eternal Nothing; where there is no ſource or quality or <hi>pain,</hi> nor nothing that <hi>can</hi> either give or receive it.</p>
                     <p n="325">325.

ſelf, but <hi>unperceptibly,</hi> for it is gone quite out from the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="326">326.

20. And we give you to underſtand, that the Spirit can alter it ſelf in this Time of the Body, which is done <hi>without</hi> its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or apprehenſion through the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>viz.</hi> through the ſeeking Luſt or Longing Pleaſure and Delight, where the <hi>deſiring</hi> figureth ſuch a Form in the Souls Will, as the luſt or longing Pleaſure is, to Evil, or Good.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And we ſay, that the pure Soul, is <hi>not</hi> corporeal, but there groweth a Body in the <hi>Tincture</hi> either heavenly or helliſh, and yet it is no palpable body according to the outward, but a <hi>Power-Body,</hi> God's <hi>Body,</hi> Chriſt's Heavenly Body, heavenly Fleſh, which Chriſt giveth us to eat in his <note n="h" place="margin">The Lord's Supper.</note> Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="22">22.

                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. But the Outward Spirit, if the Soul do not hinder it, but letteth it in, bringeth <hi>its</hi> Imagination thereinto, and covereth, vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth or obſcureth it, ſo that another ſtrange

                  <p n="24">24.

                  <p n="2">2. In our <note n="h" place="margin">Three fold Life.</note> Third Part, it is written very exactly and at large, with many Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, concerning its <hi>Propagation,</hi> how <hi>Adam</hi> was created in an Image; He was Man and Woman before his <hi>Eve;</hi> he had the fires and waters <hi>Tincture,</hi> that is Soul and Spirit, and ſhould have generated his like, an Image of himſelf, out of himſelf, through his Imagination and own Love; and this he could have done without diſrupture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For, as it is above mentioned, that the

Soul hath ſuch might or ability, to change the Body into another Form; ſo it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had ability, to generate a Branch out of it ſelf, according to its Property, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood out the tryal or <hi>Proba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But being he imagined after, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> and let the Spirit of this World into the Soul into the <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> and the Serpent, and gazed on the Earthly Fruit, longing to eat of Evil and Good: then alſo his <hi>Tincture</hi> conceived ſuch an Image, <hi>viz.</hi> a Monſter, which was half earthly, thereinto alſo inſtantly the <hi>Turba</hi> inſinuated it ſelf, and ſought the Limit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thus the noble or pretious <hi>Image</hi> was found in the Earthly, where then Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility, Corruption and Death Began: and <hi>Adam</hi> could not then generate, for his Omnipotency was loſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. A Thing that is without Ground, and yet <hi>ſeeketh</hi> and maketh a Ground in it ſelf, hath its original and ſeat in the firſt <hi>compaction</hi> or comprehenſion, where it compriſeth it ſelf in it ſelf, there is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the moſt innermoſt, and it goeth forth out of it ſelf, and ſeeketh forward, where then it <hi>maketh</hi> one Looking-Glaſs after another, till it findeth the firſt again, <hi>viz.</hi> the unſearchable limit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus alſo is the Soul, it is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by God in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the VVord which compriſeth it, was in the Heart, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Center;</hi> thus it continued in the Figure and Seat, as it was compriſed by the <hi>Fiat,</hi> and is ſo to this day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It dwelleth in the Three Principles, but the Heart is its Original, in the Heart therein, in the inward Blood of the Heart, it is the <hi>inward</hi> Fire, and in the <hi>Tincture</hi> is its Spirit, which hath a Glimps from the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57401:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And the Spirit moveth upon the Heart in the Pit or <hi>Concavity</hi> of the Heart, where the two Principles ſever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and burneth in the Tincture, as a Brimſtone-Light, and <hi>diſtributeth</hi> it ſelf further forth in the whole Body into all the Members: for the <hi>Tincture</hi> goeth through all the Members.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the right and true Fire-Smith, in the <hi>Center, ſitteth</hi> on the <hi>Heart,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth his dominion with or by the Spirit, into the <hi>Head,</hi> and hath his carnal houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and the Five Prince-Counſellors, <hi>viz.</hi> the Five <hi>Senſes,</hi> which exiſt out of the Five Spirits of the <hi>Original,</hi> as we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <note n="*" place="margin">Threefold Life.</note> Third Book, as alſo in the <note n="†" place="margin">Three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> Second and in the <note n="o" place="margin">Aurora.</note> Firſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Soul ſitteth indeed in the inward Principle, but it <hi>ruleth</hi> alſo in the outward, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Conſtellation &amp; the Elements, and if it be not a mymmick Ape, &amp; ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf to be <hi>captivated,</hi> then it is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enough over the outward, and the outward muſt ſuffer it ſelf to be <hi>ſubdued,</hi> if the Soul ſinketh it ſelf down into God, and

cometh upon the Chariot of the Bride again into the outward, that it hath the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit for an <hi>aſſiſtant.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. And this is our Inſtruction and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to this Queſtion; that it is not ſo to be underſtood, that when a mans Head is cut off, and the Blood <hi>runneth out,</hi> and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Life breaketh, that it hitteth and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Soul.</p>

                  <p n="10">10.

                  <head type="sub">How the Souls enlightening is.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. VVE are to conſider, that if the Sun were <hi>taken away</hi> out of this World, then all things would be in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then outward Reaſon might ſay, we are in <hi>Dark Death,</hi> and in the fierce wrathfulneſs of the Cold, and it were ſo indeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now behold, O beloved Mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider when thy Body periſheth, then thy <hi>Spirit</hi> alſo loſeth the Sun; and then how thou wilt be in the Light, and by what means thou wilt ſee, I offer to you in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity for your mind to conſider of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A thing, that is in the Eternal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it continually <hi>entereth</hi> into the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Liberty, hath no Darkneſs, for it dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in nothing which affordeth that, it is free, as the Eye of God, which ſeeth into it ſelf by or through the <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When it imagineth in or according to the Luſt, Pleaſure or longing after any thing, then the <hi>Will</hi> goeth into <hi>that thing,</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:57401:119"/>
which the deſirous Pleaſure or longing it ſelf, maketh, that very <hi>thing</hi> receiveth or taketh in the will into it ſelf and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadoweth it, ſo that it <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the Darkneſs, and can have no Light, unleſs it go out again into the Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thus we give you, earneſtly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in all our matters and <hi>doings,</hi> we have no Light, if we enter with the will into that which is done or <hi>acted,</hi> if we ſet our Heart and Will, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or Sacrifice to out own Net.</hi> Hab. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>upon the Work of our Hands, viz.</hi> upon Covetouſneſs. Then we are in our Souls totally blind, and have no Light in us, but only the outward Light of the Sun, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth light to the outward Body; if that breaketh or periſheth, then is the Soul <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated</hi> with that thing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Underſtand here; The Souls Spirit and <hi>Will,</hi> for the ſtock or ſtem of the Soul is a dark <hi>valley,</hi> it hath no Light, and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it lift up &amp; kindle it ſelf, yet it is but a fierce wrathful <hi>Fire-Flaſh,</hi> and is like the Devil, and cannot attain the <hi>Divine</hi> Light in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Cauſe is, it hath introduced A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination into its <hi>Will</hi> and Spirit, which darkneth the Spirit, and holdeth it <hi>captive</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:57401:119"/>
with the <hi>Turba,</hi> for God's Light goeth not <hi>back</hi> again, but <hi>forward</hi> into the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And therefore is God's Eye twofold or in two parts, and ſtandeth <hi>back to back;</hi> as is ſhewed above in the <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="9">9. The other goeth back again into the Deſiring, and maketh darkneſs in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, and therein the Center of Nature, and driveth on to the great <hi>Anguiſh</hi> and Sharpneſs.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Where then the Will ſinketh down again out of the Anguiſh, through the Darkneſs into the ſtill or <hi>quiet</hi> Liberty, and ſo bringeth along with it, out of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, the fierce wrath of the <hi>Mobility,</hi> and the earneſt ſevere Sharpneſs.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. In which Sharpneſs, the Liberty (when the will bringeth the ſharpneſs thereinto) becometh a high <hi>Triumphant</hi> majeſtick Light, which is called God's Light, which giveth light Eternally, and can be barred in by nothing, for it giveth Light in the Eternal Liberty, and deſireth nothing more.</p>

12.</p>
                  <p>And now if thou earthly Man ſhouldſt think, that God would <hi>receive</hi> thy Spirit into his majeſtick Light, whilſt thou intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceſt Abominations, <hi>viz.</hi> Covetouſneſs, which hath pride and ſtate, which is the Fire-Life of Covetouſneſs, into thy <hi>will;</hi> then thou wouldſt thereby <hi>darken</hi> God's Majeſty, and thy will and ſpirit, would ſtick ſtill only in thy Covetouſneſs, and would burn with the fire-ſource or quality of the Soul, in the glance of a looking-glaſs, <hi>viz.</hi> in pride or ſtate, and couldſt <hi>not</hi> reach or attain God's Majeſty.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And if thou didſt ſit in the <hi>Croſs</hi> of the holy Number Three, and wert ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with all the holy Angels, yet thou didſt but ſit in the darkneſs, and thy ſpirit would give Light only into the Looking-Glaſs of <hi>that</hi> ſubſtance or thing, which thou thy ſelf haſt <hi>introduced</hi> into the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Therefore now if the Soul with its Spirit in its Image, will behold God, and <hi>ſee</hi> into God's Majeſty and Eternal Light; then muſt it in this world go <hi>two</hi> wayes; and then it will retain the Eternal Body, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Image, as alſo the outward Life, together with the Earthly Body, and will introduce the Wonders <hi>for which God hath created it</hi> in the outward life, which

                  <p n="2">2. You my beloved Friend know well the heavy Fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> as we have exactly ſet it down in all our Writings, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Soul</hi> with its right Eye, hath turned it ſelf away from God <hi>into</hi> the Spirit of this World, and is become diſobedient to God, and hath deſtroyed its noble and pretious Image, and hath introduced a <hi>monſtrous</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:57401:126"/>
Image, and let in the ſpirit of this world, whereas it ſhould with its will, have ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruled over it, and not at all, with the Soul, have <hi>eaten Evil and Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But now it hath done againſt God's Command, and put its Imagination into the Earthly Spirit, where ſuddenly the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> captivated it, which hath introduced the <hi>Earthly Monſter</hi> into the noble Image: And thus the <hi>Turba</hi> ſuddenly ſought and found the Limit, in which the Image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came broken; and if the Word had not inſtantly ſet it ſelf in the middle, it had Eternally <hi>remained</hi> broken.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And now alſo the <hi>Turba</hi> is become ſeated in the earthly Abyſs, and hath cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated both Body and Soul, and bringeth the Body <hi>continually</hi> to the Limit, where then it breaketh it and caſteth it away, and then the poor Soul remaineth raw and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked without a body.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Therefore it is neceſſary that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and turn with its right Eye into the Word again, and acquire again a <hi>Body</hi> generated or born of God, elſe it is raw or naked, and hath the <hi>Turba</hi> in it, which the Fire awakeneth in its great Anguiſh, for it is a vehement <hi>hunger,</hi> a ſeeker and a finder.</p>

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:57401:127"/>
6. Thus it is now very apprehenſible to us, that we are <hi>tyed</hi> and bound to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this World with the Soul, for the <hi>Turba</hi> holdeth us captive in the fierce wrathful Anger of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And though our Soul do go forth, and become generated in God, yet it hath the <hi>Turba</hi> belonging to the <hi>outward Body,</hi> which conſumeth it, for it ſearcheth through it even into the Abyſs, and there it findeth that it is only a <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: and then it goeth forth out of the Looking-Glaſs into the Eternal, and lets the Looking-Glaſs lye in the <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thus you know very well, that the Soul with the Body in the Seed, is <hi>half</hi> earthly, for it is <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that is <hi>Phur</hi> and <hi>Sul,</hi> one among another, and the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> is therein, which hath indeed might and power enough to break or deſtroy the Seed.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. How then can a pure clean Soul be generated? It <hi>cannot</hi> be; It bringeth the <hi>Turba</hi> along with it into the world, and <hi>is ſinful in the Mothers Womb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. But know, that God is become Man, or Incarnate, and hath put the word <hi>Fiat</hi> again into the Seed, though now the <hi>Turba</hi> be alſo in the earthly part, ſo that the Seed is not <hi>altogether</hi> free.</p>

11. Yet it is in this manner with the Soul, ſo far as the Father and Mother are honeſt and vertuous, and in God, that the Soul is <hi>not left</hi> or forſaken of God, for it <hi>proceedeth</hi> out of the Fathers and Mothers Soul; and though a Child die in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, as it were without Baptiſm, yet it is baptiſed with the Fathers &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> with the holy Spirit, which <hi>dwelleth in them,</hi> and the <hi>Turba</hi> will be broken off in death, for the Faiths part preſſeth into God.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But with <hi>wicked</hi> and ungodly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents it is in another manner; The Soul, if the Child dyeth in the Mothers womb, falleth home to the <hi>Turba,</hi> and in Eternity reacheth not to God; alſo it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of him, but is a Life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Eſſence &amp; <hi>Property</hi> of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Where yet it doth not reach to the kindling or burning, for the Soul had not it ſelf <hi>acted</hi> or committed ſin, but is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-quality-Spirit, without ſelf-deſire and wonders, like the flame of Brimſtone, and like an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> which cannot reach to God, but remain ſo between Heaven and Hell, in the <hi>Myſtery,</hi> till the Judgment of God, which will gather in its harveſt, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57401:128"/>
give every thing its right and true place of Repoſitory.</p>

                  <p n="15">15. Thus we give you to underſtand, that <hi>no</hi> Soul is generated or born into this world, <hi>without</hi> ſin, how honeſt vertuous and godly ſoever the Parents are, for it is conceived and bred forth or hatched in earthly Seed, and bringeth the <hi>Turba</hi> of the Body along with it, and that hath alſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>Therefore</hi> in the Old Teſtament God made a Covenant with the Children in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and ſo <note n="*" place="margin">Sich in Bund Gethan.</note> orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Covenant that they muſt ſhed their Blood, and drown the <hi>Turba</hi> of the the Soul therewith.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And in the New Teſtament there is the Baptiſm, wherein the holy Spirit with the <hi>Water</hi> of Life, waſheth off the <hi>Turba</hi> of the Souls water, that it may come to God, and become God's Child.</p>

                  <head>The Fifteenth Queſtion.</head>
                  <head type="sub">How Sin cometh into the Soul, being it is God's Work and Creature.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is in ſuch a manner as is above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; The <hi>Turba</hi> together with the earthly ſeeking, came along with it into this world: and ſo the Soul becometh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently drawn by <hi>two parties; firſt</hi> by the Word of the Lord, which is paſſed into the middle, which there of Love is <hi>become Man</hi> or incarnate, that draweth the Soul continually into God's Kingdom, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>Turba</hi> before the eys of the Soul, ſo that the Soul ſeeth in Nature what is falſe or <hi>wicked</hi> and ſin; and if it ſuffereth it ſelf to be drawn, then it becometh <hi>regenerated</hi> in the Word, ſo that it is God's Image.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the <hi>Turba</hi> alſo draweth the Soul mightily with its bands, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Soul continually back into the <hi>earthly</hi> ſeeking or longing, eſpecially in youth, when the earthly Tree ſticketh full of green ſprouting driving Eſſences and Poyſon, and then the <hi>Turba</hi> thus flyeth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57401:130"/>
ſtrongly or mightily in, ſo that many a ſoul in eternity cannot become freed and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A thing which is from <hi>two</hi> beginnings, which ſtand in <hi>equal</hi> ballance or weight, doth by putting in more weight on the <hi>one</hi> part ſink down, be it either by evil or good.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sin maketh not it ſelf, but the will maketh it, it cometh from the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Spirit, and then the Spirit goeth into a thing, and becometh <hi>infected</hi> from the thing, and ſo the <hi>Turba</hi> of that thing cometh into the Spirit, and deſtroyeth <hi>firſt</hi> the Image of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And then it goeth further, ſeeketh deeper, and ſo it findeth the Abyſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul; and ſeeketh in the Soul, and ſo it findeth the fierce wrathful Fire, by which it <hi>mixeth</hi> it ſelf with the thing introduced into the Spirit: and ſo now ſin is <hi>totally</hi> generated or born: and ſo now all is ſin, which deſireth to bring that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the Will.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The will ſhould <hi>ſimply</hi> or ſingly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and exerciſed in Love &amp; Meekneſs, as if it were a nothing, or dead; it ſhould only deſire God's Life, that God may
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57401:130"/>
work, act or <hi>create</hi> in it, and whatſoever it doth beſides, its will ſhould be inclined or intended ſo, as to do it <hi>for</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But if it put its will into the <hi>Thing</hi> or Subſtance, then it bringeth that thing or Subſtance into the Spirit, which poſſeſſeth its Heart, and ſo the <hi>Turba</hi> becometh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and the Soul captivated with that Thing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thus we give you for an anſwer, that no Soul cometh pure and clean out of the Mothers body or womb, be it <hi>begotten</hi> by holy or unholy Parents.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For as the Abyſſe and Anger of God, as alſo the earthly world, do all cleave to and <hi>depend</hi> on God the Father, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend or touch his Heart and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo it is alſo with the Child in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body or Womb.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If it be begotten of godly pious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, then each Principle, ſtandeth in its own part, by it ſelf; when the <hi>Turba</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the earthly Body, then the Heaven ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Spirit, and ſo the Majeſty filleth the Spirit, and ſo the Soul is in God, and is free from pain.</p>

11. But while the Soul ſticketh in the <hi>Earthly</hi> Life, it is not free, and it is becauſe, the Earthly Spirit continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bringeth its Abominations, with its Imagination, into it, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt continually ſtand in <hi>ſtrife</hi> againſt the Earthly Life.</p>

                  <head>The Sixteenth Queſtion.</head>
                  <head type="sub">How the Soul both in the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Body, as alſo in the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born or Regenerate Body is held or preſerved in ſuch union toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. VVE have mentioned above, that there are Three Principles, which moreover are <hi>all Three</hi> in the Soul, and ſtand in one another as one thing: and we offer you this, that the ſtrife in the Soul, beginneth in the <hi>Seeds</hi> while they yet lye ſhut up in both ſexes in the Man and in the Wife, then clearly the <hi>Turba</hi> ſtirreth it ſelf, in that the Eſſence of the Seeds drive up to a falſe or <hi>wicked</hi> Imagination, to a falſe or wicked <hi>deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And though indeed the Spirit doth ſubdue the Body, yet <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and that the <hi>Turba</hi> cauſeth in the Seeds, and no Man can well deny, but that to many that very Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination it ſelf is <hi>offenſive,</hi> and they wiſh
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57401:132"/>
it baniſhed from them, where there is a right ſincere Spirit; therefore ye are to apprehend that the Souls Spirit ſticketh in a miſerable Pinch, and cannot be freed or looſed till the <hi>Turba</hi> taketh the Body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no full union or agreement between the outward and the new-born or regenerate Man: the outward would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually devour the Regenerate, for they ſtand in one another, but yet each hath its own Principle, ſo that the <hi>outward</hi> cannot over-power the <hi>inward,</hi> if the Spirit do but <hi>continue</hi> in ſtrife.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And they can thus well cleave one to another: for they all three ſtand or ſerve to God's Wonders, if they ſtand in their right and due <hi>order</hi> or ſubordination, each ſtanding or continuing in its <hi>own</hi> Principle.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the Soul hath the Fire-Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is the cauſe of the life of all three [Principles;] and the Spirit hath the Lights Dominion, in which the noble or pretious Image ſtandeth together with God's Love; and the outward Spirit hath the earthly Lifes dominion, which ſhould ſeek and <hi>open</hi> the Wonders, and the inward Spirit ſhould give it wiſdom wit &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>to do it;</hi> and the Soul ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57401:132"/>
or reveal to it the Abyſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the great Secreſy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Soul is the Jewel, and the Souls Spirit is the inventor or finder of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; the earthly Spirit is the ſeeker, and the earthly Body is the Myſtery wherein lyeth the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the great hidden Secreſy; for the Deity hath manifeſted or revealed it ſelf, with or by the <hi>Earthlineſs,</hi> as in a comprehenſible Subſtance; therefore now THREE Seekers belong to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And you ſhould not look upon it ſo, <hi>as if</hi> we undervalued the outward Life, for it is the <hi>moſt profitable</hi> for us of all, as to the great Wonders of God; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more profitable to the whole Man, then that he <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> in his Threefold Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and not go back with the outward into the inward, but go with the inward into the outward.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For the outward is a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the inward, but its Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which are generated forth out of the inward, and have opened or diſcovered themſelves in a comprehenſible Subſtance, they belong with their <hi>Figures,</hi> not with their Subſtance to the inward, thoſe ſhould the inward Spirit receive and take in, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Deeds of Wonder, for they will in Eternity be its JOY.</p>

                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:57401:133"/>
9. But we ſay, that the Soul, can very well be retained or held in the New Man, if its <hi>Tincture</hi> Spirit do but hinder the ſeeking and Imagination; and though the outward Spirit be Beaſtial, yet the inward underſtanding Spirit can hold the outward and ſubdue it, for that is its Lord, but he that letteth the Beaſtial Spirit be Lord, he is a Beaſt, and hath alſo a Beaſtial Image in the inward <hi>Figure</hi> in the <hi>Tincture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And he that letteth the Fire-Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Turba,</hi> be Lord, he is a <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Devil in the inward Image; and then it is neceſſary, for the outward Spirit to pour water into the Fire, that it may hold the ſtern Spirit captive, whereas (whiles it will not be God's Image) it is a Beaſt according to the <hi>Inward</hi> Image.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And when we conſider our ſelves in or as to the <hi>union,</hi> the outward Spirit is very profitable to us: for many a ſoul would periſh, when the Beaſt-ſpirit acteth, which yet holdeth the Fire captive, and ſetteth the earthly beaſtial Labour and Joy before the Fire-Spirit, wherein it <hi>can</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it ſelf, till it can through the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>ſomewhat</hi> diſcover its noble or preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57401:133"/>
Image in the Imagination again, ſo that it ſeeketh it ſelf again.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. You my beloved Children who are generated in God, to you it is ſaid, that it is <hi>not</hi> done <hi>without cauſe,</hi> that God hath breathed the outward Spirit into <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> the outward Life into his Noſtrils.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It was <hi>dangerous</hi> for this Image, God knew how it went with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and what the great eternal <hi>Magia</hi> can do; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> alſo might have become a Devil, but the outward Looking-Glaſs hindered that, for where water is it quencheth the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And many a Soul in its <hi>malice</hi> and wickedneſs would in a little while become a Devil, if the outward Life did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, ſo that the Soul cannot quite and totally <hi>kindle</hi> and enflame it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. How evil wicked and venomous is many a one, that he would murther and commit abominable evil and wickedneſs; but that his Fire hath Water, elſe it would be done and committed: as is to be ſeen in the Gall which is a fire poyſon or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, but is <hi>mixed</hi> with water, ſo that the pomp and fury of the Fire is allayed.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Thus it is alſo with the inward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the Spirit of this World hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated it ſelf in the Abyſs into the Soul,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57401:134"/>
and hath in its Source or <hi>Quality</hi> mortal Water, wherewith it often moiſteneth the Soul, when it would ſpit fire.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Alſo the outward Spirit could not without the Fire have a Life, and <hi>though</hi> it hath Fire in all Creatures, yet the Fire is onely the fierce Wrath of the inward Fire.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The Inward Fire, conſumeth Earth and Stone, alſo Body and Blood, as alſo the Noble and precious <hi>Image,</hi> if it becometh kindled or inflamed in the Will, and there the Water is a <hi>Medicine</hi> for it, which lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pomp or fury of going forth aloft over the Meekneſs of God, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did.</p>

2. But in Man it is not <hi>ſo totally</hi> in Death, in reſpect of the Light, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually cauſeth the Fire, yet there is an <hi>Enmity,</hi> as between God and Hell there is Enmity, and yet Hell or Anger-Fire is <hi>Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And God's Majeſty would not be if his Anger were not, which ſharpneth the Divine obſcure <hi>hiddenneſs</hi> of the Eternity, by the fierce wrath of Nature, ſo that it becometh turned into Fire, out of which the high Light in the free Liberty becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth generated, which in the meek ſource or quality <hi>maketh</hi> Majeſty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And yet the Fire is the only Cauſe, that in the Light, in the Meekneſs there is a Springing; for the Light <hi>exiſteth</hi> from the Glance of the Fire, and hath in it the ſource or quality of the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But as afore-mentioned, the Will ſinketh in the Anguiſh into Death, and <hi>ſprouteth</hi> forth again into the Liberty, and that is the Light together with the Fires ſource or quality, but it now containeth or holdeth <hi>another</hi> Principle in it, for the Anguiſh is become Love.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And juſt ſuch a manner and kind it hath in the Body, for the Fleſh ſtriveth againſt the Spirit, the outward Fleſhes
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57401:135"/>
                     <hi>Life</hi> is a Looking-glaſs of the moſt inward Fire-Life, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Souls Life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Souls Spirit-Life, together with the Light in the <hi>Tincture</hi> the Middlemoſt Life, and yet becometh generated out of the Soul.</p>

9. Underſtand us thus; Concerning this Life of the Souls Spirit-Life; the Soul is the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, The Spirit is the precious Noble Image, which God created to his Image, herein ſtandeth the High-Kingly and <hi>precious</hi> Image of God, for God is alſo thus, and comprehended in the ſame Lifes quality or ſource.</p>
                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p n="11">11. Thus you may very eaſily and without much ſeeking find the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the Fleſh and of the Spirit, for the Inward Spirit hath God's Body, out of or from the Meek Subſtantiality, and the Outward Spirit, hath the fierce wrathfull Fires-Looking-Glaſſes Body, <hi>viz.</hi> the Souls Looking-Glaſſes Body, which would continually <hi>awaken</hi> the fierce Wrathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Great Wonders which lie in the <hi>Arcanum</hi> or ſecreſie of the Souls Sternneſs, therefore the Inward Love-Spirit,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57401:136"/>
hindereth it, that it ſhould not lift up it ſelf and kindle or inflame the Soul, elſe it would loſe its Love-habitation and Image, and the Souls Fierce-wrath would <hi>deſtroy</hi> it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Contrariety is thus; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spirit would be Lord, for it <hi>Subdueth</hi> the outward; and the outward would be Lord, for it ſaith, I have <hi>the Great Wonders</hi> and the <hi>Arcanum</hi> or Secret, and thus Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth about the Myſtery, and yet is but a Looking-Glaſs of the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is not the Subſtance of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; but a <hi>Seeking</hi> or Searching, like a palpable Looking-Glaſs, in which the Myſtery becometh ſeen, he will needs be a Maſter, being he hath attained one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and is an own Self-Life; but he is to be accounted a Fool in <hi>reſpect</hi> of the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Therefore loving Brother, if you would ſeek the Myſtery, ſeek it not in the outward Spirit, for ſo you will be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and get but a <hi>Glimps</hi> of the Myſtery: go in even to the Croſs, then ſeek Gold, you will <hi>not</hi> be deceived, you muſt ſeek the pure Child without blemiſh, in another World, in this world you find only the Ruſty or <hi>Droſſy</hi> Child, which is altogether
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57401:136"/>
imperfect, and now take this right thus.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Go from the Croſs back into the Fourth Form, there you have Sun and Moon one in another, bring it into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh into Death, and drive on the made or framed Magick body ſo far, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come again, what it was before the <hi>Center</hi> in the Will, and then it is <hi>Magical</hi> and hungry after Nature;</p>
                  <p n="16">16. It is a ſeeking in the Eternal Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would fain have a <hi>Body,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give him for a Body, <hi>Sol,</hi> viz. the Soul, and then it will ſuddenly make it a Body according to the Soul, for the Will ſprouteth in Paradiſe with very fair heavenly fruit without ſpot or <hi>blemiſh.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. My beloved Friend, that is a very ſharp queſtion, and needeth the Eyes of all the Three Principles, which can ſee very well, they muſt not die in Death, if they will enter in and ſee this, it muſt be Poyſon to Death, and a Peſtilence to Hell, it muſt <hi>take Death Captive,</hi> if it will ſee, elſe it gets no underſtanding, unleſs it ſelf come into Death, then it will well feel what Death is, it will well taſt, what that is, when one Principle breaketh, <hi>viz.</hi> one Life.</p>

in one Looking-Glaſs the deſire of the firſt Looking-Glaſs, becometh opened and cometh into Subſtance, and then as in all ſubſtances or things, the <hi>Turba</hi> is, which breaketh or deſtroys all to the firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that is alone and hath no break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or deſtroyer.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For, there is nothing more, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken or deſtroyed, it ſtandeth in it ſelf and out of it ſelf, and goeth whither it will, and then it is <hi>every where</hi> in no place; for it is in the Abyſſe, where there is no place of Reſt, it muſt only reſt in it ſelf.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. For, there is nothing that can give it ſource quality or pain, it is it ſelf, the thing of the firſt Subſtance; and though it be another thing, yet it is but its Twig, or Branch, and hath <hi>its</hi> will, and none other, for there is nothing that can give it <hi>another</hi> will.</p>

7. We give you to underſtand concerning dying, thus; the beginning ſeeketh the <hi>Limit,</hi> and when it findeth that, it caſteth the ſeeking away, that is the Earthly Life, that will be caſt away, it muſt break or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For, the Beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul, continueth in the Limit, and lets the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy depart, and there is <hi>no complaint</hi> about it; alſo the Soul deſireth it no more, it muſt go into the Limit, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Wonders of that which hath been done or wrought.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Souls Spirit hath no woe done to it, when the Body departeth, but woe is done to the Fire-Life; for the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Fire,</hi> which hath generated the Fire, that breaketh away, but only in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Figure, remaineth ſtanding in the Will, for the Will cannot break, and the Soul muſt continue in the Will, and taketh the <hi>Figure</hi> for Matter, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Will; for the firſt Glance of the Fire, goeth not away, but its Matter of the Earthly Life, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Phur,</hi> will be broken away from it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Thus the Fire becometh impotent,

and paſſeth into the Darkneſs, unleſs it be ſo that the Spirit have <hi>Heavenly</hi> Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Body, then the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the right or true Soul, received that ſame meek Body for a <hi>Sulphur,</hi> then the Soul burneth in the Love-Fire, and is wholly gone away out of the firſt Fire-Life.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. It is now in God's Principle, the firſt fierce wrathful fire cannot touch it in Eternity, for it hath gotten another Source or Quality, and is rightly and truly New born or <hi>Regenerated,</hi> and knoweth no more of the firſt Life, for it is ſwallowed up in the <hi>Magia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. The <hi>Turba</hi> remaineth in the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Body, and becometh that again which it was before the Body was, <hi>viz.</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a <hi>Magia,</hi> wherein all its doings mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or ſubſtances ſtand in Figure, as in a Looking-Glaſs; but not Corporeally, but according to the Manner of the Eternity; as we apprehend that all Wonders, before this world ſtood in a Myſtery, as in the Virgion of Wiſdom, but without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Thus now we apprehend alſo here, that, that very Myſtery, in its parting became

ſo Manifeſted, that it cannot in Eternity be <hi>extinguiſhed,</hi> but remaineth Eternally ſtanding in the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> and in the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is ſeen in the <hi>Magia,</hi> in the Separation or Parting, after that manner as it hath here formed it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Thus it is apprehenſible to us, what the <hi>Separation</hi> or parting is, <hi>viz.</hi> This; the <hi>Turba</hi> hath found the <hi>Limit</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for ſickneſs to Death is nothing elſe, but that the <hi>Turba</hi> hath kindled it ſelf, and will break or deſtroy the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; It is at the Limit, and will caſt away the Introduced <hi>Medium</hi> or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And this is alſo the Cauſe that the Body Dyeth, the <hi>Turba</hi> paſſeth into it ſelf into the Fire, and ſo the Outward Life extinguiſheth, for the Lifes fire becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth withdrawn from it, and then it goeth into its Aether, and is at its <hi>Limit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. And ſo now if the Souls Fire hath not <hi>in</hi> its Spirit, God's Body, nor in its will, in its Deſire, then it is a Dark Fire, which <hi>burneth</hi> in Anguiſh and in great horrour, for it hath only the firſt four forms of Nature in the <hi>Anguiſh.</hi>

                  <p n="18">18. And if the Will hath nothing of the Power or Vertue of <hi>Humility,</hi> then there

                  <p n="20">20.

                  <p n="22">22. And if it hath in its life-time, laid hold of any thing that is pure of the Love, as many that at Laſt convert in the End, thoſe ſink down thus in themſelves, through the Anguiſh; for the Humble ſparkle, goeth <hi>down</hi> through Death into Life, where indeed the Souls Source or Quality and <hi>Pain</hi> taketh its End; but it ſelf is a little Branch or Twig Sprouting into God.</p>
                  <p n="23">23.

                  <head type="sub">How the Soul is Mortal, or how it is Immortal.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. A Thing which hath an Eternal Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hath alſo an Eternal End; as the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Soul hath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But as to what concerneth the Image which God created, which hath a <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> beginning, that is generated out of the Eternal, and will be ſet in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Subſtance without ſource quality or <hi>pain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And where there is no ſource qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or pain, there is no Death; and though there be ſource quality or pain, as in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there is ſource quality or pain, yet it is in One will or in <hi>Harmony,</hi> and that is grounded or founded in the Eternity: There is nothing that findeth it, and ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come into it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And now where there is one will, as in God, who is all in all, there is nothing elſe that can find the wil, there is no <hi>Turba</hi> there, for the will deſireth nothing elſe,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57401:145"/>
but only it ſelf and its Twigs or <hi>Branches,</hi> which all ſtand in one Tree in one Eſſence; the Tree is its own Beginning and its own End.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Soul is proceeded out of <hi>God</hi>'s Mouth, and goeth in the dying of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, again into God<hi>'s</hi> Mouth, it is in the <hi>Word,</hi> the Subſtance, and in the <hi>Will,</hi> the Deed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Who will now judge or condemn that thing which he hath in his own Body? as the Souls is, which is in the Body of God, it is <hi>hidden</hi> from all Evil, in God; <hi>Who</hi> will find it? none but Gods Spirit, and one Soul another, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fellowſhip of Angels.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But the wicked Soul hath <hi>loſt</hi> its Image in the Limit, for it is entered into the Limit, and the Limit is the <hi>End</hi> of the Image; the <hi>Turba</hi> deſtroyeth the <hi>Firſt</hi> Image, and draweth the Wills Subſtance or Actings to it for an Image, and theſe are alſo Immortal, for the <hi>Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> dyeth not, for it is from no Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If the Eternal Nature in the Anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, ſhould die, then alſo God<hi>'s</hi> Majeſty would Extinguiſh, and of an Eternal ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57401:145"/>
there would be an Eternal Nothing, and that <hi>cannot</hi> be; that which is from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>continueth</hi> Eternally.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Falſe or wicked Soul can awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no other Source or Quality, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which hath ſtood from Eternity in the Anger-Eye, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Center</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</p>
                  <p n="10">10. All hath been from Eternity, but Eſſentially in the Eſſence, not in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Eſſence; not Subſtantial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits but <hi>Figured</hi> Spirits, without Corpori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, have been from Eternity, as in a <hi>Magia,</hi> where one hath ſwallowed up the other in the <hi>Magia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. And out of Both, the Third is come to be, according to the Form or Manner of them both: there hath been a ſtirring up from Eternity, and a figured Subſtance, and the Creation hath ſet all in <note n="*" place="margin">Or Works of Wonder.</note> Wonders, ſo that in the Eternal <hi>Magia</hi> now and in Eternity all ſtandeth in Wonders.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. If the wicked Souls had introduced no Subſtance in their will, then there <hi>had been</hi> no Woe in them, there would have been no feeling or perception of pain but <hi>Magia;</hi> but the Subſtance is an Image, and is in the <hi>Turba,</hi> and ſo there is a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57401:146"/>
perceptible ſource quality or pain.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is a dying and yet no dying, but a <hi>will</hi> of Dying, <hi>viz.</hi> an Anguiſh in that ſame Subſtance or Thing, which is introduced into the will.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And that cauſeth that all things pant after God, and yet cannot reach him, and that maketh Anguiſh and Sorrow for the Introduced Evil, <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> the Soul continually thinking, <hi>if thou hadſt not done this or that,</hi> thou mighteſt have attained the Salvation of God, and ſo the <hi>Evil</hi> Subſtance Matter or Thing done or committed, maketh the Eternal Deſpair.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Therefore we ſay, that no Soul Dyeth, be it in God, or in Hell, and its Subſtance or Doings <hi>remain</hi> ſtanding E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally to the Glory of God's Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THis is clearly enough explained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that it hath been <hi>ſpoken out</hi> from God's Mouth, and by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit created into the Image of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore if it continue ſo, then, when it paſſeth out of the Earthly Life, it is clearly in God's Mouth; for it is in God's Body; <hi>No</hi> Source Quality or <hi>pain</hi> toucheth it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. HE that <hi>underſtandeth</hi> rightly the three Principles, hath here no further queſtion: for the Soul goeth not out at the Mouth, for it went not in at the Mouth; but it <hi>paſſeth</hi> only out of the Earthly Life, the <hi>Turba</hi> breaketh off the Earthly Life, and then the Soul remaineth ſtanding in its Principle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For, the Body doth not lay hold of it, no Wood nor Stone layeth hold of it, it is thinner than the Air, and if it hath God's Body, then it goeth directly as a <hi>Conquerer</hi> quite through the <hi>Turba,</hi> viz. through the Anger of God, and quite through Death, and when it is through, then it is in God's Body:</p>

                  <p n="6">6. It is as <hi>ſwift</hi> as the Thought of a Man; it is Magical, it dwelleth in its <note n="*" place="margin">Or Works and Actual Thoughts, Words and Deeds which it Exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Life.</note> Wonders, they are its <note n="†" place="margin">Therefore in our Fathers houſe are many Manſions or dwelling places or particular Houſes</note> Houſe or Manſion or Habitation.</p>

10. Moſt Souls go from the Body <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> Chriſt's Body, but they hang by a Threed, and are in their Faith at laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Will, which Souls are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the Spirit in the Image, but not in the Fleſh.</p>

of Home, and of the time of return to enjoy his Parents and Friends; he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at the <hi>thought</hi> of that day, and waiteth for it with <hi>inward</hi> Joy and Longing, and exerciſeth himſelf in his <note n="†" place="margin">Subſtance or Matters buſineſs and employment.</note> affairs, that he may get alſo Art and Ingenuity or underſtanding and <hi>experience,</hi> wherewith he may rejoyce his Parents Kindred and Friends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In like manner we offer to your Mind, and give you this to Conſider of, that the Soul without the Body, hath great <hi>inward</hi> Joy, and waiteth for the laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Day, with great inward deſire, when it ſhall get its bright fair Holy Body with the wonders <hi>again.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. And it is highly apprehenſible and perceptible to us, but in the <hi>Spirit</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its knowledge, that the bleſſed Souls, rejoyce in their here-Exerciſed-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and do exceedingly recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Wonders which they ſee

                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p n="9">9. Now what joy is in theſe, we have <hi>no</hi> Pen to Write; only we apprehend that thoſe for the moſt part, in this world have put on God's Body, and ſo are in greater Perfection then the other; they wait for the Laſt Judgement Day, with Great Joy Honour and Glory, when their Works in

                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Every ſuch Soul rejoyceth in great <hi>Hope</hi> before the Face of God, at that which ſhall befall it: for it apprehendeth its wages, but cannot receive that without the <hi>Body,</hi> for it hath done its <hi>Labour</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> therefore it will get that again alſo which will follow after it in the New Body.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For although the highly pretious Holy Souls have in this world put on Chriſts Body, ſo that they ſtand as an Image of God in <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet all their works have been made or wrought in the Old Body, which was God's Looking-Glaſs, and they ſhall in the Reſurrection be <hi>preſented to them</hi> in the Figure exactly Heavenly in their Body.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For the firſt <hi>Image</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> was before the Fall, is become Regenerated in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and will be put on to the Soul again with its Wonders, and though it hath Gods Body aforehand, yet the Wonders ſtand in the <hi>firſt</hi> Image.</p>

is gone, for it was a Looking-Glaſs, and is <hi>now become</hi> a Wonder; It liveth without Spirit as a Wonder, and will be put upon the Soul in great clarity or <hi>Brightneſs</hi> from the Light of God: which the Holy Souls rejoyce at exceedingly, and wait for it with great longing.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And we preſent to your apprehenſion, that every bleſſed Soul <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p n="15">15. As their works have been <hi>different</hi> upon Earth, ſo alſo is their Hope; for a day Labourer who hath done much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, rejoyceth at his wages, ſo alſo here there is a friendly Subſtance of <hi>Solace</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them and in them.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. All ſcorn and blaſphemy laid upon them, which they were not guilty of, is a great Victorious Honour and Glory to

them, that thus have ſuffered in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy wrongfully, and put on Patience in Hope, and this they have moreover, that death cannot take from them nor add to them, the Soul <hi>taketh along with it</hi> what it hath comprehended.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Their often <hi>hearty</hi> Prayers well wiſhing and well doing to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is their food, which they eat, and rejoyce themſelves, till their New Body ſhall eat Paradiſical Fruit.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But thoſe which have put on God's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy here, they eat without Ceaſing <hi>at Gods Table;</hi> but the Paradiſical Fruit belongeth to the <hi>Body</hi> of the Wonders, which ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe out of the Grave, which was created in Paradiſe: For it was made out of the beginning, and bringeth the <hi>End</hi> with the Wonders again into the <hi>Beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. And wonder not, as if we ſpeak, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are underſtood in your Eyes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning TWO Bodies of the moſt holy Saints, indeed there is not two of them, It is but ONE; conſider only how God's Subſtantiality filleth all, and that is God's Body, which is in this Life, put on to the holy Souls.</p>

20. For they caſt their Will into God's VVill, and ſo they receive alſo God's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which <hi>filleth All:</hi> their VVill dwelleth in God's Body, and eateth in God's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of God's VVord, of God's Fruit, of God's Power and Vertue, and Chriſt is in God, God is become Chriſt:</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Thus they carry about them Chriſts Body in God, and yet nevertheleſs <hi>wait</hi> for their <hi>Firſt Adams</hi> holy Body with the VVonders, which ſhall be put on them with Paradiſical ſource or quality.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. For, God's purpoſe muſt ſtand, he created the firſt Body in and for Paradiſe, it ſhould remain eternally therein; It muſt go in <hi>thither</hi> again, and the Soul upon the Croſs of the Number Three, into the Mouth of God, from whence it came; and and yet the whole Perſon with Body and Soul <hi>remaineth</hi> one in another; but God filleth all in All.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. O, that we had a Humane Pen, and could according to our Apprehenſion write it down in your Souls-Spirit: How would <hi>many convert</hi> out of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> out of <hi>Babel</hi> and the Covetous proud valley of Miſery, which yet is but Anguiſh and Source Quality or Torment, full of fear pain and terrour.</p>

24. Thus we give you to apprehend, and give you highly to conſider of, the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Miſerable State and <hi>Condition</hi> of the Damned Souls; what they have to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and but briefly, becauſe the next queſtion doth it at large.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Their Expectation is like a Captive impriſoned Malefactor that continually li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth, when any thing <hi>ſtirreth,</hi> when the Executioner ſhould come and execute Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, &amp; give him his Reward; ſo alſo <hi>they:</hi>

                  <p n="28">28. For, they ſee and know, that at the Laſt Judgement Day, all ſhall be tryed by the Eternal Anger-Fire of God, and they feel very well, that <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15:</note>

                  <p n="12">12.

                  <p n="13">13. And if their Earthly buſineſs and Employment ſtick in them and <hi>Cleave</hi> to them ſtill, then indeed they take care about their Children and Friends, and this continueth ſo long, <hi>till</hi> they ſink down into their Reſt, ſo that their Starry Spirit be <hi>conſumed,</hi> then all is gone as to all care and perplexity, and they have no more feeling knowledge thereof, but meerly that they ſee it in the Wonders in: the <hi>Magia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. But they touch not the <hi>Turba,</hi> nor ſeek what is in this World, for they are once ſunk down from the <hi>Turba</hi> through Death, they deſire <hi>that</hi> no more, neither do they take any more care, for in care,

the <hi>Turba</hi> is ſtirring; for the Souls Will, muſt enter with its Spirit into Earthly things, which it would fain <hi>forſake,</hi> for it hardly got rid away from them before, it would not cumber it ſelf to <hi>let in</hi> the Earthly Spirit again.</p>
                  <p n="15">15.

                  <p n="22">22. Now, that which an Evil Man deſireth, that the Devil acted for him very readily; for he can <hi>better</hi> do it by or through a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul, then by or of himſelf; he is too rough, and terrifyeth the <hi>Magia,</hi> which aſtoniſheth the Elementary Spirit, and awaketh the Body: and we acquaint you, that all is done Magically in the Will, without awakening or ſtirring up of the Source Quality or <hi>pain;</hi> for, No Soul awakeneth or ſtirreth up its Eſſences to

                  <p n="29">29.

                  </p>
                  <p n="46">46. This voice is the Original Eternal Spirit, which holdeth or preſerveth the Life of all things, and hath <hi>alwayes ruled</hi> in all the Three Principles, for it is the Spirit out of which all and every Life is <hi>exiſted,</hi> and in which it ſtandeth in Eternity, which hath been the Life &amp; moving of all things, in which the Beginning of Every Life <hi>hath ſtood,</hi> as alſo its End, and the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for it is from Eternity and the Creator of all things.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. It hath <hi>two</hi> Eternal Beginnings, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Fire and in the Light, and the <hi>Third</hi> Beginning hath been a Looking-Glaſs of the Eternal, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of this World; It hath been as a Wonder in this World, and through it the Wonders are become manifeſted or revealed, and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57401:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it is which poſſeſſeth the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, its Motion is the Laſt.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. For in the Creation it moved the Father, and in the Incamation or becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man; it moved the Son, and now the laſt moving and Judgment is its own, it wil bring home every thing into its <hi>Eternal Place;</hi> and this is done through the Voice of the Word out of the Mouth of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. And the Spirit goeth forth in God in <hi>Two</hi> Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Anger, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Fire, it goeth forth as the Earneſt or ſevere fierce wrath of the fire-life; and in the Light of the Love, it goeth forth as a flame of the Divine Majeſty, and in the Spirit of this World, as a <hi>Wonder</hi> of Life, as indeed all this is undeniable.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. And if there were one that would ſeem to be ſo highly Learned as to deny it, he is required to ſhew it in any thing; we will not have any thing in this World excepted, but it ſhall give teſtimony to Us, let him <hi>come</hi> when he will, he ought not to for bear and ſay, <hi>We are Mad,</hi> ſuch a ſhort words anſwer are not enough, we will demonſtrate it to him ſo, that he ſhall find himſelf, and ſee, who he is, and though the Devil ſhould burſt for Anger, yet we will ſet it before his Eyes.</p>
                  <p n="51">

51. And being that Spirit hath the VVord <hi>Fiat, viz.</hi> God's VVord, with the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, out of which it hath ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated from Eternity, and as the Spirit of the <hi>Center</hi> goeth forth in <hi>two</hi> wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> one in the Fire, in the Eſſences of the Lifes Original, in the Ground of the Souls Original; and then ſecondly in the Light of the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſource or quality, which ſprouteth through Death, and is called God's Kingdom, where in the Light it is the Flame of Love, and in the Fire, the Flame of Anger;</p>
                  <p n="52">52. So it will alſo ſhake the Gates of Death, and awaken or raiſe the Dead, and it hath the word <hi>Fiat</hi> in it, and that <hi>Fiat</hi> is in the Soul and alſo in the Body, and though it hath conſumed the Body long agoe, yet the <hi>Turba</hi> with the Wonders of the Body are remaining in the <hi>Fiat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="53">53. And now muſt the Elements give the Subſtance or Works, which they have ſwallowed up, again to the <hi>Fiat,</hi> for the Word of the Lord is <hi>therein,</hi> but in its own Principle, every one of them muſt render or give up what it hath received, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth, the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Phur;</hi> and the VVater alſo its Eſſences; the Air the <hi>ſound</hi> of the Voice of VVords; and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57401:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Fire, the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of the Soul; for it ſhall all be judged diſtinctly, and ſentenced.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. All words which the Mouth hath ſpoken, which the Air hath received into it ſelf, and the <hi>Words</hi> which it hath ſerved to make, thoſe the Air ſhall ſet forth again, or repreſent again, for it is the Looking-Glaſs of the Eternal Spirit; the Spirit ſeeth all in the Looking-Glaſs.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. And now will Man in Heart Mind and <hi>Thoughts</hi> be proved and Judged; for the <hi>Turba</hi> ſtandeth in all Evil, Malice, or wickedneſs, which is againſt the Love, and there will not much <hi>excuſe</hi> be made, for every one complaineth of, or accuſeth himſelf, his <hi>Turba</hi> accuſeth him.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. Underſtand us thus, that Spirit which is all in all, will awaken and raiſe every Life that hath been immortal, and with or by the <hi>Fiat,</hi> give it to the Body, for the <hi>Fiat</hi> draweth the Body to the Soul, with all its Deeds and VVonders, with all whatſoever it hath been done, with Words or Works; all whatſoever hath reached, the Souls Abyſſe, <hi>that muſt come forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="57">57. For in the ſtill or quiet Eternity, there ſhall be no <hi>Turba,</hi> more, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall all things or Subſtances, be tryed

                  </p>
                  <p n="59">59. Underſtand us aright thus; The Body which hath converſed here upon the Earth, that evil <hi>periſhed</hi> Body, which hath ſwallowed up that Noble precious and fair of bright Image of Paradiſe, ſhall come, and preſent it ſelf, with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Image in it, and <hi>give an account</hi> of God's Image.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. Now it is well with thoſe, who have Chriſt's Spirit, they have their <hi>firſt Image</hi> in the word <hi>Fiat,</hi> and that they muſt give again to the Soul, and that in the Adamical Body;</p>
                  <p n="61">61. But thoſe which have not Chriſt's Spirit, they will ſtand indeed preſented in the Evil Body, but their Soul will have <hi>loſt the right</hi> and true <hi>Image,</hi> and will have an Image in their Souls-Spirit; what their

daily Luſt or delight hath been, <hi>ſuch</hi> will their Image be.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. And in this hour, will alſo the fierce wrathful <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Darkneſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Devils, which now alſo <hi>ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Wages</hi> and Habitation, at which when they hear of it they Tremble.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. And thus will <hi>all the Dead</hi> both Evil and Good <hi>ariſe,</hi> every one in his Two-fold Body, and will have the Soul with the Spirit in the Body.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. One will have the outward Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, and therein, a <hi>Beaſtial</hi> Image in the Souls-Spirit, and will have the fierce wrathful <hi>Angers</hi> Subſtantiality or <hi>Works</hi> in the Inward Image.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. And another will have, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body, and therein <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Image, and in the Souls-Spirit will God's Love-Spirit give Light, on to theſe the Word <hi>Fiat</hi> draweth the right and true Adamical pure Image, <hi>again;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="66">66. For the pure Image ſtood in God hidden in the Word, which was Incarnate or became Man; And now when the Soul ſtandeth at the <hi>limit,</hi> it getteth that again, with the fair Virgin of the Wiſdom of God.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. For the Noble and Precious Image

                  <p n="68">68. For the Woman will in the Fire of God receive the Fires Tincture, ſo that ſhe will be as <hi>Adam,</hi> neither Woman nor Man, but a <hi>Virgin</hi> full of Chaſtity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, without Feminine or Maſculine ſhape or Members:</p>

                  <p n="9">9. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>his Father was called Jared:</hi> if you underſtand the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Nature, you had the whole Ground;</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And <hi>Enoch</hi> begat <hi>Methuſalah,</hi> who attained the Higheſt Age of any Man; and after he had begotten him, <hi>he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a Godly or Divine Life, till the Lord took him</hi> into his Principle.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And we are not ſo to underſtand it, as if he were <hi>wholly</hi> perfect in the Light of God's Majeſty, and ſhould not appear at the Judgment Day: He is indeed in God without neceſſity and Death, alſo in God's Love, but in the <hi>Birth</hi> of God's Principle; for he had alſo <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. So you know very well, that the

                     <hi>outward</hi> Kingdom, with the Earthly Fleſh, belongeth to the <hi>Turba,</hi> though indeed, he had in the outward Body, the Body of God's Wonders, as to which he was <hi>taken up</hi> into the Myſtery, ſo that the outward Body, was as it were ſwallowed up of the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But now muſt the Myſtery <hi>give up</hi> again, all whatſoever it hath ſwallowed up, as ye know that at the End it ſhall preſent the outward Body with all Subſtances or Works, before the Judgment of God, ſo alſo is the <hi>Turba</hi> ſtill in the <hi>outward</hi> Body with the Wonders, which ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and tryed in the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Seeing then <hi>Enoch</hi> is taken up, with Body and Soul, with <hi>both</hi> Bodies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his outward Body is in the Myſtery, and the inward Body is a Heavenly Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the <hi>Arcanum</hi> or hiddenneſs, and ſo he liveth in two Myſteries, inviſibly and incomprehenſibly to the <hi>outward</hi> World: as we give you to underſtand, that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is ſtill at hand and not vaniſhed, but is as it were ſwallowed up by the Curſe of God, and lyeth yet as a <hi>Myſtery</hi> uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For we can with good ground of Truth, ſay; that Paradiſe is ſtill upon

Earth; but we are not therein, yet <hi>Enoch</hi> is therein; but he hath ſtill the Body of the <hi>Turba</hi> in the Myſtery, and in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Myſtery he hath God's Body, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſical Body, that is capable of Paradiſe: thus he is a Wonder, and is a Prophet on the Crown at the <hi>limit</hi> of the Wonders.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. For ye know, the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>after he begat Methuſelah,</hi> the Man of the higheſt Age, that afterwards <hi>he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a Divine Life:</hi> and that is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>Methuſelah</hi> ſheweth the end of the Wonders of this World, and <hi>Enoch</hi> in his Divine Life after the Birth of <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelah,</hi> ſheweth as to his Three hundred years, the <hi>opening</hi> of the Wonders, and the open Miniſtry, <hi>viz.</hi> a preaching of Righteouſneſs, whereby every one hath his <hi>Turba</hi> ſhewen him, and the <hi>End</hi> of the Wonders of this World is ſhewed, <hi>viz.</hi> God's puniſhment and reward to the <hi>Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. And the Time after <hi>Enoch,</hi> wherein <hi>Enoch</hi> lived till the Number of the Crown, when <hi>Enoch</hi> with his Preaching was taken up, ſheweth that the Enochian Light, which appeared in his Time, will <hi>paſs</hi> again into the Principle, and will

ſeek the Earthly Body of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and it will be found that the <hi>Turba</hi> is ſtill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſo that there is no ſeeking more, for the <hi>Turba</hi> is found at the Limit, and worketh only to the Fire and to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Thus the End of this World is as the <hi>Dreggs</hi> of the Cup, and worketh in the <hi>Turba,</hi> to the blowing up of the Fire, and to the Judgment; for the outward World is become generated out of the <hi>Turba,</hi> and hath taken its beginning in the <hi>Turba,</hi> and the <hi>Turba</hi> is its proper own, thus the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſeeketh the End again in the fierce Wrath.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And as this World is become <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> in the fierce Wrath, ſo alſo will the beginning at the End, have the Spirit again in the fierce Wrath; for the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the End is all <hi>one;</hi> therefore you ſee very well, that in the Beginning the <hi>Turba</hi> ſwallowed up <hi>Adam,</hi> and brought him into Anger and Murthered <hi>Abel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Therefore</hi> ye Elect, deſire none of you to live to the time of the End, after <hi>Enochs</hi> taking up; but conſider, that when <hi>Enoch</hi> Preacheth, the Sun ſhineth, then <hi>go out of Babel</hi> it is a Golden Time; but your
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57401:199"/>
                     <hi>Turba</hi> cauſeth that <hi>Enoch</hi> ſhall be taken up.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>Enoch</hi> is not flyen away out of this World, he is paſſed into the Myſtery in the VVonders; for he is God's Preacher, and after that the <hi>Turba</hi> hath overcome the VVorld, then muſt he be ſilent, till the ſix Seals have ended their VVonders, and the Angels of the <hi>Turba</hi> poured forth their Viols, and then are the VVonders of the Anger <hi>finiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23.

                  <p n="26">26. <hi>Babel</hi> holdeth it in deriſion, and deſpiſeth <hi>Enoch</hi> for a time, then <hi>Enoch</hi> calleth <hi>Noah,</hi> but they account him an Old Fool, for Preaching of the <hi>downfal</hi> of <hi>Babel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. And <hi>Noah</hi> paſſeth into the other World through the Water, and calleth to <hi>Moſes,</hi> with his Wonders, and he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for he hath God's Wonders.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For, he is gone through Death, and hath brought his Body through Death, where then the <hi>Turba</hi> deſired to conſume it, and the Devil <hi>contended about it,</hi> and would have the <hi>Turba</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he had been an Angry Man, and brought the <hi>Turba</hi> on many.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. But it was ſaid to the Devil, that the <hi>Turba</hi> in the fire did not belong to him, for it ſerved to the Majeſty of God, and hath the VVonders: to him belonged the <hi>Turba</hi> in the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in the fierce

wrath, and is without the City, it ſhall not dwell in the City in the Principle, but without it;</p>
                  <p n="30">30. For, God hath not Created him in and for the Fire, he may continue in his own awakened fire-Life, for he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with <hi>Moſes</hi> Body; for <hi>Moſes</hi>'s VVonders in the Anger belong not to his <hi>Turba,</hi> he is an Outcaſt a Caſtaway.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Body is gone through Death, his unfadable Body, which hath the VVonders, hath ſwallowed up the Earthly in the <hi>Turba,</hi> and yet not in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable manner conſumed it; but he is alſo in the Myſtery: and his <hi>Turba</hi> which killed the firſt born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and drowned <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> in the Water, and ſlew the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Calves, alſo ſwallowed up <hi>Corah Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> with the Earth; that remained in Death;</p>

                  <p n="33">33. And now he is become a Lamb, and bringeth his works into <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s and <hi>Sems</hi> Goods, as a Myſtery of God in his Deeds of VVonder; But the Houſe is <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s, and they all dwell in <hi>Sems</hi> Tents, in his

her pomp and loftineſs will be taken away, ſhe ſets her ſelf againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and perſecuteth them, ſhe would kill them; but <hi>Moſes</hi> is dead already, and <hi>Enoch</hi> is taken up, and none in the <hi>outward</hi> Life is with them: They ſay, well, where is <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> let us ſee their Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and they are blind, and cannot ſee them: thus they rage againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and go forth to <hi>Battel.</hi>

                  <p n="38">38. Then <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth to <hi>Elias,</hi> which went out of this World in the Fire of God, in the Abyſſe of the Principle, with Body and Soul, he dwelleth in the Principle with ſtrong Might, and when he cometh and ſeeth the Cry that <hi>Babel ſtandeth in the Fire,</hi> then he kindleth the <hi>Turba,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Great Fire Burneth, which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Fleſh and Blood, alſo Stones and the Elements, and then ſhall <hi>Babel</hi> drink her <hi>laſt</hi> Draught.</p>

And <hi>Eve</hi> her ſelf, was but <hi>half</hi> a Virgin, for <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>other</hi> half, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Two Tinctures, wherein man appeared in a total <hi>entire</hi> Virgin and pure Love, and God through him, as the Original through the Creature, which he made out of himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And thus alſo in one whole or <hi>entire</hi> perſon there is a pure Love and Chaſtity, for it ſeeketh no other Mixture; it is it ſelf the <hi>Mixture</hi> of both the <hi>Tinctures,</hi> viz. of the Souls <hi>Tincture,</hi> and of the Spirits <hi>Tincture,</hi> and therein is power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that it can generate a Spirit out of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57401:203"/>
the Fires<hi>-Tincture,</hi> which is called Soul and Spirit;</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Which <hi>Adam</hi> ſquandred away, when he let the Earthly Life captivate him, and therefore he muſt be broken and a <hi>Woman</hi> be made out of him, which muſt ſet her Love Delight Longing and Imagination into <hi>Adams Tincture,</hi> if ſhe would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate with a Soul:</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And None can ſay, that <hi>Eve,</hi> before the Touching of <hi>Adam,</hi> was a pure Chaſt Virgin: for as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> awaked out of ſleep, he ſaw her ſtanding by him, and imagined ſuddenly after or into her, and took her to him, and ſaid, <hi>This is Fleſh of my Fleſh, and Bone of my Bone; ſhe ſhall be called</hi> a ſhe-Man or <hi>Woman,</hi> becauſe ſhe is taken out of Man.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And ſhe <hi>Eve</hi> alſo ſuddenly Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Adam,</hi> and one kindled the other in the ſeeking.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And where is now the pure Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Modeſty? <hi>It is not</hi> Beaſtial, is not the outward Image become a Beaſt? As is ſufficiently to be ſeen in the Will and Subſtance or Doings, that Man doth as a Beaſt, and <hi>more</hi> fooliſhly; for he hath Reaſon, and rideth on in Reaſon ſo ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly.</p>

11. But that it might be remedied, and the Image come into <hi>One</hi> again, therefore <hi>is</hi> the Word, which ſpake the Soul forth out of God's Mouth, and by the Holy Spirit, breathed it into the Image, <hi>become Man,</hi> and is entred into the Earthly Image, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Turba</hi> of Deſtruction,</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And you know very well, that the Word <hi>hath</hi> the Water of the Eternal Life, and the Fire of the Deity, and out of the Fire, the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the Deity, and in the <hi>Tincture,</hi> the Spirit of God; which goeth forth out of God's Mouth, and in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, is the Glance of the Majeſty in the working of the Spirit, Manifeſted.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That very word, is in the Virgin of the Wiſdom of God, and <hi>ſurrounded</hi> with the Eternal Wonders; and that now out of the Great Love and Humility <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> our Image, which was deſtroyed to us in <hi>Adam,</hi> is entered into us again, and is in <hi>Mary,</hi> underſtand in the Earthly <hi>Mary,</hi> but with the Bleſſing, become Man or <hi>Incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Bleſſing is this, that to the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> the Heavenly Virgin the Wiſdom of God was put on, which <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt, and therefore the Angel

                  <p n="15">15. No Woman from <hi>Adam</hi> to this Day, had the Heavenly Virgin put on to her, but only <hi>this Mary;</hi> and therefore with the Bleſſing ſhe became Chaſt and full of Modeſty, for the Spirit goeth <hi>not</hi> into the Earthly, it Mixeth it ſelf not with the Looking-Glaſs: for that <hi>cannot</hi> be, that the Looking-Glaſs, ſhould be as the Life it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Thus underſtand us dearly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its precious Depth; Mans Soul is out of God, and out of the <hi>Eternal;</hi> but Mans Body is a <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Thus hath God put on to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> God's Virgin; but in the Souls Principle, not in the Earthly Fleſh, <hi>as if</hi> ſhe were Deified; no, ſhe muſt <hi>die,</hi> as all mankind doth.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And in that very Virgin hath Gods Word, out of God the Fathers Heart, <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed</hi> the Seed of the Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> Seed, and the firſt Images Seed, which now ſtood ſo long time in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, <hi>broken:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. And now God's Life came therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp; made again a whole or <hi>Entire</hi> Image, for the Water of the Eternal Life, out

                  <p n="19">19. Thus the Word, took hold of the Souls <hi>Tincture,</hi> and the Holy Spirit of the Spirits <hi>Tincture,</hi> viz. of the Waters <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> and out of Both became one Soul, and yet the Creature remained diſtinct from God's Spirit: but God's Spirit dwelleth therein, and ſo out of God's Water and <hi>Tincture,</hi> and out of the Seed of <hi>Mary,</hi> out of her <hi>Tincture</hi> and Water in the high Bleſſing, came one Fleſh and Blood; ſo that a Heavenly Man Equally at once in the Earthly, became Man, or was <hi>Incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. So that a Man might ſay, <hi>this</hi> is the Womans Son, viz. <hi>Maries</hi> right true bodily natural Sonne with Soul and Body, with Fleſh and Blood, and <hi>all</hi> whatſoever a Man hath; and alſo God's true Sonne, which was generated out of God's <hi>Eternal Subſtance from Eternity,</hi> before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World was laid, which ſtood in the Majeſty of the Holy Number Three, and alſo in the Body of <hi>Mary</hi> equally alike at <hi>Once:</hi>

21. And the Soul of Chriſt belongeth <hi>half</hi> to the Principle of this World, and <hi>half</hi> to the Holy Spirit: for the Soul of Chriſt made uſe of the outward Spirits Air of the Stars or Conſtellations, with the Power and Vertue of the Elements, and alſo of the Word of God, and of Divine food: for ſuch a Man was <hi>Adam</hi> in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
                  <p n="22">22.

                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Thus you may underſtand what Chriſt's <hi>Temptation</hi> was, <hi>viz.</hi> that the New Regenerate Man, ſhould now hold out or endure <hi>Adams</hi> temptation, to try whether his Soul could ſtand in God, and there he was tryed in the <hi>Turba,</hi> to ſee whether he could rightly ſtand in the <hi>Three</hi> Principles, and <hi>rule</hi> over the Outward:
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57401:205"/>
and therefore his food of the outward Life was withdrawn from him, that the inward Life might <hi>overpower</hi> the outward, and eat of the Word of the Lord, and hold the outward in its own power and full <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,</hi> and alſo hold Death Captive, that it ſhould not deſtroy the outward Life, this muſt <hi>needs</hi> be a Great Combate.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And then the other <hi>two</hi> Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were theſe, he was tryed whether Man would live in <hi>full</hi> obedience to God, and let God work in him, or whether he would lift up himſelf again, and free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from God as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did: and <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the Devil muſt tempt him, ſeeing this Man was to poſſeſs his Kingly or Royal Throne.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Therefore the Devil <hi>complained,</hi> that he was not able to ſtand, the Mother of the fierce Wrathfulneſs drew him ſo hard; <hi>therefore,</hi> it was now permitted to him, that he ſhould tempt and try it in <hi>this</hi> Man, and ſhould ſet before him, <hi>that</hi> which was ſet before himſelf; and if this Man did <hi>overcome;</hi> he ſhould be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Judge, who was found to be a <hi>Lyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. For he Tempted him in the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> Aſſault fully to try, whether he would <hi>flie</hi> in his own ſelf might, and he
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57401:206"/>
himſelf had done, and had awakened the Anger, or whether he would put his Truſt alone in God, and live in God, with Will and Subſtance or Deed, as a Child in <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the Father; and this he tryed ſo long with him, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>before his ſleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. Thus muſt we alſo Continually be Tempted; but in Chriſt who hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come we <hi>can</hi> have the Victory, for his Soul is our Soul, and his Fleſh our Fleſh, if we truſt in him and give up our ſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to him, as Chriſt gave himſelf up to his Father.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And thus beloved Friend; you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>what</hi> Chriſt's Soul and Body is, <hi>viz.</hi> Our Soul and Body, if we cleave to God; but if not, then we are rent off, and are according to the <hi>outward Life,</hi> fallen home to the Spirit of this World, <hi>viz.</hi> to the periſhed <hi>corrupt Adam,</hi> and according to the Soul, fallen home to the <hi>Devil</hi> in the Anger of God; ſeek this more at large in our other Writings, where you ſhall find the whole ground of Heaven and of this World.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THis is that Great <hi>Jewel,</hi> for which we highly rejoyce, that we know it, ſo that we know our ſelves what we are, and it is more dear and acceptable to us then the whole World; for it is that Pearl <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>for which one ſold all his Goods and bought that Pearl,</hi> of which Chriſt ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For it is more profitable to <hi>Man</hi> then the whole World, it is more Noble and Precious then the Sun, for the Noble or Precious Stone of the Wiſe <hi>Men,</hi> the Philoſophers Stone lyeth THEREIN, it hath the <hi>Myſterium Magnum,</hi> The Great Myſtery, Heavenly and Earthly; and there is nothing like it <hi>in this World,</hi> but only the mean ſimplicity, which ſtandeth ſtill, and generateth or awakeneth no <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> this hath the Jewel hidden in it; as
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57401:207"/>
the Gold lyeth in the Stone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And continueth unconſumed, if a Robber with the Earthly <hi>Turba</hi> cometh not upon it, and deſtroyeth it, and yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it not, ſo is alſo the own ſelf-Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore we dare, and can with good ground ſay, that a ſimple <hi>Layick,</hi> which in ſimplicity, without much Skill and Art <hi>cleaveth to God,</hi> hath the <hi>Myſterium Magnum</hi> better and ſurer, alſo undeſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then a high <hi>learned</hi> Doctor, that flyeth aloft in his Reaſon, and deſtroyeth the Jewel and ſetteth it in <hi>Babel;</hi> this indeed will not reliſh well, but we are not much concerned in that, we ſhould ſet forth the Truth and baulk or ſhun none.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now when we ſpeak of Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then Reaſon underſtandeth the Soul, or indeed the outward Life's Spirit, which ſtandeth in power and vertue and winking of the Stars and Elements; but no, it is <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> thing, wherein the Image of God ſtandeth; the outward Spirit belongeth not to the Deity, but to the Wonders.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We have truly and clearly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, but ſince it is hinted expreſly in the Queſtion, that Chriſt commended it to his Father in his Dying, therefore
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57401:207"/>
we muſt ſpeak thereof <hi>how</hi> it was.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. You have ſufficiently conceived before, in what manner the Soul is the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, the Original of Life, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; as <hi>viz.</hi> a Fire of God, which <hi>ſhould</hi> be turned and inclined into Gods Eternal Will, wherein it is Originally generated out of the Magick <hi>ſeeking,</hi> and out of the Eternal Nothing is become a Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, wherein ALL <hi>Things</hi> lye; The Deity, with all the Three Principles, and all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is or is called Being or Subſtance or Thing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Alſo it is explained, how out of the Fire, the Light is generated, and the Spirit-Air, and then how the Fire draweth the Spirit-Air again into it ſelf, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually <hi>bloweth up</hi> it ſelf again, and ſo with the Light and the Air, and the ſource or quality of the Fire, <hi>is</hi> the Life of its own ſelf.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. Wherein the two Forms become <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,</hi> one according to the Fire-ſource or quality, <hi>viz.</hi> Red, and therein the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and vertue, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Now in the Blood is the Original of the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Warmth,</hi> that is a <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> a Life, and in the power and vertue of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> goeth forth out of the Thin Water of Life, the power and vertue out of the power and vertue, and the vertue and power receiveth that <hi>going forth</hi> or <hi>exit</hi> continually again, and that going forth is free from the Fire; and alſo from
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57401:208"/>
the power and vertue, for it is going forth and yet is <hi>generated</hi> out of the Power and Vertue:</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And this is now the right and true Spirit, that becometh generated out of the Soul, wherein the Image of God with the Divine Virgin of the Wiſdom of God, <hi>ſtandeth:</hi> for in the Spirit lyeth all Wit or Ingenuity, Wiſdom and Underſtanding; it hath the THOUGHTS, and the Noble or Precious Life, which uniteth it ſelf with God, and is ſo ſubtile, that this Spirit CAN and may enter into God.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And then if this Spirit do give it ſelf up into God; and caſteth away its Souls Fire-pomp and Wit, then it <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> God's Image and God's Body; for it goeth with the Will into God, and <hi>dwelleth</hi> with Power and Authority in God; Thus it hath God's Subſtance on it or in it, and is without this World in the Life of God.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But being this Spirit out of the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, firſt <hi>originateth</hi> out of the Fire-Life, though it is not the Fire-Life, but its Spirit, and the Fire-Life with the Original in the Abyſſe ſtandeth in the quality or ſource of the Anger of God: therefore hath Chriſt not Commended this his Spirit, to the <hi>Fiery-</hi>Life, but to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into his Hands.</p>

15. His Hands are the <hi>Love</hi> Deſiring, wherewith he reacheth after our Spirit, when we enter into him, and Commit or Commend our ſelves to him:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. And <hi>thus</hi> came now the Soul of Chriſt with the Spirit, into God's Hands compriſed in the Anger-Fire in Death; there Death would have held him, but it was <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>made a ſcorn of:</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="19">19. That was a Poyſon to Hell, that the Love of God came into it, and ſlew

                  <p n="20">20. Thus the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>took the Devil Captive,</hi> and brought him out of this Souls-Fire forth into the Darkneſs, and <hi>thruſt him into Darkneſs,</hi> out from the Souls Fire, &amp; out from Gods Fire, into the fierce wrathful harſh auſtereneſs and bitterneſs in the Cold, there he may heat himſelf leſt he freeze for Cold.</p>

                  <p n="22">22. Thus ye have in brief, deſcribed, what Chriſts and our Spirit is, <hi>viz.</hi> not the outward Life, but the Spirit of the Soul, not the Soul it ſelf, but <hi>its Lifes-Spirit.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Therefore do not burthen us with

                  <p n="6">6. But it ſeeth that all is <hi>mixed;</hi> for God is become Man, and ſetteth forth his Mercy <hi>every where</hi> in the Anger, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the Perdition, and therefore muſt the Prophet now ſpeak Magically, and not with <note n="†" place="margin">Runden Worten.</note> plain VVords; for it cometh to paſs many times, that a thing that is Evil in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet there groweth ſuddenly a ſmall Twig or Branch out of it, which breaketh the <hi>Turba,</hi> and ſo there cometh a <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> into it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Therefore God cauſeth you to be admoniſhed, that you ſhould ſubdue and reſiſt the Heaven of the Firmament, and then often, the <hi>Evil,</hi> which the Firmamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

                  <p n="13">13.

ed in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the Divine <hi>Magia,</hi> as a Figure or Image without Subſtance, from Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet that thing was not Subſtantial but Eſſential; and was apprehended in the Principle in the <hi>Flaſh</hi> of Lightning, where the Fire originateth: but the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> of it hath faſhioned it ſelf into a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured Image in the Deſirous VVill of God; and hath ſtood before the Number Three of God, in the <hi>Magia</hi> in the VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of the Holy Trinity; <hi>in which</hi> as in a Looking-Glaſs God hath manifeſted or revealed himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Subſtance, and Image of the Soul, is to be conſidered in a fair <hi>Flower</hi> that ſpringeth out of the Earth, and in the Fire, and Light: as men ſee that the Earth is a <hi>Center,</hi> and yet No Life; but it is Eſſential: and out of it, groweth a fair flower, which is not like the Earth; alſo it hath not the <hi>Smell</hi> and <hi>Taſt</hi> thereof: much leſs its <hi>Figure;</hi> and yet the Earth is the <hi>Mother</hi> of the Flowers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thus is the Soul alſo diſcovered out of the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, out of the Eternal Eſſence with the VVord <hi>Fiat,</hi> in the VVill of God, and held or preſerved in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> ſo that is a Fire-Eye, and a <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

the Firſt Principle; diſcovered in a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely</hi> Form and Subſtance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And our of this Eye, is gone forth the Glance of its Fire; as a Lightout of the Fire, and in that Glance of its own Fire, was the <hi>Eternal</hi> Image ſeen, which is in the VViſdom of God, and compriſed by the VVill of the Heart of God, in the ſecond Principle: underſtand; by the VVord <hi>Fiat,</hi> of the Second Principle, in the Love and Power or Vertue of the Holy Trinity; in which the Holy Spirit goeth forth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thus is the Soul become a <hi>Total</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and Image of the Holy Trinity, where a Man is to underſtand, the Soul, to be the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature; and its Fire-Life to be the firſt Principle; but the Sprout, or the Image of the Soul, which is a Similitude of God, groweth forth out of the Soul; as a <hi>Flower</hi> out of the Earth: and is <note n="†" place="margin">Ergriffen Compacted.</note> compriſed by the Holy Spirit; for it is his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If the Soul, putteth forth its Image, underſtand out of the Fire Source or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, into the Light of God, <hi>then</hi> it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Light, as the Moon doth the Glance of the Sun: and thus its Image ſtandeth
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57401:219"/>
in the Majeſty of God, and it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soul, in the Light of God; and its Fire-ſource, becometh <hi>changed</hi> into Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deſirous Love; wherein it is acknowledged for God's Child.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But being the Soul is Eſſential, and its own Subſtance a Deſiring, therefore it is apprehenſible, that it ſtandeth in two <hi>Fiats,</hi> the one is its Corporeal Propriety, and the other is the ſecond Principle, out of the Will of God, which ſtandeth in the Soul; <hi>in which</hi> God deſireth IT for his Image and Similitude.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Beſides, God's Deſiring, is like a <hi>Fiat</hi> in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Soul, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually frameth or inclineth the Will of the Soul, <hi>towards</hi> the Heart of God: for the delight or <hi>longing</hi> of God willeth to have the Soul; on the Contrary the <hi>Center</hi> in the Fires-Might, willeth alſo to have it:</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For the Life of the Soul Originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Fire: <hi>therefore</hi> now there is ſtrife about the Image of the Soul; and that form or quality that <hi>overcometh,</hi> whether it be the Fire, or the Meekneſs of the Love, according to that, is the Soul qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified or conditioned; and out of the Soul, ſuch an Image appeareth, as the Will of the Soul is qualified.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:57401:219"/>
13. And we are to know, that if the <hi>Will</hi> of the Soul <hi>Altereth,</hi> then its Form becometh altered alſo; for if the quality or ſource of the Soul be fiery, <hi>then</hi> alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth ſuch a fiery Image out of it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But if the Soul in the <hi>Center,</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth <note n="†" place="margin">Or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to.</note> into the ſtern harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bitterneſs, then its fair Image becometh <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,</hi> with the Dark harſhneſs; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the harſh fierce wrath.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And then is that fierce wrath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Turba,</hi> which poſſeſſeth the Image, and <hi>deſtroyeth</hi> the ſimilitude of God, for in God is Love-Light Meekneſs; and in this Image, is Darkneſs, Harſhneſs and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and its Eſſential Quality, is Fire, out of the fierce wrathful Eſſences, and ſo this Image, as long as it ſtandeth in <hi>ſuch</hi> a Quality and Form in the Darkneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not unto God's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Further, in the <hi>Fire,</hi> ye have a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the Soul; the Soul is an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Fire, and the Flaſh of the Fire, maketh in it, the Life; the Soul reſembleth a fire-Globe or a fire-Eye.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Now, the burning fire, in the ſource or quality, ſignifieth the firſt Principle and the Life; whereas yet the fire is not the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57401:220"/>
Life; but the quality or <hi>Pain-</hi>Spirit, which exiſteth in the Anguiſh of the fire; &amp; which goeth forth out of the fire; like Air, that is the Right Fountain Quality or Source-Spirit of the fire-Life; which <hi>continually</hi> bloweth up the fire again ſo that it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Now the fire giveth forth a <hi>ſhining</hi> and Light, forth out of the quality or ſource, which dwelleth in the quality or ſource, and ſhineth forth from it: and yet the quality or ſource, comprehendeth not the Light, <hi>that</hi> comprehendeth not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle; wherein the Deity dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. For Men apprehend, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Vertue is in the Light, and not in the fire; the fire giveth only to the Light <hi>Eſſences,</hi> and the Life or the Light, giveth Meekneſs, and the <hi>Subſtantiality,</hi> viz. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Now, we underſtand, that in the Light, is an amiable Life without ſource or pain: and yet there is a ſource or pain in it, but not <hi>perceptible:</hi> it is no other then a longing Delight, or Love-Deſire.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Where we apprehend that ſource or quality to be a <hi>Tincture,</hi> in which the growing and <hi>Bloſſoming</hi> of flowers ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57401:220"/>
up: and yet the fire is the cauſe of it: and the Meekneſs is the Cauſe of the Subſtantiality; for the Love-deſire in the Light, draweth, and <hi>retaineth</hi> it, ſo that it is a Subſtance, but the fires deſire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And we are to conceive of the Soul thus: as to what concerns the Soul ſolely and purely in the <hi>Center,</hi> it is an Eſſential fire in the Eye of Eternity; and yet that Eye is deſirous, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Figure</hi> and Image according to the Wiſdom of God.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And in its deſiring, in its Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſtandeth the Image; for the Word <hi>Fiat,</hi> hath laid hold of it, that it might be a ſimilitude according to the Eternal Wiſdom of God, in which he dwelleth, in which he may manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Spirit, and whatſoever hath been in his Eternal Wheel, Orb, Sphere or Globe.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Thus the Majeſty of God <hi>flameth</hi> in the Image, in the Eſſential <hi>Fire,</hi> if the Eſſential <hi>Fire</hi> introduceth its <hi>deſire</hi> into the Majeſty; but if not, then is the Image Row and Naked, without God; and the <hi>Tincture</hi> becometh falſe or evil.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For, the Image ſtandeth in the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:57401:221"/>
                     <hi>Tincture,</hi> and Originateth in the <hi>Tincture,</hi> in the Light, not in the fire ſource quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or pain: as God's Heart or Word tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Original in the Light of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in the Eternal<hi>-Fires-Tincture</hi> of the Father; and ſo alſo doth the Image of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. The Image, dwelleth in the Fire of the Soul; as the Light dwelleth in the Fire; but it hath <hi>another</hi> Principle, as alſo the Light is another ſource or quality then the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Thus the right and true Image of God, dwelleth in the Light of the fire of the Soul; which Light, the fiery Soul muſt <hi>frame</hi> in the Love Fountain in the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, through its <hi>Imagination,</hi> and glving up.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And if the Soul doth it not, but <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth</hi> in it ſelf, in its fierce wrathful <hi>Form</hi> to the fire ſource quality or pain, and not in the Love Fountain in the Light of God, then ariſeth its own ſource or quality, of its harſhneſs, ſowerneſs, and bitterneſs; and the Image of God becometh a <hi>Turba,</hi> which ſwalloweth up the Image of God, in the fierce wrath.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And then the ſower <hi>Fiat</hi> in the fiery Eſſence of the Soul, figureth or frameth an Image for the Soul, according to its <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:57401:221"/>
in the Will, ſo that whatſoever the Eſſential <hi>Fire</hi> of the Soul deſireth, that becometh Imagined in the Soul, <hi>viz. Earthly</hi> Figures: whereinto the Will of the Heart caſteth it ſelf, and ſuch an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Soul maketh, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, according to the ability or power of the Third Principle, according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Stars and Elements.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Seeing the will of the Soul caſteth it ſelf into the Kingdom of this World, therefore now the outward Kingdom hath power and <hi>ability</hi> to introduce its <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> into the Inward Principle: and if the Inward <hi>Fiat</hi> diſcovereth that, in the fire of the Soul, then it becometh impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated therewith, and retaineth the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And now the Soul hath a <hi>Beaſtial</hi> Image, according to the third Principle, and it cannot be broken in Eternity: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Soul with its will, <hi>goeth out again</hi> from the Earthly Luſt longing or delight, and preſs into the Love of God again, and then it getteth God's Image <hi>again,</hi> which can only be done in this Life, while the Soul ſtandeth, is in its own <hi>Aother</hi> or ſoyl, in the <hi>growing</hi> of its <hi>Bloſſom</hi> or flower, Eſſentially; and <hi>after</hi> this Life, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</p>

32. Thus, we give you to underſtand, what the Soul, Spirit, Image, and <hi>Turba,</hi> is: the Soul dwelleth in it ſelf, and is an Eſſential <hi>Fire:</hi> and its Image ſtandeth in it ſelf in its <hi>Imagination,</hi> in its Light; ſo far as it cleaveth to God; if not, then it ſtandeth in Anxiety, in the fierce wrath of the Darkneſs, and is a <hi>Viſards</hi> Image, and an Image of the Devil.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Its <hi>Turba,</hi> which, breaketh the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image, is the <hi>Eſſential</hi> fierce wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and it is done through the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; or falſe or <hi>wicked</hi> Love and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining: therefore</hi> it lyeth wholly in the Imagination; whatſoever a Man letteth into his deſire, in that ſtandeth the Image.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. And it is highly neceſſary, for Men continually to <hi>ſtrive</hi> againſt the <hi>Earthly</hi> Reaſon in fleſh and Blood, and give up his Spirit and Will to the <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God, and continually caſt himſelf into God's Will, and NOT account Earthly Goods or Pleaſure its Treaſure, and ſo ſet its deſire therein; which deſtroyeth its Noble or Pretious Image: for that is a <hi>Turba</hi> of the Image of God: and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Beaſtial <hi>properties</hi> into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
