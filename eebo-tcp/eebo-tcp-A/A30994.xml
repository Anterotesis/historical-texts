         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The words then of my Text, without force or wreſting, afford theſe three following Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That 'tis Lawfull and the Duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to draw their ſwords in defence of their Sovereign.</item>
               <item>2. That 'tis not Lawfull but highly impious in Chriſtians to Rebel againſt their Sovereign, or diſturb the Government, under the ſpecious pretence of defending their Religion.</item>
               <item>3. That 'tis the Duty of Chriſtians patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer for their Religion, if it be their Lot to fall into perſecuting times, and this in moſt caſes the beſt, and in ſome the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy left them.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with the Firſt Poſition. That 'tis Lawfull and the Duty of Chriſtians to draw their ſwords in Defence of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign—<hi>If my Kingdom were of this world, then</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45230:19"/>
               <hi>would my ſervants fight that I ſhould not be deliver'd to the Jews</hi>—Whereby the King of Heaven, and Prince of Peace approves of the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kings of the earth, who have their Guards to defend their Sacred Perſons; Their Armies to oppoſe and ſubdue their Enemies. Whereby He gives a Commiſsion to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to fight for their Lawfull Sovereigns, and to lay their Enemies proſtrate at their triumphant feet. It was therefore a raſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> from our Saviours command to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> to ſheath his ſword, to infer it unlawfull for Chriſtians at any time to draw theirs. And 'tis highly culpable in his followers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from this one inſtance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all warfare Criminal, as if Chriſt had hereby disbanded all Chriſtian Soldiers. What is this but to make Chriſtianity a prey to the Unſatiable, a laughing-ſtock to the Inſolent, to proſtitute the Lives and Fortunes of Chriſtians to the pleaſure of the Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and to make Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kings of all men moſt deſpicable; if it were not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to repel Injuries by open Force, when all other means prove ineffectual. This were to deprive Subjects of the opportunities of ſhewing their Loyalty; of the Rewards due to thoſe who bravely venture their Lives to relieve Widows, Orphans, or any that are unjuſtly oppreſt; to defend Churches and the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45230:19"/>
Sacred Revenue from avaricious and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Hands. This were to blaſt the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of ſo many Chriſtian Kings, as got Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown in their glorious Attempts againſt the Barbarians.</p>
            <p>But that the Equity of Chriſtian Arms is eſtabliſh'd upon the Goſpel; appears in that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> though under the moſt rigorous exerciſe of a Spiritual Life, did not command the Soldiers, when they enquired of Him<note place="margin">Luk. 3. 14.</note> of the means of ſalvation, to lay down their Arms, or deſert their Colours; But only to be contented with their pay, to abſtain from Violence and Unjuſtice, <hi>i. e.</hi> That they ſhould not abuſe their power into Tyranny, and make their ſtrength the Rule of their Actions. Becauſe alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note>
               <hi>Beareth not the ſword in vain;</hi> which He muſt do if it were not Lawfull for him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to draw it. Becauſe Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> to put up his ſword, thereby to give a check to private Revenge, ſhall it not therefore be Lawfull for Magiſtrates to draw theirs, to retaliate Publick Injuries? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as to thoſe Sayings of ſome ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which are urg'd by ſome to oppoſe the Lawfullneſs of Chriſtians going to War,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis anſwer'd, Firſt, They only ſhew the Opinions of ſome Private Doctors, and not the ſenſe of the Catholick Church; That they

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Primitive Chriſtians did often times refuſe, at leaſt decline, Liſting themſelves in the Wars, by reaſon that the circumſtances of the times wherein they liv'd, did oblige them to ſuch conditions as were not ſo well conſiſtent with their holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us the Jews deſired an exemption from Military Expeditions, leaſt by their being in conjunction with Aliens, they ſhould not be able punctually to obſerve the Rites of their Law, for they might be compell'd to bear Arms on the Sabbath, or in their marches exceed the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of that day.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let it be conſidered that the Primitive Chriſtians were inflam'd with ſo much Zeal to all Holy and Sublime perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; that with them Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels had the force of Precepts. They eſteemed nothing difficult which tended to perfection. In which perſuaſion they exhorted to coeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy, forbid ſecond Marriages, refuſed all places of Dignity and publick Truſt; ſome of them underſtood that place, <hi>Swear not at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in a Literal ſenſe; they oftentimes choſe rather to looſe their right, than go to Law, and thought it praiſe worthy in Chriſtians to abſtain as well from ſharing in the Triumphs of War, as the pleaſures and profits of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe. Not that they look'd upon theſe as forbidden by the Law of Chriſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in their exalted Judgments and pious Raptures they thought the contrary more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable and highly acceptable to God. As for thoſe places of Scripture which ſeemingly forbid all kind of Revenge or Reſiſtance; which recommend the ſuffering of injuries and indiſpenſably injoyn Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, Love and mutual Friendſhip. When they are well conſider'd, they imply no more, than a prohibition of private Revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:45230:21"/>
of Inferiors reſiſting their Superiors, of one Chriſtians going to Law with another upon frivolous matters, eſpecially when there may be danger of giving offence to an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: or elſe they are to be look'd upon as extraordinary counſels to ſome men, who by reaſon of the Dignity of their Function are obliged to higher and more exemplary Acts of Piety. Laſtly, as to that famous Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> which without doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Chriſts Kingdom, and is thus recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;<note place="margin">Iſa. 2. 4.

               <hi>They ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks; Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they any more learn war.</hi> It muſt either be underſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, that ſuch indeed ſhould be the happy State of the world, would all men embrace and practiſe the Chriſtian Religion. For then there ſhould be no more Wars, or rumours of Wars; <hi>Janus</hi>'s Temple ſhould be for ever lock'd up, and an univerſal Jubile ſhould overſpread the face of the earth: or elſe if you will have it underſtood in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe, we are yet to expect and pray for the joyfull accompliſhment of it, as we are for the general converſion of the Jews, and the coming in of the fullneſs of the Gentiles. To conclude this point, all Ages do agree in the Lawfullneſs of a War, where there is the Authority of the Prince, a juſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45230:21"/>
cauſe, a good intention, and where only war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable means are uſed for the obtaining the End.</p>
            <p>But I think I might have ſaved my ſelf the trouble of proving my firſt Poſition, for though ſome of the ancient Fathers might be ſo nice and ſcrupulous in this matter, that they could not upon any terms be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go to War, leaſt they ſhould be forc'd to ſhed the bloud of others, though they were moſt generouſly prodigal of their own; our latter Ages have produc'd Chriſtians of a more ſanguine complection, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like principles: our modern Goſpellers [fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſteps of their Captain <hi>Ignatius Loyala,</hi> who inſtituted a Religious Order ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Diſcipline which he had learnt in the Camp] having it ſeems received clearer Illuminations, and larger Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, than the prime and immediate Apoſtles of Chriſt, have thought it expedient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their Religion <hi>Vi &amp; Armis,</hi> and to truſt more to the material than the ſword of the Spirit; for why ſhould not <hi>Knox</hi> enter the Liſt, who was a Ringleader of thoſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which he had miſerably involv'd his Country? or why ſhould <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Beza</hi> be excus'd, who have left behind them Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to juſtifie the Proceedings?

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have ſuch manifeſt Proofs, that the reſtleſs Enemies of our King and Church, are ready to act the ſame Tragedy over again, it cannot be unſeaſonable to conſider my Second Poſition— <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>That 'tis not Lawfull but highly impious in Chriſtians, to Rebel againſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, or diſturb the Government, under the ſpecious pretence of defending their Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Poſition is uſually prov'd from the truth of another more general, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not Lawfull upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to reſiſt the ſupream Power; and This commonly prov'd from the Law of Nature, from the Law given to the Jews; but more eſpecially from the Evangelical Law, and the Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians; which will be found the beſt interpreter of thoſe places of Scripture, which command abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Obedience, and which, though there were no other argument, does ſufficiently confute all thoſe pernicious Proviſo's, auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Limitations, all thoſe Pretences <hi>in Ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> that Subordination or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of Power, the reſolving it final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the People, at leaſt making it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the Inferior Magiſtrate; in ſhort all thoſe monſtrous Schemes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of Government, which either <hi>Rome,</hi>

I will ſuppoſe the worſt that can be ſuppoſed, That the Civil Magiſtrate ſhould be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, as to forbid the worſhip of the true God, and command the Adoration of an
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45230:24"/>
Idol; make a Decree againſt the <hi>Bible,</hi> and eſtabliſh the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> His Impiety does not cancel your Obedience, or Legitimate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Here 'tis that the derided Doctrine of paſsive Obedience takes place; neither will the Leviathans wicked Evaſions ſtand you in any ſtead. The Retaining God in your heart, whilſt you deny him with your mouth, will not ſerve your turn; neither can you excuſe your ſelf, by reſolving the Guilt of your Apoſtacy, into the Authority of the Commander; you muſt obey God, rather than man, by ſuſtaining the utmoſt that man can inflict, for Gods ſake. This muſt be acknowledg'd a very ſharp, and grievous Tryal, yet no more than has been born by others before you; for we have read of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 16.</note>
               <hi>Becauſe he would not obey the Idolatrous Decree of Darius;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 20.</note>of <hi>his three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions</hi> in a <hi>burning fiery Furnace, becauſe they would not worſhip the Golden Image Nebucad-nezzar had ſet up:</hi> And we ſolemnly commemorate in our daily Office, the Goodly Company of the Apoſtles, and the Noble Army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. We have heard that the mouths of Lyons were ſtopt, the Flames of fire quench't for the wonderfull Deliverance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and what is yet more to be had in Admiration, two impious Idolatrous Kings converted by their Heroick Conſtancy; And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45230:24"/>
that the later glorified God by their Deaths, and for a recompence receiv'd a Crown of immortality. And to be ſure the precious Bloud, of thoſe Martyrs of the firſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, became the fruitfull ſeed of the Church. In ſhort, Religion is an inward Principle, and keeps its chief Reſidence in the Minds of Men; and they may as well have their Underſtandings raviſh't, their Wills forc't, as be depriv'd of it. The Profeſſors may, but the Faith it ſelf cannot ſuffer violence from men. Rational Motives may perſuade; a Viſion from above may enlighten; a Voice convert; the cooler Breathings of Heaven, the Gentle and Kindely Inſpirations of the Spirit may captivate thoſe underſtandings, Subdue thoſe refractory Wills, which are Proof againſt all external Force, and defie the utmoſt Rage of Men. 'Tis as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Power of any Tyrant upon earth, to impoſe any One ſingle Article of Faith, or make me embrace his Religion in the Groſs, as 'tis for him to impart an Identity of Thoughts, or an Individuation of Souls. Let no man then dare to Rebel under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of defending Religion, for that cannot be taken from Him. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all let it be added for our comfort, If our Religion be that of the One, Holy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apoſtolick Church; If it be

Among all the Antidotes which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd againſt the Contagion of Hereticks, ſhow me one that has the leaſt compoſition of Force or Violence in it.

But then they mince the matter in theſe words, <hi>In hâc parte, &amp; pro hâc vice derogamus,</hi> &amp;c. So that even this Receſsion was rather extorted from them, by the neceſſity they lay under, than any willingneſs in thoſe pretended Infallible Doctors to retract, or own that they had done amiſs. 'Tis true, He who renounc'd all Sovereignty here on earth, that ſo the Princes and Emperours of the world might have no ſuſpicion of Him or his followers, did nevertheleſs keep his Religion under his

own Cognizance, and exempt It from their Juriſdiction; for he did not only teach, promulge and practiſe it in oppoſition to the Laws and Cuſtoms then receiv'd, in the very face of the Magiſtrate; but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over encourag'd his Diſciples to the like confidence and Reſolution. He foretold them that they ſhould be <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 18.</note>
               <hi>brought before Kings, and Governours for his name;</hi> before the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sanedrim, and <hi>Roman</hi> Tribunals to bear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the Truth; but bids them not be diſmayed, for He would be their Advocate, and defend both them and It againſt all Oppoſition. Not that hereby He grants them a Licence to Rebel, to violate their Duty to the Publick, in defiance of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, but only Inſtructs and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages them in their Duty to God, in deſpite of ſufferings. <note place="margin">Luke 12. 4, 5.</note>
               <hi>He bids them not fear them, who can only deſtroy the Body, but rather Him who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell.</hi> Thus they learn't Chriſt, and thus they taught others Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Thus Chriſtianity at firſt ſet out, and accordingly found Reception in the world; thus it made a glorious Progreſs, and thus it ſhall finally Triumph over all the Powers of Darkneſs. Which uſhers in my Third and laſt Poſition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>That 'tis the Duty of Chriſtians patiently to ſuffer for their Religion, when 'tis their Lot to fall into Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:45230:29"/>
               <hi>times, and this in moſt Caſes the beſt, in ſome the only Remedy left them.</hi> For hereby we give the Deareſt Pledges of an unfeigned Love to our Maſter; that we have not only followed Him for the Loaves, for any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Ends or Advantages. Hereby we make a Publick Declaration of the Sincerity of our Hearts. Hereby we give the Nobleſt Proof of the Truth of our Religion. Hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears we are true Diſciples, when we can take up the Croſs and follow Chriſt, in the moſt difficult, but moſt heroick Act of the Chriſtian Warfare. Hereby we ſhew that we have eſcaped the Pollutions of the world, and that the Glory of God, and our own Salvation hath been our Chiefeſt Aime. Yet this Poſition however true in it ſelf, ſeems of very hard Digeſtion to our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And this is the true Reaſon why our Diſſenters of late have made ſuch Diſmal Out-cries, ſuch <hi>Dire</hi> Preſages, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to Alarm the Nation with Fears, I hope, of their own Creation. And therefore I ſhall be very ſhort with them. The Religion for which they expreſs ſo great Concern, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which they make ſuch a ſtir, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth have been diſturb'd with their Out-cries, is either from God, or from Men. If it be from God, He will either defend it from Perſecution, or elſe by His mighty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45230:29"/>
Power enable the Profeſſors patiently to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it. And which way ſoever ſhall ſeem beſt to his juſt Providence, is fitteſt and moſt profitable for us. And ſo we are ſafe. If it be from men, 'twill come to nought; 'tis mutable as all other humane Inſtitutions are; and will rather veer to the Religion of the State, than undergo the leaſt Tryal of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. And 'tis to me a manifeſt ſign that thoſe men who cry out ſo much of Perſecution before hand (And amidſt the full Enjoyment of a dangerous Liberty) as if they had a Faggot already Flaming in their Breaſts, never intend to reſiſt unto Bloud, or undergo the fiery Tryal, if they ſhould be really brought to it. Their Religion is too Voluptuous, and the Profeſſors of it too Effeminate to court Martyrdom. Let them chooſe which Part of the Dilemma they pleaſe, and they are for ever ſilenc'd. If then ſober Advice might take place, I would entreat them in their Zeal to Religion, not to diſturb the Peace of the State. In their Fears of Perſecution; not to betray and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Croſs of Chriſt. In their juſt Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations againſt the Superſtitions, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> not to make Shipwrack of the Catholick Faith, in a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Separation from their Mother the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let them not out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable

Indignation againſt the wicked and Helliſh Practices of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to eſtabliſh the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, become Guilty of the ſame in an Obſtinate, Illegal, Unchriſtian Defence of their Own. And if any one think I injure them by this Advice, for I confeſs it implies a Guilt of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs caution'd againſt; I recommend to his ſerious and impartial Peruſal ſeveral late Collections publiſh't from their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. And there He will find that the moſt pernicious Doctrines laid down by the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in their Morals, are to be match't, if not out-done. For there He will find a Diſpenſation for Oaths taken; Licences to take contrary Oaths; Equivocation, Lying, Perjury, recommended. There He will find that the Saints alone had a Right to inherit the Earth; that the wicked might be Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, Plunder'd, Murthered; and all this under pretence of doing God good ſervice. There He will find Perſecution, Rapine, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege Preach'd and practis'd. There He will find ſpeaking evil of Dignities the Holy Idiom, and priviledg'd Language of the Godly. There He will find, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Kings encourag'd, effected, juſtified; in ſhort, for I delight not to dwell on ſo ungratefull a Subject; there He will find all the moſt conſummated Villanies conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

which were in the power of the Sons of Perdition to Act, ſince the ſhedding of the <hi>Bloud of Righteous Abel,</hi> unto the <hi>Murther of Righteous King Charles,</hi> and ſo down to this very day. But thou, O Holy Chriſtian, who art ſo indeed, and not in outward ſhew only, as thy heart bleeds within thy Breaſt, to think that there ſhould be ſuch Miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; that all that name the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould not depart from ſuch horrid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties; ſo thou knoweſt it to be thy Duty to follow thy Maſter in the ſeveral ſteps of his Life; to Faſt with him in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as Feaſt with Him at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in <hi>Cana;</hi> to watch and pray with Him in his Agonies in the Garden, as well as dwell with Him in his Glorification on the Mount; to act a part with Him in his Tragedy in the High Prieſts Hall, as well as attend Him in his Triumphs to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Thou knoweſt it to be thy Duty not Only to accompany Him to the Judgment Hall, but moreover, to <hi>Mount Calvery,</hi> and there to die for Him, who ſuffered the moſt dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Death for thee. And thou art invited hereunto by the Example, and Precept of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Captain of thy Salvation, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of the Faith; His Glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Apoſtles, His Noble Army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who in all Ages have finiſh'd their

Courſe, fought the good Fight, and receiv'd a Crown of Righteouſneſs. Thou canſt pity thoſe who laugh at the Doctrine of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, and conclude their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion falſe, which will not ſuſtain ſuffering for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake.

               <hi>Wiſdom of the Serpent and the Innocency of the Dove.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That we do not ſin againſt the Rules of Chriſtian Patience, if we Defend our ſelves when brought before Magiſtrates; for though Chriſt willingly ſubmitted to the Sentence, yet He carefully acquitted Himſelf of the Treaſon laid to his charge. This is confirm'd to us by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Prophets <hi>Elias, Jeremias;</hi> the Example of the Apoſtles, particularly Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, who appeals to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; Flies to their Guards for Protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſpirators; and did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain even Humane Policy, for He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Multitude, made the Major Part
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45230:31"/>
of his ſide, by Crying out, <note place="margin">Act. 23. 6.</note>
               <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren I am a Phariſee, the ſon of a Phariſee, of the hope, and Reſurrection of the Dead, I am called in queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſince Chriſt's Kingdom, is not of this world, that therefore we ſhould not immoderately thirſt after Riches, or affect Glories and worldly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt not take it heinouſly, if in perilous circumſtances we ſhould be betrayed by our friends, or deſerted by thoſe from whom we expected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; for this was our Maſters caſe, betrayed by one Diſciple, forſook or denyed by the Reſt; by <hi>Pilate</hi> deprived of the common privilege of the Law. He who before had furniſh'd his Enemies with a Band of Ruffians to apprehend Him, denies Him common Juſtice from the Bench for fear of diſpleaſing the Jews.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This place gives us comfort in our greateſt and moſt publick Calamities, for ſince <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> It ſhall never be overcome or deſtroyed, by

all the united Forces thereof. Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but Chriſt's Throne is eſtabliſh't for ever, <note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 13.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, This place manifeſtly reproves thoſe who have ſo long boaſted themſelves Chriſt's Vicars, for He whom they pretend to repreſent declares His Kingdom not to be of this world. But they uſurp to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Kingdoms of this world, diſpoſe of them at pleaſure; as if <note place="margin">Pſal. 149. 8.</note>
               <hi>that prophecy—They ſhall Bind their Kings in chains,</hi> did literally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to them to fulfill.

               <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>His who proudly ſaid, All theſe thingswill I give thee, If thou wilt fall down and worſhip me?</hi> for by the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Pageantry</hi> of a <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Religion,</hi> adorn'd with the falſe <hi>Glories</hi> of this world, they have bewitch't too <hi>Great</hi> a <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Nations</hi> of the earth; for I dare boldly ſay, that the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Image-worſhip, Invocation</hi> and <hi>Adoration of Saints, Indulgences, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Prayer for the dead,</hi> as they are practis'd in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, Tranſubſtantiation, Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> in one <hi>Kind, Papal Supremacy;</hi> the making which neceſſary <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, and laies the <hi>Schiſm</hi> at the <hi>Impoſers</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:45230:32"/>
               <hi>Door;</hi> I dare boldly affirm that they are fond <hi>Things,</hi> vainly <hi>feigned,</hi> that they are contrary to the <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that they have no better ſupport, than <hi>Credulity, Force, Falſification</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> humane <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tradition,</hi> or the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Coveteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> Indeed, I never thought thoſe the moſt Eloquent <hi>Preachers,</hi> who can call <hi>Whore,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> loudeſt; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 'tis not neceſſary that all our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould be turn'd into invective <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues</hi> againſt the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but it has often griev'd me to think that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peters Succeſſour,</hi> hath made that <hi>Title</hi> ſo much his own, as to endanger <hi>Mahomets Claim;</hi> that a <hi>Mother Church</hi> ſhould be ſo leudly fall'n from that <hi>Gravity, Purity</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity</hi> which in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and ſome <hi>Centuries</hi> after, ſhe ſo eminently poſſeſs't. I have always thought I might diſcharge this part of the <hi>Miniſterial Function,</hi> as much to the benefit of <hi>Souls,</hi> in preſſing upon them the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> in Defending the <hi>Doctrine, Government, Solemn and Publick Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in whoſe holy <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> I do believe <hi>Salvation</hi> may be had with greater <hi>Certainty,</hi> than in any other Church of any <hi>Denomination</hi> whatſoever. To conclude, <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 2.</note>
               <hi>The Kings of the earth ſhall ſtand up, and take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt His Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:45230:33"/>
Which Prophecy implies that Chriſt ſhall be a King, and that the Kings of the earth would conſpire the Ruine of His Kingdom. And this is the true ground of all thoſe dire ſtrifes and contentions which have fill'd the world about the Chriſtian Faith. <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 14.</note>
               <hi>Becauſe they will not have this Man to Reign over them.</hi> For this reaſon the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the Death of Chriſt; they pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that He intended to ſet up a Fifth Monarchy; but the true reaſon was becauſe He did not anſwer the fond Character which they had fram'd of their Meſſias; therefore they would not ſubmit their Stubborn Necks to his eaſie Yoke; the <hi>Romans</hi> afterwards thought to have rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned His Kingdom, by a total Maſſacre of his Subjects, and they alſo pretended reaſons of State. But the true reaſon was, they could not comply with the Doctrine of the Croſs; which they thought would interrupt their pleaſures, and Eclipſe their Greatneſs. And at this day how is the world divided about the great Buſineſs of Salvation. The <hi>Turks</hi> would aſcribe this glorious work to their falſe Prophet <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> and the Jews expect Salvation from an imaginary Meſsias yet to come, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are too much divided amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45230:33"/>
the End of His coming into the world, which <note place="margin">John 18. 37.</note>
               <hi>was to bear Teſtimony to the truth;</hi> He will diſtinguiſh between the true and the falſe Believers; And His Kingdom ſhall at laſt ſhine forth in an utter Abolition of the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have only this to add further: Be the times never ſo perilous, our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers never ſo great, next the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Almighty, a Chriſtian Holy Life, our ſtedfaſt Obedience to the King, Conformity to the Church, will be found our ſureſt Refuge. For the King cannot, will not forſake that Faith of which He is the glorious Defender; nor thoſe Subjects, who by the Tenure of their Religion think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to defend Him with their Lives and Fortunes. And of this we, as well as the reſt of the Nation, have had a very late confirmation in His Majeſties Gracious Reply to that Eloquent and truly Loyal Speech made in behalf of the Univerſity. To which His Majeſty was pleaſed to anſwer, <hi>That He was fully ſatisfied of the Loyalty of the Univerſity, and that</hi>
