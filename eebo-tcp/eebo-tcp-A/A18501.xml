            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eceit is in the heart of them that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine euill, but to the Counſellers of peace ſhall be ioy. It is the ſaying (most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince) of the wiſest Prince: that euer liued; and it is the vnſpeakable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of vs that liue vnder the gratious gouernment of your renowmed Father,
<pb facs="tcp:16995:4"/>
that he doth not onely approoue what he ſayd, but practiſe it too, and in the whole courſe of his gouernment findes it to be true: for peace he counſelleth, and ioy, and peace, and content he enioyeth: nay, it is by his wiſdome and prouident care that we are all at peace with the whole world, and the whole world with vs: a bleſsing that few Kingdomes of the earth do truly enioy; and the greatneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we know not becauſe we enioy it. Jt is an Argument vnto my ſelfe of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace that his Highneſſe hath with God and his owne ſoule: for, <hi>Pax a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis incipit, quia dum lex carnis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnat legimentis, non modò alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ſed nec nobis poſſumus eſſe paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici: ſed poſtquam intus ſpiritus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat vt totus homo ſpiritui ſeruiat, tunc pax ad alios deriuatur, vt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem cum omnibus habeamus.</hi> And

Euer may all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be at peace with him, and he with his enemies: and let all that loue the peace of our Jeruſalem ſay, A men. This peace (right excellent Prince) whoſe nature it is to turne ſwords into mattocks, ſouldiers into husbandmen, (for aſ much as my education made mee not fit for that) hath turned my ſword into a penne. Then my profeſsion was armes, and J fought for peace; which ſince we now enioy, J thought J ſhould diſhonour ſo honourable a profeſsion too much, to be idle, and abuſe ſo excellent a bleſsing as peace is, by making it the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſo vntoward a childe. Heerup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on J hung vp my ſword to ruſt in the ſcabbard till good occaſion might draw it
<pb facs="tcp:16995:5"/>
forth againe; and long J had not thoght with my ſelfe which way I might ſerue my King and my Country in theſe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able times, but this booke fell into my hands; which when I had read, I thoght woorthy the tranſlation: and though I had no reaſon to thinke the tranſlation worthy your Highnes protection, yet the matter fitteſt for a Prince, and your Princely clemencie to others in the like kinde, haue emboldened me to become humble petitioner to your Highnes, that you would be pleaſed to honor the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the worke with your patronage, and protect my infirmities. The ſubiect of this worke is Wiſdome: And what fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Prince? If you honor it, it will honor you as it hath done your royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom it hath crowned with honour as with a garland, made the mirrour of Princes, and the woonder of the world.

Long may you liue an heire apparent to his virtues and to his Kingdomes, and when God ſhall haue turned his earthly crowne into a crowne of glorie, long may you reigne a glorious Sonne of ſo glorious a Father.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not (gentle Reader) but ſome there are that will not gently cenſure theſe my labours; for I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how hard a thing it is to pleaſe all. Some are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whom if I ſhould endeuour to pleaſe, I ſhould diſpleaſe my ſelfe: Some are enuious, and thoſe I care not whether I pleaſe or no. As for the iudicious Reader, I confeſſe I would willingly content him, becauſe if he be truly iudicious he will iudge of my faults as if they were his own, and rather commend my good endeuors, than condemne my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. This is the man whom I deſire to ſatisfie, and muſt giue to vnderſtand that I haue vſed a plaine Engliſh phraſe, becauſe the grauitie of the matter required it; and I loue not to ſmell of the inkhorne: and of all others I haue auoided the French, wherein it
<pb facs="tcp:16995:6"/>
was written, becauſe I would not haue it ſeeme to be a tranſlation. The Latine I haue left vntoucht; and if that be a fault, I disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it vpon the Author: He did it; and why not I? And if hee thought all French men vnderſtood it; why ſhould not I haue as good a conceit of my Countreymen? If he thought none fit to reade his booke, but ſuch as vnderſtood it, it is no fault in me if I thinke ſo too. Howſoeuer, or whatſoeuer my ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights may be (which I doubt not but a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eie may make too many) let it ſuffice that I acknowledge mine owne weakneſſe, and both in reſpect of the tongue and weight of the matter if ſelfe, ſhould not haue preſumed to haue vndergone ſo heauy a burden, had I not been encouraged by my learned, iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and honeſt friend <hi>M. Roger Webb,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſtudent and fellow of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford;</hi> from whoſe fulneſſe I am not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to confeſſe I haue receiued that little ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, whatſoeuer it be, that is in me, and whoſe learned aſſiſtance I haue vſed both in the cull, and altering of ſuch points as were either erroneous, or not otherwiſe fit to paſſe the preſſe. If any man ſhall thinke, that by this ingenious acknowledgment of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:16995:7"/>
I detract from mine owne ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, it ſufficeth my turne, if I adde vnto mine owne honeſtie by yeelding this thankfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of his loue towards me, and his labors beſtowed vpon me; which foraſmuch as they were not mercenarie, but friendly and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly, they do binde me the rather with my labours to honour him. Touching the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this Worke I can ſay little, becauſe I knew him not, let his worke commend him; and as for the worke, let it commend it ſelfe: for I had rather with ſilence paſſe that ouer which I can not ſufficiently commend, than derogate any thing from the worth thereof by ſpeaking too little. Let me only ſay, That if I haue any way wronged him in theſe my labors (by turning him out of his holy dayes ſute into his worky-dayes apparell) I am ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for it; it was not my purpoſe ſo to do, but to honor him. And howſoeuer our Engliſh attire may alter him in the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet my hope is, that he that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into him with a ſingle impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall eye, ſhall finde him no changeling, but one and the ſame.</p>

So that you ſee what the ſimpler ſort imagine Wiſdome to be at the firſt view and the ſimple ſound of the word; whereby they conclude, That there are few wiſe men, that they are rare as euery excellencie is; and that to them by right it apperteineth to command and gouerne others; that they are as Oracles: from whence is that ſaying, <hi>Beleeue others, and referre thy ſelfe to the wiſe.</hi> But well to define this thing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to trueth, and to diſtinguiſh it into his true parts, all men know not, neither are they of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, nor is it eaſie; for otherwiſe doe the common people, otherwiſe the Philoſophers, otherwiſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines ſpeake thereof. Theſe are the three floores and degrees of the world. The two latter proceed by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and rules, and precepts: the former confuſedly and very imperfectly.</p>
            <p>Now then we may ſay, That there are three ſorts <note place="margin">2 The diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> and degrees of wiſdome, Diuine, Humane, Mundane, which correſpond vnto God; Nature pure and entire;
<pb facs="tcp:16995:11"/>
Nature vitiated and corrupted. Of all theſe ſorts and euerie of them doe all theſe three orders of the world, which before we ſpeake of, write and diſcourſe, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one according to his owne maner and faſhion; but properly and formally the common ſort, that is to ſay, the world of worldly wiſdome, the Philoſopher of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, the Diuine of diuine wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Worldly wiſdome, and of the three the more baſe, <note place="margin">3 Worldly wiſdome.</note> (which is diuers according to the three great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Leaders of this inferiour world, Opulencie, Pleaſure, Glorie, or rather Auarice, Luxurie, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Quicquid est in mundo est concupiſcentia oculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>

            <p>Diuine wiſdome, and of the three the higheſt, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <note place="margin">4 Diuine wiſdome.</note> and handled by Philoſophers and Diuines, but ſomewhat diuerſly. As for the common or worldly wiſdome I diſdaine it, and paſſe by whatſoeuer may be ſpoken thereof as prophane and too vnworthy in this Treatiſe to be read. The Philoſophers make it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Speculatiue, ſaying, That it is the knowledge of the principles, firſt cauſes, and higheſt power to iudge of all things, euen of the moſt Souereigne, which is God himſelfe: and this wiſdome is Metaphyſicall, and reſideth wholly in the vnderſtanding, as being the chiefe good and perfection thereof: it is the firſt and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thom.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 57. 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 19.</note> higheſt of the fiue intellectuall vertues, which may be without either honeſtie, action, or other morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<pb facs="tcp:16995:12"/>
The Diuines make it not altogether ſo ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, but that it is likewiſe in ſome ſort Practique, for they ſay, That it is the knowledge of Diuine things, from which there ariſeth a iudgement and rule of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions; and they make it two-folde, The one acquired by ſtudie, and comes neere to that of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; which I am to ſpeake of: The other infuſed and giuen by God, <hi>De ſurſum deſcendens.</hi> This is the firſt of the ſeuen gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Spiritus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, ſpiritus ſapientiae,</hi> which is not found but only in thoſe that are iuſt and free from ſinne, <hi>In maleuolam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimam</hi>

            <p>It followeth therefore, that it is Humane wiſdome <note place="margin">5 Humane.</note> which in this Booke we are to deliuer vnto you, and whereof it takes the name, and of which in this place we muſt giue ſome briefe and generall view, which may be as an Argument and Summarie of this whole worke. The common deſcriptions are diuers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient; <note place="margin">Wiſdome according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort.</note> Some and the greateſt part thinke that it is only a wiſdome, diſcretion, and aduiſed carriage in a mans affaires and conuerſation. This may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led common, as reſpecting nothing but that which is outward and in action, and conſidereth not at all any other thing than that which outwardly appeareth. It is altogether in the eyes and eares of men, without any reſpect or very little of the inward motions of the minde: ſo that according to their opinion wiſdome may be without eſſentiall pietie or probitie, that is, a beautifull cunning, a ſweet and modeſt ſubtiltie. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thinke that it is a rude, vnreaſonable, rough ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie,
<pb facs="tcp:16995:12"/>
a kinde of ſullen frowning and frampole auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in opinions, maners, words, actions and faſhion of life; and therfore they call them that are wounded and touched with that humor Philoſophers, that is to ſay, in their counterfeit language, fantaſticall, diuers, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and declining from the cuſtomes of other men.</p>
            <p>Now this kinde of wiſdome according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our booke is rather a follie and extrauagancie. You muſt therefore know, that this wiſdome whereof we ſpeake is not that of the common people, but of Philoſophers and Diuines, whereof both haue written in their morall learnings. The Philoſophers more at <note place="margin">Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines.</note> large, and more profeſſedly as being their true and proper diſh they feed on, and formall ſubiect they write of, becauſe they applie themſelues to that which concerneth Nature and Action. Diuinitie mounteth <note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie &amp; Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</note> much higher, and is occupied about vertues infuſed, Contemplatiue and Diuine, that is to ſay, about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſdome and Beleefe. So that Philoſophers are more ſtayed, diſperſed more certeine, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ruling and inſtructing not onely the particular knowledge or actions of men, but the common and publike, teaching that which is good and profitable to Families, Corporations, Common-weales, Empires. Diuinitie is more ſparing and ſilent in this point, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king principallie into the eternall good and ſaluation of euery one. Againe, the Philoſopher handleth this ſubiect more ſweetly and pleaſingly, the Diuine more auſterely and drily. Againe, Philoſophie which is the elder (for Nature is more ancient than Grace, and the Naturall than the Supernaturall) ſeemeth to perſwade gratiouſly, as being willing to pleaſe in profiting, as the Poet ſpeaketh:</p>

            <p>It is enriched with diſcourſes, reaſons, inuentions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ſimilitudes, decked with ſpeeches, Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmes, ſententious mots, adorned with Eloquence and Arte. Theologie, which came after, altogether auſtere, it ſeemeth to command and imperiouſly like a Maſter to enioyne. And to conclude, the vertue and honeſtie of Diuines is too anxious, ſcrupulous, deiect, ſad, fearefull and vulgar. Philoſophie, ſuch as this Booke teacheth, is altogether pleaſant, free, buckſom, and if I may ſo ſay, wanton too; and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, puiſſant, noble, generous, and rare. Doubtleſſe the Philoſophers haue heerin been excellent, not only in writing and teaching, but in the rich and liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation thereof in their honourable and heroicall liues. I vnderſtand heere by Philoſophers and Wiſe men, not onely thoſe that haue carried the name of Wiſe men, ſuch as <hi>Thales, Solon,</hi> and the reſt of that ranke, that liued in the time of <hi>Cyrus, Creſus, Piſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> nor thoſe that came afterwards, and haue publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught it, as <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aristippus, Zenon, Antisthenes,</hi> all chiefe Profeſſours apart, and many other their Diſciples different and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in ſects; but alſo all thoſe great men who haue made ſingular and exemplary profeſſion of vertue and wiſdome, as <hi>Phocion, Aristides, Pericles, Alexander,</hi> whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> called as well a Philoſopher as a King, <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and diuers other Greeks: The <hi>Fabricij, Fabij, Camilli, Catoni, Torquati, Reguli, Lelij, Scipio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> Romans, who for the moſt part haue beene Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in armies. And theſe are the reaſons why in this my Booke I doe more willingly and ordinarily follow
<pb facs="tcp:16995:13"/>
the aduice and ſayings of Philoſophers, not in the mean time omitting or reiecting thoſe of the Diuines: For both in ſubſtance they doe all agree, and are verie ſold me different, and Diuinitie doth nothing diſdaine to employ, and to make good vſe of the wiſe ſayings of Philoſophie. If I had vndertaken to inſtruct the cloiſter, and the retired life, that is, that profeſſion which attendeth the ſecrets Euangelicall, I muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily haue followed <hi>adamuſsim</hi> the aduice of the Diuines: but our Booke inſtructeth a ciuill life, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man for the world, that is to ſay, to humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not diuine.</p>
            <p>We ſay then naturally and generally both with the <note place="margin">6 A generall deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> Philoſopher and the Diuine, that this humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a kinde of law or reaſon, a beautifull and noble compoſition of the entire man, both in his inward part and his outward, his thoughts, his words, his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all his motions. It is the excellencie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of man as he is man, that is to ſay, according to that which the firſt fundamentall and naturall law doth require; as wee ſay, That that worke is well wrought and excellent, that is compleat and perfectin all the parts thereof, and wherein all the rules of Arte haue beene obſerued; that man is accounted a wiſe man, that beſt knoweth after the beſt and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent maner to play the man, that is to ſay, (to giue a more particular picture thereof) that knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and the condition of man, doth keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue himſelfe from all vices, errours, paſſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as well inward and proper to himſelfe, as outward and common to other men, mainteining his ſpirit pure, free, vniuerſall, conſidering and iudging of all things without band or affection, alwayes ruling and
<pb facs="tcp:16995:14"/>
directing himſelf in all things according to nature, that is to ſay, that firſt reaſon and vniuerſall law and light inſpired by God, and which ſhineth in vs, vnto which he doth apply and accommodate his owne proper and particular light, liuing in the outward view of the world, and with all men according to their lawes, cuſtomes and ceremonies of the countrey where he is, without the offence of any, carrying himſelfe wiſely and diſcreetly in all affaires, walking alwaies vprightly, conſtant, comfortable, and content in himſelfe, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding peaceably whatſoeuer may happen, and at the laſt death it ſelfe. All theſe parts or qualities, which are many, for our better eaſe and facilitie may be drawen to foure principall heads; Knowledge of our ſelues, Libertie of ſpirit pure and generous, Imitation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (this hath a very large field, and alone might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuffice) True contentment. Theſe can no where be found but in him that is wiſe: and he that wanteth any of theſe can not be wiſe. He that hath an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous knowledge of himſelfe, that ſubiecteth his minde to any kinde of ſeruitude, either of paſſions or popular opinions, makes himſelfe partiall; and by enthralling himſelfe to ſome particular opinion is depriued of the libertie and iuriſdiction of diſcerning, iudging and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining all things. Hee that ſtriueth againſt Nature, vnder what pretence ſoeuer it be, following rather opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or paſſion than reaſon; he that carrieth himſelfe troubledly, diſquietly, malcontent, fearing death, is not wiſe. Beholde heere in a few words the picture of Humane wiſdome and folly, and the ſum of that which I purpoſe to handle in this Worke, eſpecially in the Second Booke, which expreſly containeth the rules, treatiſe, and offices of Wiſdome, which is more mine
<pb facs="tcp:16995:14"/>
than the other two, and which I once thought to haue publiſhed by it ſelfe. This verball deſcription of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is repreſented vnto the eye euen at the entrance or threſhall of this Booke by a woman all naked, in a place void and empty, reſting her ſelfe vpon nothing, in her pure and ſimple nature beholding her ſelfe in a glaſſe, her countenance cheerefull, merry and manly, vpright, her feet cloſe ioyned, vpon a ſquare pillar, and imbracing herſelfe, hauing vnder her feet inchained foure other women as ſlaues vnto her, that is to ſay, <hi>Paſsion</hi> with a changed and hideous countenance; <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with wandering eyes, inconſtant, giddy, borne vpon the heads of the people; <hi>Superſtition,</hi> aſtoniſhed and in a trance, and her hands faſtened the one to the other; <hi>Vertue</hi> or Honeſtie and Pedanticall Science with a ſullen viſage, her eye-lids eleuated reading in a Booke, where was written, <hi>Yea, No.</hi> All this needs no other explication, than that which heereafter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but heereof more at large in the Second Booke.</p>
            <p>To attaine vnto this wiſdome there are two meanes, <note place="margin">7 Two ways to attaine this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> the firſt is in the originall forming and firſt temper, that is to ſay, in the temperature of the ſeed of the Parents, the milke of the Nurſe, and the firſt education; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is ſayd to be either well borne, or ill borne, that is to ſay, either well or ill formed and diſpoſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wiſdome. A man would little thinke of what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and importance this beginning is, for if men did know it, there would be more care taken, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence vſed therein than there is. It is a ſtrange and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing, that ſo reachleſſe a careleſneſſe ſhould be in vs of the life and good life of thoſe whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make our other ſelues, when in matters of leſſe importance we take more care, vſe more diligence,
<pb facs="tcp:16995:15"/>
more counſell than we ſhould, neuer thinking of our greateſt affaires and moſt honourable, but by hazzard and peraduenture. Who is he that taketh counſell with himſelfe, or endeuoureth to do that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the preſeruing and preparing of himſelfe as he ought to the generation of male-children, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of ſpirit, and apt for wiſdome? For that which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for the one, ſerueth for the other, and Nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one maner attendeth them all. This is that which men thinke of leaſt, yea little or not at all (in the act of generation) doth it enter into their thoughts to frame a new creature like themſelues, but only like beaſts to ſatisfie their luſtfull pleaſures. This is one of the moſt important faults and of greateſt note in a Common weale, whereof there is not one that thinketh or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, neither is there concerning it either law, or rule, or publike aduice. It is moſt certeine, that if men did heerein carrie themſelues as they ought, we ſhould haue other men, of more excellent ſpirit and condition than we haue amongſt vs. What is required heerein, and to the firſt nouriſhment and education, is briefly ſet downe in our Third Booke, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>The ſecond meanes to attaine wiſdome is the ſtudie <note place="margin">8 Acquired.</note> of Philoſophie, I meane not of all the parts thereof, but Morall (yet not forgetting the Naturall) which is the light, the guide, the rule of our life, which explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and repreſenteth vnto vs the law of Nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth man vniuerſally in all things, both publike and priuate, alone and in companie, in all domeſticall and ciuill conuerſation, taketh away all that ſauage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is in vs, ſweetneth and tameth our naturall rudeneſſe, crueltie and wildneſſe, and worketh and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioneth it to wiſdome. To be briefe, it is the true ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:16995:15"/>
of man; all the reſt in reſpect of it is but vanitie, or at the leaſtwiſe not neceſſarie or little profitable: for it giueth inſtructions to liue and to die well, which is all in all; it teacheth vs perfect wiſdome, an apt iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous well aduiſed honeſty. But this ſecond meane is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as little practiſed and as ill employed as the firſt: for no man careth greatly for this wiſdome, ſo much are all giuen to that which is worldly. Thus you ſee the two principall meanes to attaine to wiſdome, the Naturall and Acquired. He that hath beene fortunate in the firſt, that is to ſay, that hath been fauourably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Nature, that is, of a good and ſweet tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which bringeth forth a great goodneſſe in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſweetnes in maners, hath made a faire march without great paine to the ſecond: But that man with whom it is otherwiſe, muſt with great and painfull ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the ſecond beautifie and ſupplie that which is wanting, as <hi>Socrates</hi> one of the wiſeſt ſayd of himſelfe, That by the ſtudie of Philoſophie he had corrected and reformed his naturall infirmities.</p>
            <p>There are contrariwiſe two formall lets or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances <note place="margin">9 The lets to Wiſdome, and means to folly are tvvo.</note> to wiſdome, and two counter-meanes or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull wayes vnto follie, Naturall and Acquired. The firſt, which is naturall, proceedeth from the originall temper and temperature, which maketh the braine ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too ſoft, moiſt, and the parts thereof groſſe and <note place="margin">1 Naturall.</note> materiall, whereby the ſpirits remaine ſottiſh, feeble, leſſe capable, plaine diminiſhed, obſcure, ſuch as that is, for the moſt part, of the common ſort of people; or too hot, ardent, and drie, which maketh the ſpirits foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, audacious, vitious. Theſe are the two extremes, <hi>Sottiſhneſſe</hi> and <hi>Follie,</hi> Water and Fire, Lead and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie, altogether improper or vnapt to wiſdom, which
<pb facs="tcp:16995:16"/>
requireth a ſpirit full of vigor and generous, and yet ſweet, pliant, and modeſt: but the ſecond is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily amended by diſcipline than the former.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, which is Acquired, proceedeth either <note place="margin">2 Acquired.</note> from no culture and inſtruction, or from that which is euill, which amongſt other things conſiſteth in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and ſworne preiudicate preuention of opinions, wherewith the minde is made drunken, and taketh ſo ſtrong a tincture, that it is made vnapt and vncapable to ſee or to finde better whereby to raiſe and inrich it ſelfe. It is ſayd of theſe kinde of men, That they are wounded and ſtricken, that they haue a hurt or blow in the head: vnto which wound if likewiſe learning be ioined, becauſe that puffeth vp, it bringeth with it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and temeritie, and ſomtimes armes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defend thoſe anticipated opinions: it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfecteth the forme and frame of follie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it incurable. So that naturall weakneſſe, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red preuention are two great hinderances; but ſcience, if it do not wholly cure them, which ſeldome it doth, ſtrengtheneth them and maketh them inuincible, which turneth not any way to the diſhonour of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as a man may well thinke) but to the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof.</p>
            <p>Science or Learning is a very good and profitable <note place="margin">10 Of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> ſtaffe or waſter, but which will not be handled with all hands; and he that knowes not well how to rule it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth thereby more hurt than profit. It beſotteth and maketh fooliſh (ſaith a great learned writer) the weake <note place="margin">See heerof <hi>Li.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 14.</note> and ſicke ſpirit, it poliſheth and perfecteth the natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrong and good. The feeble ſpirit knowes not how to poſſeſſe ſcience, how to handle it, and how to make vſe thereof as he ſhould; but contrariwiſe is poſſeſſed
<pb facs="tcp:16995:16"/>
and ruled by it, whereby he ſubmits himſelfe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a ſlaue to it, like a weake ſtomacke ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with more victuals than it can digeſt. A weake arme wanting power and skill well to weld a waſter or ſtaffe that is ſomewhat too heauie for it, wearieth it ſelfe and fainteth. A wiſe and courageous ſpirit ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtereth his wiſdome, enioyeth it, vſeth it, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth it to his beſt aduantage, enformeth his owne iudgement, rectifieth his will, helpeth and fortifieth his naturall light, and maketh himſelfe more quicke and actiue; wheras the other is made thereby more ſottiſh, more vnapt, and therewithall more preſumptuous: ſo that the fault or reproch is not in learning, no more than that wine or other good drugge is faultie which a man knoweth not how to apply and accommodate to his owne needs: <hi>Non est culpa vini, ſed culpa bibentis.</hi> Now then againſt ſuch ſpirits weake by nature, preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupated, puffed vp, and hindred by acquired wiſdome I make open warre in this Booke, and that often times vnder the word <hi>Pedante,</hi> not finding any other more <note place="margin">Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vvord <hi>Pedante</hi> or Schoole-maſter.</note> proper, and which by many good Authours is vſed in this ſenſe. In it owne Greeke Originall it was taken in the better ſenſe, but in other later languages, by reaſon of the abuſe, and bad carriage of ſuch men in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their learning, it is accounted baſe, vile, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous, contentious, opinatiue, vain-glorious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, by too many practiſed, and vſed but by way of iniurie and deriſion, and is in the number of thoſe words that by continuance of time haue changed their ſignification, as <hi>Tyrant, Sophiſter,</hi> and diuers other. <hi>Le ſieur de Bellay,</hi> after the rehearſall of many notorious vices, concludeth as with the greateſt, <hi>But of all the reſt, Knowledge pedanticall I deteſt.</hi> And in another place:</p>

               <l>But that which most doth make thy name to ſtinke,</l>

            </q>
            <p>It may be ſome will take offence at this word, thinking <note place="margin">An aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.</note> it likewiſe toucheth them, and that I thereby haue a will to tax or ſcoffe the Profeſſors and Teachers of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but let them be pleaſed to content themſelues with this free and open declaration which I here make, That it is no part of my meaning to note by this word any gown-men or learned profeſſion whatſoeuer: yea I am ſo farre from it, that Philoſophers are in ſo high eſteeme with me, that I ſhould oppoſe my ſelfe againſt my ſelfe, becauſe I account my ſelfe one of them, and profeſſe the ſame learning: only I touch a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and qualitie of ſpirits, before deſciphered, that is, ſuch as haue naturall capacitie and ſufficiencie after a common and indifferent maner, but afterwards not well tilled, preoccupated, poſſeſſed with certaine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and theſe are men of all fortunes, all conditions, and goe as well in ſhort garments as in long gownes: <hi>Vulgum tam chlamidatos, quàm coronam voco.</hi> If any man can furniſh me with any other word as ſignificant as this to expreſſe theſe kinde of ſpirits, I will willingly forgo this. After this my declaration, he that findeth himſelfe agrieued, ſhall but accuſe and ſhew himſelfe too ſcrupulous. It is true that a man may finde other oppoſites to a wiſe man beſides a <hi>Pedante,</hi> but it is in ſome particular ſenſe, as the common, prophane, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſort of people; and often times I vſe theſe oppoſits: but this is as the low is oppoſite to the high, the weake to the ſtrong, the valley to the hill, the common to the rare, the ſeruant to the maſter, the prophane to the
<pb facs="tcp:16995:17"/>
holy; as alſo a foole, which indeed according to the true ſound of the word, is his trueſt oppoſite: but this is a moderate man to an immoderate, a glorious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue man to a modeſt, the part to the whole, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate and tainted to the neat and free, the ſicke to the ſound: but this word <hi>Pedante</hi> in that ſenſe we take it, comprehendeth all theſe and more too, for it noteth and ſignifieth him that is not only vnlike &amp; contrary to a wiſe man, as thoſe before mentioned, but ſuch a one as arrogantly and inſolently reſiſteth it to the face, and as being armed on all ſides raiſeth himſelfe againſt it, ſpeaking out of reſolution and authoritie. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as after a ſort he feareth it, by reaſon that he ſeeth himſelfe diſcouered euen from the top to the bottome, and his ſport troubled by it, he proſecuteth it with a certaine inteſtine hatred, he taketh vpon him to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it, to defame it, to condemne it, accounting and carrying himſelfe as the truely wiſe, though he be a foole without peere and an ignorant ſelfe-conceited Gull.</p>
            <p>After the purpoſe and argument of this Worke, we <note place="margin">11 The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of this book.</note> come to the order and method thereof. There are three Books: The Firſt is wholly in the knowledge of our ſelues and humane condition, as a preparatiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wiſdome, which is handled at large by fiue maine and principall conſiderations, ech one including in it diuers others. The Second Booke containeth in it the treatiſes, offices, and generall and principall rules of wiſdome. The Third, the particular rules and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of wiſdome, and that by the order and diſcourſe of foure principall and morall vertues, <hi>Prudence, Iuſtice, Fortitude, Temperance;</hi> vnder which foure is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the whole inſtruction of the life of man, and all the
<pb facs="tcp:16995:18"/>
parts of dutie and honeſtie. Finally, I heere handle this matter, not Scholarlike or Pedantically, nor with enlarged diſcourſe, and furniture of Eloquence or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arte; (For wiſdome <hi>(quae ſi oculis ipſis cerneretur mirabiles excitaret amores ſui)</hi> needs no ſuch helps to commend it ſelfe, being of it ſelfe ſo noble and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) but rudely, openly, and ingeniouſly, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will not pleaſe all. The propoſitions and verities are compact, but many times drie and ſower, like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſmes, ouertures and ſeeds of diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Some thinke this Booke too foole-hardie and free <note place="margin">12 An Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement &amp; Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to the Reader.</note> to contradict and wound the common opinions, and are offended therewith, whom in foure or fiue words I thus anſwer: Firſt, that wiſdome which is neither common nor vulgar hath properly this libertie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, <hi>Iure ſuo ſingulari,</hi> to iudge of all, (it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of a wiſe and ſpirituall man, <hi>ſpiritualis omnia dijudicat, &amp; a nemine iudicatur)</hi> and in iudging to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and condemne (as for the moſt part erroneous) common and vulgar opinions. What then ſhould ſhe doe? for the caſe ſtanding thus, it can not be, but ſhe muſt incurre the diſgrace and enuie of the world. In another place I complaine of theſe kinde of men, and reproue their popular weakneſſe and feminine dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as vnworthy, being ouer-tender and delicate, to vnderſtand any thing of worth, and altogether vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of wiſdome. The hardeſt and hardieſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are beſt befitting a hardie and eleuated ſpirit, and there can nothing ſeeme ſtrnage vnto him that doth but know what the world is. It is weakneſſe to be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at any thing, we muſt rowze vp our hearts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and ſtrengthen our mindes, harden and inure our ſelues to heare, to know, to vnderſtand, to iudge
<pb facs="tcp:16995:18"/>
of all things ſeeme they neuer ſo ſtrange. All things are agreeing and well befitting the palat of the ſpirit, ſo a man be not wanting vnto himſelfe, and neither do any thing, or yeeld his conſent to whatſoeuer is not good and truly faire, no though the whole world per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him vnto it. A wiſe man ſheweth equally in them both his courage, his delicates are not capable of the one or the other, there being a weakneſſe in them both.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in all that I ſhall propoſe, my meaning is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not to binde any man vnto it, I only preſent things, and lay them out as it were vpon a ſtall; I grow not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to choler with any man that giues me no credit, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes my ware, that were to play the <hi>Pedante. Paſsion</hi> witneſſeth that it is not reaſon ſo to do, and he that out of paſſion doth any thing out of reaſon can not doe it. But why are they angrie with me? Is it becauſe I am not altogether of their opinion? Why, I am not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them becauſe they are not of mine. Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſpeake ſomething which is not pleaſing to their taſte, or to the palat of the vulgar ſort? Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpeake it. I ſpeake nothing without reaſon, if they knew how to vnderſtand it, how to reliſh it. If they can bring better reaſon to diſproue mine, I will hearken vnto it with delight and thanks to him that ſhall ſhew it me. But yet let them not thinke to beat me downe with authorities, multitudes, and allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men, for theſe haue but ſmall credit in my iuriſdiction, ſaue in matter of Religion, where only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie preuailes without reaſon. This is authorities true Empire, reaſon onely bearing ſway in all other Arts without it, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> doth very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. For it is an vniuſt tyranny and an inraged
<pb facs="tcp:16995:19"/>
follie to ſubiect and in thrall our ſpirits to beleeue and to follow whatſoeuer our Anceſtours haue ſayd, and what the vulgar ſort holde to be true, who know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they ſay, nor what they do. There are none but fooles that ſuffer themſelues to be thus led by the noſes: and this Booke is not for ſuch, which if it ſhould popularlie be receiued and accepted of the common ſort of people, it ſhould faile much in it firſt purpoſe and deſignment. We muſt heare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, make account of our ancient Writers, not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuate our ſelues vnto them but with reaſon. And if a man would follow them, what ſhould he doe? for they agree not among themſelues. <hi>Aristotle</hi> who would ſeeme to be the moſt ſufficient amongſt them, and hath aduentured to challenge &amp; to cenſure all that went before him, hath vttered more groſſe abſurdities than them all, and is at no agreement with himſelfe, neither doth he know many times where he is; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his Treatiſes of the Soule of man, of the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the world, of the Generation of the windes and waters, and ſo forth. It is no cauſe of wonder or aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that all men are not of one opinion; but it were rather ſtrange and woonderfull, that all men were of one opinion: for there is nothing more befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nature and the ſpirit of man than varietie. That wiſe Diuine <hi>S. Paul</hi> giueth vs this libertie, in that he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</note> willeth euery man to abound in his owne vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not iudging or condemning that man that doth otherwiſe, or thinke otherwiſe. And he ſpeaketh it in a matter of greater moment and more tickliſh, not in that which conſiſteth in outward action and obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein we ſay we are to conforme our ſelues to the common ſort, and to that which is preſcribed and
<pb facs="tcp:16995:19"/>
accuſtomed to be done, but alſo in that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Religion, that is, the religious obſeruance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands and dayes: whereas all that libertie and boldneſſe of ſpeech which I challenge vnto my ſelfe, is but in thoughts, iudgements, opinions, in which no man is quarter-maſter but he that hath them, euery man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Not withſtanding all this, many things which may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſeeme too harſh and briefe, too rude and difficult for the ſimpler ſort (for the ſtronger and wiſer haue ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks warme enough to concoct and digeſt all) I haue for the loue of them explicated, enlightned and ſweetned in this ſecond Edition, reuiewed, and much augmented.</p>
            <p>I would willingly aduertiſe the Reader that ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vndertake to iudge of this Worke, to take heed that he fall not into any of theſe ſeuen ouerſights, as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done; that is: To referre that vnto law and dutie, which is proper vnto action; that vnto action, which is onely to be cenſured; that to reſolution and determination, which is only propoſed, conſulted of, and problematically and Academically diſputed; that to me and mine opinions, which I deliuer from report, and is the opinion of another man; that to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate, profeſſion, and condition, which is proper to the ſpirit and inward ſufficiencie; that to religion and faith, which is but the opinion of man; that to grace and ſupernaturall inſpiration, which is proper to naturall and morall vertue and action. All paſſion and preoccupation being taken away, hee ſhall finde in theſe ſeuen points well vnderſtood how to reſolue himſelfe in his doubts, how to anſwer all obiections, made by himſelfe or by others, and informe himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:16995:20"/>
touching my intention in this worke. And if neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe after all this, he will neither reſt ſatisfied and contented, nor approue what I haue written, let him boldly and ſpeedily diſproue it (for onely to ſpeake ill, to bite, to ſlander the name of another man, though it be eaſie enough, yet it is baſe and pedanticall) and he ſhall as ſpeedily receiue either a free confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and aſſent, (for this Booke doth glory and feaſt it ſelfe in the truth and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie thereof) or an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and follies thereof.</p>

It is as neceſſarie for man to learne how to know himſelfe, as it is naturall vnto him to thinke, or to be neere vnto himſelfe: Nature hath enioyned this worke vnto all. To meditate &amp; to entertain our thoughts therein is a thing aboue all things eaſie, ordinarie, naturall; it is the food, ſuſtentation, life of the ſpirit, <hi>Cuius viuere est co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitare.</hi> Now where can a man begin, or continue his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more truly, more naturally than with himſelfe? Is there any thing that toucheth him more neerely? Doubtleſſe, to ſtudie other learnings, and to forget our ſelues, is a thing both vnnaturall and vniuſt. The true and principall vacation of euery man is to imploy his thoughts vpon himſelfe, and to tie himſelfe to himſelfe; for ſo doth euery thing els, ſetting bounds and limits to their other buſineſſe and deſires. And thou man which wilt ſeeme to containe the whole vniuers, to know all things, to controule, to iudge, neither knoweſt nor endeuoureſt the knowledge of thy ſelfe; and ſo going about to make thy ſelfe skilfull and a Iudge of Nature, thou proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt the only foole of the world: thou art of all other the moſt beggerly, the moſt vaine and miſerable; and yet moſt proud and arrogant. Looke therefore into thy ſelfe, know thy ſelfe, hold thy ſelfe to thy ſelfe; thy ſpirit and will which is els where imployed, reduce it vnto thy ſelfe. Thou forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy ſelfe, and loſeſt thy ſelfe about outward things; thou betrayeſt and diſrobeſt thy ſelfe; thou lookeſt alwaies before thee; gather thy ſelfe vnto thy ſelfe, and ſhut vp thy ſelfe within thy ſelfe: examine, ſearch, know thy ſelfe.</p>

To be briefe, we haue no cleerer looking glaſſe, no better booke than our ſelues, if as we ought we doe ſtudie our ſelues, alwayes keeping our eyes open ouer vs, and pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more narrowly into our ſelues.</p>
               <p>But this is that which we thinke leaſt of, <hi>Nemo in ſe tentat</hi>

                  <hi>deſcendere:</hi> whereby it commeth to paſſe that we fall many times to the ground, and tumble headlong into the ſame fault, neither perceiuing it, nor knowing to what courſe to betake vs: we make our ſelues fooles at our owne charges. Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in euery thing are not diſcerned, but by thoſe that know them: and ſome degree of vnderſtanding is neceſſarie euen in the marking of our owne ignorance. We muſt knocke at the doore to know whether the doore be ſhut: for when men ſee themſelues reſolued &amp; ſatisfied of a thing, and think they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vnderſtand it, it is a token they vnderſtand nothing at all: for if we know our ſelues well, we would prouide farre better for our ſelues and our affaires; nay, we ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our ſelues and our eſtate, and frame our ſelues to be others than we are. He that knowes not his owne infirmities, takes no care to amend them; he that is ignorant of his owne wants, takes as little care to prouide for them; he that feeles not his owne euils and miſeries, aduiſeth not with himſelfe of helps, nor ſeeks for remedies. <hi>Deprehendas te oportet priuſquam emendes: ſanitatis initium ſentire ſibi opus eſſe remedio.</hi> And heere beholde our vnhappineſſe: for we thinke all things goes well with vs, and we are in ſafetie, and we liue in content with our ſelues, and ſo double our miſeries. <hi>Socrates</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the wiſeſt man of the world, not becauſe his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was more compleat, or his ſufficiencie greater than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but becauſe his knowledge of himſelfe was better than others; in that he held himſelfe within his owne ranke, and knew better how to play the man. He was the king of men, as it is ſaid, that he that hath but one eye is a king in reſpect of him that hath neuer an eye; that is to ſay, doubly depriued of his ſenſe: for they are by nature weake and miſerable, and therewithall proud, and feele not their miſerie. <hi>Socrates</hi> was but purblind, for being a man as others were, weake and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, he knew it, and ingeniouſly acknowledged his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

If ye were blind, ſaith he, that is, if <note place="margin">Ioh. 9.</note> you thought your ſelues blind, you ſhould ſee, but becauſe ye thinke ye ſee, therefore you are blind; therefore your ſinne remaineth. For they that in their owne opinion ſee much, are in truth ſtarke blinde; and they that are blinde in their owne opinion ſee beſt.

A man iudgeth not of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or depth of a riuer, by that water which by reaſon of ſome ſudden inundation of neighbour riuers ouerfloweth the bankes. One valiant act makes not a valiant man, nor one iuſt a iuſt man. The circumſtances and ſource of occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth import much and alter vs, and oftentimes a man is prouoked to doe good by vice it ſelfe: So hard a thing is it for man to know man.

peeres and common people. Nor by the cariages of a man in publicke places is a man knowen; for as a king at cheſſe ſo he ſtandeth vpon his guard, he bridleth and contracteth himſelfe; feare, and ſhame, and ambition, and other paſſions make him play that part that you ſee: But truely to know him we muſt looke into his inward part, his priuy chamber, and there not how to day, but euery day he carieth himſelfe. He is many times a different man in his houſe from that he is in the countrey, in the palace, in the market place; another man amongſt his domeſticall friends from that he is amongſt ſtrangers: when he goeth foorth of his houſe into ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke place, he goeth to play a Comedy, and therefore ſtay not thou there, for it is not himſelfe that plaieth, but another man, and thou knoweſt him not.</p>

For there are many vices hid in vs and are not felt for want of force and meanes; ſo that the venemous ſerpent that is benummed with cold, ſuffereth himſelfe to be handled without danger: neither doth it ſuffice afterwards to acknowledge the fault by tale or peecemeale, and ſo thinke to mend it by marring it, but he muſt in generall reacknowledge his weakneſſe, his miſery, and come to a vniuerſall amendment and reformation.</p>

                  <p>THe body of man conſiſteth of a number of parts inward <note place="margin">1 <hi>The diuiſion of the body.</hi>
                     </note> and outward, which are all for the moſt part round and orbicular, or comming neere vnto that figure.</p>
                  <p>The inward are of two ſorts: the one in number and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie <note place="margin">2 <hi>Inward and many.</hi>
                     </note> ſpread thorow the whole body, as the <hi>bones,</hi> which are as the baſes and vpholding pillars of the whole building, and within them for their nouriſhment the <hi>marow;</hi> the <hi>muſcles</hi> for motion and ſtrength; the <hi>veines</hi> iſſuing from the <hi>liuer</hi> as chanels of the firſt and naturall blood; the <hi>arteries</hi> comming from the heart as conduits of the ſecond blood more ſubtile and vitall. Theſe two mounting higher than the <hi>liuer</hi> and the <hi>heart</hi> their originall ſources, are more ſtrait than thoſe that go downwards, to the end they ſhould helpe to mount the bloud, for that narrowneſſe more ſtraitned, ſerues to raiſe the <hi>humours,</hi> the <hi>ſinewes</hi> proceeding by couples, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſenſe, motion, and ſtrength of body, and conduits of the animall ſpirits, whereof ſome are ſoft, of which there are ſeuen paires which ſerue the ſenſes of the head, <hi>Sight, Hearing, Taſte, Speech;</hi> the other are hard, whereof there are thirtie couples, proceeding from the reines of the backe to the muſcles; The <hi>Tendrels, Ligaments, Griſtels;</hi> The foure <hi>Humours, Blood, Choler</hi> which worketh, prouoketh, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trateth, hindreth obſtructions, caſteth forth the excrements, bringeth cheerefulneſſe; <hi>Melancholy</hi> which prouoketh an appetite to euery thing, moderateth ſudden motions; <hi>Fleame</hi> which ſweetneth the force of the two <hi>Cholers,</hi> and all other heats; The <hi>Spirits</hi> which are as it were the fumigations that ariſe from the naturall heat and radicall humor, and they are in three degrees of excellencie, the <hi>Naturall, Vitall, Animall;</hi> The <hi>Fat</hi> which is the thickeſt and groſſeſt part of blood.</p>
                  <p>The other are ſingular (ſaue the kidneys and ſtones, which are double) and aſſigned to a certaine place. Now there are <note place="margin">3 <hi>Singular. Foure regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the bodie.</hi>
                     </note> foure places or regions, as degrees of the bodie, ſhops of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where ſhe exerciſeth her faculties and powers. The firſt and loweſt is for generation, in which are the priuy parts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:16995:26"/>
ſeruing thereunto. The ſecond neere vnto that, in which are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the intralles, <hi>viſcera,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>ſtomacke</hi> yeelding more to the left ſide, round, ſtraiter in the bottome than at top, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two orifices or mouthes, the one aboue to receiue, the other beneath, which anſwereth the bowels, to caſt forth and diſcharge it ſelfe. It receiueth, gathereth together, mingleth, concocteth the victuals and turnes them into <hi>Chyle,</hi> that is to ſay, a kinde of white <hi>Suc</hi> fit for the nouriſhment of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which is likewiſe wrought within the <hi>Meſeraique</hi> veines by which it paſſeth vnto the Liuer. The <hi>Liuer</hi> hot and moiſt inclining towards the right ſide, the ſtore-houſe of blood, the chiefe or rather fountaine of the veines, the ſeat of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall nouriſhing faculty, or vegetatiue ſoule, made and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of the blood of that <hi>Chyle,</hi> which it draweth from the <hi>Meſeraique</hi> veines, and receiueth into it lap by the <hi>vena porta,</hi> which entreth into the concauities thereof, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is ſent and diſtributed thorow the whole body by the helpe of the great <hi>vena caua,</hi> which ariſeth from the bunch and branches thereof, which are in great number as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of a fountaine. The <hi>Spleene</hi> towards the left ſide which receiueth the diſcharge and excrements of the Liuer: The <hi>Reines,</hi> the <hi>Entralles</hi> which though they are all in one, yet are diſtinguiſhed by ſix differences and names, equalling ſeuen times the length of a man, as the length of a man is equalled by ſeuen foot. In theſe two firſt parts or degrees which ſome take to be but one (although there are two faculties very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, the one generatiue for the continuance of the kinde, the other nutritiue for euery particular perſon, and they make it to anſwer to the loweſt and elementary part of the world, the place of generation and corruption) is the concupiſcible ſoule.</p>
                  <p>The third degree compared to the <hi>Aetherian</hi> region, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from the former by the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or <hi>Midrife,</hi> and from that aboue by the narrowneſſe of the throat; in which is the iraſcible ſoule, and the pectorall parts <hi>Praecordia,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Heart,</hi> very hot, placed about the fift rib, hauing his point vnder the left pap or dug, the originall fountaine of the <hi>Arteries,</hi> which are alwayes mooued, and cauſe the <hi>Pulſe</hi> to beat, by which as by channels it ſendeth and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16995:27"/>
thorow the whole bodie the vitall blood which it hath concocted, and by it the ſpirit and vertue vitall. The <hi>Lungs,</hi> of ſubſtance very ſoft and ſpongeous, ſupple to draw to and inforce forth like a paire of bellowes, inſtruments both of reſpiration whereby the heart is refreſhed, drawing vnto it the blood, the ſpirits, the aire, and disburthening it ſelfe of thoſe fumes and excrements which oppreſſe it, and of the voice by meane of the rough <hi>Arterie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth and higheſt, which anſwereth to the celeſtiall region, is the head which conteineth the <hi>Braine,</hi> colde and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſpongeous, wrapped within two skinnes, the one more hard and thicke which toucheth the brainpan, <hi>Dura mater;</hi> the other more eaſie and thin which includeth the Braine, <hi>Pia mater:</hi> from it do iſſue &amp; are deriued the <hi>Smowes</hi> and marow that deſcendeth and falleth downe into the reines of the backe. This <hi>Braine</hi> is the ſeat of the reaſonable ſoule, the ſource of ſenſe and motion, and of the moſt noble animall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, compoſed of the vitall, which being raiſed from the heart by the <hi>Arteries</hi> vnto the braine are concocted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted, elaborated and made ſubtile by the helpe of the multiplicitie of ſmall <hi>Arteries,</hi> as fillets diuerſly wouen and interlaced by many turnings and windings, like a labyrinth or double net, <hi>Rete mirabile;</hi> within which this vitall ſpirit being retained and ſoiourning, often times paſſing and repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is refined and perfected, and becomes a creature, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in an excellent degree.</p>
                  <p>The outward and viſible parts, if they be ſingle, are in the middle as the <hi>Noſe</hi> which ſerueth for reſpiration, ſmell, <note place="margin">3 <hi>Outward parts ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</hi>
                     </note> and the comfort of the braine, and the disburthening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in ſuch ſort that by it the aire entereth and iſſueth both downe into the lungs and vp into the braines. The <hi>Mouth</hi> which ſerueth to eat and to ſpeake, and therefore hath many parts ſeruice-able thereunto; without, the lips; within, the tongue ſoft and very ſubtile which iudgeth of ſauors; the <hi>Teeth</hi> which bruiſe and grinde the victuals; the <hi>Nauell,</hi> the two ſinks or wayes to eaſe and disburden the bodie.</p>
                  <p>If they be double and alike, they are collaterals and equall, as the two <hi>eyes,</hi> planted in the higheſt ſtage as centinels, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <note place="margin">4 <hi>Double and equall.</hi>
                     </note> of many and diuers parts; three <hi>humors,</hi> ſeuen <hi>tunicles,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:16995:27"/>
ſeuen <hi>muſcles,</hi> diuers colours, of many faſhions and much art. Theſe are the firſt and moſt noble outward parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in beautie, vtilitie, mobilitie, actiuitie, yea in the action of loue <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they are to the viſage that which the viſage is to the bodie, they are the face of the face: and becauſe they are tender, delicate and precious, they are fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and rampaired on all parts with <hi>skinnes, lids, browes, haire.</hi> The <hi>eares</hi> in the ſelfe ſame height that the eyes are, as the ſcouts of the body, Porters of the ſpirit, the Receiuers and Iudgers of ſounds which alwayes aſcend; they haue their entrance oblique and crooked, to the end the aire and the ſound ſhould not enter at once, whereby the ſenſe of hearing might be hindered and iudge the woorſe. The <hi>armes</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> the worke-maſters of all things and vniuerſall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The <hi>legs</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> the props and pillars of the whole building.</p>

The firſt and principall are ſpeech, vpright ſtature, the forme or feature, the port or cariage, whereof the wiſe, yea the Stoicks themſelues made ſuch account, that they were wont to ſay, That it was better to be a foole in a humane ſhape, than wiſe in the forme of a beaſt. The hand is a miracle (that of the Ape is not to be termed a hand.) His naturall nakedneſſe, laughter, crying. The <hi>Senſe</hi> of tickling, haire on the lower lid of the eye, a viſible nauell, the point of the heart on the left ſide. The toes of the feet not ſo long as the fingers of the hand. Bleeding at noſe, a ſtrange thing conſidering that he carieth his head vpright, and a beaſt downwards. To bluſh for ſhame, wax pale for feare. To be an ambidexter; diſpoſed at all times to the ſports of <hi>Venus.</hi> Not to moue the eares, which bewrayeth in beaſts the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but man doth ſufficiently make them knowen, by his bluſhing, paleneſſe, motion of the eyes and noſe.</p>

                  <p>THe goods of the body are Health, Beauty, Cheerfulnes, <note place="margin">1 <hi>The praiſe of Health.</hi>
                     </note> Srength, Vigor, a prompt readineſſe and diſpoſition: but of all theſe Health is the firſt, and paſſeth all the reſt. Health is the moſt beautifull and rich preſent that Nature can beſtow vpon vs, and aboue all other things to be preferred, not only Science, Nobility, Riches, but Wiſdome it ſelfe, which the auſtereſt amongſt the wiſe doe affirme. It is the only thing that deſerueth our whole imploiment, yea our life it ſelfe to attaine vnto it; for without it life is no life, but a death, vertue and wiſdome grow weake and faint. What comfort can all the wiſdome of the world bring to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man that is, if he be thorowly ſtricken with an <hi>Apoplexie?</hi> Doubtleſſe there is nothing to be preferred before this bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly health, but <hi>Honeſtie</hi> which is the health of the <hi>Soule.</hi> Now it is common vnto vs with beaſts, yea many times it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and far more excellent in them than in vs: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it be a gift of Nature, <hi>gaudeant bene nati,</hi> giuen in the firſt formation, yet that which afterward followeth, The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16995:28"/>
milke, Good gouernment, which conſiſteth in ſobrietie and moderate exerciſes, lightneſſe of heart, and a continuall auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all paſſions do preſerue it much. Griefe and ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are the contraries vnto it, which are the greateſt if not the only euils that follow man, whereof we ſhall ſpeake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But in the preſeruation hereof, beaſts likewiſe ſimply following nature which hath giuen them health do farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed men, they often times forgetting themſelues, though afterwards they pay dearly for it.</p>
                  <p>Next followeth Beautie, a good of great account in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety <note place="margin">2 <hi>Beautie.</hi>
                     </note> of men. It is the firſt meane of reconciling or vniting one to another, and it is very likely that the firſt diſtinction that hath beene of one man from another, and the firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that giueth preheminence to one aboue another, hath beene the aduantage of beauty. It is likewiſe a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full quality, there is none that ſurmounteth it in credit, or that hath ſo great a part in the ſocietie of men; for there is none ſo barbarous, none ſo reſolute, that hath not been beaten by it. It preſenteth it ſelfe vnto the view, it ſeduceth and preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupateth the iudgement, it makes deepe impreſſions, and preſſeth a man with great authority; and therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> called it a ſhort tyranny, and <hi>Plato</hi> the priuiledge of Nature: for it ſeemeth that he that carieth in his countenance the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of Nature imprinted in a rare and excellent beautie, hath a kinde of lawfull power ouer vs, and that we turning our eies towards him, he likewiſe turneth our affections, and enthrawleth them in deſpight of our ſelues. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth that it apperteineth to thoſe that are beautifull to command; that they are venerable next to the gods themſelues; that there are none, but ſuch as are blinde, but are touched with it. <hi>Cyrus, Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> three great Commanders, haue made great vſe thereof in their greateſt affaires, yea <hi>Scipio</hi> the beſt of them all. <hi>Faire</hi> and good are neere neighbours, and are expreſſed by the ſelfe ſame words both in <hi>Greeke</hi> and in the Scriptures. Many great Philoſophers haue attained to their wiſdome, by the aſſiſtance of their beauty. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſiderable and much required in beaſts themſelues. <note place="margin">3 <hi>The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Beauty.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are in Beauty diuers things to be conſidered: That of men is properly the forme and feature of the bodie, as for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16995:29"/>
other beauties they belong vnto women. There are two ſorts of beauties, the one ſetled which moueth not at all, and it conſiſteth in the due proportion and colour of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, a body that is not ſwolne or puffed vp, wherein the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes and veines appeare not from far, nor the bones preſſe not the skin, but full of bloud and ſpirits, and in good ſtate, hauing the muſcles eleuated, the skin ſmooth, the colour ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million: the other moueable, which is called a good grace, and is the true guiding or cariage of the motion of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and aboue all, the eyes. The former beauty of it ſelfe is as it were dead, this actiue and full of life. There are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are rude, fierce, ſowre, others that are ſweet, yea though they be fading.</p>
                  <p>Beauty is properly to be conſidered in the viſage. There <note place="margin">4 <hi>Of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</hi>
                     </note> is nothing more beautifull in man than his ſoule; and in the body of man than his viſage, which is as it were the ſoule abreuiated, that is, the paterne or image of the ſoule, that is, her Eſcuchion with many quarters, repreſenting the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all her titles of honour, planted and placed in the gate and forefront, to the end that men may know that heere is her abode and her palace. By the countenance it is that we know the perſon of a man; and therefore arte which imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth nature, takes no care to repreſent the perſon of man, but only to paint or carue the viſage.</p>
                  <p>There are many ſpeciall ſingularities in the viſage of man, which are not in beaſts (for to ſay the truth they haue no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage) <note place="margin">5 <hi>Seuen ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities in the viſage of man.</hi>
                     </note> nor in the reſt of the body of man; As the number and diuerſitie of the parts and formes of them, in beaſts there is neither chin, nor cheeks, nor forehead, much leſſe any forme or faſhion of them. Variety of colours, as in the eye onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there is blacke, white, greene, blew, red, cryſtaline. Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for the ſenſes are there double, anſwering the one to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> other, and in ſuch a maner, that the greatneſſe of the eye is the greatneſſe of the mouth, the largeneſſe of the forehead the length of the noſe, the length of the noſe that of the chin and lips. An admirable diuerſitie of countenances, and ſuch, that there are hardly found two faces in all reſpects like one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> another: this is a chiefe point of workmanſhip, which in no other thing can be found. This variety is very profitable,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16995:29"/>
yea neceſſary for humane ſociety; firſt to know one another, for infinite euils, yea the diſſipation of humane kinde muſt needs follow, if a man ſhould miſtake himſelfe by the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and ſimilitude of diuers viſages, yea it would be a confuſion worſe than that of <hi>Babel.</hi> A man would take his daughter for his ſiſter, for a ſtranger, his enemy for his friend. If our faces were all alike, we ſhould not diſcerne a man from a beaſt; and if they were not all vnlike one another, we could not know how to diſcerne a man from a man. Beſides, it was an excellent arte of Nature to place in this part ſome ſecret that might giue contentment to one another thorow the whole world: for by reaſon of this varietie of faces, there is not a perſon that in ſome part is not beautifull. The dignity and honour of it round figure, forme vpright and eleuated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> on high, naked and vncouered without haire, feathers, ſcales, as in other creatures, looking vp vnto heauen. Grace, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> a pleaſant and decent comlineſſe, euen to the giuing vp of a mans <hi>Soule,</hi> and the rauiſhing of his will, as hath beene ſhewed before. To be briefe, the viſage is the throne of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and loue; the ſeat of laughter and kiſſing, two things very proper and agreeable vnto man, the true and moſt ſignificant ſymboles of amitie and good diſcretion. Finally, it is apt for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> all alterations, to declare the inward motions and paſſions of the ſoule, as Ioy, Heauineſſe, Loue, Hatred, Enuie, Malice, Shame, choler, Iealouſie, &amp; ſo forth. It is as the hand of a diall, which noteth the houres and moments of time, the wheeles and motions themſelues being hid within. And as the aire which receiueth all the colours &amp; changes of the time, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what the weather is, ſo ſaith one, the aire of a mans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. <hi>Corpus animum tegit &amp; detegit, in facie legitur homo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The beauty of the face conſiſteth in a large, ſquare, well <note place="margin">6 <hi>A deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the beautie of the face.</hi>
                     </note> extended and cleere front, eye-browes well ranged, thin and ſubtile, the eye well diuided, cheerefull, ſparkling: as for the colour I leaue it doubtfull, the noſe leane, the mouth little, the lips coraline, the chinne ſhort and dimpled, the cheekes ſomewhat riſing and in the middle the pleaſant <hi>gelaſin,</hi> the eares round and well compact, the whole countenance with a liuely tincture white and vermilion. Neuertheleſſe, this deſcription of Beauty is not generally receiued, the opinions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16995:30"/>
of Beauty are different according to the diuerſity of nations. With the Indians the greateſt Beautie conſiſteth in that which we account the greateſt deformitie, that is, in a tawny colour, thicke and ſwollen lips, a flat and large noſe, teeth ſpotted with blacke or red, great eares and hanging, a little low forehead, dugs great and pendant, to the end they may giue their little ones ſucke ouer their ſhoulders, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this forme of beautie, they vſe all maner of arte.

                  <p>THere is great likelihood that the cuſtome or faſhion of <note place="margin">Nakedneſſe is naturall.</note> going naked, as yet continued in a great part of the world, was the firſt and originall amongſt men, and that of couering and adorning the bodie with garments was artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and inuented to helpe and inlarge nature, as they which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16995:30"/>
by artificiall light goe about to increaſe the light of the day: for Nature hauing ſufficiently prouided for all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a couering, it is not to be beleeued that ſhe hath hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led man worſe than the reſt, and left him only indigent, and in ſuch a ſtate that he could not helpe himſelfe without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſuccours, and therefore thoſe reproches that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nature as a ſtepmother, are vniuſt. If men from the beginning had beene clothed, it is not likely that they would euer haue diſrobed themſelues and gone naked, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their health, which could not but be much offended with that change, and ſhame it ſelfe: and neuertheleſſe, it is done and obſerued amongſt many nations. Neither can it be alledged that we clothe our ſelues either to couer our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or priuy parts, or to defend vs againſt colde (for theſe are the two reaſons pretended; for againſt heat there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reaſon) becauſe Nature hath not taught vs, that there is any thing in our nakedneſſe that we ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of; it is we that by our owne fault and fale haue tolde it our ſelues: <hi>Quis indicauit tibi quod nudus eſſes, niſi quod ex lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no quod praeceperam tibi ne comederes comediſti:</hi> and Nature hath already ſufficiently hid them, put them farre from our eies, and couered them. And therefore it is leſſe needfull to couer thoſe parts only, as ſome doe in thoſe countreys where they goe all naked, and ordinarily are not couered: for why ſhould he that is the lord of all other creatures, not daring to ſhew himſelfe naked vnto the world, hide himſelfe vnder the ſpoiles of another, nay adorne himſelfe? As for colde and other particular and locall neceſſities, wee know that vnder the ſelfe ſame aire, the ſelfe ſame heauen, one goes naked, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other apparelled; and we haue all the moſt delicate part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: and therefore a wandring perſon being asked, How he could go ſo naked in Winter, anſwered, That our faces are alwayes naked, and he was all face: Yea, many great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages haue euer gone with their heads vncouered, <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa, Caeſar, Hanibal, Seuerus,</hi> and many nations there are, which go to the warres and fight all naked: and the counſell that <hi>Plato</hi> giueth for the continuance of health is, neuer to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer either head or feet. And <hi>Varro</hi> ſayth, That when it was firſt ordained that men ſhould vncouer their heads in the

preſence of the gods and of the magiſtrate, that it was rather for healths ſake, and to harden themſelues againſt the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the times, than for reuerence. Laſtly, the inuention of couers and houſes againſt the iniuries of heauen and men, is more ancient, more naturall, more vniuerſall, than of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and common with many creatures, but an induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſearch for victuall more naturall than either.

The generall knowledge and diſcourſe thereof may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to theſe ten points: The Definition, Eſſence or Nature, Faculties and Actions, Vnitie or Pluralitie, Source, Entrance into the bodie, Reſidence therein, Seat, Sufficiencie to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe her functions, the End and Separation from the bodie.</p>
                  <p>It is firſt very hard to define, or truly to ſay what the ſoule <note place="margin">1 <hi>The Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion verie difficult.</hi>

                  <p>It is eaſie to ſay what it is not: That it is not <hi>Fire, Aire,</hi>

Againe, Mettals and things inanimate haue likewiſe a temperature of the foure Elements and firſt qualities. Neither is it blood, (for there are many things ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and liuing without blood, and many creatures die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſhedding of a drop of blood.) Nor the beginning and

Neither is it the act, or life, or <hi>Enargie,</hi> or perfection (for that word <hi>Entelechia</hi> is diuerſly taken and interpreted) of a liuing body: for all this is but the effect or action of the <hi>Soule,</hi> and not the <hi>Soule</hi> it ſelfe, as to liue, to ſee, to vnderſtand is the action of the <hi>Soule.</hi> And it would likewiſe follow, that the <hi>Soule</hi> ſhould be an accident not a ſubſtance, and could not ſubſiſt without that bodie whereof it is the act and perfection, no more than the couer of an houſe may be without the houſe, and a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue without his correlatiue. To be briefe, it is to ſay what the ſoule doth and is to another, not what it is in it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But to ſay what the <hi>Soule</hi> is, is very difficult: A man may <note place="margin">3 <hi>Hard to ſay what it is.</hi>
                     </note> ſimply ſay that it is an eſſentiall quickning forme, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the plant the vegetatiue or growing life; to a beaſt a ſenſible life, which comprehendeth the vegetatiue; to a man an intellectuall life, which comprehendeth the other two, as in numbers the greater conteines the leſſe, and in figures the <hi>Pentagone</hi> conteines the <hi>Tetragone,</hi> &amp; this the <hi>Trigone.</hi> I call it the intellectiue ſoule rather than the reaſonable, which is comprehended in the intellectiue as the leſſe in the great: for the reaſonable in ſome ſenſe and meaſure, according to the opinion of the greateſt Philoſophers and experience it ſelfe, is likewiſe in beaſts, but not the intellectiue as being more high. <hi>Sicut equus &amp; mulus in quibus non est intellectus.</hi> The <hi>Soule</hi> then is not the beginning or ſource, that word doth properly belong to the ſoueraigne firſt author, but an inward cauſe of life, motion, ſenſe, vnderſtanding. It moueth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; it ſelfe is not moued; as contrarily, the body is moued, and moueth not at al: it moueth I ſay the body, &amp; not it ſelfe, for nothing but God moueth it ſelfe; and whatſoeuer moueth it ſelfe is eternall and Lord of it ſelfe: and in that it mooueth the bodie it hath it not of it ſelfe, but from an higher cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the nature and eſſence of the <hi>Soule,</hi> I meane a humane <hi>Soule</hi> (for the <hi>Soule</hi> of a beaſt is without all doubt <note place="margin">4 <hi>The nature and eſſence of the ſoule.</hi>
                     </note> corporall, materiall, bred and borne with the matter, and with it corruptible) there is a queſtion of greater importance than it ſeemeth: for ſome affirme it to be corporall, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporall:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16995:32"/>
and this is very agreeable to reaſon, if a man be not opinatiue. That it is corporall, ſee what the grounds are; <hi>Spirits</hi> and Diuels, good and ill, which are wholly ſeparated from all matter are corporall, according to the opinion of all Philoſophers and our greateſt Diuines, <hi>Tertulltan, Origen, S.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In homil. l. de ſpir. l 3. de lib. arb. Hom. de Epith.</note> 
                     <hi>Baſil, Gregorie, Auguſtine, Damaſcene;</hi> how much more the <hi>Soule</hi> of man, which hath ſocietie and is vnited to a matter? Their reſolution is, that whatſoeuer is created, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto God, is groſſe, corporall, materiall, and only God is incorporall; that euery ſpirit is a bodie and hath a bodily na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Next vnto authoritie almoſt vniuerſall the reaſon is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable. Whatſoeuer is included in this finite world is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, limited both in vertue and ſubſtance, bounded with a ſuperficies, incloſed and circumſcribed in a place, which are the true and naturall conditions of a bodie: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bodie which hath a ſuperficiall part, and is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and faſtened in a place. God only is wholly infinite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporall, the ordinarie diſtinctions, <hi>circumſcriptiuè, defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè, effectiuè,</hi> are but verball, and in nothing either helpe or hurt the cauſe: for it alwayes ſtands good that ſpirits are in ſuch ſort in a place, that at the ſelfe ſame time that they are in a place they can not be elſwhere; and they are not in a place either infinite, or very great, or very little, but equall to their limited and finited ſubſtance and ſuperficies. And if it were not ſo, ſpirits could not change their place, nor aſcend or deſcend, as the Scripture affirmeth that they doe: and ſo they ſhould be immooueable, indiuiſible, indifferently in all. Now if it appeare that they change their place, the change conuicteth that they are mooueable, diuiſible, ſubiect vnto time and to the ſucceſſion thereof, required in the motion and paſſage from one place to another, which are all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a bodie. But becauſe many ſimple men vnder this word corporall, do imagine viſible, palpable, and thinke not that the pure aire, or fire without the flame or coale are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, haue therefore likewiſe affirmed, That ſpirits both ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and humane are not corporall, as in trueth they are not in that ſenſe: for they are of an inuiſible ſubſtance, whether airie as the greateſt part of Philoſophers and Diuines affirm, or celeſtiall as ſome <hi>Hebrewes</hi> and <hi>Arabiques</hi> teach, calling
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16995:32"/>
by the ſelfe ſame name both the heauen and the ſpirit an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence proper to immortalitie; or whether (if they will haue it ſo) of a ſubſtance more ſubtile and delicate, yet they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes corporall, ſince limited by place, mooueable, ſubiect to motion and to times. Finally, if they were not corporall, they ſhould not be paſſible and capable of ſuffering as they are: the humane receiueth from his bodie pleaſure and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, ſorrow and delight in his turne, as the bodie from the ſpirit and his paſſions many good qualities, many bad, vertues, vices, affections, which are all accidents: and all as well the ſpirits ſeparated and Diuels, as humane, are ſubiect to puniſhment and torments. They are therefore corporall: for there is nothing paſſible, that is not corporall, and it is only proper vnto bodies to be ſubiect to accidents.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Soule</hi> hath a great number of vertues and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as many almoſt as the body hath members: There are <note place="margin">3 <hi>The facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Soule.</hi>
                     </note> ſome in plants, more in beaſts, moſt in man, to know, to liue, to feele, to mooue, to deſire, to allure, to aſſemble, to retaine, to concoct, to digeſt, to nouriſh, to grow, to reiect, to ſee, to heare, to taſte, to ſmell, to ſpeake, to breath, to ingender, to thinke, to reaſon, to contemplate, to conſent, diſſent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, iudge; all which are no parts of the <hi>Soule:</hi> for ſo it ſhould be diuiſible, and ſhould conſiſt vpon accidents, but they are her naturall qualities. The actions come after and follow the faculties, and ſo there are three degrees, according to the doctrine of great <hi>S. Denys</hi> followed of all, that is, we muſt conſider in ſpirituall creatures three things, <hi>Eſſence, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, Operation:</hi> By the latter which is the action we know the facultie, and by it the eſſence. The actions may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and wholly ceaſe without any preiudice at all vnto the ſoule, and her faculties, as the <hi>Science</hi> and facultie of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remaineth entire in the Painter, although his hands be bound, and ſo be made vnable to paint: But if the faculties themſelues periſh, the <hi>Soule</hi> muſt needs be gone, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then <hi>Fire</hi> is no longer fire hauing loſt the facultie of warming.</p>
                  <p>The eſſence and nature of the <hi>Soule</hi> being after a ſort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, <note place="margin">The vnitie of the ſoule.</note> one of the buſieſt queſtions that belongeth vnto the <hi>Soule</hi> offereth it ſelfe to our conſideration, that is, whether
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16995:33"/>
there be in a creature eſpecially in man one ſoule or manie? Touching which point there are diuers opinions, but may be reduced into three. Some of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and almoſt all the <hi>Arabiques</hi> imitating them, haue thought (not onely in euery particular man, but generally in all men) that there was but one immortall <hi>Soule.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> for the moſt part held an opinion quite contrarie, that there was a pluralitie of ſoules in euery creature, all diuers and diſtinct, two in euerie beaſt, and three in man, two mortal, the vegetatiue &amp; ſenſible, and the third intellectiue, immortall. The third opinion as the meane betwixt the two former, and moſt followed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held by many of all nations is, that there is but one <hi>Soule</hi> in euery creature, not more. In euery of theſe opinions there is ſome difficultie. I leaue the firſt as being already ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted and reiected. The pluralitie of ſoules in euerie creature and man, on the one ſide ſeemeth verie ſtrange and abſurd in Philoſophie, for that were to giue many formes to one and the ſame thing, and to ſay that there are many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ſubiects in one, two beaſts in one, three men in one; on the other ſide it giueth credit and helpeth much our beleefe touching the immortalitie of the intellectuall <hi>Soule;</hi> for there being three ſoules, there can follow no inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that two of them ſhould die, and the third continue immortall. The vnitie of the <hi>Soule</hi> ſeemeth to reſiſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie thereof; for how can one and the ſame indiuiſible, be in a mortall part and an immortall? as neuertheleſſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> would haue it. Doubtleſſe it ſeemeth that of neceſſitie the <hi>Soule</hi> muſt be either altogether mortall, or altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, which are two very foule abſurdities. The firſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth all religion and ſound Philoſophy: the ſecond maketh beaſts likewiſe immortall. Neuertheleſſe it ſeemes to be more true that there is but one <hi>Soule</hi> in euery creature, for the pluralitie and diuerſitie of faculties, inſtruments, actions, neither derogateth any thing at all, nor multiplieth in any thing this vnitie, no more than the diuerſitie of riuers the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of one ſpring or fountaine, nor the diuerſitie of effects in the Sunne, to heat, to enlighten, to melt, to drie, to whiten, to make blacke, do diſſipate the vnitie and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the Sunne; for ſhould they, there would be a great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16995:33"/>
number of ſoules in one man and Sunnes in one world. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this eſſentiall vnitie of the <hi>Soule</hi> any thing hinder the immortalitie of the humane <hi>Soule</hi> in her eſſence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vegetatiue and ſenſitiue faculties, which are but accidents, die, that is to ſay, cannot be exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, the <hi>Soule</hi> not hauing a ſubiect or inſtrument whereby to doe it, but the third intellectuall <hi>Soule</hi> is alwaies well, becauſe for it there is no need of the bodie, though whileſt it is within it, it make vſe thereof to exerciſe it ſelfe; inſomuch that if it did returne vnto the bodie, it were onely againe to exerciſe hir vegetatiue and ſenſitiue faculties, as we ſee in thoſe that are raiſed vnto life to liue heere below, not in thoſe that are raiſed to liue elſewhere, for ſuch bodies need not to liue by the exerciſe of ſuch faculties: Euen as there is no want or decay in the Sunne, but it continueth in it ſelfe wholly the ſame, though during a whole ecclips it neither ſhine nor warme, nor performe his other effects in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are ſubiect vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Hauing ſhewed the vnitie of the ſoule in euery ſubiect, let <note place="margin">The ſource of the ſoule.</note> vs ſee from whence it commeth, and how it entreth into the body. The originall beginning of ſoules is not held to be the ſame of all, I meane of humane ſoules; for the vegetatiue and ſenſitiue, of Plants and Beaſts, is by the opinion of all, altogether materiall, and in the ſeed, for which cauſe it is likewiſe mortall. But concerning the <hi>Soule</hi> of man there are foure celebrated opinions. According to the firſt which is of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> held by <hi>Philo Iudeus,</hi> and afterward by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches, Priſcilianiſts,</hi> and others, it is transferred and brought foorth as a part or parcell of the ſubſtance of God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth it into the bodie, alleaging to their beſt aduantage the words of <hi>Moyſes, Inſpirauit in faciem eius ſpiraculum vitae:</hi> The ſecond opinion, held by <hi>Tertullian, Apollinaris,</hi> the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferians</hi> and other Chriſtians, affirmeth that the <hi>Soule</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth and is deriued from the ſoules of our parents with the ſeed, as the <hi>Soule</hi> of a beaſt. The third opinion which is that of the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts</hi> held by many <hi>Rabins</hi> and Doctors of the Iewes, and afterwards by <hi>Origen</hi> and other Doctors, teacheth that the ſoules of men haue beene from the beginning all created of God, made of nothing and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16995:34"/>
reſerued in heauen, afterwards to be ſent into the lower parts, as need ſhould require, and that the bodies of men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and diſpoſed to receiue them; and from hence did ſpring the opinion of thoſe that thought that the ſoules of men heere below, were either well or ill handled, and lodged in bodies either ſound or ſicke, according to that life which they had led aboue in heauen, before they were incorporate. And truely the maſter of Wiſdome himſelfe ſheweth, that the <hi>Soule,</hi> of the two, was the elder, and before the bodie, <hi>Eram puer, bonam indolem ſortitus, imo bonus cum eſſem, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus incontaminatum reperi.</hi> The fourth opinion receiued and held through all Chriſtendome is, that they are all created of God, and infuſed into bodies prepared, in ſuch maner that the creation and infuſion is done at one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Theſe foure opinions are all affirmatiue, but there is a fift much reteined which determineth nothing, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſay, that it is a ſecret vnknowen vnto men; of which opinion was <hi>S. Austin, Greg.</hi> and others, who neuertheleſſe <note place="margin">De orig. Epl. 28. 157.</note> thought the two latter affirmatiue opinions more like to be true than the former.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now ſee when and how the <hi>Soule</hi> entreth into the <note place="margin">6 <hi>The entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſoule into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi>
                     </note> bodie, whether altogether at one inſtant, or ſucceſſiuely; I meane the humane <hi>Soule:</hi> for of that of a beaſt there is no doubt, ſince it is naturall in the ſeed, according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> (whom moſt do follow) that is by ſucceſſion of times and by degrees, as an artificiall forme which a man maketh by pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the one after the other; the head, afterwards the throat, the bellie, the legs: inſomuch that the vegetatiue and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue <hi>Soule</hi> altogether materiall and corporall, is in the ſeed, and with the deſcent of the parents, which faſhioneth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the matrix: and that done, the reaſonable <hi>Soule</hi> arriueth from without. And therefore there are neither two nor three ſoules; neither together nor ſucceſſiuely, neither is the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue corrupted by the arriuall of the ſenſitiue, nor the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue by the arriuall of the intellectuall; but it is but one <hi>Soule</hi> which is made, finiſhed and perfected in that time which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath preſcribed. Others are of opinion, that the ſoule entreth with all her faculties at one inſtant, that is to ſay then, when all the bodie is furniſhed with organs, formed, and

And as it hath foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and chiefe faculties, ſo men giue it foure ſeats, that is, thoſe foure regions, which we haue noted before in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body, the foure firſt principall inſtruments of the ſoule, the reſt referre themſelues vnto them, as alſo all the faculties to theſe, that is to ſay, the engendring faculty to the ingendring parts, the naturall to the liuer, the vitall to the heart, the animall and intellectuall to the braine.</p>

                     </note> the faculties of the <hi>Soule,</hi> whereunto the ſoule of it ſelfe is wiſe and ſufficient, inſomuch that it faileth not to produce that which it knoweth, &amp; to exerciſe it functions, as it ought, if it be not hindered, and that the inſtruments thereof be well diſpoſed. And therefore it was well and truly ſaid of the wiſe, that Nature is wiſe, diſcreet, induſtrious, a ſufficient miſtriſſe which maketh a man apt to all things: <hi>Inſita ſunt nobis omnium artium, ac virtutum ſemina, magiſterque ex occulto Deus produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ingenium:</hi> which is eaſily ſhewed by induction. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatiue ſoule without inſtruction formeth the body in the matrix with excellent arte, afterwards it nouriſheth it, and makes it grow, drawing the victuall vnto it, retaining and concocting it, afterwards caſting out the excrements, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth and reformeth the parts that faile; theſe are things that are ſeene in plants, beaſts, and men. The ſenſitiue <hi>Soule</hi> of it ſelfe without inſtruction, maketh both beaſts and men to moue their feet, their hands, and other members, to ſtretch, to rub, to ſhake, to moue the lips, to preſſe the dug, to crie, to laugh.

                     </note> the ſeparation of the <hi>Soule</hi> from the body, which is after a diuers ſort and maner; the one, and the ordinarie is naturall by death, and this not the ſame in beaſts and men: for by the death of beaſts, the <hi>Soule</hi> dieth, and is annihilated, áccording vnto that rule, by the corruption of the ſubiect the forme pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Naturall and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                     </note> the matter remaineth: by the death of man the <hi>Soule</hi> is ſeparated from the body, but is not loſt, but remaineth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is immortall.</p>
                  <p>The immortalitie of the <hi>Soule</hi> is a thing vniuerſally, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <note place="margin">2. <hi>The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the Soule.</hi>
                     </note> (for it is the principall foundation of all religion) and peaceably receiued and concluded vpon throughout the world, I meane by an outward and publique profeſſion; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and inwardly, not ſo, witneſſe ſo many Epicures, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, and mockers in the world: yea the <hi>Saduces,</hi> the greateſt Lordes of the Iewes, did not ſticke with open mouth to denie it; though a thing profitable to be beleeued, and in ſome ſort proued by many naturall and humane reaſons, but properly and better eſtabliſhed by the authority of religion than any other way. It ſeemeth that there is in a man a kinde of inclination and diſpoſition of nature to beleeue it, for man deſireth naturally to continue and perpetuate his being, from whence likewiſe proceedeth that great, yea furious care and loue of our poſterity and ſucceſſion. Againe two things there are that giue ſtrength thereunto, and make it more plauſible, the one is the hope of glory and reputation, and the deſire of the immortalitie of our name, which how vaine ſoeuer it be, carrieth a great credit in the world: the other is an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that vice which robbeth a man of the view and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of humane iuſtice, remaining alwaies oppoſite to the diuine iuſtice, muſt thereby be chaſtiſed, yea after death: ſo that beſides that a man is altogether carried and diſpoſed by nature to deſire it, and conſequently to beleeue it, the Iuſtice of God doth conclude it.</p>
                  <p>From hence we are to learne that there are three differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">3 <hi>The proofe.</hi>
                     </note> and degrees of <hi>Soules,</hi> an order required euen to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the vniuerſe. Two extreames, the one is that which being altogether materiall, is plunged, and ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the matter, and inſeparable from it, and therewithall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16995:36"/>
corruptible, which is the <hi>Soule</hi> of a beaſt: the other quite contrary, is that which hath not any commerce, or ſocietie with the matter or body, as the ſoule of immortall Angels or Diuels. In the middle as the meane betwixt theſe two, is the humane ſoule, which is neither wholly tied to the matter, nor altogether without it, but is ioyned with it, and may likewiſe ſubſiſt and liue without it. This order and diſtinction is an excellent argument of immortalitie; for it were a <hi>vacuum,</hi> a defect, a deformitie too abſurd in nature, diſhonourable to the authour, and a kinde of ruine to the world, that betwixt two extreames, the corruptible and incorruptible, there ſhould be no middle; that is, partly the one and partly the other: there muſt needs be one that ties and ioynes the two ends or extreames together, and that can be none but man. Below the loweſt and wholly materiall, is that which hath no <hi>Soule</hi> at all, as ſtones; aboue the higheſt and immortall, is the eternall only God.</p>
                  <p>The other ſeparation not naturall nor ordinary, and which <note place="margin">4 2. <hi>Not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</hi>
                     </note> is done by ſtrange impulſions and at times, is very difficult to vnderſtand, and perplex. It is that which is done by extaſies and rauiſhments, which is diuers and done by different meanes: for there is a ſeparation that is diuine, ſuch as the Scripture reporteth vnto vs, of <hi>Daniel, Zachary, Eſdras, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, S. Paul.</hi> There is another that is demoniacall, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by diuels, and good ſpirits and bad, as we reade of many, as of <hi>Iohn D'vns,</hi> called <hi>Leſcot,</hi> who being in his extaſie a long time held for dead, was carried into the aire, and caſt downe vpon the earth; but ſo ſoone as he felt the blow that he receiued by the fall, he came to himſelfe: but by reaſon of the great ſtore of blood which he loſt, his head being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he died outright. <hi>Cardan</hi> telleth it of himſelfe, and of his father, and it continueth autentiquely verified in many and diuers parts of the world, of many, and thoſe for the moſt part of the vulgar ſort, weake and women poſſeſſed, whoſe bodies remaine not only without motion, and the beating of the heart and arteries, but alſo without any ſenſe or feeling of the greateſt blowes, either with iron or fire, that could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, and afterwards their ſoules being returned they haue felt great paine in their limmes, and recounted that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16995:36"/>
which they haue ſeene and done in places far diſtant. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is a humane ſeparation, which proceedeth either from that maladie which <hi>Hipocrates</hi> calleth <hi>Sacer,</hi> commonly called The falling ſicknes, <hi>Morbus comitialis,</hi> the ſigne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a foming at the mouth, which is not in thoſe that are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; but in ſtead thereof they haue a ſtinking ſauor, or it is occaſioned by ſtiptickes, ſtupifying and benumming medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; or ariſeth from the force of imagination, which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and bending it ſelfe with too deepe an attention about a thing, carrieth away the whole ſtrength and power of the <hi>Soule.</hi> Now in theſe three kindes of extaſies or rauiſhments, <hi>Diuine, Diabolicall, Humane,</hi> the queſtion is, Whether the <hi>Soule</hi> be truely and really ſeparated from the body; or if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in it, it be in ſuch ſort employed and buſied about ſome outward thing which is foorth of the bodie, that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth it owne bodie; whereby followeth a kinde of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and vacation of the actions and exerciſe of the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof. Touching the diuine extaſie, the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe and his owne act; dares not define any thing, <hi>Si in corpore vel extra corpus neſcio, Deusſcit.</hi> An inſtruction that may ſerue for all others, and for other ſeparations of leſſe qualitie. Touching the <hi>Demoniacall</hi> extaſie, as not to feele a blow be it neuer ſo great, to report what hath been done two or three hundred leagues off, are two great and violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures of a true ſeparation from the bodie, but not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſarie: for the diuell can ſo alienate and occupie the ſoule within the body, that it ſhall not ſeeme to haue any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or commerce with the bodie for ſome certaine time, and in that time ſo beforteth the ſoule by preſenting things vnto the imagination that haue beene done afarre off, that a man may ſpeake and diſcourſe thereof: for to affirme that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Soule</hi> doth wholly depart and abandon the bodie, Nature is too bolde and foole-hardie: to ſay that it doth not wholly depart, but that the imaginatiue or intellectuall is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out, and that the vegetatiue ſoule remaineth, were more to intangle our ſelues; for ſo the <hi>Soule</hi> in it eſſence ſhould be diuided, or the accident only ſhould be carried out, and not the ſubſtance. Touching the humane extaſie, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there is no ſeparation of the <hi>Soule,</hi> but only a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16995:37"/>
of the patent and outward actions thereof.</p>
                  <p>What becomes of the <hi>Soule,</hi> and what the ſtate thereof is <note place="margin">11 <hi>The eſtate of the Soule after death.</hi>
                     </note> after the naturall ſeparation by death, diuers men thinke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly: and this point belongeth not to the ſubiect of this booke. The <hi>Metempſychoſe</hi> and tranſanimation of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> hath in ſome ſort been embraced by the <hi>Academicks, Stoicks, Aegyptians,</hi> and others; but yet not of all in the ſame ſenſe: for ſome doe admit it only for the puniſhment of the wicked, as we reade of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> who was changed into a beaſt by the iudgement of God. Others, and ſome great, haue thought that good ſoules, being ſeparated, become Angels, the wicked, Diuels. It had beene more pleaſing to haue ſayd Like vnto them; <hi>Non nubent, ſed erunt ſicut Angeli.</hi> Some haue affirmed, that the ſoules of the wicked, at the end of a certaine time, were reduced to nothing. But the trueth of all this we muſt learne from Religion and Diuines, who ſpeake heereof more cleerely.</p>

That is to ſay, the <hi>Soule,</hi> as the firſt efficient cauſe. The facultie of <hi>Senſe</hi> (which is a qualitie of the <hi>Soule,</hi> and not the <hi>Soule</hi> it ſelfe) that is, of perceiuing and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> outward things; which is done after a fiue-folde maner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which we call <hi>The fiue Senſes</hi> (of this number we ſhall ſpeake hereafter) that is to ſay, <hi>Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, Tasting, Touching.</hi> The corporall inſtrument of the <hi>Senſe,</hi> whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> there are fiue, according to the number of the <hi>Senſes;</hi> the Eye, the Eare, the high concauitie of the Noſe, which is the entrance to the firſt ventricles of the braine, the Tongue, the whole Skin of the bodie. The <hi>Spirit</hi> which ariſeth from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> braine the fountaine of the ſenſitiue <hi>Soule,</hi> by certaine ſinewes in the ſayd inſtruments, by which ſpirit and inſtrument the ſoule exerciſeth her facultie. The ſenſible <hi>Species,</hi> or obiect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> offered vnto the inſtruments, which is different according to the diuerſitie of the ſenſe. The obiect of the eye or ſight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common opinion is colour, which is an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent quality in bodies, whereof there are ſix ſimple, as White, Yellow, Red, Purple, Greene and Blew; ſome adde a ſeuenth, which is blacke; but to ſay the trueth, that is no colour, but a priuation, being like vnto darkeneſſe, as the other colours more or leſſe vnto the light. Of compound colours the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16995:38"/>
is infinite: but to ſpeake more truely, the true obiect is light, which is neuer without colour, and without which the colours are inuiſible. Now the light is a qualitie which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth of a luminous body, which makes both it ſelfe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and all things els; and if it be terminated and limited by ſome ſolide bodie, it reboundeth and redoubleth it beames: otherwiſe if it paſſe without any ſtop or termination, it can not be ſeene except it be in the root of that light or luminous bodie from whence it came, nor make any thing els to be ſeene. Of the Eare or Hearing, the obiect is a ſound, which is a noiſe proceeding from the encounter of two bodies, and it is diuers: the pleaſant and melodious ſweeteneth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeth the ſpirit, and for it ſake the bodie too, and driues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way maladies from them both: the ſharpe and penetrant doth contrariwiſe trouble and wound the ſpirit. Of Taſting, the obiect is a fauour or ſmacke, whereof there are ſix diuers ſimple kindes, <hi>Sweet, Sowre, Sharpe, Tart, Salt, Bitter;</hi> but there are many compounds. Of Smell, the obiect is an odour or ſent, which is a fume riſing from an odoriferous obiect aſcending by the noſe to the firſt ventricles of the braine: the ſtrong and violent hurteth the braine, as an ill ſound the eare: the temperate and good doth contrariwiſe reioyce, delight and comfort. Of the ſenſe of Touching, the obiect is heat, colde, drouth, moiſture either pleaſant and polite, or ſharpe and ſmarting, motion, reſt, tickling.</p>
                  <p>The middle or ſpace betwixt the obiect and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> which is the Aire neither altered nor corrupted, but ſuch as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>So that ſenſe is made, when the ſenſible ſpecies preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it ſelfe by the middle to an inſtrument ſound and well diſpoſed, and that therein the ſpirit aſſiſting, receiueth it and apprehendeth it in ſuch ſort, that there is there both action and paſſion; and the ſenſes are not purely paſſiue: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they receiue, and are ſtricken by the obiect, yet neuertheleſſe in ſome ſenſe and meaſure they doe worke or react in apprehending the ſpecies and image of the obiect propoſed.</p>
                  <p>In former times and before <hi>Aristotle,</hi> they did make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the ſenſe of <hi>Seeing</hi> and the reſt of the ſenſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:16995:38"/>
and they all held, that the ſight was actiue, and was made by emitting or ſending forth of the eye, the beames thereof vnto the outward obiects, and that the other ſenſes were paſſiue, receiuing the ſenſible obiect: but after <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> they are made all alike, and all paſſiue, receiuing in the organ or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the kindes and images of things, and the reaſons of the Ancients to the contrary are eaſily anſwered.

                  <p>It is an opinion amongſt vs, that there are but fiue ſenſes of Nature, becauſe wee marke but fiue in vs; but yet there <note place="margin">2 <hi>The num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                     </note> may very well be more, and it is greatly to be doubted that there are; but it is impoſſible for vs to know them, to affirme them, or to denie them, becauſe a man ſhall neuer know the want of that ſenſe which he hath neuer had. There are many
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16995:39"/>
beaſts which liue a full and perfect life, which want ſome one of our fiue ſenſes; and a creature may liue without the fiue ſenſes, ſaue the ſenſe of <hi>Feeling,</hi> which is only neceſſary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life. We liue very commodiouſly with fiue, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we do want one, or two, or three, and yet it can not be knowen. One ſenſe can not diſcouer another: and if a man want one by nature, yet he knowes not which way to affirme it. A man borne blinde can neuer conceiue that he ſeeth not, nor deſire to ſee, nor delight in his ſight: it may be he will ſay that he would ſee, but that is becauſe he hath heard ſay and learned of others, that it is to be deſired: the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſenſes are the firſt gates, and entrances to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So man not being able to imagine more than the fiue that he hath, he can not know how to iudge whether there be more in Nature; yet he may haue more. Who knoweth whether the difficulties that we finde in many of the works of Nature, and the effects of creatures, which we can not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, doe proceed from the want of ſome ſenſe that wee haue not? Of the hidden properties which we ſee in many things, a man may ſay that there are ſenſible faculties in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proper to iudge and apprehend them; but yet he muſt confeſſe that we haue them not, and that the ignorance of ſuch things proceedeth from our owne default. Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether it be ſome particular ſenſe, that diſcouereth in the Cocke the houre of mid-night and morning, and that moues him to crow? Who taught ſome beaſts to chuſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine herbes for their cure, and many ſuch like woonders as theſe are? No man can affirme or denie, ſay this it is, or that it is.</p>
                  <p>Some haue aſſayed to giue a reaſon of this number of the fiue ſenſes, and to prooue the ſufficiencie of them, by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <note place="margin">3 <hi>Their ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie.</hi>
                     </note> and diuerſly comparing their outward obiects; which are, either all neere the bodie or diſtant from it: if neere but yet remaining without, it is the ſenſe of Touching; if they enter, it is Taſte; if they be more diſtant and preſent by a right line, it is the Sight; if oblique and by reflexion, it is the Hearing. A man might better haue ſayd thus, That theſe fiue ſenſes being appointed for the ſeruice of an entire man, ſome are entirely for the bodie, that is to ſay, <hi>Taste</hi> and

                     <hi>Touching;</hi> that, in that it entreth; this, in that it remaines without. Others firſt and principally for the ſoule, as ſight and hearing: the Sight for inuention, the Hearing for acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and communication, and one in the middle, for the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſpirits, and ties of the ſoule and body, which is the <hi>Smell.</hi> Againe, they anſwer to the foure Elements, and their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: The ſenſe of <hi>Feeling</hi> to the earth; of <hi>Hearing</hi> to the aire; of <hi>Taſte</hi> to the water and moiſture; the <hi>Smell</hi> to the fire. The <hi>Sight</hi> is a compound, and partakes both of water and fire, by reaſon of the bright ſplendor of the eie. Againe they ſay that there are ſo many ſenſes, as there are kinds of ſenſible things, which are colour, ſound, odour, taſte or ſauour, and the fift which hath no proper name, the obiect of <hi>Feeling,</hi> which is heat, cold, rough, plaine, and ſo foorth. But men deceiue themſelues, for the number of the ſenſes is not to be iudged by the number of ſenſible things, which are no cauſe that there are ſo many. By this reaſon there ſhould bee many more, and one and the ſame ſenſe ſhould receiue many diuers heads of obiects, and one and the ſame obiect be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by diuers ſenſes: ſo that the tickling of a feather, and the pleaſures of <hi>Venus</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from the fiue Senſes, and by ſome comprehended in the ſenſe of <hi>Feeling:</hi> But the cauſe is rather, for that the ſpirit hath no power to attaine to the knowledge of things, but by the fiue Sences, and that Nature hath giuen it ſo many, becauſe it was neceſſary for it end and benefit.</p>
                  <p>Their compariſons are diuers in dignity and nobility. The <note place="margin">4 <hi>Compariſon.</hi>

                     <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Seeing</hi> excelleth all the reſt in fiue things: It appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth farther off, and extendeth it ſelfe euen to the fixed ſtarres. It hath more variety of obiects, for to all things &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in all there is light and colour the obiects of the eie.

It is more diuine, and the markes of Diuinity are many. Liberty incomparable aboue others, whereby the eie ſeeth, or ſeeth not, and therefore it hath lids ready to open and to ſhut: power not to turmoile it ſelfe, and not to ſuffer it ſelfe to bee

ſeene; Actiuitie and abilitie to pleaſe or diſpleaſe, to ſignifie and inſinuate our thoughts, willes and affections: for the eye ſpeaketh and ſtriketh, it ſerueth for a tongue and a hand; the other Senſes are purely paſſiue. But that which is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this Senſe is, that the priuation of the obiect thereof, which is darkneſſe, brings feare, and that naturally; and the reaſon is, becauſe a man findeth himſelfe robbed of ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a guide: and therefore whereas a man deſireth company for his ſolace, the Sight in the light is in place of companie. The ſenſe of Hearing hath many excellent ſingularities, it is more ſpirituall, and the ſeruice thereof more inward. But the particular compariſon of theſe two, which are of the reſt the more noble, and of ſpeech, ſhall be ſpoken in the Chapter following. As for pleaſure or diſpleaſure, though all the Senſes are capable thereof, yet the Senſe of Feeling receiueth greateſt griefe, and almoſt no pleaſure; and contrarily the Taſte great delight, and almoſt no griefe. In the organ and inſtrument, the Touch is vniuerſall, ſpred thorow the whole bodie, to the end the bodie ſhould feele heat and colde; the organs of the reſt are aſſigned to a certaine place &amp; member.</p>
                  <p>From the weakneſſe and incertitude of our ſenſes comes ignorance, errour and miſtakings: for ſithens that by their <note place="margin">5 The weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Senſes.</note> meanes and mixture we attaine to all knowledge, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs in their report, we haue no other helpe to ſticke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But who can ſay, or accuſe them, that they do deceiue vs, conſidering that by them we begin to learne and to know? Some haue aſſirmed that they do neuer deceiue vs, and when they ſeeme to doe it, the fault proceedeth from ſome thing els; and that wee muſt rather attribute it to any other thing than to the ſenſes. Others haue ſayd cleane contrarie, that they are all falſe, and can teach vs nothing that is certaine. But the middle opinion is the more true.</p>
                  <p>Now whether the Senſes be falſe or not, at the leaſt it is <note place="margin">6 The mutuall deceit of the ſpirit and ſenſes.</note> certaine that they deceiue, yea ordinarily enforce the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the reaſon, and in exchange are againe mocked by it. Do then but conſider what kinde of knowledge and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a man may haue, when that within, and that without is full of deceit and weakeneſſe, and that the principall parts thereof, the eſſentiall inſtruments of ſcience do deceiue one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16995:40"/>
another. That the ſenſes doe deceiue and enforce the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it is plaine in thoſe ſenſes whereof ſome do kindle with furie, others delight &amp; ſweeten, others tickle the <hi>Soule.</hi> And why doe they that cauſe themſelues to be let blood, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, cauteriſed and burnt, turne away their eies, but that they do well know that great authoritie that the Senſes haue ouer their reaſon? The ſight of ſome bottomleſſe depth, or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate downfall, aſtoniſheth euen him that is ſetled in a firme and ſure place: and to conclude, doth not the Senſe vanquiſh and quite ouercome all the beautifull reſolutions of vertue, and patience? So on the other ſide, the ſenſes are likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the vnderſtanding, which appeareth by this, that the <hi>Soule</hi> being ſtirred with Choler, Loue, Hatred, or any other paſſion, our ſenſes doe ſee, and heare euery thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then they are, yea ſometimes our ſenſes are altogether dulled by the paſſions of the <hi>Soule,</hi> and it ſeemeth that the <hi>Soule</hi> retireth and ſhutteth vp the operation of the Senſes, and that the ſpirit being otherwiſe employed, the eie diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that which is before it, and which it ſeeth: yea the ſight and the reaſon iudge diuerſly of the greatneſſe of the Sunne, the ſtarres, nay of the figure of a ſtaffe any thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
                  <p>In the Senſes of Nature the beaſts haue as well part, as we, <note place="margin">7 The ſenſes common to man and beaſt, but diuerſly.</note> and ſometimes excell vs: for ſome haue their hearing more quicke than man, ſome their ſight, others their ſmell, others their taſte: and it is held, that in the ſenſe of Hearing, the Hart excelleth all others; of Sight, the Eagle; of Smell, the Dogge; of Taſte, the Ape; of Feeling, the Tortuis: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, the preheminence of that ſenſe of Touch is giuen vnto man, which of all the reſt is the moſt brutiſh. Now if the Senſes are the meanes to attaine vnto knowledge, and that beaſts haue a part therein, yea ſomtimes the better part, why ſhould not they haue knowledge?</p>
                  <p>But the Senſes are not the only inſtruments of knowledge, <note place="margin">8 <hi>The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Senſes hard and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi>
                     </note> neither are our Senſes alone to be conſulted or beleeued: for if beaſts by their Senſes iudge otherwiſe of things than we by ours, as doubtleſſe they do; who muſt be beleeued? Our ſpettle cleanſeth and drieth our wounds, it killeth the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; What then is the true qualitie of our ſpettle? To dire
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16995:41"/>
and to cleanſe, or to kill? To iudge well of the operation of the ſenſes, we muſt be at ſome agreement with the beaſts, nay with our ſelues: for the eie preſſed downe and ſhut, ſeeth otherwiſe than in it ordinary ſtate; the eare ſtopt, receiueth the obiects otherwiſe than when it is open: an infant ſeeth, heareth, taſteth, otherwiſe than a man; a man than an olde man; a ſound than a ſicke; a wiſe than a foole. In this great diuerſitie and contrarietie what ſhall we holde for certaine? Seeing that one ſenſe belieth another, a picture ſeemeth to be held vp to the view, and the hands are folded together.</p>

                     </note> it is diſputed. Touching their Organes, that of the Sight in it compoſition and forme is admirable, and of a liuely and ſhining beautie, by reaſon of the great varietie and ſubtiltie of ſo many ſmall parts or pieces; and therefore it is ſayd that the eye is one of thoſe parts of the bodie which doe firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be formed, and the laſt that is finiſhed: and for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cauſe it is ſo delicate, and ſaid to be ſubiect to ſix ſcore maladies. Afterwards comes that of Speech, which helpeth the ſenſe of Hearing to many great aduantages. For the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the bodie, the Sight is moſt neceſſarie, and therefore doth more import a beaſt than Hearing. But for the ſpirit, the Hearing challengeth the vpper place. The Sight ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth well for the inuention of things, which by it haue almoſt all beene diſcouered, but it bringeth nothing to perfection. Againe, the Sight is not capable but of corporall things and particular, and that only of their cruſt or ſuperficiall part, it is the inſtrument of ignorant men and vnlearned, <hi>qui mouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad id quod adeſt, quodque praeſens eſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eare is a ſpirituall Senſe, it is the Intermedler, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">2 <hi>The prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minencie of hearing.</hi>
                     </note> of the vnderſtanding, the inſtrument of wiſe and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall men, capable not only of the ſecrets and inward parts of particular bodies, whereunto the Sight arriueth not, but alſo of the generall kindes, and of all ſpirituall things and diuine,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16995:41"/>
in which the Sight ſerueth rather to diſturbe than to helpe: and therefore we ſee not only many blinde, great and wiſe, but ſome alſo that are depriued of their ſight to become great Philoſophers: but of ſuch as are deafe we neuer heard of any. This is the way by which a man entreth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, and makes himſelfe maſter of the place, and imploieth his ſpirit in good or ill; witneſſe the wife of King <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> who was conteined in her dutie of chaſtitie by the ſound of a Harpe: and <hi>Dauid</hi> by the ſelfe ſame meane chaſed away the euill ſpirit from <hi>Saul,</hi> and reſtored him to health: and that skilfull player on the Flute, that ſweetned the voice of that great Oratour <hi>Gracchus.</hi> To be briefe, Science, Trueth, and Vertue haue no other entrance into the Soule, but by the Eare: Chriſtianitie it ſelfe teacheth that faith and ſaluation commeth by Hearing, and that the Sight doth rather hurt, than helpe thereunto; that faith is the beliefe of thoſe things that are not ſeene, which beliefe is acquired by hearing; and it calleth ſuch as are apprentices or nouices therein, Auditors, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, catechiſed. Let me adde this one word, that the Hearing giueth ſuccour and comfort in darkneſſe, and to ſuch as are aſleepe, that by the ſound they may be awaked, and ſo prouide for their preſeruation. For all theſe reaſons haue the wiſeſt ſo much commended Hearing, the pure and virgin gardian from all corruption, for the health of the inward man, as for the ſafetie of a Citie, the gates and walles are gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the enemie enter not.</p>
                  <p>Speech is peculiarly giuen vnto man, an excellent preſent and very neceſſary, in regard of him from whom it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">3 <hi>The force &amp; authoritie of Speech.</hi>
                     </note>: it is the interpreter and image of the ſoule, <hi>animi index, &amp; ſpeculum,</hi> the meſſenger of the heart, the gate by which all that is within iſſueth foorth, and committeth itſelfe to the view, all things come foorth of darkneſſe and ſecret corners into the light, and the ſpirit itſelfe makes it ſelfe viſible: and therefore an ancient Philoſopher ſaid once to a child, Speake that I may ſee thee, that is to ſay, the inſide of thee. As veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are knowen whether they be broken or whole, full or emptie, by the ſound, and mettals by the touch; ſo man by his ſpeech. Of all the viſible parts of the body which ſhew themſelues outward, that which is neereſt the heart is the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16995:42"/>
tongue by the root thereof; ſo that which comes neereſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our thought, is our ſpeech: for from the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. In regard of him which receiueth it, it is a powerfull maſter, an imperious commander, which entreth the fortreſſe, poſſeſſeth it ſelfe of the poſſeſſor, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him vp, animateth, exaſperateth, appeaſeth him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſad, merrie, imprinteth in him whatſoeuer paſſion, it handleth and feedeth the Soule of the hearer, and makes it pliable to euery ſenſe; it makes him bluſh, waxpale, laugh, crie, tremble for feare, mad with choler, to leape for ioy, and pierceth him thorow with paſſion. In regard of all, Speech is the hand of the ſpirit, wherewith, as the bodie by his, it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and giueth, it asketh counſell and ſuccour and giueth it. It is the great Intermedler and Huckſter: by it we trafficke, <hi>Merx a Mercurio</hi> peace is handled, affaires are managed, Sciences and the goods of the ſpirit are diſtributed, it is the band and cement of humane ſociety (ſo that it be vnderſtood: For, ſaith one, a man were better to be in the companie of a dog that he knoweth, than in the companie of a man whoſe language he knoweth not, <hi>vt externus alieno, non ſit hominis vice.)</hi> To be briefe, it is the inſtrument of whatſoeuer is good or ill, <hi>vita &amp; mors in manibus linguae:</hi> there is nothing better, <note place="margin">Of a good &amp; euill tongue.</note> nothing worſe than the tongue. The tongue of a wiſe man is the doore of a royall Cabinet, which is no ſooner opened, but incontinently a thouſand diuerſities preſent themſelues to the eie, euery one more beautifull than other, come from the <hi>Indies, Peru, Arabia;</hi> So a wiſe man produceth and rangeth them in good order, ſentences, and Aphoriſmes of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, ſimilitudes, examples, hiſtories, wiſe ſayings drawen from all the mines, and treaſuries olde and new, <hi>qui profert de theſauro ſuo noua &amp; vetera,</hi> which ſerue for a rule of good maners, of policie, and all the parts both of life and of death, which being applied in their times and to good purpoſe, bring with it great delight, great beautie and vtilitie, <hi>mala au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea in lectis argenteis, verba in tempore ſuo.</hi> The mouth of a wicked man is a ſtincking and contagious pit, a ſlanderous <note place="margin">Prouerb.</note> tongue murdereth the honour of another, it is a ſea and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of euils, woorſe than fetters, fire, poiſon, death, hell, <hi>Vniuerſitas iniquitatis, malum inquietum, venenum mortiferum,</hi>

                     </note> them, the one is nothing without the other, as alſo by nature in one and the ſame ſubiect, the one is not without the other. They are the two great gates, by which the ſoule doth trafficke, and hath her intelligence: By theſe two, the ſoules are powred the one into the other, as veſſels when the mouth of the one is applied to the enterie of the other: So that if theſe two gates be ſhut, as in thoſe that are deafe and dumbe, the ſpirit remaineth ſolitary and miſerable: Hearing is the gate to enter, by it the ſpirit receiueth all things from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and conceiueth as the female: Speech is the gate to goe foorth, by it the ſpirit acteth and bringeth foorth as the male. From the communication of theſe two, as from the ſtroke of two flints or irons together, there comes foorth the ſacred fire of truth, for they rubbing and poliſhing the one the other, they ſhake off their ruſt, and purifie and cleanſe themſelues, and all maner of knowledge comes to perfection. But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is the firſt, for there can nothing come foorth of the ſoule, but that which firſt entered, and therefore he that by nature is altogether deafe, is likewiſe dumbe. It is neceſſary that firſt the ſpirit be furniſhed with moueables and vtinſeles, by the ſenſe of Hearing, to the end it may by ſpeach diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them, ſo that the good and ill of the tongue and almoſt of the whole man, dependeth vpon the eare: He that heares well, ſpeakes well, and he that heares ill ſpeakes ill.

It muſt be compoſed of a ſubſtance and parts ſubtile, delicate and delicious, well ioyned and vnited without ſeparation, hauing foure little chambers or ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whereof three are in the middle, ranged in front, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterals betweene and behinde them, drawing towards the hinder part of the head; the fourth is alone, wherein is framed the preparation and coniunction of the vitall ſpirits, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be made animall and caried to the three ventricles before, wherein the reaſonable ſoule doth exerciſe it faculties, which are three, <hi>Vnderſtanding, Memory, Imagination,</hi> which doe not exerciſe their powers apart and diſtinctly, each one in each ventricle, as ſome haue commonly thought, but in common all three together in all three, and in euery of them, according to the maner of the outward ſenſes, which are double and haue two ventricles, in each of which the ſenſes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16995:43"/>
do wholly worke; whereby it comes to paſſe that hee that is wounded in one or two of theſe ventricles (as he that hath the palſie) ceaſeth not neuertheleſſe to exerciſe all the three; though more weakly, which he could not doe, if euery facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had his chamber or ventricle apart.</p>
                  <p>Some haue thought that the reaſonable <hi>Soule</hi> was not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall, <note place="margin">2 <hi>The reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Soule is organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi>
                     </note> that is, had no need of any corporall inſtrument to exerciſe it functions, thinking thereby the better to proue the immortality of the <hi>Soule:</hi> But not to enter into a labyrinth of diſcourſe, ocular and ordinarie experience diſproueth this opinion, and conuinceth the contrary; For it is well knowen that all men vnderſtand not, nor reaſon not alike and after one maner, but with great diuerſitie; yea one and the ſame man, may bee ſo changed, that at one time hee may reaſon better than at another; in one age, one eſtate and diſpoſition better than in another; ſuch a one better in health than in ſickneſſe, and another better in ſickeneſſe than in health; one and the ſame man, at one and the ſame time, may bee ſtrong in iudgement and weake in imagination. From whence can theſe diuerſities and alterations proceed, but from the change and alteration of the ſtate of the organ or inſtrument? From whence commeth it that drunkennes, the bite of a mad dog, a burning feuer, a blow on the head, a fume riſing from the ſtomacke, and other accidents peruert and turne topſie tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy the iudgement, intellectuall ſpirit, and all the wiſedome of Greece, yea conſtraine the <hi>Soule</hi> to diſlodge from the body? Theſe accidents being purely corporall cannot touch nor ariue to this high ſpirituall facultie of the reaſonable ſoule, but only to the organs or inſtruments, which being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the <hi>Soule</hi> cannot well and regularly act &amp; exerciſe it fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp; being violently inforced, is conſtraind either to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelfe, or depart from the body. Againe, that the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoule ſhould haue need of the ſeruice of the inſtruments, doth no way preiudice the immortality thereof: for God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vſe therof, &amp; accommodates his actions; &amp; as according to the diuerſitie of the aire, region and climate, God brings foorth men very diuers in ſpirit and naturall ſufficiency, as in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> men more ingenious, than in <hi>Muſcouy</hi> and <hi>Tartarie:</hi> So the ſpirit according to the diuerſitie of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16995:44"/>
diſpoſitions, and corporall inſtruments, diſcourſeth better or worſe. Now the inſtrument of the reaſonable <hi>Soule,</hi> is the braine, and the temperature thereof, whereof wee are to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>Temperature is the mixture and proportion of the foure firſt qualities, Hot, Cold, Dry, Moiſt, and it may be a fift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <note place="margin">3 <hi>Of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the braine, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
                     </note> which is the Harmonie of theſe foure. Now from the Temperature of the braine proceedeth all the ſtate and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the reaſonable <hi>Soule,</hi> but that which is the cauſe of great miſery vnto man, is, that the three faculties of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Soule,</hi> Vnderſtanding, Memorie, Imagination, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and exerciſe themſelues by contrarie temperatures. The temperature which ſerueth, and is proper to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is drie, whereby it comes to paſſe that they that <note place="margin">The vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding dry. Old age.</note> are ſtriken in yeeres, doe excell thoſe in their vnderſtanding that are yoong, becauſe in the braine as yeeres increaſe, ſo moiſture decreaſeth. So likewiſe melancholicke men, ſuch as are afflicted with want, and faſt much (for heauineſſe and faſting are driers) are wiſe and ingenious, <hi>Splendor ficcus, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſaptentiſſimus, vexatio dat intellectum:</hi> And beaſts that are of a drie temperature, as <hi>Ants, Bees, Elephants,</hi> are wiſe and ingenious, as they that are of a moiſt temperature are ſtupid and without ſpirit, as <hi>Swine:</hi> And the Southerne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Southernes.</note> of the world are drie, and moderate in the inward heat of the braine, by reaſon of their violent outward heat.</p>
                  <p>The temperature of the memorie is moiſt, whereof it is <note place="margin">2 <hi>The Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie moist. Infancie. Septentrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</hi>
                     </note> that infants haue better memorie than old men, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after that humidity that is gotten by ſleepe in the night, is more apt for memorie, which is likewiſe more vigorous in Northerne people. I heere vnderſtand a moiſture that is not wateriſh or diſtilling, wherein no impreſſion may bee made, but airie, viſcous, fat, and oilly, which eaſily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and ſtrongly retaineth, as it is ſeene in pictures wrought in oile.</p>
                  <p>The temperature of the imagination is hot, from whence it commeth that franticke men, and ſuch as are ſicke of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">3 <hi>The imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hot Youth.</hi>

                  <p>By this diuerſitie of temperatures it commeth to paſſe, <note place="margin">4 <hi>A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                     </note> that a man may be indifferent in all the three faculties, but not excellent; and that he that is excellent in any one of the three, is but weake in the reſt: that the temperatures of the memorie and vnderſtanding are very different and contrary, it is cleere, as drie and moiſt; as for the imagination, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th not to be ſo contrary from the others, becauſe heat is not incompatible with drouth and moiſture: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding experience ſheweth, that they that excell in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are ſicke in vnderſtanding and memorie, and held for fooles and madde men: but the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the great heat that ſerueth the imagination, conſumeth both the moiſture which ſerueth the memorie, and the ſubtilitie of the ſpirits and figures which ſhould be in that drineſſe which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the vnderſtanding, and ſo it is contrary, and deſtroyeth the other two.</p>
                  <p>By that which hath beene ſpoken it appeareth, that there <note place="margin">5 <hi>Three only tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                     </note> are but three principall temperatures, which ſerue and cauſe the reaſonable <hi>Soule</hi> to worke, and diſtinguiſh the ſpirits, that is to ſay, Heat, Drineſſe, Moiſture: Colde is not actiue, nor ſerueth to any purpoſe, but to hinder all the motions and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Soule: and when we finde in ſome authors, that Colde ſerueth the vnderſtanding, and that they that haue colde braines, as Melancholike men and the Southerne, are wiſe and ingenious; there Colde is taken not ſimply, but for a great moderation of heat: for there is nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the vnderſtanding and to wiſdome, than great heat, which contrariwiſe ſerueth the imagination. According to the three temperatures, there are three faculties of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soule; but as the temperatures, ſo the faculties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue diuers degrees, ſubdiuiſions and diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>There are three principall offices and differences of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <note place="margin">6 <hi>Subdiuiſion of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi>
                     </note> to Infer, to Diſtinguiſh, to Chaſe: theſe Sciences which appertaine to the vnderſtanding, are Schoole-Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Theorike of Phyſicke, Logicke, Philoſophie naturall and morall. There are three kindes of differences of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, eaſily to receiue and loſe the figures, eaſily to receiue and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16995:45"/>
hardly to loſe, hardly to receiue and eaſily to loſe. The Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the memory are Grammar, the Theorike of the Law, Poſitiue Diuinitie, Coſmographie, Arithmeticke. Of the imagination there are many differences, and a farre greater number than either of the memorie or vnderſtanding: to it doe properly appertaine, Inuentions, Merry-conceits and Ieſts, Tricks of ſubtilty, Fictions and Lies, Figures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, Neatneſſe, Elegancie, Gentilitie: becauſe to it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine, Poetrie, Eloquence, Muſicke, and generally what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer conſiſteth in Figure, Correſpondencie, Harmonie and Proportion.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it appeareth that the viuacitie, ſubtiltie, prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and that which the common ſort call wit, belongs to a <note place="margin">7 <hi>The proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and their order.</hi>
                     </note> hot imagination; ſoliditie, maturitie, veritie, to a drie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. The imagination is actiue and ſtirring, it is it that vndertaketh all, and ſets all the reſt a worke: the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is dull and cloudie: the memorie is purely paſſiue, and ſee how: The imagination firſt gathereth the kinds and figures of things both preſent, by the ſeruice of the fiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and abſent by the benefit of the common ſenſe: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it preſenteth them, if it will, to the vnderſtanding, which conſidereth of them, examineth, ruminateth, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth; afterwards it puts them to the ſafe cuſtodie of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, as a Scriuener to his booke, to the end he may againe, if need ſhall require, draw them forth (which men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>Reminiſcentia,</hi> Remembrance) or els, if it will, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to the memorie before it preſents them to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: for to recollect, repreſent to the vnderſtanding, commit vnto memorie, and to draw them foorth againe, are all works of the imagination; ſo that to it are referred, the common Senſe, the Fantaſie, the Remembrance, and they are not powers ſeparated from it, as ſome would haue it, to the end they may make more than three faculties of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soule.</p>
                  <p>The common ſort of people, who neuer iudge aright, doe <note place="margin">8 <hi>Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon in dignitie.</hi>
                     </note> more eſteeme of memorie, and delight more in it, than in the other two, becauſe they haue much vſe of counting, and it makes greater ſhew and ſtirre in the world; and they thinke, that to haue a good memorie is to be wiſe, eſteeming more of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16995:45"/>
Science than of Wiſdome; but yet of the three it is the leaſt, being ſuch as may be euen in fooles themſelues: for very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is an excellent memorie ioyned with vnderſtanding and wiſdome, becauſe their temperatures are contrary. From this error of the common people comes that ill courſe, which euery where we ſee, in the inſtruction of our youth, who are alwayes taught to learne by heart (ſo they terme it) that which they reade in their books, to the end they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See of this lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> be able to repeat it; and ſo they fill and charge the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie with the good of another, and take no care to awaken and direct the vnderſtanding, and to forme the iudgement, whereby he may be made able to make vſe of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per good, and his naturall faculties, which may make him wiſe and apt to all things: ſo that wee ſee that the greateſt ſcholars, that haue all <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in their heads, are the verieſt ſots, and moſt vnskilfull in publike affaires, and the world is gouerned by thoſe that know nothing. It is the opinion of all the wiſeſt, that the vnderſtanding is the firſt, the moſt excellent and principall piece of harneſſe: if that ſpeed well, all goes well, and a man is wiſe; and contrariwiſe, if that miſcarrie, all goes acroſſe. In the ſecond place is the imagination: the memorie is the laſt.</p>
                  <p>All theſe differences, it may be, will be better vnderſtood <note place="margin">9 <hi>An image of the three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soule.</hi>
                     </note> by this ſimilitude, which is a picture or imitation of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soule. In euery Court of iuſtice there are three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or degrees; the higheſt are the Iudges, with whom there is little ſtirre but great action, for without the mouing or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of themſelues, they iudge, decide, order, determine of all things: this is the image of iudgement the higheſt part of the Soule. The ſecond are the Aduocates and Procters, in whom there is great ſtirre and much adoe, without action, for it lies not in their power to diſpatch or order any thing, only they hatch and prepare the buſineſſe: this is the picture of the imagination, an vndertaking, vnquiet facultie, which neuer reſteth, no not in the profoundeſt ſleepe; and it makes a noiſe in the braine, like a pot that ſeetheth, but neuer ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. The third and laſt degree is the Scribe or Regiſter of the Court, with whom there is no ſtirre nor action, but pure
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16995:46"/>
paſſion, as the Gardian or Cuſtos of all things: and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth the memorie.</p>
                  <p>The action of the reaſonable Soule is the knowledge and <note place="margin">10 <hi>The action of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Soule.</hi>
                     </note> vnderſtanding of all things: The Spirit of man is capable of vnderſtanding all things, viſible, muiſible, vniuerſall, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſenſible, inſenſible, <hi>intellectus eſt omnia:</hi> but it ſelfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it vnderſtands not at all, as ſome are of opinion (witneſſe ſo great and almoſt infinite diuerſitie of opinions thereof, as wee haue ſeene before by thoſe doubts and obiections that haue alwayes croſſed it) or very darkly, imperfectly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, by reflexion of the knowledge of things vpon themſelues, by which it perceiueth and knoweth that it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, and hath power and facultie to vnderſtand: this is the maner whereby the ſpirit knowes it ſelfe. The firſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Spirit, GOD, doth firſt know himſelfe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in himſelfe all things; the latter Spirit, Man, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, all other things rather than himſelfe, and is in them as the eye in a glaſſe: how then ſhould it act or worke in it ſelfe without meane, and by a ſtrait line?</p>
                  <p>But the queſtion is concerning the meane whereby it <note place="margin">11 <hi>The meane whereby it worketh.</hi>
                     </note> knoweth and vnderſtandeth things. The common receiued opinion that came from <hi>Aristotle</hi> himſelfe is, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> knoweth and vnderſtandeth by the helpe and ſeruice of the Senſes; that it is of it ſelfe as a white emptie paper, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commeth to the vnderſtanding, which doth not firſt paſſe the Senſes, <hi>Nil est in intellectu, quod non fuerit prius in ſenſu.</hi> But this opinion is falſe: firſt becauſe (as all the wiſeſt haue affirmed, and hath beene before touched) the ſeeds of all ſciences and vertues are naturally diſperſed and inſinuated into our ſpirits, ſo that they may be rich and merry with their owne: and though they want that tillage that is fit, yet then they ſufficiently abound. Beſides it is iniurious both to God and Nature: for this were to make the ſtate of the reaſonable Soule worſe than that of other things, than that of the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue and ſenſitiue, which of themſelues are wiſe enough to exerciſe their functions, as hath beene ſayd; for beaſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſcipline of the ſenſes know many things, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſals by the particulars, by the fight of one man they know
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16995:46"/>
all men, and are taught to auoid the danger of things hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to ſeeke and to follow after that which is fit for them and their little ones. And it were a thing ſhamefull and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that this ſo high and ſo diuine a facultie ſhould begge it good of things ſo vile and corruptible as the ſenſes, which do apprehend only the ſimple accidents, and not the formes, natures, eſſence of things, much leſſe things vniuerſall, the ſecrets of Nature, and all things inſenſible. Againe, if the Soule were made wiſe, by the aide of the ſenſes, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they that haue their ſenſes moſt perfect and quicke, ſhould be moſt wittie, moſt wiſe; whereas many times we ſee the cleane contrary, that their ſpirits are more dull, and more vnapt, and that many haue of purpoſe depriued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the vſe of ſome of them, to the end the ſoule might better, and more freely execute it owne affaires. And if any man ſhall obiect, that the ſoule being wiſe by nature, and without the helpe of the ſenſes, all men muſt neceſſarilie be wiſe, and alwayes vnderſtand and reaſon alike: which being ſo, how commeth it about that there are ſo many dull pates in the world, and that they that vnderſtand, exerciſe their functions more weakly at one time than at another, the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue ſoule farre more ſtrongly in youth, the reaſonable ſoule more weakly than in olde age, and in a certaine ſtate of health or ſickneſſe than at another time? I may anſwer, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is not good: for as touching the firſt, that is, That all men muſt be wiſe: I ſay that the facultie and vertue of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not giuen alike vnto all, but with great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and therefore it is a ſaying as ancient as honorable, euen of the wiſeſt, that the acting vnderſtanding was giuen but to few; and this inequalitie proueth that Science comes not of ſenſe: for as it hath been ſayd, they that excell others in their ſenſes, come ſhort of others in their vnderſtanding and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Touching the ſecond, The reaſon why a man doth not exerciſe his functions alwayes after one maner, is becauſe the inſtruments whereby the Soule muſt neceſſarily worke, can not alwayes be diſpoſed as they ſhould; and if they be for ſome ſpeciall kinde of faculties or functions, yet not for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The temperature of the braine, by which the Soule worketh, is diuers and changeable; being hot and moiſt, in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16995:47"/>
youth it is good for the vegetatiue, naught for the reaſonable; and contrarily, being colde and drie, in olde age it is good for the reaſonable, ill for the vegetatiue. The braine by a hot and burning maladie being heated and purified, is more fit for inuention and diuination, vnfit for maturitie and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of iudgement and wiſdome. By that which hath beene ſpoken let no man thinke, that I affirme that the ſpirit hath no ſeruice from the ſenſes, which I confeſſe to be great eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the beginning, in the diſcouerie and inuention of things: but I ſay in the defence of the honor of the ſpirit, that it is falſe that it dependeth vpon the ſenſes, and that we can not know any thing, vnderſtand, reaſon, diſcourſe without the ſenſe: for contrariwiſe all knowledge comes from it, and the ſenſes can do nothing without it.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit in this vnderſtanding facultie proceedeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> and by order: It vnderſtandeth at the firſt inſtant, ſimply and directly a Lion to be a Lion, afterwards by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents that hee is ſtrong: for ſeeing the effects of his ſtrength, it concludeth that he is ſtrong. By diuiſion or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, it vnderſtandeth a Hare to be fearefull; for ſeeing it flie and hide it ſelfe, it concludeth that a Hare is not ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fearefull. It knoweth ſome by ſimilitude, others by a collection of many things together.</p>

One ſayd of a King of <hi>Sparta</hi> that was gentle and debonaire, Hee is a good man euen to the wicked. How ſhould hee be good vnto the wicked, ſaith another, if he be not wicked with the wicked.

Man knoweth not, vnderſtandeth not any thing aright, in puritie and in trueth as he ought: appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances doe alwayes compaſſe him on euery ſide, which are as well in thoſe things that are falſe as true. We are borne to ſearch the truth, but to poſſeſſe it, belongeth to a higher and greater power. Truth is not his that thruſts himſelfe into it, but his that runnes the faireſt courſe towards the marke. When it falles out that he hits vpon a trueth, it is by chance and hazzard, he knowes not how to holde it, to poſſeſſe it, to diſtinguiſh it from a lie. Errours are receiued into our ſoule, by the ſelfe ſame way and conduit that the truth is; the ſpirit hath no meanes either to diſtinguiſh or to chuſe: and as well may he play the ſot, that telles a trueth as a lie. The meanes that it vſeth for the diſcouerie of the truth, are reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, both of them very weake, vncertaine, diuers, waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The greateſt argument of truth, is the generall conſent of the world: now the number of fooles doth farre exceed the number of the wiſe, and therefore how ſhould that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent be agreed vpon, but by corruption and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe giuen without iudgement and knowledge of the cauſe, and by the imitation of ſome one that firſt began the dance.</p>

whoſe guide and conduct a man may truſt, and in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of whoſe iudgements a man may wade without temeritie, beyond the common opinion. It is a miracle to finde a great and liuely ſpirit, well ruled and gouerned: it is a dangerous ſword which a man knowes not well how to guide; for from whence come all thoſe diſorders, reuolts, hereſies and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the world, but for this? <hi>Magni errores non niſi ex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnis ingenijs: nihil ſapientiae o dioſius acumine nimio.</hi> Doubtleſſe that man liues a better time, and a longer life, is more happie and farre more fit for the gouernment of a Common-wealth, ſayth <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that hath an indifferent ſpirit, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beneath a mediocritie, than he that hath a ſpirit ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated and tranſcendent, that it ſerues not for any thing but the torment of himſelfe and others.

Wiſdome and follie are neere neighbors; there is but a halfe turne betwixt the one and the other; which we may eaſily ſee in the actions of madde men. Philoſophie teacheth, that Melancholy is proper to them both. Whereof is framed the fineſt follie, but of the fineſt wit? And therefore, ſayth <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there is no great ſpirit without ſome mixture of follie. And <hi>Plato</hi> telleth vs, that in vaine a temperate and ſound ſpirit knocketh at the doore of Poetrie. And in this ſenſe it is, that the wiſeſt and beſt Poets doe loue ſometimes to play the foole, and to leape out of the hindges. <hi>Inſanire iucundum eſt, dulce deſipere in loco: non poteſt grande &amp; ſublime quidquam niſi mota mens, &amp; quamdiu apud ſe est.</hi>

From hence it is that the beautifull and generous actions of another man are obſcured by vile and baſe miſconſtructions, that vaine and wicked cauſes &amp; occaſions are feined. This is a great vice and a proofe of a malignant nature and ſicke iudgement, in which there is neither great ſubtiltie nor ſufficiencie, but malice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. This proceedeth either from the enuy they beare to the glorie of another man, or becauſe they iudge of others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to themſelues, or becauſe they haue their taſte alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and their ſight ſo troubled, that they cannot diſcerne the cleere ſplendour of vertue in it natiue purity. From this ſelfe ſame cauſe and ſource it commeth, that we make the vertues and vices of another man to preuaile ſo much, and extend them farther than we ought, that from particularities wee draw conſequents and generall concluſions: if he be a friend, all ſits well about him, his vices ſhall be vertues: if he be an enemie or of a contrary faction, there is nothing good in him: inſomuch that we ſhame our owne iudgement, to ſmooth vp our owne paſſions. But this reſts not heere, but goeth yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the greateſt part of thoſe impieties, hereſies, errours in our faith and religion, if we looke well into it, is ſprung from our wicked and corrupt willes, from a violent and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 2.

                  <p>There are other defects of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which are more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnto it, and in it. The greateſt and the root of all the reſt <note place="margin">18 <hi>Naturall.</hi>

It is truly ſaid, that the beſt and happieſt diſtribution that God euer made, is of iudgement, becauſe euery man is content with his owne, and thinkes he hath inough. Now this malady proceedeth from the ignorance of our ſelues.

                  <p>THe imagination is a thing very ſtrong and powerfull, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is it that makes all the ſtirre, all the clarter, yea the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the world proceeds from it (as we haue ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is either the onely, or at leaſt the moſt actiue and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">The effects of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination maruellous.</note> facultie of the Soule). The effects thereof are maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſtrange: it worketh not only in it owne proper bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and Soule, but in that of another man, yea it produceth contrary effects: it makes a man bluſh, wax pale, tremble, dote, to wauer; theſe are the leaſt and the beſt: it takes away the power and vſe of the ingendring parts, yea when there is moſt need of them, and is the cauſe why men are more ſharpe and auſtere, not only towards themſelues but others, witneſſe thoſe ties and bands whereof the world is full, which are for the moſt part impreſſions of the apprehenſion and of feare. And contrariwiſe, without endeuor, without obiect, &amp; euen in ſleepe it ſatisfieth the amorous deſires, yea changeth the ſex, witneſſe <hi>Lucius Coſſitius,</hi> whom <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth to haue ſeene to be changed from a woman to a man, the day of his mariag; and diuers the like: it marketh ſometimes ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, yea it killeth and makes abortiue the fruit within the wombe; it takes away a mans ſpeech, and giues it to him that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16995:54"/>
neuer had it, as to the ſonne of <hi>Croeſus:</hi> it taketh away moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſenſe, reſpiration. Thus we ſee how it worketh in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Touching the Soule: it makes a man to loſe his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, his knowledge, iudgement; it turnes him foole and mad-man, witneſſe <hi>Gallus Vibius,</hi> who hauing ouer-bent his ſpirits in comprehending the eſſence and motions offollie, ſo diſlodged and diſiointed his owne iudgement, that he could neuer ſettle it againe: it inſpireth a man with the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things ſecret and to come, and cauſeth thoſe inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, praedictions, and maruellous inuentions, yea it rauiſheth with extaſies: it killeth not ſeemingly but in good earneſt, witneſſe that man whoſe eyes being couered to receiue his death, and vncouered againe to the end he might reade his pardon, was found ſtarke dead vpon the ſcaffold. To be briefe, from hence ſpring the greateſt part of thoſe things which the common ſort of people call miracles, viſions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments. It is not alwayes the diuell, or a familiar ſpirit, as now adaies the ignorant people thinke, when they can not finde the reaſon of that they ſee; nor alwayes the ſpirit of God (for theſe ſupernaturall motions we ſpeake not of heere) but for the moſt part it is the effect of the imagination, or long of the agent who ſayth &amp; doth ſuch things; or of the patient and ſpectator, who thinks he ſeeth that he ſeeth not. It is an excellent thing and neceſſary in ſuch a caſe, to know wiſely how to diſcerne the reaſon thereof, whether it be naturall or ſupernaturall, falſe or true, <hi>Diſcretio ſpirituum,</hi> and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate our iudgements, as the moſt part of the common people do by the want thereof.</p>
                  <p>In this part and facultie of the ſoule doth opinion lodge, which is a vaine, light, crude and imperfect iudgement of things drawen from the outward ſenſes, and common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſetling and holding it ſelfe to be good in the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and neuer arriuing to the vnderſtanding, there to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſifted, and laboured; and to be made reaſon, which is a true, perfect and ſolide iudgement of things: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vncertaine, inconſtant, fleeting, deceitfull, a very ill and dangerous guide, which makes head againſt reaſon, whereof it is a ſhadow and image, though vaine and vntrue. It is the mother of all miſchiefs, confuſions, diſorders: from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16995:55"/>
it ſpring all paſſions, all troubles. It is the guide of fooles, ſots, the vulgar ſort, as reaſon of the wiſe and dexterious.</p>
                  <p>It is not the trueth and nature of things which doth thus <note place="margin">3 <hi>The world is lead by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                     </note> ſtirre and moleſt our ſoules, it is opinion, according to that ancient ſaying; Men are tormented by the opinions that they haue of things, not by the things themſelues. <hi>Opinione ſaepiùs, quàm re laboramus: plura ſunt quae nos tenent, quàm quae pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munt.</hi> The veritie and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of things entreth not into vs, nor lodgeth neere vs of it ſelfe, by it owne proper ſtrength and authoritie: for were it ſo, all things ſhould be receiued of all, all alike, and after the ſame faſhion; all ſhould be of like credit, and truth it ſelfe, which is neuer but one and vniforme, ſhould be embraced thorowout the whole world. Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as there is ſo great a varietie, yea contrarietie of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the world, and there is not any thing concerning which all doe generally accord, no not the wiſeſt and beſt borne and bred; it giueth vs to vnderſtand, that things enter into vs by compoſition, yeelding themſelues to our mercie and deuotion, and lodging themſelues neere vnto vs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our pleaſure, and humour and temper of our ſoules. That which I beleeue, I can not make my companion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; but, which is more, what I doe firmly beleeue to day, I can not aſſure my ſelfe that I ſhall beleeue to morrow: yea it is certaine that at another time I ſhall iudge quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

                  <p>Almoſt all the opinions that wee haue, wee haue not but from authoritie: we beleeue, we iudge, we worke, we liue, we die and all vpon credit, euen as the publike vſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome teacheth vs; and we doe well therein: for we are too weake to iudge and chuſe of our ſelues; no the wiſe do it not, <note place="margin">

Doubtfull, if not errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> memorie, imagination may be taken from vs, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, troubled with a thouſand accidents: not the will.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this is that, that keepeth a man intire, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth him much: for he that hath giuen his will, is no more his owne man, neither hath he any thing of his owne.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this is it whereby we are made and called good or wicked, which giueth vs the temper and the tincture.</p>
                     <p>As of all the goods that are in man, vertue or honeſtie is the firſt and principall, and which doth farre excell know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, dexteritie; ſo wee can not but confeſſe, that the will where vertue and goodneſſe lodgeth, is of all others the moſt excellent: and to ſay the trueth, a man is neither good nor wicked, honeſt nor diſhoneſt, becauſe he vnderſtandeth and knoweth thoſe things that are good, and faire, and honeſt, or wicked and diſhoneſt; but becauſe he loueth them, and hath deſire and will towards them. The vnderſtanding hath other preheminences: for it is vnto the will as the husband to the wife, the guide and light vnto the traueller, but in this it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth place vnto the will.</p>
                     <p>The true difference betwixt theſe faculties is, in that by the vnderſtanding things enter into the ſoule, and it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them (as thoſe words, to apprehend, conceiue, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, the true offices thereof doe import) but they enter not entire and ſuch as they are, but according to the proportion and capacitie of the vnderſtanding: whereby the greateſt and the higheſt do recoile and diuide themſelues after a ſort, by this entrance, as the Ocean entreth not altogether into the <hi>Mediterrane</hi> ſea, but according to the proportion of the mouth of the Strait of <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> By the will, on the other ſide, the ſoule goeth foorth of it ſelfe, and lodgeth and liueth elſwhere in the thing beloued, into which it transformeth it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16995:56"/>
ſelfe; and therefore beareth the name, the title, the liuerie, being called vertuous, vitious, ſpirituall, carnall: whereby it followeth, that the will is enobled by louing thoſe things that are high and woorthy of loue; is vilified, by giuing it ſelfe to thoſe things that are baſe and vnwoorthy; as a wife honoureth or diſhonoureth her ſelfe by that husband that ſhe hath taken.</p>
                     <p>Experience teacheth vs, that three things do ſharpen our will, Difficultie, Raritie, and Abſence, or feare to loſe the thing; as the three contrary dull it, Facilitie, Abundance, or Satietie, and dayly preſence or aſſured fruition. The three former giue price and credit to things, the three latter ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der contempt. Our will is ſharpened by oppoſition, it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it ſelfe againſt deniall. On the other ſide, our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite contemneth and letteth paſſe that which it hath in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and runnes after that which it hath not, <hi>permiſſum fit vile nefas: quod licet ingratum eſt, quod non licet acrius vrit:</hi> yea it is ſeene in all ſorts of pleaſures, <hi>omnium rerum voluptas ipſo quo debet fugare periculo creſit:</hi> inſomuch that the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, the defect and the abundance, the deſire and the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition do put vs to like paine.

                     <p>PAſſion is a violent motion of the <hi>Soule</hi> in the ſenſitiue <note place="margin">1 <hi>The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

                     <p>But it is neceſſarie that we know how theſe motions are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> made, how they ariſe and kindle themſelues in vs; which a man may repreſent by diuers meanes and compariſons: firſt in regard of their agitation and violence. The Soule which <note place="margin">1. <hi>Their agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                        </note> is but one in the bodie hath many and diuers powers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuers veſſels wherein it is retained, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereof it maketh vſe, and the obiects which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto it. Now when the parts wherein it is incloſed, doe not retaine and occupie it, but according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their capacitie, and as farre forth as it is neceſſarie for their true vſe; the effects thereof are ſweet, benigne, and well gouerned: but when contrariwiſe the parts thereof haue more motion and heat than is needfull for them, they change and become hurtfull; no otherwiſe than the beames of the Sunne, which wandering according to their naturall libertie, do ſweetly and pleaſingly warme; if they be recollected and gathered into the concauities of a burning glaſſe, they burne and conſume that they were woont to nouriſh and quicken. Againe, they haue diuers degrees in their force of agitation; and as they haue more or leſſe, ſo they are diſtinguiſhed; the indifferent ſuffer themſelues to be taſted and digeſted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing themſelues by words and teares; the greater and more violent aſtoniſh the ſoule, oppreſſe it, and hinder the libertie of it actions. <hi>Curae leues loquuntur, ingentes ſtupent.</hi>

                        </note> and the ſtate of the ſoule to a ſtate royall, wherein the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16995:57"/>
Soueraigne for the gouernment of ſo many people hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-magiſtrates, vnto whom for the exerciſe of their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he giueth lawes and ordinances, reſeruing vnto himſelfe the cenſuring of the greateſt and moſt important occurrents. Vpon this order dependeth the peace and proſperitie of the ſtate: and contrariwiſe, if the magiſtrates, which are as the middle ſort betwixt the Prince and the people, ſhall ſuffer themſelues either to be deceiued by facilitie, or corrupted by fauour; and without reſpect either of their Soueraigne, or the lawes by him eſtabliſhed, ſhall vſe their owne authoritie in the execution of their affaires, they fill all with diſorder and confuſion. Euen ſo in man, the vnderſtanding is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, which hath vnder it a power eſtimatiue, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatiue, as a magiſtrate, both to take knowledge, and to iudge by the report of the ſenſes of all things that ſhalbe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and to moue our affections, for the better execution of the iudgements thereof: for the conduct and direction whereof in the exerciſe of it charge, the law and light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was giuen vnto it: and moreouer, as a helpe in all doubts, it may haue recourſe vnto the counſell of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and ſoueraigne, the vnderſtanding. And thus you ſee the order of the happie ſtate heereof: but the vnhappie is when this power which is vnder the vnderſtanding, and aboue the ſenſes, whereunto the firſt iudgement of things appertaineth, ſuffereth it ſelfe for the moſt part to be corrupted and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whereby it iudgeth wrongfully and raſhly, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards manageth and mooueth our affections to ill purpoſe, and filleth vs with much trouble and vnquietneſſe. That which moleſteth and corrupteth this power, are firſt the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which comprehend not the true and inward nature of things, but only the face and outward forme, carrying vnto the ſoule the image of things, with ſome fauourable commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and as it were a fore-iudgement and preiudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their qualities, according as they finde them pleaſing and agreeable to their particular, and not profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the vniuerſall good of man: and ſecondly, the mixture of the falſe and indifferent iudgement of the vulgar ſort. From theſe two falſe aduiſements and reports of the <note place="margin">Opinion.</note> Senſes, and vulgar ſort, is formed in the ſoule an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16995:57"/>
opinion, which we conceiue of things, whether good or ill, profitable or hurtfull, to be followed or eſchewed; which doubtleſſe is a very dangerous guide, and raſh miſtreſſe: for it is no ſooner conceiued, but preſently without the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any thing to diſcourſe and vnderſtanding, it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelfe of our imagination, and as within a Citidell, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fort againſt right and reaſon, afterwards it deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into our hearts, and remooueth our affections, with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motiues of hope, feare, heauineſſe, pleaſure. To be briefe, it makes all the fooles, and the ſeditions of the ſoule, which are the paſſions, to ariſe.</p>
                     <p>I will likewiſe declare the ſame thing, by another ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of military policy. The <hi>Senſes</hi> are the <hi>Sentinels</hi> of the <hi>Soule,</hi> watching for the preſeruation thereof, and meſſengers or ſcouts to ſerue as miniſters and inſtruments to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſoueraigne part of the <hi>Soule.</hi> And for the better performance heereof, they haue receiued power to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the things, to draw the formes, and to embrace or reiect them, according as they ſhall ſeeme agreeable or odious vnto their nature. Now in exerciſing their charge, they muſt bee content to know, and to giue knowledge to others of what doth paſſe, not enterpriſing to remoue greater forces, leſt by that meanes they put all into an <hi>alarum</hi> and confuſion. As in an army, the <hi>Sentinels</hi> many times by want of the watch word, and knowledge of the deſſeigne and purpoſe of the Captaine that commandeth, may be deceiued, and take for their ſuccor their enemies diſguiſed which come vnto them, or for enemies thoſe that come to ſuccour: So the Senſes by not apprehending whatſoeuer is reaſon, are many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by an appearance, and take that for a friend which is our enemy. And when vpon this thought and reſolution, not attending the commandement of reaſon, they go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the power concupiſcible and iraſcible, they raiſe a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and tumult in our ſoules, during which time, reaſon is not heard, nor the vnderſtanding obeied. <note place="margin">4 <hi>The distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Paſſions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their obiect and ſubiect.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>By this time we ſee their regiments, their rankes, their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall kindes and ſpeciall. Euery paſſion is moued by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and opinion, either of what is good, or what is ill. If by that which is good, and that the ſoule do ſimply ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16995:58"/>
of it, this motion is called Loue. If it be preſent and ſuch whereof the <hi>Soule</hi> in it ſelfe taketh comfort, it is called plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <note place="margin">Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible ſix.</note> and ioy: if it be to come, it is called deſire: if by that which is euill, it is hate: if it be preſent in our ſelues, it is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe: if in another, it is pity: if it bee to come, it is feare. And theſe which ariſe in vs by the obiect of an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant euill, which we abhor and flie from, deſcend more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into our hearts, and ariſe with greater difficulty. And this is the firſt band of that ſeditious rowt, which trouble the reſt and quiet of our ſoules, that is, in the concupiſcible part, the effects whereof notwithſtanding they are very dangerous, yet they are not ſo violent as thoſe that follow them: for theſe firſt motions formed in this parte, by the obiect which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth it ſelfe, do paſſe incontinently into the iraſcible part, that is to ſay, into that compaſſe where the ſoule ſeeketh the meanes to obtaine or auoid that which ſeemeth vnto it either good or ill. And then euen as a wheele that is alreadie in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, receiuing another motion by a new force, turnes with farre greater ſpeede; ſo the <hi>Soule</hi> being already mooued by the firſt apprehenſion, ioining a ſecond endeuour to the firſt, carrieth it ſelfe with farre more violence than before, and is ſtirred vp by paſſions more puiſant and difficult to be tamed; inaſmuch as they are doubled, and now coupled to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, vniting themſelues, and backing the one the other by a <note place="margin">In the iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible fiue.</note> mutuall conſent: for the firſt paſſions, which are formed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an obiect of an appearing good, entring into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meanes whereby to obtain it, ſtirre vp in vs either hope or deſpaire. They that are formed vpon an obiect of an euill to come, ſtirre vp in vs either feare, or the contrarie, which is audacitie; of a preſent euill, choler and courage: which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſtrangely violent, and wholly peruert the reaſon which they finde already ſhaken. Thus you ſee the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall windes from whence ariſe the tempeſts of our <hi>Soule,</hi> and the pit whereout they riſe is nothing elſe but the opinion (which commonly is falſe, wandring, vncertaine, contrary to nature, veritie, reaſon, certaintie) that a man hath, that the things that preſent themſelues vnto vs, are either good or ill: for hauing conceiued them to be ſuch, we either folow them, or with violence flie from them. And theſe are our paſſions.</p>

                     </note> gluttonous and exceſſiue deſire of greatneſſe) is a ſweet and pleaſing paſſion, which diſtilleth eaſily into generous ſpirits, but is not without paine got forth againe. We thinke it is our dueties to embrace what is good, and amongſt thoſe good things, we account of honour more than them all. See heere the reaſon, why with all our ſtrength wee run vnto it. An ambitious man will alwayes be the firſt, he neuer lookes backward, but ſtill forward to thoſe that are before him: and it is a greater griefe vnto him to ſuffer one to go beyond him, than it is pleaſure vnto him, to leaue a thouſand behind him. <hi>Habet hoc vitium omnis ambitio, non reſpicit.</hi> It is twofolde: <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> the one of glory and honor, the other of greatneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: that is profitable to the world, and in ſome ſenſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as ſhall be proued: this pernitious.</p>
                  <p>The ſeed and root of ambition is naturall in vs. There is a <note place="margin">2 <hi>It is natural.</hi>
                     </note> prouerbe that ſaith, That Nature is content with a little: and another quite contrarie, That Nature is neuer ſatisfied, neuer content: but it ſtill deſireth, hath a will to mount higher, and to enrich it ſelfe, and it goeth not a ſlow pace neither, but with a looſe bridle it runneth headlong to greatneſſe and glorie. <hi>Natura noſtra imperij eſt auida, &amp; ad implendum cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem praeceps.</hi> And with ſuch force and violence doe ſome men runne, that they breake their owne necks, as many great men haue done, euen at the dawning as it were, and vpon the point of entrance and full fruition of that greatneſſe which hath coſt them ſo deare. It is a naturall and very powerfull paſſion, and in the end is the laſt that leaueth vs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one calleth it, The ſhirt of the ſoule: becauſe it is the laſt vice it putteth off. <hi>Etiam ſapientibus cupido gloriae nouiſſima</hi>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:16995:59"/>
that is, ſo is it the moſt noble and haughty; the force and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance <note place="margin">The force and primacy thereof.</note> thereof is ſhewed, in that it maſtereth and ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all other things, euen the ſtrongeſt of the world, yea all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſions and affections, euen loue it ſelfe, which ſeemeth neuertheleſſe to contend with it for the Primacy. As we may ſee in all the great men of the world, <hi>Alexander, Scipio, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> and many other, who haue couragiouſly refuſed to touch the moſt beautifull damoſels, that were in their power, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning neuertheleſſe with ambition; yea that victory they had ouer loue, ſerued their ambition, eſpecially in <hi>Caeſar:</hi> For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was there a man more giuen to amorous delights, euen of all ſexes, and all ſorts of people, witneſſe ſo many exploits both at <hi>Rome</hi> and in ſtrange countries, nor more carefull and curious in adorning his perſon; yet ambition did alwaies ſo carry him, that for his amorous pleaſures hee neuer loſt an houre of time which he might employ to the inlargement of his greatneſſe, for ambition had the ſoueraigne place in him, and did fully poſſeſſe him. We ſee on the other ſide that in <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> and others, the force of loue hath made them to forget the care and conduct of their affaires. But yet both of them being weighed in equall ballance, ambition carieth away the price. They that hold that loue is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſay that both the ſoule and the body, the whole man, is poſſeſſed by it, yea that health it ſelfe dependeth thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But contrariwiſe it ſeemeth that ambition is the ſtronger, becauſe it is altogether ſpirituall. And in as much as loue poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the body, it is therefore the more weake, becauſe it is ſubiect to ſaciety, and therefore capable of remedies, both corporall, naturall and ſtrange, as experience ſheweth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who by diuers meanes haue alaied, yea quite extinguiſhed the force and fury of this paſſion; but ambition is not capable of ſaciety, yea it is ſharpned by the fruition of that it deſireth, and there is no way to extinguiſh it, being altogether in the ſoule it ſelfe and in the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>It doth likewiſe vanquiſh loue and robbeth it, not onlie of it health and tranquillity (for glory &amp; tranquillity are things <note place="margin">4 <hi>The care of life.</hi>
                     </note> that cannot lodge together) but alſo of it owne proper life, as <hi>Agrippina</hi> the mother of <hi>Nero</hi> doth plainly proue, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and conſulting with others to make hir ſonne Emperour,

                  </p>
                  <p>It likewiſe trampleth vnder foote and contemneth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence <note place="margin">6 <hi>Religion.</hi>

Tim. 6.</note> bee puffed vp with this paſſion and affection, make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and wander from the faith, piercing themſelues tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with many ſorowes.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, it offereth violence euen to the lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe. This hath beene the cauſe of ſo many murders <note place="margin">7 <hi>It enforceth Nature.</hi>
                     </note> of parents, infants, brothers; witneſſe <hi>Abſalon, Abimelech, Athalias, Romulus, Sei</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who killed both his father and brother, <hi>Soliman</hi> the Great Turke his two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So that nothing is able to reſiſt the force of ambition, it beats all to the ground, ſo high and haughtie is it. It lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth only in great mindes, euen in the Angels themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Ambition is not the vice or paſſion of baſe companions, <note place="margin">8 <hi>It is a lofty paſſion.</hi>
                     </note> nor of common or ſmall attempts, and dayly enterpriſes: Renowne and glorie doth not proſtitute it ſelfe to ſo baſe a price; it purſueth not thoſe things that are ſimply and ſolely good and profitable, but thoſe that are rare, high, difficult, ſtrange and vnuſuall. That great thirſt after honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that caſts downe a man, and makes him a begger, and to ducke and ſtoop to all ſorts of people, &amp; by all means, yea the moſt abiect, at what baſe price ſoeuer, is vile and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable: it is a ſhame and diſhonour ſo to be honoured. A man muſt not be greedie of greater glorie than he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16995:60"/>
of; and to ſwell and to be puffed vp for euery good and profitable action, is to ſhew his taile while hee lifts vp his head.</p>
                  <p>Ambition hath many and diuers waies, and is practiſed by diuers meanes: there is one way ſtrait and open, ſuch as <note place="margin">9 <hi>It hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers waies.</hi>

                     <hi>Alexander, Caeſar, Themiſtocles</hi> tooke; there is another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and hidden, which many philoſophers and profeſſors of pietie haue taken, who goe forwards by going backward, goe before others by going behind them, not vnlike to wier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawers, who draw and goe backward; they would faine be glorious by contemning glory. And to ſay the trueth, there is greater glory in refuſing and trampling glory vnder foot, than in the deſire and fruition thereof, as <hi>Plato</hi> told <hi>Diogenes.</hi> And ambition is neuer better caried, better guided, than by wandering, and vnuſuall wayes.</p>

Serpents loſe not their venim, though they be frozen with colde, nor an ambitious man his vices though with a colde diſſimulation hee couer them: for when he is arriued to that pitch of height that he deſired, he then makes them feele what he is. And though ambition quit a man of all other vices, yet it neuer taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way it ſelfe. An ambitious man putteth himſelfe foorth to great and honourable actions, the profit whereof returneth to the publike good, but yet he is neuer the better man that performes them, becauſe they are not the actions of vertue but of paſſion, no though that ſaying be often in his mouth, We are not borne for our ſelues but the weale publike. The meanes men vſe to mount themſelues to high eſtate, and their carriages in their ſtates and charges, when they are arriued thereunto, do ſufficiently ſhew what men they are, and their owne conſciences telles the moſt that follow that dance, that howſoeuer the publike good be their outward colour, yet their owne particular is that they intend.</p>

                     </note> of them is grounded only vpon opinion. The immoderate deſire to get riches is a gangreene in our ſoule, which with a venimous heat conſumeth our naturall affections, to the end it might fill vs with virulent humours. So ſoone as it is lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

in our hearts, all honeſt and naturall affection which we owe either to our parents or friends, or our ſelues, vaniſheth away. All the reſt in reſpect of our profit ſeemeth nothing, yea we forget in the end, and contemne our ſelues, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, our mindes, for this tranſitory traſh, and as the Prouerbe is, We ſell our horſe to get vs hay.</p>
                  <p>Couetouſneſſe is the vile and baſe paſſion of vulgar fooles, <note place="margin">3 <hi>The follie &amp; miſerie of couetouſneſſe in fine points</hi>
                     </note> who account riches the principall good of man, and feare pouertie as the greateſt euill; and not contenting themſelues with neceſſarie meanes, which are forbidden no man, weigh that is good in a Goldſmiths ballance, when nature hath taught vs to meaſure it by the ell of neceſſitie. For what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter follie can there be, than to adore that which Nature it ſelfe hath put vnder our feet, and hidden in the bowels of the earth as vnworthy to be ſeene, yea rather to be contemned, and trampled vnder foot? This is that that the only ſinne of man hath torne out of the intrailes of the earth, and brought vnto light, to kill himſelfe. <hi>In lucem propter quae pugnaremus excutimus: nonerube ſcimus ſumma apud nos haberi, quae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ima terrarum.</hi> Nature ſeemeth euen in the firſt birth of golde, and wombe from whence it proceedeth, after a ſort to haue preſaged the miſerie of thoſe that are in loue with it: for it hath ſo ordered the matter, that in thoſe countreys where it groweth, there growes with it neither graſſe, nor plant, nor other thing that is woorth any thing, as giuing vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thereby, that in thoſe mindes where the deſire of this mettall growes, there can not remaine ſo much as a ſparke of true honour and vertue: for what thing can be more baſe, than for a man to diſgrade, and to make himſelfe a ſeruant and a ſlaue to that, which ſhould be ſubiect vnto him? <hi>Apud ſapientem diuitiae ſunt in ſeruitute, apud ſtultum in imperio.</hi> For a couetous man ſerues his riches, not they him, and he is ſayd to haue goods as he hath a feuer, which holdeth and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeth ouer a man, not he ouer it. What thing more vile than to loue that which is not good, neither can make a good man, yea is common, and in the poſſeſſion of the moſt wicked of the world, which many times peruert good maners, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer amend them? Without which ſo many wiſe men haue made themſelues happy, and by which many wicked men
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16995:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue come to a miſerable end. To be briefe, what thing more miſerable than to binde the liuing vnto the dead, as <hi>Mezen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> did, to the end their death might be languiſhing and the more cruell; to tie the ſpirit to the excrement and ſcumme of the earth; to pierce throw his owne ſoule with a thouſand torments, which this amourous paſſion of riches brings with it; and to intangle himſelfe with the ties and cords of this malignant thing, as the Scripture calleth them, which doth likewiſe terme them thornes, and theeues which ſteale away the heart of man, ſnares of the Diuell, idolatrie, and the root of all euill. And truly he that ſhall ſee the Catalogue of thoſe enuies and moleſtations which riches ingender within the heart of man, as their proper thunder-bolt and lightning, they would be more hated than they are now loued. <hi>Deſunt inopiae multa, auaritiae omnia: in nullum auarus bonus eſt, in ſe peſſimus.</hi>

In this there is but one kinde of vertue, which is, not to faint in courage, but to continue firme and conſtant. In abundance there are many, Temperance, Moderation, Liberalitie, Diligence, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſo forth. There, more is not expreſſed, but that he looke to himſelfe: heere, that he attend firſt himſelfe, and then the good of others. He that is ſpoiled of his goods hath the more libertie to attend the more weightie affaires of the ſpirit: and for this cauſe many, both Philoſophers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, out of the greatneſſe of their courage, haue put it in practiſe. He doth likewiſe diſcharge himſelfe of many duties and difficulties that are required in the good and honeſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of our riches, in their acquiſition, conſeruation, diſtribution, vſe and emploiment: but he that quitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his riches for this reaſon, ſlieth the labour and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that belongs vnto them; and quite contrary doth it not out of courage, but cowardize: and a man may tell him, that he ſhakes off his riches, not becauſe they are not profitable,

foule, ſince naturall? In crying, laughing, champing, gaping, the viſage is more diſtorted: Is it to the end it may ſerue as a bridle and a ſtay to ſuch a kinde of violence? Why then doth Nature cauſe ſuch a violence? Or contrariwiſe: Is it becauſe ſhame ſerueth as a ſpurre, and as ſulfure; or that the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof mooue without our conſent, yea againſt our willes? By this reaſon beaſts likewiſe ſhould be baſhfull: and many other things moue of themſelues in vs without our conſent, which are neither vicious nor ſhamefull; not only inward and hidden (as the pulſe &amp; motion of the heart, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, lungs, the inſtruments and parts that ſerue the appetite, of eating, drinking, diſcharging the braine, the bellie, and their ſhuttings and openings, are beſides, nay many times, againſt our willes, (witneſſe thoſe ſneeſings, yawnings, teares, hoquets and fluxions, that are not in our owne power, and this of the bodie: the ſpirit forgetteth, remembreth, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, misbeleeueth, and the will it ſelfe, which many times willeth that which we would it willed not) but outward and apparant: the viſage bluſheth, waxeth pale, wanne, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die groweth fat, leane, the haire turneth gray, blacke, white, growes, ſtands on end, without and againſt our conſent. Is it that hereby the pouertie and weakneſſe of man may be the more truely ſhewed? That is as well ſeene in our eating and drinking, our griefs, wearineſſe, the disburdening of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, death, whereof a man is not aſhamed. Whatſoeuer the reaſon be, the action in it ſelfe and by nature is no way ſhamefull, it is truely naturall; ſo is not ſhame: witneſſe the beaſts. Why ſay I beaſts? The nature of man, ſayth Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, mainteining it ſelfe in it firſt originall ſtate, had neuer knowen what ſhame was, as now it doth; for from whence commeth ſhame but from weakneſſe, and weakneſſe but from ſinne, there being nothing in nature of it ſelfe ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? The cauſe then of this ſhame not being in nature, we muſt ſeeke it elſwhere. It is therefore artificiall. It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention forged in the cloſet of <hi>Venus</hi> to giue the greater priſe to the buſineſſe, and to inkindle the deſire thereof the more. This is with a little water to make the fire burne the cleerer, as Smithes vſe to doe, to inflame the deſire to ſee what it is that is hidden; to heare and know what it is that is muttered
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16995:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and whiſpered. For to handle things darkly as if they were myſteries, and with reſpect and ſhame, giueth taſte and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation vnto them. Contrariwiſe, a looſe, free and open per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and commoditie, derogateth from the worth, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the true reliſh and delight thereof.</p>
                  <p>This action then in it ſelfe, and ſimply taken, is neither <note place="margin">3 <hi>In what ſenſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</hi>
                     </note> ſhamefull nor vitious, ſince it is naturall and corporall, no more than other the like actions are: yea, if it be well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is iuſt, profitable, neceſſarie, at the leaſt, as it is to eat and drinke. But that which doth ſo much diſcredit it, is, that moderation is ſeldome kept therein; and that to attaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, we make great ſtirres; and many times vſe bad meanes, whereby it draweth after it, if it go not before, many euils all worſe than the action it ſelfe. The charge riſeth aboue the principall, and this is to fiſh (as it is ſayd) with threeds of golde and purple. And all this is purely humane. Beaſts that follow ſimple nature, are quit from all theſe troubles. But the art of man on the one ſide ſets a ſtrait gard about it, planteth at the gate ſhame to giue it a reliſh: on the other ſide (ô the couſinage of men!) it inflameth and ſharpneth the deſire, it deuiſeth, remoueth, troubleth, turneth all topſie turuie to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it, (witneſſe Poetrie, which ſportteh not it ſelfe in any thing ſo much as in this ſubiect) and findeth euery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto it to be better, than by the gate, and the lawfull way, and followeth euery wandring way, rather than the common way of marriage.</p>

but the iniuſtice of another cannot make that iuſt; nor the loſſe that wee receiue by another make that profitable vnto vs: it is too raſh and inconſiderat to do any thing that is good: it would cure an euill with an euill; for to yeeld the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an offence to <hi>Choler,</hi> is to correct a vice by it ſelfe. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which ſhould haue the command ouer vs, needs no ſuch officers as of their owne heads execute lawes, not attending her ordinance; ſhe would haue all things done according to nature by meaſure, and therefore violence doth no way befit it. But what, ſhall vertue ſee the inſolencie of vice and not be angry with it? ſhall the libertie therof be ſo bridled as not to dare to bee moued againſt the wicked? vertue deſires no indecent libertie, it needes not turne it owne ſtrength againſt it ſelfe, nor that the wickedneſſe of another ſhould trouble it: a wiſe man muſt as well beare the vices of a wicked man without choler, as his proſperitie without enuie. Hee muſt endure the indiſcretions of raſh and inconſiderate men, with the ſelfe ſame patience that Phyſitians do the iniuries of mad men.

Yea the greateſt part of thoſe that thus torment themſelues, when you haue talked with them, or that themſelues haue had the leaſure but to diſcourſe vpon their owne paſſions, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it is but a folly thus to afflict themſelues, and praiſe thoſe who in the like aduerſities, haue made head againſt fortune, and with a manly and generous courage haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their afflictions. And it is certaine that men do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their mourning to their cauſe of ſorrow, but the opinion of thoſe with whom they liue. And if a man marke them well, he ſhall finde that it is opinion, which the more to annoy vs preſenteth the things vnto vs which torment vs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than they ſhould, or by anticipation, feare, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of that which is to come, ſooner than they ſhould.</p>
                  <p>But it is againſt nature, inaſmuch as it polluteth and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <note place="margin">3 <hi>Againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

                  <p>Now it is not only contrary and an enemy vnto nature, but <note place="margin">4 <hi>Iniuſt and impious.</hi>

complaint againſt the Lord and common law of the whole world, which hath made all things vnder the Moone changeable and corruptible? If we know this law, why do we torment our ſelues? If we know it not, whereof doe we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, but of our owne ignorance, in that we know not that which Nature hath written in all the corners and creatures of the world? We are heere not to giue a law, but to receiue it, and to follow that which we find eſtabliſhed: for to torment our ſelues by contradicting it, doth but double our paine.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, it is pernicious and hurtfull vnto man, and by ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe it killeth when we <note place="margin">5 <hi>Pernitican.</hi>

What is this to ſay, but that it condemneth it ſelfe, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth how indecent it is? For it is for a woman that is taken in her wantonneſſe to hide herſelfe, and to feare to be knowen. Againe, do but conſider the veſtments and habits of ſorrow, how ſtrange and effeminate they are; which ſheweth, that it taketh away whatſoeuer is manly and generous in vs, and puts vpon vs the countenances and infirmities of women: and therfore the <hi>Thratians</hi> adorned thoſe men that mourned, like women. And ſome ſay, that ſorow makes men eunuches. The firſt and more manly and generous lawes of the <hi>Romans</hi> forbad theſe effeminate lamentations, finding it an horrible thing, that men ſhould ſo degenerate from their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and do things contrary to manhood; allowing only of thoſe firſt teares, which proceed from the firſt encounter of a freſh and new griefe, which may fall euen from the eyes of

                  <p>Wee ſpeake not heere of that feare of God ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Scripture, nor of that feare which proceedeth from loue, and is a ſweet reſpect towards the thing beloued, commendable in ſubiects and all inferiours towards their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; but of that vitious feare that troubleth and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, which is the ſeed of ſinne, the twinne of ſhame, both of one wombe, ſprung from that cloſe and curſed marriage of the ſpirit of man with a diabolicall perſwaſion. <hi>Timeo, eò quòd nudus eſſem, &amp; abſcondi me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a deceitfull and malicious paſſion, and hath no other power ouer vs, but to mocke and ſeduce vs: it ſerues it turne <note place="margin">2 <hi>The malice and tyranny thereof.</hi>
                     </note> with that which is to come, where though we ſeeme to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee much, we ſee nothing at all; and in that doubtfull darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16995:73"/>
it holdeth vs, as in a darke place, as theeues do by night, to the end they may robbe a man and not be knowen, and giue a great and ſudden affright with a ſmall number. And therefore it tormenteth vs with masks and ſhewes of euils, as men feare children with bug-beares; euils that haue nothing but a ſimple appearance, and haue nought in themſelues whereby to hurt vs, yea, are not euils, but that wee thinke them ſo. It is the only apprehenſion which we haue, which makes that euill to vs which is not ſo, and draweth euill euen from our owne good to afflict vs withall. How many do we ſee euery day, that with feare to become miſerable, become that they feare, and turne their vaine feare into certaine miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? How many haue loſt their friends, by diſtruſting their friends; haue got diſeaſes, by fearing them? One hath in ſuch ſort conceiued an opinion that his wife hath plaied falſe play with him, that for griefe he languiſheth; another hath in ſuch ſort apprehended ſuch a conceit of pouertie, that he falleth ſicke: and to be briefe, ſome haue died for feare to die. And euen ſo may a man ſay almoſt of whatſoeuer we feare: for feare ſeemeth not to other end, than to make vs finde that which we flie from. Doubtleſſe, feare is of all other euils the greateſt and moſt tedious: for other euils are no longer euils than they continue, and the paine endureth no longer than the cauſe; but feare is of that which is, and that which is not, and that perhaps which neuer ſhall be, yea ſometimes of that which can not poſſible be. Beholde then a paſſion truly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and tyrannicall, which draweth from an imaginarie euill true and bitter ſorrowes, and is ouer-greedie by thought and opinion to ouertake, nay out-run them.</p>
                  <p>Feare doth not only fill vs with euils, and many times by falſe appearances, but it likewiſe ſpoileth all the good that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we haue, and all the pleaſure of our life, as an enemie to our reſt. A man can take no delight in the fruition of that good which he feareth to loſe; life it ſelfe can not be pleaſant, if a man feare to die. Nothing good (ſaith an ancient writer) can bring pleaſure with it, but that againſt the loſſe whereof a man is alwayes prepared.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a ſtrange paſſion, indiſcreet and inconſiderate, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> proceeds as often from the want of iudgement, as of heart.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16995:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It ariſeth from dangers, and many times caſteth vs into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; for it ingendreth in vs ſuch an inconſiderate deſire to get out, that it aſtoniſheth, troubleth, and hindereth vs from taking that order that is fit to get out. It bringeth a violent kinde of trouble, whereby the ſoule being affrighted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth it ſelfe into it ſelfe, and debateth with it ſelfe how to auoid that danger that is preſented. Beſides that great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that it bringeth, it ſeizeth on vs with ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment, that we loſe our iudgement, &amp; there is no longer reaſon or diſcourſe in vs: it maketh vs to flie when no man purſueth, yea many times our owne friends and ſuccours: <hi>adeo pauor etiam auxilia formidat.</hi> Many haue run mad heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, yea the ſenſes themſelues haue heereby loſt their vſe: we haue our eyes open, and ſee not; one ſpeaks to vs, and we hearken not vnto him; we would flie, and we can not go.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16995:74"/>
and many parts that bring much knowledge of importance, and very profitable, if it be well done. But who ſhall doe it? Shall man? He is a partie and to be ſuſpected; and to ſay the truth, deales partially therein: which may eaſily be proued, becauſe he keepes neither meaſure nor mediocritie. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he placeth himſelfe farre aboue all, he tearmes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Maſter, and diſdaineth the reſt; diuides vnto them their morſels, diſtributeth ſuch a portion of faculties and powers vnto them as ſhall ſeeme good vnto him. Sometimes as it were in deſpight, he debaſeth himſelfe beneath all; he murmureth, complaineth, wrongeth Nature as a cruell ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, makes himſelfe the outcaſt and moſt miſerable of the world. Now both theſe extreames are equally againſt reaſon, veritie, modeſtie. But how would you haue him to walke vprightly &amp; euenly with all other creatures, when he doth it not with man his companion, nor with God himſelfe, as ſhall be ſhewed?

So is there a great vicinitie and kindred betwixt man and other creatures: they haue many things alike and common to each other, and they haue differences likewiſe, but not ſo farre diſtant and vnlike, but that they may holde together.

                  <p>The certaine aduantages that beaſts haue ouer men, and <note place="margin">5 <hi>Of Beaſts generall.</hi>
                     </note> ſuch as are paſt all doubt, are either general or particular.

a plaine and entire liberty without ſhame, feare, or ceremony in things naturall and lawfull (for it is onely man that hath cauſe to hide himſelfe in his actions, and whoſe faults and imperfections offend others). Exemption from ſo many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and diſorders, ſuperſtition, ambition, auarice, enuie, yea mightie dreames trouble not them as they doe men, nor ſo many thoughts and fantaſies. The particular aduantages are the pure, high, healthfull, pleaſant habitation, and abode of <note place="margin">Particular.</note> birds in the aire. Their ſufficiencie in ſome arts, as the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and other birds in building, the Spider in ſpinning and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> weauing, diuers beaſts in Phyſicke, and the Nightingale in Muſicke. Maruellous effects and properties, not to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> no not imagined, as the propertie of the fiſh <hi>Remora</hi> to ſtay the greateſt veſſels of the ſea, as we reade of the chiefe galley of <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> and the ſelfe ſame of <hi>Caligula;</hi> of the <hi>Torpedo</hi> or Crampe-fiſh, to benum and dead the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of another, though farre diſtant, and not touching him; of the Hedgehog, to foreſee the windes; of the Chameleon, to change his colours. Prognoſtications, as of birds in their paſſages from countrey to countrey, according to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the ſeaſons; of all beaſts that are dammes, in knowing which of their yoong is the beſt; for ſome happe falling out of defending them from danger, or conueying them to their neſts, they alwayes begin with that they know and foreſee to be the beſt. In all theſe things man is farre their inferior, and in ſome of them he hath no skill at all. A man may adde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, if hee will, the length of their liues, which in ſome beaſts doth ſeuen or eight times exceed the longeſt terme of the life of man.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe aduantages that man pretendeth to haue aboue beaſts, but are yet diſputable, and perhaps as well in beaſts <note place="margin">6 <hi>Diſputable aduantages.</hi>
                     </note> as men, are many: Firſt, the reaſonable faculties, diſcourſe, reaſoning, diſcipline, iudgement, prudence. There are heere <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                     </note> two things to be ſpoken, the one of the veritie of the thing it ſelfe. It is a great queſtion, whether beaſts be depriued of all theſe ſpiritual faculties. The opinion that they are not depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but haue them, is the more true and the more authentike. It is defended by many great Philoſophers, eſpecially by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus, Anaxagoras,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks, Galen, Porphyry, Plutarch,</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:16995:76"/>
and mainteined by this reaſon. The compoſition of the braine, which is that part which the ſoule makes vſe of, and whereby it reaſoneth, is all alike as the ſame in beaſts and men, confirmed by experience. Beaſts from particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude generals, by the ſight of one only man they know all men, they know how to ioyne, and diuide, and diſtinguiſh the good from the ill, for the ſafegard of their liues, libertie, and little ones. Yea, we reade and ſee, if we would but marke and conſider it, many things done by beaſts, that doe farre excell the ſufficiencie, ſubtiltie, and all the wit and cunning of the common ſort of men: ſome of thoſe that are beſt woorth the noting, I will note vnto you. The Fox being to paſſe ouer a riuer that is frozen with ice, applieth his eare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ice, to finde whether he can heare any noiſe, and that the water doe runne vnder it, that thereby he may reſolue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go forward, or to retire backe; of whom the <hi>Thraſians</hi> haue learned the ſame cunning, being to paſſe their frozen riuers. A Dogge, to the end hee may know which way of three either his maſter or that beaſt he hunteth is gone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aſſured himſelfe by ſenting them, that he hath not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by two of them, becauſe he findes not the trace, without the ſetting of his noſe to the ground or farther trauerſing, he runneth mainly into the third. The Mule of the Philoſopher <hi>Thales</hi> croſſing a riuer with a ſacke of ſalt on his backe, and being plunged into the deepe with his burthen, his ſalt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in the water, and made his burthen the lighter; which the Mule (falling into the deepe by chance) hauing found, being afterwards loaden with wooll, vſed the ſame remedie, and ſunke the more. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, that he ſaw a Dog in a ſhip caſting ſtones into a pipe of oile, to make the oile to mount, that hee might the better come at it. As much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Crowes of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> who by that meanes raiſe the water when it is too low, that they may drinke. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Elephants gather ſtones and ſticks, and caſt them into that ditch whereinto their companion is fallen, to helpe him to get out. The Oxen of the Kings gardens of <hi>Suze</hi> being taught to go in a wheele a iuſt hundred turnes, to draw water to water the gardens, they would neuer exceed that iuſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and were neuer deceiued in their account. All theſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16995:76"/>
thnigs, how can they be done, without diſcourſe and reaſon, addition and diuiſion? To ſay they know not this, were to denie that we ſee they doe. What ſhould we thinke of that dexteritie that is in the Elephant in plucking thoſe darts and iauelins foorth of his bodie with little or no paine at all? of the Dogge that <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaketh of, which in a publike play vpon a ſcaffold counterfeited death, drawing towards his end, trembling, afterwards growing ſtiffe, and ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be caried foorth, by little and little comming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and lifting vp his head counterfeited a new reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? of ſo many apiſh imitations and ſtrange tricks that the dogs of Players and Iuglers doe? of the policies and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherewith beaſts defend themſelues againſt the aſſaults we make vpon them? of the husbandrie and great proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Ant in laying abroad his graine to drie, leſt it take moiſture and ſo corrupt, in nipping the ends thereof that it grow not? of the policie of the Bee, where there is ſuch diuerſitie of offices and charges ſo firmly eſtabliſhed?</p>
                  <p>To beat downe all this, ſome doe maliciouſly attribute theſe things to a naturall, ſeruile and forced inclination; as if <note place="margin">7 <hi>An oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</hi>
                     </note> beaſts did performe their actions by a naturall neceſſitie, like things inanimate, as the ſtone falleth downward, the fire mounteth vpward. But beſides that, that can not be, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our imagination; for there muſt be a numbring of the parts, compariſon, diſcourſe by addition and diuiſion, and conſequents; they likewiſe know not what this naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and inſtinct is; they be words which they abuſe to ſmall purpoſe, that they may not be deafe and mute altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Againe, this ſaying is retorted againſt them: for it is beyond all compariſon more noble, honourable, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth more the Diuinitie to worke by nature than by art and apprentiſhip; to be led and directed by the hand of God, than by our owne; regularly to act by a naturall and ineuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, than regularly by a raſh and caſuall libertie.</p>
                  <p>By this obiection of the naturall inſtinct, they would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe depriue them of inſtruction and diſcipline both actiue and paſſiue, but experience giues them the lie; for they doe both receiue it: witneſſe the Pie, the Parret, the Black-bird, the Dogge, the Horſſe, as hath beene ſaid, and they giue it,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16995:77"/>
witneſſe the Nightingale, and aboue all other the Elephant, which excelleth all other beaſts in docilitie, and all kinde of diſcipline and ſufficiencie.</p>
                  <p>As for this facultie of the ſpirit whereof man doth ſo much glorie, which is to ſpiritualize things corporall and abſent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> robbing them of all accidents, to the end it might conceiue them after it owne maner, <hi>nam intellectum eſt in intelligente ad modum intelligentis;</hi> beaſts themſelues do the like. The Horſe accuſtomed to the warres ſleeping in his ſtable, trembleth and groaneth as if he were in the middeſt of the fight; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the ſound of the drumme, the trumpet, yea an armie it ſelfe. The Hare in her ſleepe panting, lifteth vp her ſcut, ſhaking her legs, conceiueth a ſpirituall Hare. Dogs that are kept for gard, in their ſleepe do ſnarre, and ſometimes barke outright, imagining a ſtranger to be come. To conclude this firſt point, we muſt confeſſe that beaſts doe reaſon, haue the vſe of diſcourſe and iudgement, but more weakly and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly than man; they are inferiour vnto men in this, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue no part therein at all; they are inferiour vnto men, as amongſt men ſome are inferiour vnto others; and euen ſo amongſt beaſts there is ſuch a difference: but yet there is a greater difference betweene men; for (as ſhall be ſaid heereafter) there is a greater diſtance betweene a man and a man, than a man and a beaſt. But for all this we muſt not heereby inferre, a kinde of equalitie or paritie betwixt a beaſt and a man (though as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, there are ſome men ſo weake and blockiſh, that they differ from a beaſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in figure) and that the ſoule of a beaſt is immortall as that of a man, or the ſoule of a man mortall as that of a beaſt: for theſe are but malicious illations. For beſides that in this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning facultie, man hath a verie great aduantage aboue beaſts, ſo hath the other faculties more high and wholly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, whereby he is ſayd to be like vnto God himſelfe, and is capable of immortalitie, wherein beaſts haue no part, and are ſignified by that vnderſtanding, which is more than a ſimple diſcourſe. <hi>Nolite fieri ſicut equus &amp; mulus in quibus non est intellectus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other point which we are to ſpeake of in this matter is, that this preheminence and aduantage of vnderſtanding, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:16995:77"/>
and other ſpirituall faculties that man pretendeth, is ſold him at a deare rate, and brings with it more hurt than good: for it is the principall ſource of all thoſe euils that oppreſſe him; of vices, paſſions, maladies, irreſolution, trouble, deſpaire, which beaſts want, by the want of this great aduantage: witneſſe the Hogge of <hi>Pyrrho,</hi> which did eat his meat peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in the ſhippe in the middeſt of a great tempeſt, when all the men were almoſt dead for feare. It ſeemeth that theſe great parts of the ſoule haue beene denied vnto beaſts, or at leaſtwiſe leſſened, and giuen them more feeble, for their great good and quiet, and beſtowed vpon man for his torment: for it is long of them that he toileth and trauelleth, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe with what is paſt, and that which is to come; yea he imagineth, apprehendeth, and feareth thoſe euils that are not, nor euer ſhall be. Beaſts apprehend nothing that is ill vntill they feele it; and being eſcaped, they are preſently in ſecuritie and at peace. So that we ſee that man is moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable euen in that wherin he thought himſelfe moſt happy: whereby it ſeemeth that it had beene better for man, not to haue beene indued and adorned with all thoſe beautifull and celeſtiall armes, ſince he turneth them againſt himſelfe, euen to his owne deſtruction. And to ſay the trueth, we ſee thoſe that are moſt ſtupid and feeble of ſpirit, liue at beſt content, and feele not their euill accidents in ſo high a degree, as thoſe that are more ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>Another aduantage that man pretendeth aboue beaſts is a ſignorie and power of commanding, which he thinketh hee <note place="margin">10 2. <hi>Signorie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
                     </note> hath ouer beaſts: but beſides, that it is an aduantage that men themſelues haue and exerciſe the one ouer the other, this is not true. For where is this command of man, this obedience of the beaſts? It is a monſter that was neuer ſeen, yea men do more feare beaſts, than beaſts them. It is true that man hath a great preheminence ouer beaſts, <hi>vt praeſit piſcibus maris, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latilibus coeli, beſtijs terrae.</hi> And this by reaſon of his beautifull <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and vpright forme, of his wiſdome and the prerogatiue of his ſpirit: but not that hee ſhould either command, or they obey.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe another aduantage, neere neighbour to <note place="margin">11. 3. <hi>Libertie.</hi>
                     </note> this, pretended by man, which is a plaine libertie, reproching
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16995:78"/>
beaſts with their ſeruitude, captiuitie, ſubiection: but this is to ſmall purpoſe. There is farre greater reaſon why man ſhould reproch man; witneſſe thoſe ſlaues, not only made by force, and ſuch as deſcend from them, but alſo thoſe that are voluntarie, who either ſell for money their libertie or giue it, out of the lightneſſe of their hearts, or for ſome commoditie, as the ancient fenſers ſolde outright women to their miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſouldiers to their captaines. Now there is none of all this in beaſts, they neuer ſerue one another, nor yeeld themſelues to any ſeruitude either actiue or paſſiue, either to ſerue or to be ſerued, and are in euery thing more free than men. And as man goeth to the chaſe, taketh, killeth, eateth the beaſts; ſo is he taken, killed, eaten by them in his turne, and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably too, by maine ſtrength, not by wit and art, as man doth: and not only by them is he killed, but by his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by another man, a thing baſe and diſhonorable. Beaſts aſſemble not themſelues in troops to go to kill, to deſtroy, to ranſacke, to inthrall another troope of their kinde, as men do.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and greateſt aduantage pretended by man, is in vertue; but of morall it is diſputable (I meane morall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially <note place="margin">12 4. <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                     </note> by the outward action): for formallie the moralitie good or euill, vertue and vice, can not be in a beaſt. Kinde acknowledgement, officious amitie, fidelitie, magnanimitie, and many other vertues, which conſiſt in ſocietie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, are more liuely, more expreſſe and conſtant, than can be in the common ſort of people. <hi>Hircanus</hi> the dogge of <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> continued vpon the bed of his dead maſter, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all kinde of ſuſtenance, and afterwards caſt himſelfe into that fire wherein his maſter was burnt, and there died with him. The ſelfe ſame did another belonging to one <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> That dogge of wiſe <hi>Heſiodus</hi> diſcouered the murther of his maſter. Another in like ſort in the preſence of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and his whole armie. Another which neuer ceaſed, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> affirmeth, going from citie to citie, vntill that ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Robber of the Temple of <hi>Athens</hi> was apprehended and brought to iudgements That hiſtorie is famous, of the lion that was hoſt and nurſe to <hi>Androdus</hi> the ſlaue and his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, which would not touch him being caſt out vnto him: which <hi>Appion</hi> affirmeth to haue ſeene at <hi>Rome.</hi> An Elephant
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16995:78"/>
hauing in choler killed his gouernour, repenting himſelfe of it, refuſed any longer to eat, drinke, or liue. Contrariwiſe, there is not a creature in the world, more vniuſt, vnthankfull, traiterous, perfidious, lying and deceitfull, than man. Againe, foraſmuch as vertue conſiſteth in the moderation of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and the bridling of our pleaſures, beaſts are much more moderate therein than wee, and doe better containe themſelues within the limits of nature. For they are not only not touched with vnnaturall, ſuperfluous and artificiall paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſires, which are all vitious and infinite, as men who for the moſt part are plunged in them; but alſo in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as eating and drinking, the acquaintance betwixt the male and the female, they are farre more moderate and ſtaied. But that we may ſee which is the more vertuous or vitious a man or a beaſt, and in good earneſt to ſhame a man more than a beaſt, let vs take the vertue moſt proper and agreeable vnto man, that is, as the word it ſelfe importeth, humanity: as the moſt ſtrange and contrary vice is cruelty. Now heerin beaſts <note place="margin">Humanity. Cruelty.</note> haue aduantage enough euen to make men bluſh for ſhame. They neuer aſſaile, and ſeldome offend thoſe of their kind, <hi>maior ſerpentum ferarumque concordia quàm hominum:</hi> They neuer fight but for great and iuſt cauſes, as the defence and preſeruation of their liues, liberty, and their little ones: and that they doe with their naturall and open armes, by their only force and valour, and that one to one, as in ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and not in troupes, nor by deſignements. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates are ſhort and ſoone ended, vntill one of them be either wounded or yeeldeth, and the combate ended, the quarrell, hatred, and choler is likewiſe at an end. But man hath no quarrell but againſt man, for not only light, vaine and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cauſes, but many times vniuſt, with artificiall and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous armes, by deceits and wicked meanes, in troupe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly gathered by aſſignement; and laſtly his wars are long and neuer ended but with death, and when he is able no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to hurt, yet the hatred and choler endureth.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion of this compariſon is, that vntruely and <note place="margin">12 <hi>The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this ſecond conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi>
                     </note> vainly doth man glorifie himſelfe aboue beaſts. For if man haue in him ſomething more than they, as eſpecially the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacity of the ſpirit and vnderſtanding, and thoſe great facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16995:79"/>
of the ſoule; ſo likewiſe in exchange is hee ſubiect to a thouſand euils from which the beaſts are freed, inconſtancie, irreſolution, ſuperſtition, a painfull care of things to come, ambition, auarice, enuie, curioſitie, detraction, lying, and a world of diſordered appetites, diſcontentments, emulations. This ſpirit wherewith man maketh himſelfe ſo mery, brings him a thouſand inconueniences, and then moſt, when it is moſt ſtirred and enforced. For it doth not only hurt the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, trouble, breake and weaken the bodily forces and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but alſo it hurts and hindereth it ſelfe. What caſteth man into follie and madneſſe, but the ſharpeneſſe, agility, and proper force of the ſpirit? The moſt ſubtile follies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent lunacies proceede from the rareſt and quickeſt agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſpirit, as from greateſt amities ſpring greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and from ſoundeſt healths mortall maladies. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie men, ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi> as they are more capeable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſedome, ſo likewiſe of folly. And hee that well marketh it, ſhall finde, that in thoſe eleuations and ſalies of a free ſoule, there is ſome mixture of folly; for to ſay the truth, theſe things are neere neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Touching a ſimple life and ſuch as is according to nature, beaſts do farre exceede men; they liue more freely, ſecurely, <note place="margin">13 <hi>An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                     </note> moderately, contentedly. And that man is wiſe that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth heereof, and benefiteth himſelfe by making them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction vnto himſelfe, which doing, he frameth himſelfe to innocencie, ſimplicitie, libertie, and that naturall ſweetneſſe which ſhineth in beaſts, and is wholly altered and corrupteth in vs by our artificiall inuentions, and vnbridled licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, abuſing that wherein we ſay we excell them, which is the ſpirit and iudgement. And therefore God doth many times ſend vs to ſchoole, to birds, beaſts themſelues, to the kite, the graſhopper, the ſwallow, the turtle, the ant, the ox, the aſſe, and diuers others. Laſtly, we muſt remember that there is a kind of commerce betwixt beaſts &amp; vs, a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation &amp; mutuall obligation, whereof there is no other reaſon, but that they belong to one &amp; the ſame maſter, and are of the ſame family that we are. It is an vnworthy thing to tyranniſe ouer them, we owe iuſtice vnto men, and pitie and gentleneſſe to ſuch other creatures as are capeable thereof.</p>

The vulgar vnlearned ſot accounteth it a ſouereigne good, and preferreth it aboue all things; yea he will not ſticke to redeeme and prolong it by all the delayes that may be, vpon what conditions ſoeuer, thinking it can neuer be bought too deare: for it is all in all with him, his motte is <hi>Vita nihil carius.</hi> He eſteemeth and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his life for the loue of it ſelfe: he liues not but to liue.

And I can not be of their opinion (as it is ſimply taken) that ſay it is beſt of all, not to be at all; and that the beſt is the ſhorteſt life: <hi>optimum non naſci aut quàm citiſſimè aboleri.</hi> And it is neither well nor wiſely ſayd, What hurt or what matter had it beene if I had neuer beene? A man may anſwer him with the like queſtion: Where had that good beene which is come, and being not come, had it not beene euill not to haue beene? It is a kinde of euill that wanteth good, whatſoeuer it be, yea though not neceſſarie. Theſe extremities are too extreame and vitious, though not equally: but that ſeemes true that a wiſe man ſpake, That life is ſuch a good as a man would not take, if he knew well what it were before he tooke it: <hi>Vitam</hi>

To ſay the truth, the greateſt part thereof being diuerted and otherwiſe employed, there remaines little or nothing for it ſelfe: for the time of our infancie, olde age, ſleepe, maladies of minde and bodie, and many other times, both vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnfit for any good, being taken away, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth is little or nothing at all. Neuertheleſſe, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the contrarie opinion to them that holde a ſhort life to be a great good and gift of Nature, their complaint ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to haue little equitie and reaſon, and rather to proceed from malice. For to what end ſerueth a long life? Simplie to liue, to breathe, to eat, to drinke, to ſee this world: for all this what needs ſo long time? We haue ſeene, knowen, taſted all in a ſhort ſpace; and knowing it, to deſire ſo long a time to practiſe it, and ſtill to reiterate the ſame thing, to what end is it? Who will not be ſatisfied, nay wearied, to do alwaies one and the ſame thing? If it be not tedious and irkeſome, at the leaſt it is ſuperfluous: it is a turning wheele where the ſame
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16995:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things come and go: it is alwaies to begin where we end, and to reſpinne the ſame webbe. But perhaps they will ſay they deſire a long life to learne and to profit the more, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a greater perfection of knowledge and vertue. Alas good ſoules that wee are, what ſhould wee know, or who ſhould teach vs? We employ but badly that little which is giuen vs, not only in vanities and thoſe things that yeeld vs no profit, but in malice and ſinne; and then we crie out and complaine, that we haue not enough giuen vnto vs. And to ſay the truth, to what end ſerues ſo great ſtore of knowledge and experience, ſince in the end wee muſt leaue it and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge it; and hauing diſlodged it altogether, forget and loſe it all, or know it better and otherwiſe? But you will ſay, that there are beaſts that do triple and quadruple the life of man. To omit thoſe fables that are tolde heereof; Be it ſo: but yet there are a number that liue not a quarter of that time that man doth, and few neither, that liue out their time. By what right or reaſon, or priuiledge, can man challenge a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger life than other creatures? Is it becauſe he doth better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it in matters more high and more worthie life? By this reaſon he ſhould liue leſſe time than all other creatures; for there is none comparable to man in the ill emploiment of his life, in wickedneſſe, ingratitude, intemperance, and all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſorder and immodeſtie in maners, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before in the compariſon of man with beaſts: ſo that as I asked euen now, to what end a long life ſerued; now I aske, what euils there would be in the world, if the life of man were long? What would he not enterpriſe, ſince the ſhortneſſe of life, which cuts off his way, and (as they ſay) interrupts his caſt, and the vncerteinty thereof, which takes away all heart and courage, can not ſtay him, liuing as if he ſhould liue euer? On the one ſide he feareth perceiuing himſelfe to be mortall, but notwithſtanding that, hee can not bridle himſelfe from not coueting, hoping, enterpriſing, as if he were immortall. <hi>Tanquam ſemper victuri viuitis, nunquam vobis fragilitas veſtra</hi>

Man therefore hath no ſubiect whereof to complaine, but to be angrie with himſelfe.

youth, it filles the minde more with wrinckles, then the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; and there is not a ſoule growing olde, growes not ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and rotten.

It were abſurd to tearme wiſdome a difficultie of humours, an anxietie and diſtaſte of things preſent, an impotencie to doe as in former times: wiſdome is too noble to be ſerued with ſuch officers. To wax olde is not to wax wiſe, nor to take away vices; but to change them into worſe. Olde age condemneth pleaſure, but it is becauſe it can not taſte or reliſh it aright, like <hi>Eſops</hi> dogge, it ſaith it will none of it, but it is becauſe it can not ioy in it: for olde age leaueth not pleaſure properly, but pleaſure diſdaines olde age; for it is alwayes wanton and ſporting: and it is no reaſon that impotencie ſhould corrupt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhould in youth know vice in pleaſure, and in olde age pleaſure in vice. The vices of youth are temeritie, indiſcreet forwardneſſe, and vnbridled libertie and ouergree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die deſire of pleaſure; which are naturall things proceeding from the heat of the blood and naturall vigour, and therefore the more excuſable; but the vices of olde age are farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The lighter are a vaine and fraile proteruitie, an enur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pratling, inſociable humours, ſuperſtition, care to get ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, euen then when the vſe of them is loſt, a ſottiſh auarice, and feare of death, which proceedeth properly, not from the want of ſpirit and courage, as they ſay, but becauſe olde men are long acquainted and as it were cockered in this world, whereby their affections are knit vnto it; which is not in yoong men: but beſides theſe they are enuious, froward, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt: but that which is moſt ſottiſh and ridiculous in them, is that they would not only be reuerenced but feared, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they put vpon them an auſtere looke and diſdainfull, thinking thereby to extort feare and obedience: but they are therein much deceiued, for this ſtately and furious geſture is receiued of youth with mockerie and laughter, being practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only to blinde their eyes, and of purpoſe to hide and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the truth of things.

therefore ſo fit for contempt, that the beſt way to compaſſe their deſires is loue and affection: for command and feare are no longer fit armes for them.

               <p>ALl the deſcriptions the wiſe, and ſuch as haue taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> greateſt paines in the ſtudie of humane knowledge, haue giuen vnto man, ſeeme all to note in man foure things, <hi>Vanitie, Weakneſſe, Inconſtancie, Miſerie;</hi> calling him the ſpoile of times, the play-game of Fortune, the image of inconſtancie, the example and ſpectacle of infirmitie, the ballance of enuie and miſerie, a dreame, a fantaſie, aſhes, a vapour, a morning deaw, a flower that preſently fadeth and withereth, a winde, graſſe, a bladder or bubble, a ſhadow, leaues of trees caried with the winde, vncleane ſeed in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, a ſponge of ordures, a ſacke of miſeries in his middle age, a ſtench and meat for wormes in his end; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the moſt miſerable and wretched thing in the world. <hi>Iob,</hi> one of the moſt ſufficient in this matter, as well in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe as contemplation thereof, hath well and at large deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him, and after him, <hi>Salomon,</hi> in their Books. To be ſhort, <hi>Plinie</hi> ſeemeth very properly to haue deſciphered him, in calling him the moſt miſerable, and yet the moſt arrogant creature of the world, <hi>Solum vt certum ſit nihil eſſe certi, nec miſerius quicquam homine aut ſuperbius.</hi> By the firſt word (miſerable) he comprehendeth all thoſe former deſcriptions, and as much as all the reſt haue ſayd; but by the other (the moſt proud) hee toucheth another chiefe point very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: and hee ſeemeth in theſe two words to haue vttered whatſoeuer can be ſayd. Theſe are thoſe two things that ſeeme to hurt and hinder one the other, Miſerie and Pride, Vanitie and Preſumption.

Foraſmuch as man is compoſed of two diuers parts, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſoule and the body, it is a matter of difficulty well to deſcribe him entire in his perfection and declining ſtate. Some refer vnto the body whatſoeuer ill can be ſpoken of man; they make him an excellent creature, and in regard of his ſpirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll him aboue all other creatures: but on the other ſide, whatſoeuer is ill, either in man, or in the whole world, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and proceedeth from this ſpirit of man, and in it there is farre more vanity, inconſtancy, miſery, preſumption, than in the body, wherein there is little matter of reproch in reſpect of the ſpirit, and therefore <hi>Democritus</hi> calleth it a world of hidden miſeries, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> prooueth it in a booke written of that ſubiect. Now let vs conſider man more according to the life, than heeretofore we haue done, and pinch him where it itcheth not, referring all to theſe fiue points, <hi>vanity, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, inconſtancy, miſery,</hi> and <hi>preſumption,</hi> which are his more naturall and vniuerſall qualities, but the two latter touch him more neerely. Againe there are ſome things common to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe fiue, which a man knowes not to which to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it, and eſpecially, imbecillity and miſery.</p>

                  <p>VAnity is the moſt eſſentiall and proper quality of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. There is nothing ſo much in man, bee it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> malice, infelicity, inconſtancy, irreſolution (and of all theſe there is alwaies abundance) as baſe feebleneſſe, ſottiſhneſſe and ridiculous vanity. And therefore <hi>Democritus</hi> met better with it, with a kind of diſdaine of humane condition, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laughing at it, than <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that wept and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe, whereby he gaue ſome teſtimony, that he made ſome account thereof; and <hi>Diogenes</hi> who ſcorned it, than <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that hater and flier of the company of men. <hi>Pindarus</hi> hath expreſſed it more to the life than any other, by the two vaineſt things in the world, calling it the dreame of aſhadow, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This is that, that hath wrought in the wiſeſt ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of man, that hearing of ſome great deſignment and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

enterpriſe, and iudging it ſuch, were wont neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to ſay that the world was not worthy a mans labour and paines, (ſo anſwered <hi>Statilius</hi> to <hi>Brutus,</hi> talking with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the conſpiracie againſt <hi>Caeſar)</hi> and that a wiſe man ſhould doe nothing but for himſelfe, for it is not reaſon that wiſe men, and wiſedome ſhould put themſelues in danger for fooles.</p>
                  <p>This vanitie is ſhewed and expreſſed many waies, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">2 <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
                     </note> a diuers maner, firſt in our thoughts and priuate imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are many times more than vaine, friuolous, and ridiculous, wherein neuertheleſſe we ſpend much time, and yet perceiue it not. Wee enter into them, we dwell in them, and we come foorth againe inſenſibly, which is a double va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and a great forgetfulneſſe of our ſelues. One walking in a hall conſidereth how he may frame his paces after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faſhion vpon the boords of the floure: another diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in his minde, with much time, and great attention, how he ſhould carry himſelfe if he were a king, a Pope, or ſome other thing that he is aſſured can neuer come to paſſe; and ſo hee feedeth himſelfe with winde, yea leſſe than winde, that, that neither is, nor euer ſhall be. Another dreameth how he ſhall compoſe his body, his countenances, his geſtures, his ſpeech after an affected faſhion, and pleaſeth himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as with a thing that wonderfully becomes him, and that euery man ſhould take delight in. But what a vanitie and ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh weakeneſſe in our deſires is this, that brings forth beliefs and hopes farre more vaine? And all this falleth out not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we haue nothing to doe, when we are ſwallowed vp with idleneſſe, but many times in the midſt of our moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie affaires: ſo naturall and powerfull is vanitie, that it robbeth and plucketh out of our hands, the truth, ſoliditie, and ſubſtance of things, and fills vs with winde, yea with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Another more ſottiſh vanitie is a troubleſome care of what ſhall heere fall out when we are dead. We extend our deſires <note place="margin">3 <hi>Care for times to come.</hi>
                     </note> and affections beyond our ſelues, and our being; wee would prouide that ſome thing ſhould bee done vnto vs, when wee know not what is done vnto vs; owe deſire to be praiſed after our death, what greater vanitie? It is not ambition, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16995:83"/>
&amp; a man may thinke it, for that is the deſire of a ſenſible and perceptible honor: if this praiſe of our ſelues when we are gone, might any way profit either our children, our parents, or our friends that ſuruiue vs, it were well, there were ſome benefit, though not to our ſelues; but to deſire that as a good, which ſhall no way touch vs, nor benefit others, is a meere vanitie, like that of thoſe who feare their wiues will marrie after their departure: and therefore they deſire them with great paſſion to continue vnmarried, and binde them by their willes ſo to do, leauing vnto them a great part of their goods vpon that condition. This is vanitie and many times iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. It was contrariwiſe a commendable thing in thoſe great men in times paſt, which dying exhorted their wiues to marry ſpeedily for the better increaſe of the Commonwealth. Others ordeine, that for the loue of them and for their ſakes a friend keepe ſuch and ſuch a thing, or that he do this or that vnto their dead bodies; which rather ſheweth their vanitie, than doth any good to ſoule or bodie.</p>
                  <p>See heere another vanitie, we liue not but by relation vnto another; we take not ſo much care what we are in our ſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in effect and truth, as what we are in the publike knowledge of men; in ſuch ſort, that we do many times deceiue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue our ſelues of our owne goods and commodities, and torment our ſelues, to frame our outward appearances to the common opinion. This is true, not onely in outward things and ſuch as belong to the bodie, and the expenſe and charge of our meanes, but alſo in the goods of the ſpirit, which ſeeme vnto vs to be without fruit, if others enioy them not, and they be not produced to the view and approbation of ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p>Our vanity is not only in our ſimple thoughts, deſires, and diſcourſes, but it likewiſe troubleth, ſhaketh and tormenteth <note place="margin">5 Agitations of the ſpirit.</note> both ſoule and bodie. Many times men trouble and torment themſelues more for light occaſions and matters of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than for the greateſt and moſt important affaires that are. Our ſoule is many times troubled with ſmall fantaſies, dreames, ſhadowes, fooleries, without bodie, without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; it is intangled and moleſted with choler, hatred, ſorow, ioy, building caſtles in <hi>Spaine.</hi> The remembrance of a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well

The ſound of names and certaine words pronounced with a pitifull voice, yea with ſighs and exclamations pierceth euen to the quicke, as Oratours and Players, and other that ſell winde and ſmoake doe well know and practiſe. And this winde catcheth and carrieth away many times men that are moſt conſtant and ſetled, if they ſtand not vpon their gard: ſo puiſſant is vanitie ouer men. And not only light and little things doe ſhake and trouble vs, but alſo lies and impoſtures, euen thoſe we know to be ſuch (a ſtrange thing) in ſuch ſort, that we take pleaſure to deceiue our ſelues in good earneſt, to feed our fantaſies with tales, with nothing <hi>(ad fallendum noſmetipſos ingenioſiſſimi ſumus):</hi> witneſſe they that weepe and afflict themſelues hearing a relation, or ſeeing a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which they know to be an inuention made for delight, euen of thoſe things that neuer were.

What vanitie and loſſe of time is there in thoſe viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſalutations, congies and mutuall enterteinments, thoſe offices of courteſie, orations, ceremonies, offers, praiſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes! How many hyperbolicall ſpeeches, hypocriſies and impoſtures are there in the ſight and knowledge of all, both of thoſe that giue them, that receiue them, that heare of them! inſomuch that it ſeemeth to be a match and market made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to mocke, lie, and deceiue one another. And that which is woorth all the reſt, he that knowes that a man doth impudently lie vnto him, muſt yet giue him thanks; and he that knowes that when he lies he is not beleeued, ſets a bolde face vpon the matter, attending and obſeruing one the other, who ſhall firſt begin or end; when they could both be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they were both aſunder. What inconueniences doth man endure? He faineth, counterfeiteth, diſguiſeth himſelfe;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16995:85"/>
he endureth heat, colde, troubleth his reſt, afflicteth his life for thoſe courtly vanities, and leaueth his weightie affaires for the winde. We are vaine at the charge of our owne eaſe, yea of our health and of our life. The accidents and the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things trample vnder foot the ſubſtance, and the winde carrieth the bodie, ſo much is man a ſlaue to vanitie: and he that will do otherwiſe ſhall be held for a foole and a man that vnderſtands not the world. It is dexteritie well to play this Comedie, and folly not to be vaine. Being entred into ſpeech and familiar diſcourſe, how many vaine and vnprofitable, falſe, fabulous tales are there (not to ſay wicked and perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which are not of this count) how many vaunts and vaine boaſtings! Man deſireth and delighteth to ſpeake of himſelfe and that which is his, and if he thinke he haue either done or ſaid, or poſſeſſe any thing that is worthie eſtimation, he is not at eaſe vntill he hath vttered it, and made it knowen to others: when a commoditie firſt commeth he entreth into an account thereof, he valueth it, he raiſeth the price, nay he will not ſeeme to attend his commoditie, though he ſeeke it with induſtrie; and then to heare what the ſpeech of the people is abroad, he thruſts himſelfe into companie, and it tickleth him at the heart to heare his happie ſucceſſe ſpoken of, and that men eſteeme of him the more, and of what hee eſteemes.</p>
                  <p>But better to make knowen what credit and command this vanitie hath ouer the nature of man, let vs call to minde that <note place="margin">7 <hi>Publike and vniuerſall agitations.</hi>
                     </note> the greateſt alterations of the world, the moſt generall and fearefull agitations of States and Empires, armies, battels, murthers, haue riſen from light, ridiculous and vaine cauſes: witneſſe the warres of <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey, Augustus</hi> and <hi>Antonie.</hi> The Poets ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie as much, when they ſet all <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> on fire for an apple. The firſt occaſions and motiues ariſe of nothing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they grow and increaſe: a teſtimonie of the vanitie and follie of man. Many times the accident doth more than the principall, the leſſer circumſtances touch more to the quicke than the greateſt, nay the cauſes and ſubiects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The robe of <hi>Caeſar</hi> troubled <hi>Rome</hi> more than his death did, or thoſe 22 ſtabs with a poignard that were giuen him.</p>

                     </note> ſhewed in that which he moſt affecteth and ſeeks after; he pleaſeth himſelfe and placeth his whole felicitie in thoſe vaine and friuolous goods, without which hee may well and commodiouſly liue, and takes not that care that he ſhould for the true and eſſentiall: his chance is winde, his whole good nothing but opinion and dreames, wherein he is matchleſſe. <hi>God</hi> hath all good things in eſſence, all euill in vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; man quite contrarie poſſeſſeth his good things by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, his euill in eſſence.

This weakneſſe is confeſſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all that account many things eaſie to be vnderſtood of all, but is not taken to be ſuch in thoſe things it ſhould, as in ſuch wherein a man ſeemeth, to be moſt ſtrong, and leaſt weake; in deſiring, poſſeſſing, and vſing thoſe things that he hath and holdeth, and in euery good and euill; and to be ſhort, in ſuch wherein he glorieth moſt, wherein he thinketh to excell others, and to be ſome thing. Theſe are the true te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of his weakneſſe: but we ſhall ſee this better apart.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, touching deſire, a man can not ſettle his contentment in any thing, no not his owne deſire and imagination. It is <note place="margin">2 <hi>In deſiring &amp; chuſing.</hi>

If one ſhould put a man to his owne choiſe, make him his

                  <p>The weakneſſe of man doth more appeare, and is greater <note place="margin">3 <hi>In poſſeſſing and vſing.</hi>
                     </note> in the poſſeſſion and vſe of things, and that diuers wayes: firſt, in that he can not make vſe of any thing in it owne puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſimple nature; but he muſt diſguiſe, alter and corrupt them before he can accommodate them to his vſe: the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, mettals, and all things els in their owne nature are not fit for vſe. Good things, delights and pleaſures can not be enioyed without ſome mixture of euill and diſcommoditie: <hi>Medio de fonte leporum ſurgit amari aliquid, quod in ipſis floribus angat.</hi> The higheſt pleaſure that is hath a ſigh and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to accompanie it; and being come to perfection is but debilitie, a deiection of the minde, languiſhment.

Secondly, whatſoeuer happeneth vnto vs, we take and enioy with an ill hand; our taſte is vnreſolued and vncertaine, it knowes not how to hold
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16995:87"/>
and poſſeſſe any thing after a good maner: and from thence ſprang that vndetermined queſtion of the ſouereigne good. The better things many times in our hands, by our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vice, inſufficiencie, are made woorſe, are corrupted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nothing, are vnprofitable vnto vs, yea ſometimes hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and contrary.</p>
                  <p>But humane imbecillitie is more richly diſplaied in good and euill, in vertue and vice: hence it is, that man can not be, <note place="margin">4 <hi>In good and euill.</hi>
                     </note> when it ſeemes good vnto himſelfe, either wholly good or wholly wicked, but he hath his weakeneſſe, his impotencies in them both. Touching vertue, three points are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: the firſt is, That it is not in the power of man to doe all good, to put in practiſe all vertues; inſomuch that many vertues are incompatible, and can not be together, at leaſt in one and the ſame ſubiect, as filiall or maidenly continencie and viduall, which are wholly different; the married and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married ſtate; the two ſecond of widowhood and marriage, being more painfull and buſie, and hauing more difficultie and vertue than the two firſt of virginitie and the vnmarried eſtate, which haue more puritie, grace and eaſe: <hi>Virgo felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, vidua laborioſior, in illa gratia, in iſta virtus coronatur:</hi> that <note place="margin">Tertull.</note> conſtancie which is in pouertie, want, aduerſitie, and that which is in abundance and proſperitie: patience in beggerie and liberalitie. And this is more true in vices, which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite one againſt the other.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is, That many times a man can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which belongs to one vertue, without the ſcandall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and offence either of another vertue, or of it ſelfe; inſomuch that they hinder one the other: whereby it comes to paſſe that a man can not ſatisfie the one but at the charge of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which wee muſt not attribute vnto vertue, or thinke that the vertues croſſe and contrary one another, for they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree well enough; but vnto the weakeneſſe of our humane condition, all the ſufficiencie and induſtrie thereof being ſo ſhort and ſo feeble, that it can not finde any certaine, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and conſtant rule, whereby to make an honeſt man: and ſuch order can not be taken, but that the meanes to doe well doe many times hinder one the other. Let vs take for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Charitie and Iuſtice: if I encounter my father or my
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16995:87"/>
friend in the warres, on the enemies part, in iuſtice I ought to kill him, but in charitie I ſhould ſpare and ſaue him. If a man be wounded to the death and paſt all remedie, and that there remaineth nothing but a grieuous languiſhment, it were a deed of charitie to make an end of him, as he did that killed <hi>Saul</hi> at his earneſt intreatie; but this charitie is puniſhed by iuſtice, as he was by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that iuſtly, <hi>Dauid</hi> being the miniſter of publike iuſtice, not priuate charitie: yea, to be found neere vnto a man in ſuch a caſe, in a ſuſpicious place, and where there is doubt of the murderer, although hee be there to performe ſome office of humanitie, is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and the beſt thing that can happen vnto him, is to be called into queſtion, and put to anſwer to that accident whereof he is innocent. So that we ſee that iuſtice doth not only offend charitie, but it hampereth and hindereth it ſelfe: and therefore it was very well ſayd and truly, <hi>Summum ius, ſumma iniuria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third point and the moſt notable is, that a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> many times to vſe badde meanes for the better auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſome great euill, or the execution of what is good, in ſuch ſort that he muſt ſometimes approoue as lawfull, not onely thoſe things that are not good, but that are ſtarke naught; as if to be good, it were neceſſarie to be ſomewhat wicked. And this is ſeene in euery thing, in <hi>Policie, Iuſtice, Veritie, Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Policy,</hi> how many euils are there permitted and publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted, not only by conniuence or permiſſion, but alſo by <note place="margin">7 <hi>Policy.</hi>
                     </note> the approbation of the lawes themſelues? as ſhall heereafter be ſaid in his due place; <hi>ex ſenatuſconſultis &amp; plebeſcitis ſcelera exercentur.</hi> To disburthen a State or Common-weale either of too great a number of people, or of ſuch as are inflamed with a deſire of warres, which the ſtate, like a body repleat with bad or abundant humours, cannot beare, it is the maner to ſend them elſewhere, and to eaſe themſelues at the charge or diſeaſe of another. As the <hi>French, Lombards, Gothes, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales, Tartarians, Turks</hi> haue beene accuſtomed to do. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid a ciuill war, it is the maner to entertaine a ſtrange war. To inſtruct others in the vertue of Temperance, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> cauſed the <hi>Ilotes</hi> their ſeruants to be made drunke, that by the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16995:88"/>
vgly deformity of their ſuperfluous inundation, others might grow into a horror and deteſtation of that ſinne. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> to prepare their people to valour, and a contempt of the dangers of death, ordeined of purpoſe thoſe furious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of the fencers, which at the firſt they ordained for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors, afterwards for ſlaues or ſeruants, but innocents, and laſtly for freemen that gaue themſelues thereunto. Brothell houſes in great Cities, <hi>vſuries, diuorces,</hi> vnder the law of <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and in diuers other nations, and religions, haue beene permitted for the better auoiding of greater miſchiefes, <hi>ad du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiem cordis eorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Iuſtice, which cannot ſubſiſt, cannot be executed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">8 <hi>Iuſtice.</hi>
                     </note> the mixture of ſome wrong, not onely Iuſtice commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, for that is not ſtrange: it is after a ſort neceſſarie, and men could not liue and traffique together, without mutuall dammage, without offence, and the lawes allow of the loſſe which is vnder the moiety of the iuſt price. But alſo Iuſtice diſtributiue, as it ſelfe confeſſeth: <hi>Summum ius, ſumma iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria: &amp; omne magnum exemplum habet aliquid ex iniquo, quod contra ſingulos, vtilitate publica rependitur. Plato</hi> alloweth, and it is not againſt the law, by deceits and falſe hopes of fauour and pardon, to draw the offender to confeſſe his fault. This is by iniuſtice, deceit and impudencie to doe iuſtice. And what ſhould we ſay of the inuention of tortures, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Of tortures.</note> a proofe of patience, than verity? For both hee that can ſuffer them, and cannot, will conceale the truth. For why ſhould griefe cauſe a man rather to ſpeake that which is, than that which is not? If a man thinke that an innocent is patient enough to endure torments, why ſhould not he that is guilty, being a meanes to ſaue his life? <hi>Illa tormenta gubernat dolor, moderatur natura, cuiuſque tum animi, tum corporis regit quaeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, flectit libido, corrumpit ſpes, infirmat metus, vt in tot rerum anguſtijs nil veritati loci relinquatur.</hi> In defence heereof it is ſaid, that tortures doe aſtoniſh and quell the guiltie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from him a truth; and contrariwiſe ſtrengthen the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: but we doe ſo often ſee the contrarie, that this may be doubted; and to ſay the truth, it is a poore meanes full of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, full of doubt. What will not a man ſay, what will he not doe, to auoid ſuch torment? <hi>etenim innocentes mentiri</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:16995:88"/>
                     <hi>cogit dolor,</hi> in ſuch ſort that it falleth out that the iudge which giueth the torture, to the end an innocent ſhould not die, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to die an innocent and tortured too. A thouſand and a thouſand haue falſely accuſed their owne heads, either to ſhorten their torments or their liues. But in the foot of this account is it not a great iniuſtice and crueltie to torment and to racke a man in pieces for that offence which is yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of? To the end they may not kil a man without iuſt cauſe, they doe worſe than kill him: if he be innocent and beare the puniſhment, what amends is made him for his vniuſt torture? He ſhall be quit, a goodly recompence, and much reaſon he hath to thanke you. But it is the leſſer euill that the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man could inuent.</p>
                  <p>If man bee weake in vertue, much more is hee in veritie, whether it be eternall and diuine, or temporall and humane. <note place="margin">9 <hi>Veritie.</hi>
                     </note> That aſtoniſheth him with the lightning, &amp; beats him downe with the thunder thereof, as the bright beames of the ſunne, the weake eie of the owle: if he preſume to behold it, being oppreſſed, he preſently fainteth, <hi>qui ſcrutator est maieſtatis, opprimetur a gloria:</hi> in ſuch ſort that to giue himſelfe ſome breath, ſome taſt, he muſt diſguiſe, temper, and couer it with ſome ſhadow or other. This, that is, humane veritie, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and woundeth him, and he that ſpeakes it, is many times holden for an enemie, <hi>Veritas odium parit.</hi> It is a ſtrange thing, man deſireth naturally to know the truth, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereunto he remooueth all lets whatſoeuer, and yet he can not attaine it: if it be preſent, he can not apprehend it; if he apprehend it, he is offended with it. The fault is not in the truth, for that is alwayes amiable, beautifull, worthie the knowledge; but it is humane imbecillitie that can not endure the ſplendour thereof. Man is ſtrong enough to deſire, but too weake to receiue and holde what he deſireth. The two principall means which he vſeth to attaine to the knowledge of truth, are Reaſon and Experience. Now both of them are ſo feeble &amp; vncertaine (though Experience the more weake) that nothing certaine can be drawen from them. Reaſon hath ſo many formes, is ſo pliable, ſo wauering, as hath been ſaid, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.</note> and Experience much more, the occurrents are alwayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; there is nothing ſo vniuerſall in Nature as diuerſitie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:16995:89"/>
ſo rare and difficult, and almoſt impoſſible, as the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſle and ſimilitude of things: and if a man can not note this diſſimilitude, it is ignorance and weakneſſe; I meane this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, pure, and entire ſimilitude and diſſimilitude: for to ſay the trueth, they are both whole and entire, there is no one thing that is wholly like or diſlike to another. This is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and maruellous mixture of Nature.</p>
                  <p>But after all this, what doth better diſcouer this humane imbecillitie than Religion? yea the very intention thereof is <note place="margin">10 <hi>Religion.</hi>
                     </note> to make man feele his owne euill, his infirmitie, his nothing, and to make him to receiue from God his good, his ſtrength, his all things. Firſt it preacheth it vnto him, it beats it into our memorie, it reprocheth man, calling him duſt, aſhes, earth, fleſh, blood, graſſe. Afterwards it infinuateth it into him, and makes him feele it after an excellent and goodly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; bringing in God himſelfe, humbled, weakened, deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the loue of him, ſpeaking, promiſing, ſwearing, chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, threatning; and to be briefe, conuerſing and working with man after a baſe, feeble humane maner, like a father that counterfeits his ſpeech, and playes the childe with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The weakneſſe of man being ſuch, ſo great, ſo inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, that to giue it ſome acceſſe and commerce with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, and to vnite it vnto God, it was neceſſary that God ſhould debaſe himſelfe to the bafeſt: <hi>Deus quia in altitudine ſua a nobis paruulis apprehendi non poterat, ideo ſe ſtrauit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</hi> Againe, it makes him ſee his owne weakneſſe by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie effects; for all the principall and holieſt exerciſes, the moſt ſolemne actions of religion, are they not the true ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes and arguments of humane imbecillitie and ſickneſſe? Thoſe ſacrifices that in former times haue been vſed thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Sacrifices.</note> the world, and yet in ſome countreys continue, not only of beaſts, but alſo of liuing men, yea of innocents, were they not ſhamefull marks of humane infirmitie and miſerie? Firſt, becauſe they were ſignes and ſymboles of his condemnation and malediction (for they were as publike proteſtations, that he had deſerued death, and to be ſacrificed as thoſe beaſts were) without which there had neuer been any bloodie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings or propitiatorie and expiatorie ſacrifices. Secondly, becauſe of the baſeneſſe of the purpoſe and intent, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16995:89"/>
was to thinke to appeaſe, flatter and gratifie God by the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre and blood of beaſts and of men: <hi>Sanguine non colendus Deus, quae enim ex trucidatione immerentium voluptas eſt?</hi> It is true, that God in thoſe firſt ages, yet the feeble infancie of the world and nature remaining ſimple, did well accept of them at the hands of religious men, euen for their deuotion, or rather Chriſt his ſake: <hi>Reſpexit Dominus ad Abel, &amp; ad munera eius,</hi> taking in good part that which was done with an intent to honour and ſerue him: and alſo afterwards, the world being as yet in it apprentiſhip, <hi>ſub paedagogo,</hi> was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeaſoned in this opinion ſo vniuerſall, that it was almoſt thought naturall. I touch not heere that particular myſterie of the religion of the Iewes, who vſed them for figures (that is a point that belongs to religion) and with whom it was common to conuert that which was humane or naturall and corporall to a holy and ſacred vſe, and to gather from thence a ſpirituall fruit.

The Sacraments in a matter baſe and common, bread and <note place="margin">Sacraments.</note> wine, and an outward action as baſe, are they not teſtimonies of our pouertie and baſeneſſe?

                  <p>All this ſheweth how great this humane weakneſſe is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">11 <hi>In euill.</hi>
                     </note> thing that is good, in Policie, Iuſtice, Veritie, Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, but that which is more ſtrange is, that this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is as great in what is euill: for man though hee be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be wicked, yet hee can not be wholly ſuch, but when he hath done his woorſt there will be more to doe. There is alwayes ſome remorſe and fearefull conſideration, that molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the will and maketh it relent, and ſtill reſerueth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done; which hath beene the cauſe of the ruine of many, although perhaps they made it a proiect for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This is imbecillitie and ſottiſhneſſe, and from hence did ariſe that Prouerbe at their coſt, That a man muſt not play the foole by halfes. A ſpeech vttered with iudgement, but that may haue both a good and an ill ſenſe. To ſay that a man, when hee is once in, muſt ſtill proceed to woorſe and woorſe, without any reſeruation or reſpect, it is a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16995:90"/>
doctrine: and the Prouerbe ſaith well againſt it: The ſhorter follies are the better. But yet in ſome certaine caſes the middle way is verie dangerous, as when a man hath a ſtrong enemie by the throat, like one that holdeth a woolfe by the eares, he muſt either win him altogether by courteſie or vtterly vndo him &amp; extinguiſh him; which was alwayes the practiſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that very wiſely: among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, concerning the <hi>Latines</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> at the exhortation of <hi>Camillus, Pacem in perpetuum parere vel ſeruiendo vel igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendo:</hi> for in ſuch a caſe to doe things by halfes, is to loſe all, as the <hi>Samnites</hi> did, who for want of putting in practiſe that counſell giuen them by an olde weather-beaten ſouldier, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they had then encloſed and ſhut vp, payd dearly for it; <hi>aut conciltandus aut tollendus hoſtis.</hi> The former courſe of courteſie is the more noble, honourable, and rather to be choſen; and wee ought not come to the ſecond but in extremities, and then when the enemie is not capable of the firſt. By this that hath beene ſaid, is ſhewed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame imbecillitie of man in good and euill, and that good or euill which hee either doth or flieth, is not purely and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely good or euill: ſo that it is not in his power to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depriued of all good, nor altogether wicked.</p>
                  <p>Let vs likewiſe note many other effects and teſtimonies of <note place="margin">12 <hi>Reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes.</hi>
                     </note> humane weakneſſe. It is imbecillitie and puſillanimitie not to dare or not to be able to reprehend another, or to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: hee that is feeble or courageous in the one, is ſo in the other. Now it is a ſtrange kinde of delicateneſſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue either himſelfe or another of ſo great a fruit, for ſo light and verball a wound, that doth onely touch and pierce the eare. Neere neighbour vnto this it is, not to be able to giue a deniall with reaſon, nor to receiue and ſuffer a repulſe with patience.</p>
                  <p>In falſe accuſations and wicked ſuſpitions, which are done <note place="margin">13 <hi>Falſe ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.</hi>
                     </note> in place of iuſtice and iudgement, there is double imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; the one in thoſe that are accuſed and ſuſpected, and that is in iuſtifying and excuſing themſelues too carefully, and as it were ambitiouſly. <hi>Mendax infamia terret quem niſi menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem?</hi> This is to betray their owne innocencie, to put their conſcience and their right to comprimiſe and arbitrement;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16995:91"/>
for by ſuch plea <hi>perſpicuitas argumentatione eleuatur. Socrates</hi> in iudgement it ſelfe would not do it, neither by himſelfe nor by another, refuſing to vſe the learned plea of great <hi>Lyſias,</hi> and choſe rather to die. The other is in a contrarie caſe, that is, when the accuſed is ſo couragious that he takes no care to excuſe or iuſtifie himſelfe, becauſe he ſcorneth the accuſation and accuſer, as vnwoorthy his anſwer and iuſtification; and he will not doe himſelfe that wrong to enter the liſts. This courſe hath been practiſed by generous men, by <hi>Scipio</hi> aboue all others, many times out of the maruellous conſtancie of his minde. Now others are offended heerewith, thinking it too great a confidence and pride, and it ſtingeth them, that hee hath too ſenſible a feeling of his innocency, and will not yeeld himſelfe; or imputing this ſilence and contempt to the want of heart, diſtruſt of the law, and inabilitie to iuſtifie himſelfe. O feeble humanitie! the accuſed or ſuſpected, whether hee defend or defend not himſelfe, it is imbecillitie and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. We wiſh a man courage to defend himſelfe, and when he hath done it, wee ſhew our owne weakneſſe by being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with it.</p>
                  <p>Another argument of imbecillitie is, when a man ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and addict himſelfe to a certaine particular forme of life; <note place="margin">14 <hi>Tenderneſſe &amp; delicacie.</hi>
                     </note> this is a baſe kinde of tenderneſſe, and effeminate delicacie, vnworthy an honeſt man, and makes vs vnprofitable, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in conuerſation, and may be hurtfull too in a caſe where change of maners and carriage is neceſſarie. It is likewiſe a ſhame, either not to dare or not to be able to doe that which hee ſeeth euery man to doe beſides himſelfe. It were fitteſt that ſuch people ſhould liue and hide themſelues in the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney corner in their priuate houſes. The faireſt forme of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is to be pliable to all, euen to exceſſe it ſelfe, if need be; to be able, to dare, to know how to doe all things, and yet to doe nothing but what is good. It is good to know all, not to vſe all.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe imbecillity, and a great &amp; vulgar ſottiſhnes, to run after ſtrange and ſcholaſticall examples, after allegations, <note place="margin">15 <hi>Search of bookes.</hi>
                     </note> neuer to ſettle an opinion without teſtimonies in print, nor to beleeue men but ſuch as are in bookes, nor trueth it ſelfe but ſuch as is ancient. By this reaſon fooleries and toyes if they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16995:91"/>
once paſſe the preſſe, they haue credit and dignity enough. Now there are euery day many things done before our eies, which if we had but the ſpirit and ſufficiency well to collect, to ſearch with dexterity to iudge of, and to applie to their times, we ſhould frame and finde miracles and maruellous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which yeeld not in any thing to thoſe of times paſt, which we ſo much admire, and therefore we admire becauſe they are ancient and in print.</p>
                  <p>Againe another teſtimony of weakneſſe is, that man is not <note place="margin">16 <hi>Extremities.</hi>
                     </note> capable but of indifferent things, and cannot endure extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for if they be ſmall and in outward ſhew baſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth and diſdaineth them as vnworthy, and it is offenſiue vnto him to conſider of them: if they be very great and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent, he feares them, he admires them, and is offended with them. The firſt doth principally concerne great and high minds: the ſecond as common with thoſe that are weake.</p>
                  <p>This weakneſſe doth likewiſe appeare in our hearing, <note place="margin">17 <hi>Sudden oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents.</hi>
                     </note> ſight, and in the ſudden ſtroke of a new vnexpected occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which ſurpriſeth and ſeaſeth vpon vs vnawares. For they doe in ſuch ſort aſtoniſh vs, that they take from vs both our ſenſe and ſpeech,
<q>
                        <l>Diriguit viſu in medio, calor oſſa reliquit,</l>
                        <l>Labitur &amp; longo vix tandem tempore fatur,</l>
                     </q>
yea, ſometimes life it ſelfe: whether they be good, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that Romane dame, who died for ioy ſeeing hir ſonne returne ſafe from the warres; <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: or whether they be euill, witneſſe <hi>Diodorus,</hi> who died in the field for ſhame, becauſe he was not able to reſolue a doubt, nor anſwer an argument.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is another imbecillity, and it is twofold, and after <note place="margin">18 <hi>Braueries and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
                     </note> two contrary maners. Some yeeld and are ouercome by the teares and humble ſupplcations of another, and their courage &amp; gallantry is wounded with their words: others quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie are not mooued by all the ſubmiſſions and complaints that may be, but are rather more obdurate and confirmed in their conſtancy and reſolution. There is no doubt but the former proceeds of weakneſſe, and it is commonly found in effeminate and vulgar mindes; but the ſecond is not without
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16995:92"/>
difficultie, and is found in all ſorts of people. It ſhould ſeeme that to yeeld vnto vertue, and to manly &amp; generous ſtrength and vigour, is the part of a valorous and generous minde. It is true if it be done in a reuerent eſteeme of vertue, as <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> did receiuing into grace a ſouldiour whom hee had ſeene to carrie himſelfe valorouſly in fight euen againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; or as <hi>Pompey</hi> did, pardoning the citie of the <hi>Mammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> for the vertue of <hi>Zenon</hi> a citizen thereof; or as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conradus</hi> did, forgiuing the Duke of <hi>Bauiers,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſieged with him, for the magnanimitie of their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who priuily conuaied them away, and tooke the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon their owne heads. But if it be done with a kinde of aſtoniſhment and affright of the power of vertue, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who loſt their hearts hearing <hi>Epaminondas</hi> then accuſed, recount vnto them his honourable acts, and ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproaching them with their ingratitude, it is debility and cowardize. The fact of <hi>Alexander</hi> containing the braue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of <hi>Betis</hi> taken with the citie of <hi>Gaza</hi> where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, was neither weaknes nor courage, but choler, which in him had neither bridle, nor moderation.</p>

                  <p>The firſt point and proofe of the miſerie of man is his <note place="margin">2 <hi>In his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and his end.</hi>
                     </note> birth; his entrance into the world is ſhamefull, vile, baſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; his departure, his death, ruine, glorious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable: whereby it ſeemeth that he is a monſter and againſt nature, ſince there is ſhame in making him, honor in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. <hi>Noſtri noſmet poenitet &amp; pudet.</hi> Heerof a word or two. The action of planting and making man is ſhamefull, and all the parts thereof, the congredients, the preparations, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and whatſoeuer ſerues thereunto is called and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſhamefull, and there is nothing more vncleane in the whole nature of man. The action of deſtroying and killing him honourable, and that which ſerues thereunto glorious: we gild it, we inrich it, we adorne our ſelues with it, we carrie it by our ſides, in our hands, vpon our ſhoulders. We diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to go to the birth of man: euery man runnes to ſee him die, whether it be in his bed, or in ſome publike place, or in the field. When we goe about to make a man, we hide our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſelues, we put out the candle, we do it by ſtealth. It is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and a pompe to vnmake a man, to kill him; wee light the candles to ſee him die, wee execute him at high noone, wee ſound a trumpet, we enter the combat, and we ſlaughter him when the ſunne is at higheſt. There is but one way to beget, to make a man; a thouſand and a thouſand meanes, inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> arts to deſtroy him. There is no reward, honour or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence aſſigned to thoſe that know how to increaſe, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> preſerue humane nature; all honours, greatneſſe, riches, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, empires, triumphs, trophes are appointed for thoſe that know how to afflict, trouble, deſtroy it.

haue ſlaine, ech of them (as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth) more than a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of men, but they made none, left none behinde them.

                     </note> ſmall, naturall and iuſt pleaſures, as I meane to proue, but alſo a forger of thoſe that are euill; it faineth, feareth, flieth, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth as great miſchiefs, things that are not any way euill in themſelues; and in trueth, which beaſts themſelues feare not, but that by his owne proper diſcourſe and imagination they are fained to be ſuch, as not to be aduanced in honour, greatnes, riches, as cuckoldſhip, ſterility, death: for to ſay the truth, there is nothing but griefe it ſelfe that is euill and which is felt. And though ſome wiſe men ſeem to feare theſe things, yet it is not for their owne ſakes, but becauſe of that griefe which ſometimes doth accompany them afterwards: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times it is a fore-runner of death, and ſometimes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the loſſe of goods, of credit, of honour. But take from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16995:94"/>
theſe things grief, the reſt is nothing but fantaſie, which hath no other lodging but in the head of man, which quits it ſelfe of other buſineſſe to be miſerable; and imagineth within it owne bounds, falſe euils beſides the true, employing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his miſerie in ſtead of leſſening and contracting it. Beaſts feele not theſe euils, but are exempted from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature iudgeth them not to be ſuch.</p>
                  <p>As for ſorrow, which is the only true euill, man is wholly borne thereunto, and it is his naturall propertie. The <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes</hi>

All the parts of man are capable of ſorrow; very few of delight. The parts capable of pleaſure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> can not receiue more than one or two ſorts, but all can receiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the greateſt number of griefs all different, heat, colde, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rubbing, trampling, fleaing, beating, boiling, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, extenſion, oppreſſion, relaxation, and infinite others, which haue no proper name, (to omit thoſe of the ſoule) in ſuch ſort, that man is better able to ſuffer them, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them. Man hath no long continuance in pleaſure: for that of the bodie is like a fire of ſtraw: and if it ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it would bring with it much enuie and diſpleaſure: but ſorrowes are more permanent, and haue not their certaine ſeaſons as pleaſures haue. Againe, the empire and command of ſorrow is farre more great, more vniuerſall, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, more durable, and (in a word) more naturall, than that of pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>To theſe three a man may adde other three: Sorrow and griefe is more frequent, and falles out often; Pleaſure is rare. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Euil comes eaſily of it ſelfe, without ſeeking; Pleaſure neuer comes willingly, it muſt be ſought after, and many times we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> pay more for it than it is woorth. Pleaſure is neuer pure, but alwayes diſtempered, and mingled with ſome bitterneſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and there is alwayes ſome thing wanting; but ſorrow and griefe is many times entire and pure. After all this, the worſt of our market, and that which doth euidently ſhew the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our condition, is, that the greateſt pleaſures touch vs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16995:94"/>
not ſo neere, as the lighteſt griefs. <hi>Segnius homines bona, quàm mala ſentiunt,</hi> we feele not ſo much our ſoundeſt health, as the leaſt maladie that is, <hi>pung it in cute vix ſumma violatum plagula corpus, quando valere, nil quenquam monet.</hi>

Firſt by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what is paſt, and the anticipation of what is to come, ſo that we cannot faile to be miſerable, ſince that thoſe things which are principally good in vs, and whereof wee glorie moſt, are inſtruments of miſerie: <hi>futuro torquemur &amp; praeterito, mult a bona noſtra nobis nocent, timoris tormentum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moria reducit, prouidentia anticipat, nemo praeſentibus tantùm miſer est.</hi> It is not enough to be miſerable, but wee muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it by a continual expectation before it come, nay ſeeke it and prouoke it to come, like thoſe that kill themſelues with the feare of death, that is to ſay, either by curioſitie or imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitie, and vaine apprehenſion, to preoccupate euils and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, and to attend them with ſo much paine &amp; ado, euen thoſe which peraduenture will neuer come neere vs?

My meaning is not here to ſpeake of that vertuous and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall premeditation, which is that temper, whereby the ſoule is made inuincible, &amp; is fortified to the proofe againſt all aſſaults and accidents, whereof we ſhall ſpeake heerafter: but <note place="margin">Lib. 2. ca 7.</note> of that fearefull and ſometimes falſe, and vaine apprehenſion of euils that may come, which afflicteth and darkeneth, as it were with ſmoke, all the beauty and ſerenity of the ſoule, troubleth all the reſt and ioy thereof, inſomuch that it were better to ſuffer it ſelfe to be wholly ſurpriſed. It is more eaſie and more naturall not to thinke thereof at all. But let vs leaue this anticipation of euill, for ſimply euery care and painfull thought bleating after things to come by hope, deſire, feare, is a very great miſery. For beſides that we haue not any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer that which is to come, much leſſe ouer what is paſt; (and ſo it is vanity, as it hath been ſaid) there doth ſtil remain vnto vs that euill and dammage, <hi>Calamitoſus eſt animus, futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri anxius,</hi> which robbeth our vnderſtanding, and taketh from vs the peaceable comfort of our preſent good, and will not ſuffer vs to ſettle and content our ſelues therein.</p>
                  <p>But this is not yet enough. For to the end man may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer want matter of miſery, yea that he may alwaies haue his <note place="margin">7 <hi>By vnquiet ſearch.</hi>
                     </note> full, he neuer ceaſeth ſearching and ſeeking with great ſtudy, the cauſes and aliments of miſery. He thruſteth himſelfe into buſineſſe euen with ioy of heart, euen ſuch as when they are offered vnto him, he ſhould turne his backe towards them; and either out of a miſerable diſquiet of mind, or to the end he may ſhew himſelfe to be induſtrious, a man of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vnderſtanding, that is a foole and miſerable too, he enterpriſeth, mooueth, and remooueth new buſineſſe, or els he putteth himſelfe into that of other mens. To be ſhort, he is ſo ſtrongly and inceſſantly moleſted with care, and thoughts not only vnprofitable and ſuperfluous, but painfull and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, tormented with what is preſent, annoied with what is paſt, vexed with that which is to come, that hee ſeemeth to feare nothing more, than that he ſhall not be ſufficiently mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. So that a man may iuſtly crie out, O poore and wretched creatures that you are, how many euils doe you willingly endure, beſides thoſe neceſſarie euils that nature hath beſtowed vpon you? But what? Man contenteth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16995:95"/>
himſelfe in miſerie, he is obſtinate to ruminate &amp; continually to recall to minde his paſſed euils. Complaints are common with him, and his owne euils and ſorrowes ſeeme many times deare vnto him, yea it is a happie thing for ſmall and light occaſions to be termed the moſt miſerable of all others: <hi>est quaedam dolendi voluptas.</hi> Now this is a farre greater miſerie to be ambitiouſly miſerable, than not to know it, not to feele it at all. <hi>Homo animal querulum, cupidè ſuis incumbens miſerijs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will not account it a humane miſerie, ſince it is an euill <note place="margin">8 <hi>By incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibilitie.</hi>

                  <p>So that we ſee man miſerable both naturally and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, <note place="margin">9 <hi>In the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</hi>
                     </note> in truth and by imagination, by obligation and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart. He is too miſerable, and yet he feares he is not miſerable enough, and laboureth to make himſelfe more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Let vs now ſee how. When he feeles any euill, and is annoyed with ſome certaine miſerie (for hee is neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many miſeries that he feeles not) he endeuoureth to quit himſelfe thereof; but what are his remedies? Truly ſuch as importune him more than the euill it ſelfe which hee would cure; in ſuch ſort, that being willing to get forth of one miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he doth but change it into another, and perhaps into a worſe. But what of that, the change it ſelfe perhaps deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, or at leaſt yeelds him ſome ſolace: he thinketh to heale one euill with another euill, which proceedeth from an opinion which the bewitched and miſerable world holdeth; that is, That there is nothing profitable, if it be not painfull. That is woorth nought that coſts nothing, yea eaſe it ſelfe is much ſuſpected. This doth likewiſe proceed from an higher cauſe. It is a ſtrange thing, but true, and which conuicteth man to be miſerable, That no euill can be taken away, but by another euill, whether it be in bodie or in ſoule. Spirituall maladies and corporall are not cured and chaſed away, but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16995:96"/>
by torment, ſorrow, paine. The ſpirituall by repentance, <note place="margin">It was erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, but corrected.</note> watchings, faſtings, impriſonments, which are truly afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch as gaule vs too, notwithſtanding the reſolution and deuotion willingly to endure them: for if we vſe them either for pleaſure or profit, they can worke no effect, but are rather exerciſes of pleaſure, of couetouſneſſe, of houſhold gouernment, than of repentance and contrition of heart. The corporall in like ſort be medicines, inciſions, cauteries, diets, as they well feele that are bound to medicinall rules, who are troubled on the one ſide with the diſeaſe that afflicts them, on the other with that rule, the thought whereof continually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyes them. So likewiſe other euils, as ignorance is cured by great, long and painfull ſtudie: <hi>Qui addit ſcientiam, addit &amp; laborem:</hi> want and pouertie, by great care, watchings, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, ſweatings: <hi>In ſudore vultus tui.</hi> So that both for the ſoule and for the bodie, labour and trauell is as proper vnto man, as it is for a bird to flie.</p>
                  <p>All theſe miſeries aboue mentioned are corporall, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">10 <hi>Spirituall miſeries.</hi>
                     </note> both to the ſpirit and to the body, and mount little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the imagination and fantaſie. Let vs conſider of the more ſubtile and ſpirituall, which are rather to be called mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, as being erroneous and malignant, more actiue and more our owne, but leſſe felt and confeſſed, which makes a man more, yea doubly miſerable, becauſe hee onely feeleth thoſe euils that are indifferent, and not the greater; yea a man dares not touch them, or ſpeake of them, ſo much is he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and ſo deſperate in his miſeries. We muſt therefore by the way as it were, and gently ſay ſomething, at leaſt with the finger point afarre off, to giue him occaſion to conſider and thinke thereof, ſince of himſelfe he hides it not. Firſt, in regard of the vnderſtanding, is it not a ſtrange and a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſerie of humane nature, that it ſhould wholly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of error and blindneſſe? The greater part of common and vulgar opinions, yea the more plauſible, and ſuch as are receiued with reuerence, are falſe and erroneous; and which is woorſe, the greater part vnprofitable for humane ſocietie. And although ſome of the wiſeſt, which are but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, vnderſtand better than the common ſort, and iudge of theſe opinions as they ſhould, neuertheleſſe ſometimes they

                  <p>And this is the cauſe why a Prophet is not eſteemed in his owne countrey.

                  <p n="14">14 To defame and to chaſtiſe ouer-rigorouſly, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, certaine vices as crimes in the higheſt degree villanous and contagious, which are neuertheleſſe but indifferent, and haue their roote and excuſe in nature: and not ſo much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and to chaſtiſe with ſo greedy adoo thoſe vices that are truly great, and againſt nature, as pretended and plotted mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, treaſons, and treachery, cruelty, and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Behold alſo after all this a true teſtimonie of ſpirituall miſerie, but which is wily &amp; ſubtile, and that is, that the ſpirit of man in it beſt temper, and peaceable, ſetled, and ſoundeſt eſtate, is not capable but of common, ordinary, naturall, and indifferent things. To be capable of diuine and ſupernaturall, as of diuination, propheſie, reuclation, inuention, and as a man may ſay, to enter into the cabinet of the gods, he muſt be ſicke, diſplaced from his naturall ſeate, and as it were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>correptus,</hi> either by extrauagancie, extaſie, inſpiration, or by dreaming; inſomuch that the two naturall wayes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine thereunto are either fury, or dead ſleepe. So that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is neuer ſo wiſe, as when it is a foole, nor more awaked, than when it ſleepeth: it neuer meeteth better, than when it goes on one ſide, or croſſeth the way; it neuer mounts or flies ſo high, as when it is moſt deiected. So that it muſt needs be miſerable, becauſe to be happy, it muſt be, as it were loſt, and without it ſelfe. This toucheth not in any ſort the diuine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for God can to whom, and when it pleaſeth him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale himſelfe, man in the meane time continuing ſetled in his ſenſe and vnderſtanding, as the ſcripture makes mention of <hi>Moyſes</hi> and diuers others.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 To conclude, can there be a greater fault in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than not to eſteeme of iudgement, not to exerciſe it, and to preferre the memory, and imagination, or fantaſie before it?

This is many times a vanity, and there appeareth not in it any ſparke of iudgement, or excellent vertue: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the authours themſelues are many times weake and common in iudgement, and in will corrupted: how much better is it, to heare a countrey ſwaine, or a merchant talking in his counting-houſe, diſcourſing of many goodly propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and verities, plainely and truely without arte or forme and giuing good and wholeſome counſell, out of a ſound, ſtrong, and ſolide iudgement?</p>

                  <p>Finally but eſpecially, this preſumption is to be conſidered in man himſelfe, that is to ſay, in regard of himſelfe, and of <note place="margin">6 <hi>Of man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>

This belongeth to the folly, ſimplicitie, tenderneſſe and imbecillitie of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſort of people, of ſpirits effeminate, ſick, ſuperſtitious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, indiſcretly zealous, who like wax do eaſily receiue all impreſſions, ſuffer themſelues to be taken and lead by the eares.

For ſo lightly to beleeue and hold for truth and certaintie that which we know not, or to enquire of the cauſes, reaſons, conſequents, and not of the truth it ſelfe, is to enterpriſe to preſume too much. For from what other cauſe proceeds this? If you ſhall anſwere, from a ſuppoſition that it is true; why this is nothing: a man hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and ſtirreth the foundations and effects of a thouſand things which neuer were, whereby both <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra</hi> are falſe. How many fables, falſe and ſuppoſed miracles, viſions, reuelations, are there receiued in the world that neuer were? And why ſhould a man beleeue a miracle, a thing neither hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16995:103"/>
nor naturall, when he is able by naturall and humane meanes to confute, and confound the truth thereof? Truth and lying haue like viſages, like cariage, reliſh, gate, and we behold them with one and the ſame eye, <hi>it a ſunt finitima falſa veris, vt in praecipitem locum non debeat ſe ſapiens committere.</hi> A man ought not to beleeue that of a man which is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, except he be warranted by ſupernaturall and ſuperhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane approbation, which is only God, who is only to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in that he ſaith, only becauſe he ſaith it.</p>
                  <p>The other contrary vice is an audacious temeritie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and reiect as falſe all things that are not eaſily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and that pleaſe not the palat. It is the propertie of thoſe that haue a good opinion of themſelues, which play the parts of men of dexteritie and vnderſtanding, eſpecially heretikes, <hi>Sophists, Pedanties:</hi> for they finding in themſelues ſome ſpeciall point of the ſpirit, and that they ſee a little more cleerely than the common ſort, they aſſume vnto themſelues law and authoritie to decide and determine all things. This vice is farre greater and more baſe than the former: for it is an enraged folly to thinke to know as much as poſſiblie is to be knowne, the iuriſdiction and limits of nature, the capacitie of the power and will of God, to frame vnto himſelfe and his ſufficiencie the truth and falſhood of things, which muſt needs be in ſo certaine and aſſured reſolution and definition of them: for ſee their ordinarie language, that is falſe, impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, abſurd: and how many things are there which at one time we haue reiected with laughter as impoſſible, which we haue been conſtrained afterwards to confeſſe and approue, yea and others too, more ſtrange than they? And on the other ſide how many things haue wee receiued as articles of our faith, that haue afterwards prooued vanities and lies?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond degree of preſumption, which followeth and commonly proceedeth from the former, is certainly and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatelie <note place="margin">2 <hi>To affirme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.</hi>
                     </note> to affirme or diſprooue that which he hath lightly beleeued or misbeleeued. So that it addeth vnto the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie in opinion, and ſo the preſumption increaſeth. This facilitie to beleeue with time is confirmed, and degenerateth into an obſtinacie inuincible and vncapable of amendment, yea a man proceeds ſo farre in this obſtinacie, that he defends
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16995:103"/>
thoſe things that he knowes and vnderſtands leaſt: <hi>Maiorem fidem homines adhibent ijs quae non intelligunt: cupiditate humani ingenij lubentius obſcura creduntur:</hi> he ſpeaks of all things with reſolution. Now affirmation and opinatiue obſtinacie are ſignes of negligence and ignorance accompanied with follie and arrogancie.</p>
                  <p>The third degree which followeth theſe two, and which <note place="margin">8 3. <hi>To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade.</hi>
                     </note> is the height of preſumption, is to perſwade others to receiue as canonicall whatſoeuer he beleeueth, yea imperiouſly to impoſe a beleefe as it were by obligation, and inhibition to doubt. What tyranny is this? Whoſoeuer beleeueth a thing, thinks it a worke of charitie to perſwade another to beleeue the ſame; and that he may the better do it, he feareth not to adde of his owne inuention ſo much as he ſeeth neceſſarie for his purpoſe to ſupplie that want, and vnwillingnes which he thinks to be in the conceit of another of that he tels. There is nothing vnto which men are commonly more prone, than to giue way to their owne opinions: <hi>Nemo ſibi tantùm errat, ſed alijs erroris cauſa &amp; author eſt.</hi> Where the ordinarie meane wanteth, there a man addeth commandement, force, fire, ſword. This vice is proper vnto dogmatiſts, and ſuch as will gouerne, and giue lawes vnto the world. Now to attaine to the end heereof, and to captiuate the beliefs of men vnto themſelues they vſe two meanes: Firſt they bring in certain generall and fundamentall propoſitions, which they call prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and preſuppoſitions, wherof they ſay we muſt neither doubt nor diſpute; vpon which they afterwards build what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they pleaſe; and leade the world at their pleaſure: which is a mockerie whereby the world is repleniſhed with errours and lies. And to ſay the trueth, if a man ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine theſe principles, he ſhould finde as great or greater vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueths and weakneſſes in them, than in all that which they would haue to depend vpon them, and as great an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of trueth in propoſitions quite contrarie. There haue <note place="margin">Copernicus. Paracelſus.</note> beene ſome in our time that haue changed and quite altered the principles and rules of our Ancients and beſt Profeſſors in <hi>Aſtronomie, Phiſicke, Geometrie,</hi> in nature, and the motion of the windes. Euery humane propoſition hath as much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as another, if reaſon make not the difference. Trueth
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16995:104"/>
dependeth not vpon the authoritie and teſtimonie of man: there are no principles in man if Diuinitie haue not reuealed them; all the reſt is but a dreame and ſmoake. Now theſe great maſters will that whatſoeuer they ſay ſhould be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and receiued, and that euery man ſhould truſt them, without iudging or examining what they teach: which is a tyrannicall iuſtice. God onely (as hath beene ſayd) is to be beleeued in all that he ſaith, becauſe he ſaith it: <hi>Qui a ſemet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſo loquitur mendax eſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other meane is by ſuppoſition of ſome miraculous thing done, new and celeſtiall reuelation and apparition, which hath beene cunningly practiſed by Law-makers, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals in the field, or priuate Captaines. The perſwaſion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ſubiect it ſelfe poſſeſſeth the ſimpler ſort, but at the firſt it is ſo tender and fraile, that the leaſt offence, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or imprudencie that ſhall happen, vndoeth all: for it is a great maruell how from ſo vaine beginnings and friuolous cauſes there ſhould ariſe the moſt famous impreſſions. Now this firſt impreſſion being once gotten, doth woonderfully grow and increaſe, in ſuch ſort that it faſteneth euen vpon the moſt expert and skilfull, by reaſon of the multitude of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, witneſſes, yeeres, wherewith a man ſuffereth himſelfe to be carried, if he ſee not well into it, and be not well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt it: for then it is to ſmall purpoſe to ſpurne againſt it, or to enquire farther into it, but ſimply to beleeue it. The greateſt and moſt powerfull meane to perſwade, and the beſt touch-ſtone of trueth, is multitude of yeeres and beleeuers: now fooles do win the game, <hi>ſanitatis patrocinium est inſanien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium turba.</hi> It is a very difficult thing for a man to reſolue and ſettle his iudgement againſt the common opinion. All this may eaſily appeare by thoſe many impoſtures and fooleries which we haue ſeene to go for miracles, and rauiſh the whole world with admiration, but inſtantly extinguiſhed by ſome accident, or by the exact inquirie of ſuch as are quicke ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who haue cleered and diſcouered the couſenage; which if they had had but time to ripen, and to haue fortified in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they had continued for euer, beene generally receiued and adored. And euen ſuch are diuers others, which by the fauour of Fortune haue paſſed for currant, and gained pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16995:104"/>
beliefe, whereunto men afterwards accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, without any farther deſire to know the thing in it firſt forme and originall, <hi>nuſquam ad liquidum fama perducitur.</hi> And this is the reaſon why there are ſo many kinds of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, ſo many ſuperſtitious cuſtomes of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> which are yet remaining euen in Chriſtendome, and concerning which we can not wholly aſſure the people. By this whole diſcourſe we ſee what we are, and to what we tend, ſince we are lead by ſuch guides.</p>

                  <p>THere is nothing in this lower world wherein there is found ſo great difference as amongſt men, and where the differences are ſo diſtant and diuers in one and the ſame ſubiect and kinde. If a man ſhould beleeue <hi>Plinie, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus, Plutarch,</hi> there are ſhapes of men in ſome countreys, that haue very little reſemblance with ours, and ſome that are of a mixt and doubtfull kind betwixt men and beaſts. There are ſome countreys where men are without heads, carrying their eyes and mouthes in their breſts, where they are <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodites,</hi> where they go with foure feet, where they haue one eye in the forehead, and a head liker to a dogs head than a mans, where they are fiſh from the nauell downwards, and liue in the water; where their women beare children at fiue yeeres of age, and liue but eight; where they haue their head and forhead ſo hard, that iron can not pierce them; where they doe naturally change into wolues and other beaſts, and afterwards into men again; where they are without a mouth, nouriſhing themſelues with the ſmell of certaine odours; where they yeeld a ſeed that is blacke; where they are verie little and dwarfs; where they are very great and giants; where they goe alwayes naked; where they are all hairie;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16995:105"/>
where they ſpeake not, but liue in woods like beaſts, hidden in caues and hollow trees. And in our times we haue diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, ſeene with the eye, and touched with our fingers, where the men are without beards, without vſe of fire, corne, wine; where that is held to be the greateſt beautie, which we account the greateſt deformitie, as hath beene ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Touching the diuerſitie of maners we ſhall ſpeake elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And to omit many of theſe ſtrange wonderments, we know that as touching the viſage, it is impoſſible to find two in all things alike; it may fall out that we may miſtake, and take the one for the other, becauſe of the great reſemblance that may be betweene two; but this muſt be in the abſence of the one, for in the preſence of them both it is eaſie to note a difference, though a man know not how to expreſſe it. In the ſoules of men there is a farre greater difference, for it is not only greater without compariſon betwixt a man and a man, than betwixt a beaſt and a beaſt: but there is greater difference betwixt a man and a man, than a man and a beaſt; for an excellent beaſt comes neerer to a man of the baſeſt ſort and degree, than that man to another great and excellent perſonage. This great difference of men proceedeth from the inward qualities, and from the ſpirit, where there are ſo many parts, ſo many iuriſdictions, ſo many degrees beyond number, that it is an infinit thing to conſider. We muſt now at the laſt learne to know man by thoſe diſtinctions and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are in him, which are diuers, according to the many parts in man, many reaſons, and meanes to compare and conſider of him. We will heere ſet downe fiue princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, vnto which all the reſt may be referred, and generally all that is in man, <hi>Spirit, bodie naturall,</hi> acquired, publike, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, apparent, ſecret: and ſo this fift and laſt conſideration of man ſhall haue fiue parts, which are fiue great and capitall diſtinctions of men, that is to ſay:</p>

So likewiſe not only the colour, the feature, the complexion, the countenance, the manners, are diuers, but alſo the faculties of the ſoule, <hi>plaga coeli non ſolùm ad robur corporum, ſed &amp; animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum facit.

And this is the reaſon why <hi>Cyrus</hi> would not agree to the Perſians to abandon their ſharp and hillie countrie, to goe to another more plaine and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, ſaying, that fat countries and delicate, made men ſoft and effeminate, and fertile grounds barren and infertile ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Following this foundation, we may in groſſe diuide the world into three parts, and all men into three kinds of nature: <note place="margin">2 <hi>The diuiſion of the world into three parts.</hi>
                     </note> we will make three generall ſituations of the world, which are, the two extremities South, and North, and the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them both; euery part and ſituation ſhall haue ſixtie degrees. The Southerne part which is vnder the Aequator, hath thirtie degrees on this ſide the line, thirtie on that, that is to ſay, all that part which is betwixt the two tropicks or ſomewhat more, where are the hot and Southerne countries, <hi>Africke</hi> and <hi>Aethiope,</hi> in the middle betwixt the Eaſt and the Weſt; <hi>Arabia, Calicut,</hi> the <hi>Moluques, Ianes, Taprobana</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orient; <hi>Peru</hi> and the great Seas towards the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16995:106"/>
The other middle part hath thirtie degrees beyond the Tropicks both on this ſide the line and on that, towards the Poles, where are the middle and temperate regions, all <hi>Europe</hi> with the <hi>Mediterrane</hi> Sea in the middle betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt; all <hi>Aſia</hi> both the leſſe and the greater which is towards the Eaſt, with <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> towards the Weſt.

                  <p>As for the differences of the ſpirit, we know that mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <note place="margin">2 <hi>The ſpirit.</hi>

The gards of Princes (yea in the Southerne partes) are Northerne men, as hauing more ſtrength, and leſſe ſubtiltie and malice. So likewiſe the Southerne people are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with great vertues, and ſubiect to great vices, as it is ſaid of <hi>Hannibal:</hi> The Northerne haue goodnes and ſimplicitie. The leſſer and middle ſciences, as policies, lawes, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, are in the middle nations, wherein the greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and policies haue flouriſhed.</p>
                  <p>As touching the third point, religions haue come from the South, Egypt, <hi>Arabia, Chaldea;</hi> more ſuperſtition in <note place="margin">3 <hi>Religion.</hi>

                  <p>As for manners, and firſt touching warres, it is certaine that the greateſt armies, artes, military inſtruments and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">4 <hi>Manners.</hi>
                     </note> haue come from the North. The <hi>Scythians, Gothes, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, Huns, Tartarians, Turks, Germanes,</hi> haue beaten and conquered all other nations, and ranſaked the whole world; and therefore it is a common ſaying, that all euill comes from the North. Single combats came from them. The Northerne people adore a ſword faſtned in the earth, ſaith <hi>Solinus.</hi> To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations they are inuincible, yea to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conquered the reſt of the world, were vtterly deſtroyed by them. They grow weake and languiſh with the Southerne winds, and going towards the South; as the Southerne men comming into the North redouble their forces. By reaſon of their warlike fiercenes, they will not endure to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16995:107"/>
by authority, they loue their libertie, at leaſtwiſe electiue commanders. Touching chaſtitie and iealouſie in the North, ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> one woman to one man; yea, one woman ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth many men, ſaith <hi>Caeſar.</hi> There is no iealouſie, ſaith <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where men and women bathe themſelues together with ſtrangers. In the South <hi>Polygamie</hi> is altogether receiued. All <hi>Africke</hi> adoreth <hi>Venus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solinus.</hi> The Southerns die with iealouſie, and therefore they keepe Eunuches as gardians to their wiues, which their great Lords haue in great number, as they haue ſtables of horſes. Touching crueltie, the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames are alike cruell, but the cauſes are diuers, as we ſhall ſee anon, when we come to ſpeake of the cauſes. Thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the wheele, and ſtaking of men aliue, came from the North: The inhumanities of the <hi>Moſcouites</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> are too well knowne. The <hi>Almanes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> puniſh not their offenders by lawe, but cruelly murther them as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Southerns flea their offenders aliue, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge is ſo great, that they become furious if they be not glutted therewith. In the middle regions they are merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and humane: The <hi>Romans</hi> puniſhed their greateſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with baniſhment. The <hi>Greeks</hi> vſed to put their offenders to death with a ſweet drugge made of a kinde of Hemlocke which they gaue them to drinke: And <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie and courteſie were the conditions of <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> and from thence deriued to the reſt of the world.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of all theſe corporall and ſpirituall differences, is the inequalitie and difference of the inward naturall heate, <note place="margin">5 <hi>The cauſe of the aforeſaid differences.</hi>
                     </note> which is in thoſe countries and peoples, that is to ſay, ſtrong and vehement in the Northerns, by reaſon of the great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cold which incloſeth and driueth the heate into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, as caues and deepe places are hot in winter, ſo mens ſtomacks, <hi>ventres hieme culidiores.</hi> Weake and feeble is the Southerns, the inward heate being diſperſed and drawne into the outward parts, by the vehemencie of the outward heate, as in Sommer vaults and places vnder the earth are cold. Meane and temperate in the middle regions. From this diuerſitie, I ſay, and inequalitie of naturall heat; proceed theſe differences not only corporall, which are eaſie to note, but alſo ſpirituall; for the Southerns by reaſon of their cold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16995:107"/>
are melancholike, and therefore ſtaied, conſtant, contemplatiue, ingenious, religious, wiſe; for wiſdome is in cold creatures, as Elephants, who as they are of all other beaſts the moſt melancholicke, ſo are they more wiſe, docile, religious, by reaſon of their cold bloud. From this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie temperature it likewiſe commeth, that the Southerns are vnchaſte, by reaſon of that frothie, freating, tickling me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, as we commonly ſee in Hares; and cruell, becauſe this freating ſharp melancholie doth violently preſſe the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and reuenge. The Northernes are of a phlegmatick and ſanguine temperature, quite contrarie to the Southerne; and therefore haue contrary qualities, ſaue that they agree in this one, that they are likewiſe cruell and inhumane, but by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, that is, for want of iudgement, whereby like beaſts, they know not how to conteine and gouerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. They of the middle regions are ſanguin and chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, tempered with a ſweete, pleaſant, kindly diſpoſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; they are actiue. We could likewiſe more exquiſitely repreſent the diuers natures of theſe three ſorts of people, by the application and compariſon of all things, as you may ſee in this little Table, where it appeareth that there doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong, and may be referred to the</p>

In the ſecond and middle ſtage are they that are of an indifferent iudgement, make profeſſion of ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> knowledge, dexterity; but do not ſufficiently vnderſtand and iudge themſelues, reſting themſelues vpon that which is commonly held, and giuen them at the firſt hand, without further enquirie of the truth and ſource of things, yea with a perſwaſion that it is not lawfull; and neuer looking farther than where they be, but thinking that it is euery where ſo, or ought to be ſo, and that if it be otherwiſe, they are deceiued,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16995:108"/>
yea, they are barbarous. They ſubiect themſelues to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the municipall lawes of the place where they liue, euen from the time they were firſt hatched, not only by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance and cuſtome, which all ought to do, but euen from the very heart and ſoule, with a perſwaſion that that which is beleeued in their village is the true touchſtone of truth (heere is nothing ſpoken of diuine reuealed truth, or religion) the only, or at leaſt the beſt rule to liue well. Theſe ſorts of people are of the ſchoole and iuriſdiction of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> affirmers, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue men, dogmatiſts, who reſpect more vtilitie than veritie, according to the vſe and cuſtome of the world, than that which is good and true in it ſelfe. Of this condition there are a very great number, and diuers degrees, the principall and moſt actiue amongſt them gouerne the world, and haue the commaund in their hand. In the third and higheſt ſtage are men indued with a quick and cleare ſpirit, a ſtrong, firme, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſolid iudgement, who are not content with a bare affirmation, nor ſettle themſelues in common receiued opinions, nor ſuffer themſelues to be wonne and preoccupated by a publicke and common beleefe, whereof they wonder not at all, knowing that there are many couſenages, deceits &amp; impoſtures recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the world with approbation and applauſe, yea publick adoration and reuerence: but they examin all things that are propoſed, ſound maturely, and ſeeke without paſſion the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, motiues, and iuriſdictions euen to the roote, louing better to doubt, and to hold in ſuſpence their beleefe, than by a looſe and idle facilitie or lightneſſe, or precipitation of iudgement to feede themſelues with lies, and affirme or ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of that thing whereof they can haue no certaine reaſon. Theſe are but few in number, of the Schoole of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> modeſt, ſober, ſtaied, conſidering more the veritie and realitie of things than the vtilitie; who if they be well borne, hauing with that aboue mentioned probitie and gouernment in manners, they are truly wiſe, and ſuch as heere we ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But becauſe they agree not with the common ſort, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching opinions, ſee more clearely, pierce more deeply, are not ſo facill and eaſily drawne to beleeue, they are ſuſpected and little eſteemed of others, who are farre more in number, and held for fantaſticks and philoſophers; a word which they

vſe in a wrong ſenſe, to wrong others. In the firſt of theſe three degrees or orders there is a farre greater number than in the ſecond, and in the ſecond, than in the third. They of the firſt and laſt, the loweſt and higheſt trouble not the world, make no ſtirre, the one for inſufficiencie and weakenes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of too great ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, ſtabilitie, and wiſdome. They of the middle make all the ſtirre, the diſputations that are in the world, a preſumptuous kind of people, alwayes ſtirred, and alwayes ſtirring. They of the lower range, as the bottome, the leeſe, the ſinke, reſemble the earth, which doth nothing but receiue and ſuffer that which comes from aboue. They of the middle reſemble the region of the aire, wherein are formed all the meteors, thunderings, and alterations are made, which afterwards fall vpon the earth. They of the higher ſtage reſemble the firmament it ſelfe, or at leaſt the higheſt region next vnto heauen, pure, cleare, neate, and peaceable. This difference of men proceedeth partly from the nature of the firſt compoſition and temperature of the braine, which is different, moiſt, hot, drie, and that in many degrees, whereby the ſpirits and iudgements are either very ſolid, couragious, or feeble, fearefull, plaine: and partly from inſtruction and diſcipline; as alſo from the experience and practiſe of the world, which ſerueth to put off ſimplicitie, and to become more aduiſed. Laſtly, all theſe three ſorts of people are found vnder euery robe; forme and condition both of good and euill men, but diuerſly.</p>
                  <p>There is another diſtinction of ſpirits and ſufficiencies, for ſome there are that make way themſelues, and are their owne <note place="margin">2 <hi>Another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</hi>
                     </note> guides and gouernours. Theſe are happie, of the higher ſort, and very rare; others haue neede of help, and theſe are of two ſorts. For ſome neede only a little light, it is enough if they haue a guide and a torch to goe before them, they will willinglie and eaſily follow. Others there are that muſt be drawen, they neede a ſpurre, and muſt be led by the hand. I ſpeake not of thoſe that either by reaſon of their great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot, as they of the lower range, or the malignitie of their nature will not, as they of the middle, who are neither good to follow, nor will ſuffer themſelues to be drawen and directed, for theſe are a people paſt all hope.</p>

Now before we begin, it ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie ſummarily to ſpeake of commanding and obeying, two foundations and principall cauſes of theſe diuerſities of eſtates and charges.</p>

                  <p>THeſe, as hath beene ſayd, are the two foundations of all humane ſocietie, and the diuerſitie of eſtates and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They are Relatiues, they do mutually reſpect, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and conſerue one the other, and are alike required in all aſſemblies and communities; but are yet ſubiect to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinde of enuie, and an euerlaſting conteſtation, complaint and obtrectation. The popular eſtate make the Souereigne of woorſe condition than a Carter. The Monarchie placeth him aboue God himſelfe. In commanding is the honour, the difficultie (theſe two commonly go together) the goodneſſe, the ſufficiencie, all qualities of greatneſſe. Command, that is to ſay, ſufficiencie, courage, authority, is from heauen and of God, <hi>imperium non niſi diuino fato datur: omnis poteſtas a Deo eſt:</hi> And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> was wont to ſay, That God did not appoint and eſtabliſh men, that is to ſay, men of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort and ſufficiencie, and purely humane, to rule others, but ſuch as by ſome diuine touch, ſingular vertue, and gift of heauen, do excell others: and therefore they are called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes.</hi> In obeying is vtilitie, procliuitie, neceſſitie, in ſuch ſort, that for the preſeruation of the weale publike it is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie than well to command; and the deniall of obedience, or not to obey as men ſhould, is farre more dangerous than for a Prince not to command as he ſhould. Euen as in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, though the husband and the wife be equally obliged to loialtie and fidelitie, and haue both bound themſelues by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the ſame words, the ſame ceremonies and ſolemnities, yet notwithſtanding the inconueniences are incomparably farre greater, in the fact of adulterie, in the wife than the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: euen ſo, though command and obedience are equally required in euery ſtate and companie, yet the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of diſobedience in ſubiects are farre more dangerous than of ill gouernment in a Commander. Many States haue a long time continued and proſpered too vnder the command of wicked Princes and Magiſtrates, the ſubiects obeying and accommodating themſelues to their gouernment: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wiſe man being once asked why the Common-wealth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16995:111"/>
of <hi>Sparta</hi> was ſo flouriſhing, and whether it were becauſe their Kings commanded well? Nay rather, ſaith he, becauſe the Citizens obey well. For if the ſubiects once refuſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and ſhake off their yoke, the ſtate muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground.</p>

                  <p>NOtwithſtanding the ſtate of marriage be the firſt, more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ancient and moſt important, and as it were the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fountaine of humane ſocietie, whence ariſe families, and from them Common-weales, <hi>Prima ſocietas in coniugio eſt, quod principium vrbis, ſeminarium Reipublicae;</hi> yet it hath been contemned and defamed by many great perſonages, who haue iudged it vnwoorthy men of heart and ſpirit, and haue framed many obiections againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they account the band and obligation thereof vniuſt, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Obiections againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>
                     </note> a hard and ouerſtreight captiuitie, inſomuch, that by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age a man is bound and enthralled to the cares and humours of another. And if it fall out, that hee haue miſtaken in his choice, and haue met with a hard bargaine, more bone than fleſh, his life is euer afterwards moſt miſerable. What ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and iniuſtice can there be greater than for one houres follie, a fault committed without malice, and by meere ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, yea many times to obey the aduice of another, a man ſhould be bound to an euerlaſting torment? It were better for him to put the halter about his necke, and to caſt himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea, his head downward, to end his miſerable life, than to liue alwayes in the paines of hell, and to ſuffer without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion on his ſide, the tempeſt of iealouſie, of malice, of rage, of madneſſe, of brutiſh obſtinacie, and other miſerable conditions: and therefore one ſticks not to ſay, That he that inuented this knot and tie of marriage, had found a goodly and beautifull meanes to be reuenged of man, a trap or gin to intangle beaſts, and afterwards to make them languiſh at a little fire. Another ſaith, That to marrie a wiſe man to a foole, or a foole to a wiſe man, is to binde the liuing to the dead, which was the cruelleſt death inuented by Tyrants, to make the liuing to languiſh and die by the companie of the dead.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16995:112"/>
Secondly, they ſay that mariage is a corruption and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of good and rare ſpirits; inſomuch that the flatteries and ſmooth ſpeaches of the partie beloued, the affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards children, the care of houſhold affaires, and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their famelies, do leſſen, diſſolue, and mollifie the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſtrength of the moſt liuely and generous ſpirit that is, witneſſe <hi>Samſon, Salomon, Marc. Antony.</hi> And therefore howſoeuer the matter goe, we had not neede to marry. But thoſe that haue more fleſh than ſpirit, ſtrong in bodie, and weake in minde, tie them to the fleſh, and giue them the charge of ſmall and baſe matters, ſuch as they are capable of. But ſuch as are weake of body, haue their ſpirits great, ſtrong, and puiſtant, is it not then a pitie to binde them to the fleſh, and to mariage, as men doe beaſts in a ſtable? We ſee that beaſts the more noble they are, the ſtronger and fitter for ſeruice, as horſes and dogs, the more are they kept aſunder from the companie and acquaintance of the other ſex, and it is the maner to put beaſts of leaſt eſteeme at randon together. So likewiſe ſuch men and women as are ordeined to the moſt venerable and holieſt vocation, and which ought to be as the creame and marrow of Chriſtianitie, Church-men and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, are (though not by any warrant from the word of God) excluded from mariage. And the reaſon is, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage hindreth and auerteth thoſe beautifull and great eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoule, the contemplation of things, high, celeſtiall, and diuine, which is incompatible with the troubles and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations of domeſticall affaires; for which cauſe the Apoſtle preferreth the ſolitarie continent life before mariage. Vtilitie may well hold with mariage, but honeſtie is on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it troubleth beautifull and holy enterpriſes: as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> reporteth, that hauing determined with ſome other his friends, among whom there were ſome maried, to retire themſelues from the citie, and the company of men, the better to attend to the ſtudie of wiſdome and vertue, their purpoſe was quickly broken and altered by the wiues of thoſe that were maried. And another wiſeman did not doubt to ſay, that if men could liue without women, they ſhould be viſited and accompaned by Angels. Moreouer, mariage is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16995:112"/>
to ſuch as delight in trauell and to ſee ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whether to learne to make themſelues wiſe, or to teach others to be wiſe, and to publiſh that to others which they know. To conclude, mariage doth not only corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect good and great ſpirits, but it robbeth the weale-publicke of many beautifull and great things, which cannot manifeſt themſelues remaining in the boſome and lap of a woman, or being ſpent about young children. But is it not a goodly ſight, nay a great loſſe, that he that is able for his wiſdome and policie to gouerne the whole world, ſhould ſpend his time in the gouernment of a woman and a few children? And therefore it was well anſwered by a great perſonage being ſollicited to marry, That he was borne to command men, not a woman, to counſell Kings and Princes, not little children.</p>
                  <p>To all this a man may anſwere, that the nature of man is <note place="margin">3 <hi>The anſwere to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Cap.</hi> 4.</note> not capable of perfection, or of any thing againſt which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be obiected, as hath elſewhere beene ſpoken. The beſt and moſt expedient remedies that it hath, are in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other but ſickly, mingled with diſcommodities: They are all but neceſſarie euils. And this is the beſt that man could deuiſe for his preſeruation and multiplication. Some (as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and others) would more ſubtillie haue inuented meanes to haue auoided theſe thornie inconueniences; but beſides that they built caſtels in the aire, that could not long continue in vſe, their inuentions likewiſe if they could haue been put in practiſe, would not haue been without many diſcommodities and difficulties. Man hath been the cauſe of them, and hath himſelfe brought them forth by his vice, intemperancie, and contrarie paſſions; and we are not to accuſe the ſtate, nor any other but man, who knowes not well how to vſe any thing. Moreouer a man may ſay, that by reaſon of theſe thornes and difficulties, it is a ſchoole of vertue, an apprentiſhip, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and domeſticall exerciſe: and <hi>Socrates</hi> a doctor of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did once ſay to ſuch as hit him in the teeth with his wiues pettiſh frowardnes, That he did thereby learne euen within his owne dores, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant and patient euery where elſe, and to thinke the croſſes of fortune to be ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant vnto him. It is not to be denied but that he that can liue vnmaried, doth beſt: but yet for the honour of mariage, a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16995:113"/>
man may ſay, that it was firſt inſtituted by God himſelfe in Paradiſe before any other thing, and that in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and perfection. See heere foure commendations of mariage, but the fourth paſſeth all the reſt, and is without replie. Afterwards the Sonne of God approued it, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with his preſence at the firſt miracle that he wrought, and that miracle done in the fauour of that ſtate of mariage and maried men; yea he hath honored it with this priuiledge, that it ſerueth for a figure of that great vnion of his with the Church, and for that cauſe it is called a myſterie and great.</p>
                  <p>Without all doubt, mariage is not a thing indifferent: It is either wholly a great good, or a great euill, a great content, or <note place="margin">4 <hi>Wholly good, or wholly ill.</hi>
                     </note> a great trouble, a paradiſe or a hell: It is either a ſweet and pleaſant way, if the choice be good, or a rough and dangerous march, and a gauling burthenſome tye, if it be ill: It is a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine where truly that is verified which is ſaid, <hi>Homo homini deus, aut lupus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mariage is a worke that conſiſteth of many parts; there muſt be a meeting of many qualities, many conſiderations <note place="margin">5 <hi>A good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, a rare good.</hi>
                     </note> beſides the parties maried. For whatſoeuer a man ſay, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth not only for himſelfe; his poſteritie, familie, alliance, and other meanes, are of great importance, and a greeuous burthen. See heere the cauſe why ſo few good are found; and becauſe there are ſo few good found, it is a token of the price and value thereof: it is the condition of all great charges: Royaltie is full of difficultie, and few there are that exerciſe it well and happily. And whereas we ſee many times that it falleth not out ſo luckely, the reaſon thereof is the licentious libertie, and vnbridled deſire of the perſons themſelues, and not in the ſtate and inſtitution of mariage: and therefore it is commonly more commodious, and better fitted in good, ſimple, and vulgar ſpirits, where delicacie, curioſitie, and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are leſſe troubleſome: vnbridled humours and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wauering minds are not fit for this ſtate or degree.</p>
                  <p>Mariage is a ſtep to wiſdome, a holie and inuiolable band, an honorable match. If the choyce be good and well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">6 <hi>A ſimple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and ſummary of mariage.</hi>
                     </note> there is nothing in the world more beautifull: It is a ſweet ſocietie of life, full of conſtancie, truſt, and an infinite number of profitable offices and mutuall obligations: It is a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16995:113"/>
fellowſhip not of loue, but amitie. For loue and amitie are as different, as the burning ſick heate of a feuer, from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate of a ſound bodie. Mariage hath in it ſelfe amitie, vtilitie, iuſtice, honor, conſtancie, a plaine pleaſure, but ſound, firme, and more vniuerſall. Loue is grounded vpon pleaſure only, and it is more quicke, piercing, ardent. Few mariages ſucceede well that haue their beginnings and progreſſe from beautie and amorous deſires. Mariage hath neede of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more ſolid and conſtant; and we muſt walke more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; this boyling affection is worth nothing: yea mariage hath a better conduct by a third hand.</p>
                  <p>Thus much is ſaid ſummarily and ſimplie; but more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to deſcribe it, we know that in Mariage there are two <note place="margin">7 <hi>A deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more exact.</hi>
                     </note> things eſſentiall vnto it, and ſeeme contraries, though indeed they be not; that is to ſay, an equalitie ſociable, and ſuch as is betweene Peeres: and an inequalitie, that is to ſay, ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and inferioritie. The equalitie conſiſteth in an entire and perfect communication and communitie of all things, ſoules, wills, bodies, goods, the fundamentall law of Mariage, which in ſome places is extended euen to life and death, in ſuch ſort, that the husband being dead, the wife muſt incontinently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. This is practiſed in ſome places by the publick lawes of the countries, and many times with ſo ardent affection, that many wiues belonging to one husband, they contend, and publicklie pleade for the honor to goe firſt to ſleepe with their ſpouſe (that is their word) alleaging for themſelues the better to obtaine their ſuite, and preferment heerein, their good ſeruice, that they were beſt beloued, had the laſt kiſſe of their deceaſed husband, and haue had children by him.</p>

                  <p>In other places it was obſerued, not by publicke lawes, but priuate compacts and agreements of mariage, as betwixt <hi>Marc. Antony,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> This equalitie doth likewiſe conſiſt in that power which they haue in commune ouer their family, whereby the wife is called the companion of her husband, the miſtris of the houſe and family, as the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16995:114"/>
the maſter and lord: And their ioint authoritie ouer their family is compared to an <hi>Aristocracie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſtinction of ſuperioritie and inferioritie conſiſteth in this, that the husband hath power ouer the wife, and the <note place="margin">8 <hi>Inequalitie.</hi>
                     </note> wife is ſubiect to the husband. This agreeth with all lawes and policies; but yet more or leſſe according to the diuerſitie of them. In all things the wife, though ſhe be far more noble, and more rich, yet is ſubiect to the husband. This ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and inferioritie is naturall, founded vpon the ſtrength and ſufficiencie of the one, the weaknes and inſufficiencie of the other. The Diuines ground it vpon other reaſons drawen from the Bible: Man was firſt made by God alone and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, expreſly for God his head, and according to his image, and perfect, for nature doth always begin with things perfect. The woman was made in the ſecond place, after man, of the ſubſtance of man, by occaſion and for another thing, <hi>mulier eſt vir occaſionatus,</hi> to ſerue as an aide and as a ſecond to man, who is her head, and therefore imperfect. And this is the difference by order of generation. That of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſinne proueth the ſame, for the woman was the firſt in preuarication, and by hir own weakenes and will did ſinne, man the ſecond, and by occaſion of the woman; the woman then the laſt in good and in generation, and by occaſion, the firſt in euill and the occaſion thereof, is iuſtly ſubiect vnto man, the firſt in good, and laſt in euill.</p>
                  <p>This ſuperioritie and power of the husband hath beene in ſome places ſuch as that of the father, ouer life and death, as <note place="margin">9 <hi>The power of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi> Dion. Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. l. 2. Lib. 2. Lib. 6. bel. Gal.</note> with the <hi>Romans</hi> by the law of <hi>Romulus:</hi> and the husband had power to kill his wife in foure caſes, <hi>Adulterie, Suborning of children, counterfeiting of falſe keyes,</hi> and <hi>drinking of wine.</hi> So likewiſe with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as <hi>Polybius,</hi> and the ancient <hi>French,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> affirmeth, the power of the husband was ouer the life and death of his wife. Elſwhere, and there too, afterwards this power was moderated; but almoſt in all places the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the husband and the ſubiection of the wife doth inferre thus much, That the husband is maſter of the actions and vowes of his wife, and may with words correct her and hold her to the ſtocks (as for blowes, they are vnworthy a woman of honour or honeſtie, ſaith the Law) and the wife is bound
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16995:114"/>
to holde the condition, follow the qualitie, countrey, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, habitation and rancke of her husband, ſhe muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie and follow him in all things, in his iourneys if need be, his baniſhment, his impriſonment, yea a wandring perſon, a vagabond, a fugitiue. The examples heereof are many and excellent, of <hi>Sulpitia,</hi> who followed her husband <hi>Lentulus</hi> being baniſhed into <hi>Cicilie; Erithrea</hi> her husband <hi>Phalaris; Ipſicrates</hi> the wife of King <hi>Mithridate</hi> vanquiſhed by <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> who wandred thorow the world. Some adde vnto this, That wiues are to follow their husbands euen in the warres, and into thoſe prouinces whither the husband is ſent with publike charge. Neither can the wife bring any thing into queſtion of law, whether ſhe be plaintiffe or defendant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Corn. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</note> the authority of her husband, or of the Iudge, if he refuſe; neither can ſhe call her husband into iudgement, without the permiſſion of the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Marriage is not carried after one and the ſame faſhion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">10 <hi>The diuers rules of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>
                     </note> hath it in euery place the ſame lawes and rules, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuerſitie of religions and countreys, it hath rules either more eaſie or more ſtreight: according to the rules of Chriſtianitie of all others the ſtreighteſt, marriage is more ſubiect, and held more ſhort. There is nothing but the entrance left free, the continuance is by conſtraint, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome thing els than our owne willes. Other nations and religions, to make marriage more eaſie, free, and fertile, haue receiued and practiſed <hi>Polygamie</hi> and repudiation, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to take and leaue wiues: they accuſe Chriſtianitie for taking away theſe two, by which meanes amity and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the principall ends of marriage, are much preiudiced, inaſmuch as amitie is an enemie to all conſtraint, and they doe better maintaine themſelues in an honeſt libertie; and multiplication is made by the woman, as Nature doth richly make knowen vnto vs in wolues, of whom the race is ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile in the production of their yoong, euen to the number of twelue or thirteene, that they farre excell all other profitable creatures: of theſe there are great numbers killed euery day, by which meanes there are but few, and they though of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the moſt fertile, yet by accident the moſt barren: the reaſon is becauſe of ſo great a number as they bring, there is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16995:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one only female, which for the moſt part beareth not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the multitude of males that concurre in the generation, of which the greateſt part die without fruit, by the want of females. So likewiſe we may ſee how much <hi>Polygamy</hi> helpeth to multiplication in thoſe nations that receiue it, Iewes, Turks and other Barbarians, who are able to raiſe forces of three or foure thouſand fighting men fit for warres. Contrariwiſe, in Chriſtendome there are many linked together in matrimony, the one of which, if not both, are barren, which being placed with others, both the one and the other may happely leaue great poſteritie behinde them. But to ſpeake more truly, all his fertilitie conſiſteth in the fertilitie of one only woman. Finally, they obiect, That this Chriſtianlike reſtraint is the cauſe of many laſciuious pranks and adulteries. To all which we may anſwer, That Chriſtianitie conſidereth not of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by reaſons purely humane, naturall, temporall; but it beholds it with another viſage, and weigheth it with reaſons more high and noble, as hath beene ſaid. Adde vnto this, That experience ſheweth in the greateſt part of marriages, that conſtraint increaſeth amitie, eſpecially in ſimple and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonaire mindes, who doe eaſily accommodate themſelues where they finde themſelues in ſuch ſort linked. And as for laſciuious and wicked perſons, it is the immodeſtie of their maners that makes them ſuch, which no libertie can amend. And to ſay the truth, Adulteries are as common where Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamie and repudiation are in force; witneſſe the Iewes and <hi>Dauid,</hi> who for all the wiues that hee had could not defend himſelfe from it: and contrariwiſe, they haue beene a long time vnknowen in policies well gouerned, where there was neither Polygamie nor repudiation; witneſſe <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> a long time after the foundation. And therefore it is abſurd to attribute it vnto religion, which teacheth nothing but puritie and continencie.</p>
                  <p>The libertie of Polygamie which ſeemeth in ſome ſort na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, <note place="margin">11 <hi>Polygamie diuers.</hi>
                     </note> is caried diuerſly according to the diuerſitie of nations and policies.

                     </note> ſome, as the <hi>Hebrewes, Greeks, Armenians,</hi> the cauſe of the ſeparation is not expreſſed, and it is not permitted to retake the wife once repudiated, but yet lawfull to marry another. But by the law of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> the ſeparation is made by the Iudge, with knowledge taken of the cauſe (except it be by mutuall conſent) which muſt be adulterie, ſterilitie, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patibilitie of humours, an enterpriſe on his, or hir part againſt the life of each other, things directly and eſpeciallie contrarie to the ſtate and inſtitution of mariage: and it is lawfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take one another as often as they ſhall thinke good. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeemeth to be the better, becauſe it bridleth proud wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ouer-ſharp and bitter husbands: The ſecond, which is to expreſſe the cauſe, diſhonoureth the parties, &amp; diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many things which ſhould be hid. And if it fall out that the cauſe be not ſufficientlie verified, and that they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue together, poyſonings and murthers doe commonly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, many times vnknowne vnto men: as it was diſcouered at <hi>Rome</hi> before the vſe of repudiation, where a woman being apprehended for poyſoning of her husband, accuſed others, and they others too to the number of threeſcore and ten, which were all executed for the ſame offence. But the worſt law of all others hath beene, that the adulterer eſcapeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt euery where without puniſhment of death, and all that is laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him is diuorce &amp; ſeparation of companie, brought in by <hi>Iustinian,</hi> a man whollie poſſeſſed by his wife, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed whatſoeuer lawes to paſſe that might make for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of women.

                  <p>THere are many ſorts and degrees of authoritie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power, Publicke, and Priuate; but there is none <note place="margin">1 <hi>Fatherly power.</hi>

In former times almoſt euery where it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and vniuerſall ouer the life and death, the libertie, the goods, the honor, the actions and cariages of their children, as to plead, to marie, to get goods: as namely with the <hi>Romans</hi> by the expreſſe law of <hi>Romulus, parentum in liberos omne ius esto, relegendi, vendendi, occidendi;</hi> except only children vnder <note place="margin">Dion.

And it ſhould ſeeme by that fact of <hi>Abraham</hi> going about to kill his ſonne, that this power was likewiſe vnder the law of nature: for if it had been againſt his dutie, and without the power of the father, he had neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereunto, neither had hee euer thought that it was God that commanded him to do it, if it had beene againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And therefore we ſee that <hi>Iſaac</hi> made no reſiſtance, nor alledged his innocencie, knowing that it was in the power of his father: which derogateth not in any ſort from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he would not ſacrifice his ſonne by vertue of his right or power, nor for any demerit of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but only to obey the commandement of God. So likewiſe it was in force by the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note> moderated. So that we ſee what this power hath been in ancient times in the greateſt part of the world, and which endured vnto the time of the Romane Emperours. With the Greeks it was not ſo great and abſolute, nor with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians: neuertheleſſe, if it fell out, that the father had killed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16995:116"/>
his ſonnes wrongfully and without cauſe, he had no other puniſhment, but to be ſhut vp three daies together with the dead bodie.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſons and fruits of ſo great and abſolute a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">2 <hi>The reaſons and fruits thereof.</hi>
                     </note> of fathers ouer their children, neceſſarie for the culture of good maners, the chaſing away of vice, and the publike good, were firſt to holde the children in awe and dutie: and ſecondly, becauſe there are many great faults in children, that would eſcape vnpuniſhed, to the great preiudice of the weale publike, if the knowledge and puniſhment of them were but in the hand of publike authoritie, whether it be becauſe they are domeſticall and ſecret, or becauſe there is no man that will proſecute againſt them: for the parents who know them and are intereſſed in them will not diſcredit them; beſides that, there are many vices and inſolencies that are neuer puniſhed by iuſtice. Adde heereunto, that there are many things to be tried, and many differences betwixt parents and children, brothers and ſiſters, touching their goods or other matters, which are not fit to be publiſhed, which are extinct and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by this fatherly authoritie. And the law did alwayes ſuppoſe, that the father would neuer abuſe this authoritie, becauſe of that great loue which he naturally carrieth to his children, incompatible with crueltie; which is the cauſe that in ſtead of puniſhing them with rigour, they rather become interceſſours for them, when they are in danger of the law: and there can be no greater torment to them, than to ſee their children in paine. And it falleth out very ſeldome or neuer, that this power is put in practiſe without very great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that it was rather a ſcarcrow to children and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, than a rigour in good earneſt.</p>
                  <p>Now this fatherly power (as ouer-ſharpe and dangerous) is almoſt of it ſelfe loſt and aboliſhed (for it hath rather hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">3 <hi>The decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16995:117"/>
that is to ſay, ſince the foundation of <hi>Rome.</hi> In former times, if it fell out that the father killed his children, he was not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <note place="margin">Saluſt. in bel.

Theſe latter lawes come ſomewhat neere the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> which would, That at the only complaint of the father made before the Iudge, without any other knowledge taken of the cauſe, the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and contumacious childe ſhould be ſtoned to death; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the preſence of the Iudge, to the end the puniſhment ſhould not be done in ſecret or in choler, but exemplarilie. So that according to <hi>Moyſes</hi> this fatherly power was more free and greater, than it hath beene after the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; but afterwards vnder <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and finally vnder <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> it was almoſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extinct. From whence it is, that children haue learned to denie their obedience to their parents, their goods, their aide, yea to wage law againſt them; a ſhamefull thing to ſee our Courts full of theſe caſes. Yea, they haue beene diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heerewith vnder pretext of deuotion and offerings, as with the Iewes before Chriſt, wherwith he reprocheth them: <note place="margin">Matt. 15.</note> and afterwards in Chriſtianitie; according to the opinion of ſome: yea, it hath beene lawfull to kill them either in their owne defence, or if they were enemies to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale: although, to ſay the truth, there ſhould neuer becauſe iuſt enough for a ſonne to kill his father. <hi>Nullum tantum ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus admitti poteſt a patre, quod ſit parricidio vindicandum, &amp; nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſcelus rationem habet.</hi>

                  <p>There are foure ſorts, Naturall, that is, ſlaues borne; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Diſtinction.</hi>

hole in their eare in token of perpetuall ſeruitude. And this kind of voluntarie captiuitie, is the ſtrangeſt of all the reſt, and almoſt againſt nature.</p>
                  <p>It is couetouſneſſe that is the cauſe of ſlaues enforced; and lewdneſſe the cauſe of voluntaries. They that are Lords and <note place="margin">3 <hi>The cauſe of Slaues.</hi>
                     </note> Maſters haue hoped for more gaine and profit by keeping, than by killing them: and indeed the faireſt poſſeſſions and the richeſt commodities, were in former times ſlaues.

                  <p>It is a ſtrange thing to reade of thoſe cruelties practiſed by Lords vpon their ſlaues, euen by the approbation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <note place="margin">4 <hi>The cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Lords againſt their ſlaues.</hi>
                     </note> of the lawes themſelues: They haue made them to till the earth being chained together, as the manner is in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> at this day; they lodge them in holes and ditches; and being old, or impotent, and ſo vnprofitable, they ſell them, or drowne them, and caſt them into lakes to feed their fiſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: They kill them not only for the leaſt fault that is, as the breaking of a glaſſe, but for the leaſt ſuſpition, yea, for their owne pleaſure and paſtime, as <hi>Flaminius</hi> did, one of the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt men of his time: And to giue delight vnto the people, they were conſtrained in their publicke Theaters to kill one another.

                  <p>The power and authoritie of maſters ouer their ſeruants, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> is not very great, nor imperious, and in no ſort can be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the libertie of ſeruants; only they may chaſtiſe and correct them with diſcretion and moderation.

all the good that is in it appeareth outwardly, and all the ill is altogether inward: As alſo becauſe to commaund others, is a thing as beautifull and diuine, as great and difficult; and for this cauſe they are eſteemed and reuerenced for more than men. Which beliefe in the people, and credit of theirs is very neceſſarie and commodious to extort from the people due reſpect and obedience, the nource of peace and quietnes. But in the end they prooue to be men caſt in the ſame mould that other men are, and many times worſe borne, and worſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in nature than many of the common ſort of people. It ſeemeth that their actions becauſe they are weightie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, doe proceed from weightie and important cauſes: but they are nothing, and of the ſame condition that other mens are. The ſame occaſion that breeds a brawle betwixt vs and our neighbour, is ground enough of a warre betwixt Princes: and that offence for which a Lackey deſerues a whipping, lighting vpon a King, is the ruine of a whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince. They will as lightly as we, and we as they, but they can do more than we: the ſelfe-ſame appetites moue a flie and an elephant. Finally, beſides theſe paſſions, defects, and naturall conditions which they haue common with the meaneſt of thoſe that doe adore them, they haue likewiſe vices and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities which their greatnes and ſoueraigntie beares them out in, peculiar vnto themſelues.</p>

name and title of a ſoueraigne, the ſhew and outſide is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, pleaſant, and ambitious; but the burthen and the inſide is hard, difficult, and yrkſome. There is honor enough, but little reſt and ioy, or rather none at all: It is a publicke and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeruitude, a noble miſerie, a rich captiuitie, <hi>Aureae &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidae compides, clara miſeria;</hi> witneſſe that which <hi>Augustus, Marcus Aurelius, Pertinax, Diocletian,</hi> haue ſaid and done, and the end that almoſt all the firſt twelue <hi>Ceſars</hi> made, and many others after them. But becauſe few there are that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this, but ſuffer themſelues to be deceiued by the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhew, I will more particularly quote the inconueniences and miſeries that accompanie great Princes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the great difficultie to play their part, and to quit themſelues of their charge: for can it be but a great burthen <note place="margin">8 1 <hi>In their charge.</hi>
                     </note> to gouerne ſo many people, ſince in the ruling of himſelfe there are ſo many difficulties? It is an eaſier matter and more pleaſant to follow, than to guide; to trauell in a way that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie traced, than to finde the way; to obey, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; to anſwere for himſelfe only, than for others too; <hi>vt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius multo iam ſit parere quietum, quàm regere imperio res velle.</hi> Adde heereunto that it is required that he that commandeth muſt be a better man, than he that is commanded: ſo ſaid <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> a great Commander. How difficult a thing this is, we may ſee by the paucitie of thoſe that are ſuch as they ought to be. <hi>Vespaſian,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> was the only Prince that in goodnes excelled his predeceſſors: and another ſticks not to ſay, that all the good Princes may be grauen in a ring.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in their delights and pleaſures, wherein it is thought they haue a greater part than other men. But they <note place="margin">9 2 <hi>In the pleaſures and actions of their life.</hi>
                     </note> are doubtleſſe of a worſe condition than the pleaſures of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men: for beſides that the luſtre of their greatnes makes them vnfit to take ioy in their pleaſures, by reaſon that they are too cleare and apparent, and made as a butt and ſubiect to cenſure, they are likewiſe croſt and peered into euen to their very thoughts, which men take vpon them to diuine and iudge of. Againe, the great eaſe and facilitie that they haue to do what pleaſeth them, becauſe all men applie themſelues vnto them, takes away the taſte, &amp; ſowreth that ſweet which ſhould be in their pleaſures; which delight no man but thoſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16995:120"/>
that taſte them, with ſome ſcarcitie and difficultie. He that giues no time to be thirſtie, knowes not what a pleaſure it is to haue drinke: Sacietie is noyſome, and goes againſt the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>

                  <p>There is nothing more tedious and loathſome than abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, yea they are depriued of all true and liuely action, which can not be without ſome difficultie and reſiſtance. It is not going, liuing, acting in them, but ſleeping and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible ſliding away.</p>
                  <p>The third inconuenience that followeth Princes, is in their <note place="margin">10 3 <hi>In their marriages.</hi>
                     </note> marriages. The marriages of the vulgar ſort are more free and voluntarie, made with more affection, libertie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. One reaſon heereof may be, that the common ſort of men finde more of their degree to chuſe, whereas Kings and Princes, who are not of the rout, as we know, haue no plentifull choice. But the other reaſon is better, which is, that the common ſort in their marriages looke but into their owne affaires, and how they may accommodate it beſt vnto themſelues; but the marriages of Princes are many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced for publike neceſſity: they are great parts of the State, and inſtruments ſeruing for the generall good and quiet of the world. Great perſonages and Souereignes marrie not for themſelues, but for the good of the State, whereof they muſt be more amourous and iealous, than of their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: for which cauſe they many times hearken vnto marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages where there is neither loue nor delight; and matches are made betweene perſons, who neither know nor haue ſeene one another, much leſſe affect: yea, ſuch a great man takes ſuch a great ladie, whom if he were not ſo great, he would not take: but this is to ſerue the weale-publike, to aſſure the States, and to ſettle peace amongſt their people.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, That they haue no true part in the attempts that men make one againſt the other in emulation of honour <note place="margin">11 4 <hi>Attempte of honour.</hi>
                     </note> and valour, in the exerciſes of the minde and of the bodie, which is one of the moſt delightfull things in the commerce and conuerſation of men. The reaſon heereof is, becauſe all the world giues place vnto them, all men ſpare them, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16995:121"/>
loue rather to hide their owne valour, to betray their owne glorie, than to hurt or hinder that of their Souereigne, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where they know he affects the victorie. This, to ſay the trueth, is by force of reſpect to handle men diſdainfully and iniuriouſly, and therefore one ſaid, that the children of Princes learned nothing by order and rule, but to manage a horſe, becauſe in all other exerciſes euery one bowes vnto them, and giues them the priſe: but the horſe who is neither flatterer nor Courtier, caſts as well the Prince to the ground as the Eſquire. Many great perſonages haue refuſed the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and approbations offered them, ſaying, I would accept and eſteeme of them, and reioyce in them, if they came from free men, that durſt ſay the contrarie, and tax me if there were cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The fift is, that they are depriued of the libertie to trauell in the world, being as it were empriſoned within their owne <note place="margin">12 5 <hi>Libertie of trauell.</hi>
                     </note> countries, yea within their owne palaces, being alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with people, ſuters, gazers, and lookers on, and that whereſoeuer they be, and in all actions whatſoeuer, prying euen through the holes of their chaire: whereupon <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the King ſaid, that in this reſpect the eſtate of an aſſe was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the condition of a King.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt miſerie is, that they are depriued of all amitie and mutuall ſocietie, which is the ſweeteſt and perfecteſt fruit of <note place="margin">13 6 <hi>Mutuall and hartie amitie.</hi>
                     </note> humane life, and cannot be but betwixt equals, or thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom the difference is but ſmall. This great diſparitie puts them without the commerce and ſocietie of men; all humble ſeruices, and baſe offices, are done vnto them by thoſe that cannot refuſe them, and proceed not from loue, but from ſubiection, or to increaſe their owne greatnes, or of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and countenance; which is plaine, becauſe wicked Kings are as well ſerued and reuerenced as the good; they that are hated, as they that are beloued, there is no difference, the ſelfe-ſame apparell, the ſelfe-ſame ceremonie: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour anſwered his Courtiers, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for his iuſtice, Perhaps I ſhould be proud of theſe praiſes, if they were ſpoken by ſuch as durſt to accuſe me, and to diſpraiſe my actions when they ſhall deſerue it.</p>
                  <p>The ſeuenth miſery, worſe perhaps than all the reſt, and <note place="margin">14 7 <hi>Ignorance of things.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:16995:121"/>
more dangerous to the weale-publicke, is, that they are not free in the choice of men, nor in the true knowledge of things. They are not ſuffered truly to know the ſtate of their affaires, and conſequently not to call and employ ſuch as they would, and as were moſt fit and neceſſarie. They are ſhut vp, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with a certaine kind of people, that are either of their own bloud, or by the greatnes of their houſes and offices, or by preſcription, are ſo farre in authoritie, power, and managing of affaires before others, that it is not lawfull, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all to hazard, to diſcontent, or in any ſort to ſuſpect them. Now theſe kind of people that couer, and hold as it were hidden the Prince, do prouide that all the truth of things ſhall not appeare vnto him, and that better men, and more profitable to the ſtate come not neere him, leſt they be knowne what they are. It is a pitifull thing not to ſee but by the eyes, not to vnderſtand, but by the eares of another, as Princes doe. And that which perfecteth in all points this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, is, that commonly, and as it were by deſtinie, Princes and great perſonages are poſſeſſed by three ſorts of people, the plagues of humane kinde, Flatterers, Inuenters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts or tributes, Informers, who vnder a faire and falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of zeale and amitie towards the Prince, as the two firſt, or of loyaltie and reformation as the latter, ſpoile and ruinate both Prince and State.</p>
                  <p>The eight miſerie is, that they are leſſe free, and maſters of their owne wills than all other, for they are inforced in their <note place="margin">15 8 <hi>Not mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their wills.</hi>
                     </note> proceedings by a thouſand conſiderations and reſpects, whereby many times they muſt captiuate their deſignments, deſires, and wills; <hi>in maxima fortuna, minima licentia.</hi> And in the meane time in ſtead of being plaintiffes, they are more rudely handled and iudged than any other: For men will not ſtick to diuine of their deſignes, penetrate into their hearts and inuentions, which they cannot doe, <hi>Abditos principis ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp; ſi quid occultius parat exquirere: illicitum anceps nec ideo aſſequare:</hi> and looking into things with another viſage, where they vnderſtand not ſufficientlie the affaires of the ſtate, they require of their Princes what they thinke ſhould be done, blame their actions, &amp; refuſing to ſubmit themſelues to what
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16995:122"/>
is neceſſarie, they commonly proceed in their buſineſſe rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it falleth out many times, that they make a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end, not only tyrants and vſurpers, for it belongs to <note place="margin">16 9 <hi>A miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end.</hi>

                  <p>IT is one of the vanities &amp; follies of man, to preſcribe lawes and rules that exceed the vſe and capacitie of men, as ſome Philoſophers and Doctors haue done.

Wherein there is firſt great iuſtice: for there muſt alwaies be kept a proportion betwixt the commandement and the obedience, the duetie and the power, the rule and the workmaſter: and theſe binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and others to be neceſſarilie in want, cutting out more worke than they know how to finiſh: and many times theſe goodly Law-makers are the firſt Law-breakers: for they do nothing, and many times do quite contrarie to that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne others, like the Phariſes, <hi>Imponunt onera grauia, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt ea digito mouere.</hi> So do ſome Phyſitians and Diuines: ſo liues the world; rules and precepts are enioined, and men not only by an irregularitie of life and maners, but alſo by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie opinion and iudgement follow others.</p>

Some follow the ciuill and ſociable life, others flie it, thinking to ſaue themſelues in the ſolitarie wilderneſſe; ſome loue armes, others hate them; ſome liue in common, others in priuate; it pleaſeth ſome beſt to haue charge, and to leade a publike life, others to hide and keepe themſelues priuate; ſome are Courtiers, attending wholly vpon others, others

They haue all their aduantages and diſaduantages, their good and their ill. That which is moſt to be looked into and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heerein, as ſhall be ſaid, is, That euery man know how to chuſe that which beſt befits his owne nature, that he might liue the more eaſily and the more happily.

                  </head>
                  <p>THere are three ſorts of life, and as it were three degrees, one priuate of euery particular man within himſelfe, and in the cloſet of his owne heart, where all is hid, all is lawfull: the ſecond, in his houſe and family, in his priuate and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie actions, where there is neither ſtudie nor arte, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is not bound to giue any reaſon: the third is publike in the eyes of the world. Now to keepe order and rule in this firſt low and obſcure ſtage, it is very difficult, and more rare than in the other two; and in the ſecond, than in the third: the reaſon is, becauſe where there is neither Iudge nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troler, nor Regarder, and where we haue no imagination ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of puniſhment or recompenſe, we carrie our ſelues more looſely and careleſly, as in priuate liues, where conſcience and reaſon only is our guide, than in publike; where we are ſtill in checke and as a marke to the eyes and iudgement of all; where glory, feare of reproch, baſe reputation, or ſome other paſſion doth leade vs (for paſſion commands with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power than reaſon) whereby we keepe our ſelues readie, ſtanding vpon our guard: for which cauſe it falleth out, that many are accounted holy, great, and admirable in publike, who in their owne priuate haue nothing commendable. That which is done in publike is but a fable, a fiction, the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16995:125"/>
truth is ſecret and in priuat; and he that will well iudge of a man, muſt conuerſe euery day with him, and pry into his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and naturall cariage; the reſt is all counterſet; <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus mundus exercet histrioniam:</hi> and therefore ſaid a wiſe man, That he is an excellent man, who is ſuch within and in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe which he is outwardly for feare of the lawes, and ſpeech of the world. Publick actions thunder in the eares of men, to which a man is attentiue, when he doth them; as exploits in warre, ſound iudgement in counſell, to rule a people, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme an Ambaſſage. Priuate and domeſticall actions are quick and ſure, to chide, to laugh, to ſell, to pay, to conuerſe with his owne, a man conſiders not of them, he doth them not thinking of them: ſecret and inward actions much more, to loue, to hate, to deſire.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is heere another conſideration, and that is, that that is done by the naturall hypocriſie of men, which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> make moſt account of, and a man is more ſcrupulous in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, that are in ſhew, but yet are free, of ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and almoſt all in countenances and ceremonies, and therefore are of little coſt, and as little effect; than in inward and ſecret actions that make no ſhew, but are yet requiſite and neceſſarie, and therefore they are the more difficult. Of thoſe depend the reformation of the ſoule, the moderation of the paſſions, the rule of the life; yea, by the attainement of theſe outward, a man becomes careleſſe of the inward.</p>
                  <p>Now of theſe three liues, inward, domeſticall, publicke, he that is to leade but one of them, as Hermits, doth guide and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> order his life at a better rate, than he that hath two, and he that hath but two, his condition is more eaſie, than he that hath all three.</p>

there is not one good, the number of fooles is infinite, contagion in a preaſe is dangerous, they ſeeme to haue reaſon on their ſide: for the companie of the wicked is a dangerous thing, and therefore they that aduenture themſelues vpon the ſea, are to take heed that no blaſphemer, or diſſolute and wicked perſon enter their ſhip; one only <hi>Ionas</hi> with whom God was angrie had almoſt loſt all; <hi>Bias</hi> to thoſe that were in the ſhip with him crying out in a great danger for help vnto their gods, pleaſantlie ſaid, Hold you your peace, for the gods perceiue not that you are heere with me. <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> the Vice-roy of the <hi>Indies</hi> for <hi>Emmanuel</hi> king of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingall,</hi> in a great danger at ſea, tooke vpon his ſhoulders a little child, to the end that his innocencie might ſerue as a ſuretie to God for his ſinnes. But to thinke that a ſolitarie life is better, more excellent and perfect, more fit for the exerciſe of vertue, more difficult, ſharp, laborious and painfull, as ſome would make vs beleeue, they groſſely deceiue themſelues: for contrarily it is a great diſcharge and eaſe of life, and it is but an indifferent profeſſion, yea a ſimple apprentiſhip and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to vertue. This is not to enter into buſines, troubles, and difficulties, but it is to flie them, and to hide themſelues from them, to practiſe the counſell of the Epicures (Hide thy ſelfe) it is to runne to death, to flie a good life. It is out of all doubt, that a King, a Prelat, a Paſtor, is a farre more noble cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, more perfect, more difficult, than that of a Monke, or a Hermit. And to ſay the truth, in times paſt the companies of Monks were but ſeminaries and apprentiſhips, from whence they drew thoſe that were fit for Eccleſiaſticall charge, and their preparatiues to a greater perfection. And he that liues ciuillie hauing a wife, children, ſeruants, neighbours, friends, goods, buſines, and ſo many diuers parts which he muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, and truly and loyally anſwere for, hath without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon farre more buſines, than he that hath none of all theſe, hath to doe with none but himſelfe: Multitude and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is farre more troubleſome, than ſolitarineſſe and want. In abſtinencie there is but one thing, in the conduct and vſe of many, diuers things, there are many conſiderations, diuers duties. It is an eaſier thing to part from goods, honours, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, charges, than to gouerne them well, and well to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16995:126"/>
them. It is eaſier for a man to liue altogether without a wife, than in all points duly to liue, and to maintaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his wife, children, and all the reſt that depend vpon him: ſo is the ſingle life more eaſie than the maried ſtate.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe to thinke that ſolitarineſſe is a ſanctuarie and an aſſured hauen againſt all vices, temptations, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is to deceiue themſelues; for it is not true in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Againſt the vices of the world, the ſtirre of the people, the occaſions that proceed from without, it is good; but ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſſe hath it inward and ſpirituall affaires and difficulties: <hi>Iuit in deſertum vt tentaretur à diabolo.</hi> To imprudent and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed young men, ſolitarineſſe is a dangerous ſtaffe, and it is to be feared, that whileſt he walks alone he entertaines worſe companie than himſelfe, as <hi>Crates</hi> ſaid to a young man who walked all alone farre from companie. It is there where fooles contriue their wicked deſignements, begin their owne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes, ſharpen their paſſions and wicked deſires. Many times to auoid the gulfe of <hi>Charybdis,</hi> they fall into <hi>Scylla;</hi> to flie is not to eſcape, it is many times to increaſe the danger, and to loſe himſelfe, <hi>non vitat, ſed fugit: magis autem periculis patemus auerſi.</hi> A man had neede be wife and ſtrong, and well aſſured of himſelfe when he falles into his owne hands, for it falls out many times that there are none more dangerous than his owne, <hi>Guarda me, dios de mi,</hi> ſaith the Spaniſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb very excellently; <hi>nemo eſt ex imprudentibus qui ſibi relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui debeat; ſolitudo omnia mala perſuadet.</hi> But for ſome priuat and particular conſideration, though good in it ſelfe (for many times it is for idleneſſe, weakeneſſe of ſpirit, hatred, or ſome other paſſion) to flie and to hide himſelfe, hauing means to profit another, or to do good to the weale-publick, is to be a fugitiue, to bury his talent, to hide his light, a fault ſubiect to the rigour of iudgement.</p>

That which is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in cities, is commoditie either priuate, as of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and artificers; or publike, to the managing whereof few are called, and in ancient times heeretofore they were choſen from the countrey life, who returned hauing perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their charge.</p>

                     <p>THis laſt diſtinction and difference is apparent enough and ſufficiently knowen, and hath many members and conſiderations, but may all be reduced to two heads, which a man may call with the vulgar ſort, Felicitie or good fortune, and Infelicitie or ill fortune, Greatneſſe or littleneſſe. To Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie and greatneſſe belong health, beautie, and the other goods of the bodie, libertie, nobilitie, honor, dignitie, ſcience, riches, credit, friends. To Infelicitie or littleneſſe belong all the contraries, which are priuations of the other good things. From theſe things doth ariſe a very great difference, becauſe a man is happie in one of theſe, or in two, or in three, and not in the reſt, and that more or leſſe by infinite degrees: few or none at all are happie or vnhappie in them all. He that hath the greateſt part of theſe goods, and eſpecially three, Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Dignitie, or Authoritie and riches, is accounted great; he that hath not any of theſe three, little. But many haue but one or two, and are accounted midlings betwixt the great and the little. We muſt ſpeake a little of them all.</p>

                  <p>LIbertie is accounted by ſome a ſouereigne good, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude an extreame euill, inſomuch that many haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen rather to die a cruell death, than to be made ſlaues, or to ſee either the publike good or their owne priuate indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But of this there may be too much, and of theſe too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, as of all other things. There is a twofolde libertie: the true, which is of the minde or ſpirit, and is in the power of

euery one, and can not be taken away, nor indamaged by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, nor by Fortune it ſelfe: contrariwiſe, the ſeruitude of the ſpirit is the moſt miſerable of all others, to ſerue our owne affections, to ſuffer our ſelues to be deuoured by our owne paſſions, to be led by opinions. ô pitifull captiuitie! The corporall libertie is a good greatly to be eſteemed, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Fortune: and it is neither iuſt nor reaſonable (if it be not by reaſon of ſome other circumſtance) that it ſhould be preferred before life it ſelfe, as ſome of the ancients haue done, who haue rather made choice of death, than to loſe it; and it was accounted a great vertue in them: ſo great an euill was ſeruitude thought to be: <hi>Seruitus obedientia eſt fracti ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi &amp; abiecti arbitrio carentis ſuo.</hi> Many great and wiſe men haue ſerued, <hi>Regulus, Valerianus, Plato, Diogenes,</hi> euen thoſe that were wicked, and yet diſhonoured not their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but continued in effect and truth more free than their maſters.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NObilitie is a qualitie euery where not common, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, brought in and eſtabliſhed with great reaſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and for publike vtilitie.</p>
                  <p>It is diuers, diuerſly taken and vnderſtood, and according to diuers nations and iudgements it hath diuers kindes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> to the generall and common opinion and cuſtome it is a qualitie of a race or ſtocke. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that it is the antiquitie of a race and of riches. <hi>Plutarch</hi> calleth it the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a race, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, meaning thereby a certaine habit and qualitie continued in the linage. What this qualitie or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is, all are not wholly of one accord, ſauing in this, that it is profitable to the weale-publike. For to ſome and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part this qualitie is militarie, to others it is politike, litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of thoſe that are wiſe, palatine of the officers of the Prince. But the militarie hath the aduantage aboue the reſt: for beſides the ſeruice which it yeeldeth to the weale-publike as the reſt do, it is painfull, laborious, dangerous; whereby it is accounted more worthy and commendable. So hath it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with vs by excellencie the honourable title of Valour.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16995:129"/>
There muſt then according to this opinion be two things in true and perfect nobilitie, profeſſion of this vertue, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie profitable to the common-weale, which is as the forme; and the race as the ſubiect and matter, that is to ſay, a long continuance of this qualitie by many degrees and races, and time out of mind, whereby they are called in our language Gentlemen, that is to ſay, of a race, houſe, familie, carying of long time the ſame name, and the ſame profeſſion. For he is truely and entirely noble, who maketh a ſingular profeſſion of publick vertue, ſeruing his Prince and Countrie, and being deſcended of parents and anceſtors that haue done the ſame.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome that ſeparate theſe two, and thinke that one of them ſufficeth to true nobilitie, that is, either only vertue <note place="margin">3 <hi>the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                     </note> and qualitie, without any conſideration of race or anceſtors. This is a perſonall and acquired nobilitie, &amp; conſidered with rigour it is rude, that one come from the houſe of a Butcher or Vintner ſhould be held for noble, whatſoeuer ſeruice he hath done for the Common-weale. Neuertheleſſe, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath place in many nations, namely with the <hi>Turks,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of ancient nobilitie, and eſteeming of no other but perſonall, and actuall militarie valour; or only antiquitie of race without profeſſion of the qualitie; this is in the bloud and purely naturall.</p>
                  <p>If a man ſhould compare theſe two ſimple and imperfect nobilities together, that which is purely naturall (to iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right) <note place="margin">4 <hi>Naturall nobilitie.</hi>
                     </note> it is the leſſe, though many, out of their vanitie haue thought otherwiſe. The naturall is another mans qualitie, and not his owne, <hi>genus &amp; proauos &amp; quae non fecimus ipſi, vix ea nostra puto: nemo vixit in gloriam nostram; nec quod ante nos fuit nostrum eſt.</hi> And what greater follie can there be, than to glorie in that which is not his owne? This honor may light vpon a vitious man, a knaue, and one in himſelf a true villaine. It is alſo vnprofitable to another, for it communicateth not with any man, neither is any man bettered by it, as ſcience, iuſtice, goodnes, beautie, riches do. They that haue nothing elſe commendable in them but this nobilitie of fleſh and bloud, make much of it, they haue it alwaies in their mouthes, it makes their cheekes ſwell and their hearts too (they will be ſure to manage that little good that they haue) it is the marke
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16995:130"/>
by which they are knowne, and a token that they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in them, becauſe they reſt themſelues whollie vpon that. But this is vanitie, for all their glorie ſpringeth from fraile inſtruments, <hi>ab vtero, conceptu, partu,</hi> and is buried vnder the toombe of their anceſtors. As offenders being purſued haue recourſe to altars and the ſepulchers of the dead, and in former times to the ſtatues of Emperours; ſo theſe men being deſtitute of all merit and ſubiect of true honor, haue recourſe to the memorie and armories of their anceſtors. What good is it to a blind man, that his parents haue beene well ſighted, or to him that ſtammereth, that his Grandfather was elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent? and yet theſe kind of people are commonly glorious, high minded, contemners of others; <hi>Contemptor animus &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbia commune nobilitatis malum.</hi>

                     </note> thereof, it is alwaies a worthie ſubiect, and profitable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Againe, a man may ſay that it is more ancient and more rare, than the naturall, for by it the naturall began; and in a word, that is true honor which conſiſteth in good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effects, not in dreames and imagination, vaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and proceedeth from the ſpirit, not the bloud, which is the ſame in noble men that is in others. <hi>Quis genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? ad virtutem à natura bene compoſitus animus facit nobilem, cui ex quacun<expan>

                     </note> and occaſion to the perſonall; for things do eaſily returne to their firſt nature and beginning.

It is a foule thing to degenerate, and to belie a mans owne race. The nobilitie that is giuen by the bountie and letters patent of the Prince, if it haue no other reaſon, it is ſhamefull, and rather diſhonorable than hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16995:130"/>
It is an nobilitie in parchment, bought with ſiluer or fauor, and not by bloud as it ought: If it be giuen for merit, and notable ſeruices, it is perſonall and acquired as hath beene ſaid.</p>

Others haue called it the ſhadow of vertue, which ſometimes followeth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times goeth before it, as the ſhadow the bodie. But to ſpeake truly, it is the rumor of a beautifull and vertuous action, which reboundeth from our ſoules to the view of the world, and by reflexion into our ſelues, bringeth vnto vs a teſtimonie of that which others beleeue of vs, which turneth to a great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind.</p>
                  <p>Honor is ſo much eſteemed and ſought for by all, that to attaine thereunto a man enterpriſeth, endureth, contemneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whatſoeuer beſides, yea life it ſelfe; neuertheleſſe, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſmall and ſlender moment, vncertaine, a ſtranger, and as it were ſeparated in the aire, from him that is honored; for it doth not only not enter into him, nor is inward and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall vnto him, but it doth not ſo much as touch him (being for the moſt part either dead or abſent, and who feeleth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) but ſetleth it ſelfe and ſtayeth without at the gate, ſticks in the name, which receiueth and carieth all the honors and diſhonours, praiſes and diſpraiſes, whereby a man is ſaid to haue either a good name or a bad. All the good or euill that a man can ſay of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is caried by his name. Now the name is nothing of the nature and ſubſtance of the thing, it is only the image which preſenteth it, the marke which diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth it from others, a ſummarie which conteineth it in a ſmall volume, mounteth it, and carieth it whole and entire, the meane to enioy it and to vſe it (for without the names there would be nothing but confuſion, the vſe of things would be loſt, the world would decay, as the hiſtorie of the

tower of <hi>Babell</hi> doth richly teach vs) to be breefe, the ſtickler and middle of the eſſence of the thing, and the honor or diſhonor thereof, for it is that that toucheth the thing it ſelfe, and receiueth all the good or ill that is ſpoken Now honor before it ariue to the name of the thing, it goes a courſe almoſt circular, like the Sunne, performed and perfected in three principall ſites or places, the action or worke, the heart, the tongue: for it begins and is conceiued, as in the matrix and roote, in that beautie, goodnes, profit of the thing honored which comes to light and is produced, this is (as hath beene ſaid) the rumor of a beautifull or honorable action. <hi>Coeli e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narrant gloriam dei: pleni ſunt coeli &amp; terra gloria tua</hi> (for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer valour worth and perfection the thing haue in it ſelfe and inwardly, if it produce nothing that is excellent, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vncapable of honor, and is as if it were not at all) from thence it entreth into the ſpirit and vnderſtanding, where it takes life, and is formed into a good, hautie, and great opinion: finally ſallying foorth from thence, and being caried by the word verball or written, it returnes by reflexion, and as it were, diſſolueth and endeth in the name of the authour of this beautifull worke, where it had the beginning, as the Sunne in the place from whence it departed, and then it beares the name of honor, praiſe, glorie, and renowme.</p>
                  <p>But the queſtion is, what thoſe actions are to which honor is due. Some thinke that it is generally due to thoſe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their dutie in that which belongs to their profeſſion, although it be neither famous nor profitable, as he that vpon a Stage playes the part of a ſeruant, well, is no leſſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than he that preſenteth the perſon of a King, and he that cannot worke in ſtatues of gold, cannot want thoſe of leather or earth wherein he may as well ſhew the perfection of his arte. All cannot employ themſelues, neither are they called to the managing of great affaires, but the commendation is to do that well, that he hath to do. This is too much to leſſen and vilifie honor, which is not a common and ordinarie gheſt for all perſons, and all iuſt and lawfull actions. Euery chaſte wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, euery honeſt man is not honorable.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16995:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reaſon why it is properly due to thoſe that adminiſter, and well acquit themſelues of great charges; that be the actions as priuatly and generally good and profitable as they will, they ſhall haue approbation and ſufficient renowme which thoſe that know them, and the ſafetie and protection of the lawes; but not honour, which is publike, and hath more dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, fame, and ſplendor. Some adde vnto theſe a third, and that is, that it be not an action of obligation, but of ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>The deſire of honour and glorie, and the approbation of <note place="margin">4 <hi>Deſire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, chap.</hi> 20.</note> another, is a vitious, violent, powerfull paſſion, whereof we haue ſpoken in the paſſion of ambition; but very profitable to the weale-publike, to conteine men in their dutie, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and inflame them to honourable actions, a teſtimonie of weakneſſe and humane inſufficiencie, which for want of good money vſeth light and falſe coine.

                  <p>The marks of honour are very diuers, but the better and more beautifull are they that are without profit and gaine, <note place="margin">5 <hi>Marks of honour.</hi>

Some make that account of it, that they preferre it before all other things, and thinke that it is a ſouereigne good, ſome kinde and ray of Diuinitie, ſeeking it with greedineſſe, charge and great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; others contemne it, and deſpiſe thoſe that profeſſe it: the mediocritie betwixt both is the more iuſt and moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For my part I place it farre beneath honeſtie, ſanctitie, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> wiſdome, vertue, yea beneath dexteritie in affaires: and yet I dare to range it with dignitie, naturall nobilitie, militarie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and I thinke they may very well diſpute of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie: and if I were called to ſpeake my opinion, I ſhould make it to march either ſide by ſide with them, or inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently after. As ſciences are different in their ſubiects and matters, in the apprentiſhip and acquiſition, ſo are they in their vtilitie, honeſtie, neceſſitie, as alſo in their gaine and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: ſome are Theoricks and in ſpeculation only, others are practike and in action: againe, ſome are Reals, occupied in the knowledge of things that are without vs, whether they be naturall or ſupernaturall; other are particular, which teach the tongues to ſpeake, and to reaſon. Now without all doubt, thoſe ſciences that haue moſt honeſtie, vtilitie, neceſſitie, and leaſt glorie, vanitie, mercenarie gaine, are farre to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before others. And therefore the practike are abſolutely the better, which reſpect the good of man, teaching him to liue well, to die well, to command well, to obey well; and therefore they are diligently to be ſtudied by him that ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to be wiſe: whereof this worke is a briefe and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie, that is to ſay, Morall Science, Oeconomicall, Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. After theſe is Naturall, which ſerueth to the knowledge of whatſoeuer is in the world fit for our vſe, as likewiſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the greatneſſe, goodneſſe, wiſdome, power of the chiefe workmaſter. All other knowledges are vaine, and are to be ſtudied curſorily, as appendents vnto theſe, becauſe they are no wayes beneficiall to the life of man, and helpe not to make vs honeſt men. And therefore it is a loſſe and a follie to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy therein ſo much time, ſo much coſt, ſo much labour as we doe. It is true that they ſerue to heape vp crownes, and

to win reputation with the people, but it is in policies that are not wholly ſound goods.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THeſe are the two ſources and elements of all diſcords, <note place="margin">1 <hi>The cauſes of troubles.</hi>
                     </note> troubles, and commotions that are in the world: for the exceſſiue riches of ſome do ſtirre them vp to pride, to delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, pleaſures, diſdaine of the poore; to enterpriſe and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: the extreame pouertie of others, prouokes them to enuie, extreame iealouſie, furie, deſpaire, and to attempt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. <hi>Plato</hi> calleth them the plagues of a Common-wealth. But which of the two is the more dangerous, is not thorowly reſolued amongſt all. According to <hi>Aristotle</hi> it is abundance, for a State needs not doubt of thoſe that deſire but to liue, but of ſuch as are ambitious and rich. According to <hi>Plato</hi> it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, for deſperate poore men are terrible and furious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for wanting either bread or worke to exerciſe their arts and occupation,s or too exceſſiuely charged with impoſts, they learne that of the miſtreſſe of the ſchoole Neceſſitie, which of themſelues they neuer durſt to haue learned, and they dare becauſe their number is great. But yet there is a better remedie for theſe than for the rich, and it is an eaſie matter to hinder this euill; for ſo long as they haue bread and emploiment to exerciſe their myſteries, and liue, they will neuer ſtir. And therefore the rich are to be feared for their owne ſakes, their vice and condition: the poore by reaſon of the imprudencie of gouernours.</p>
                  <p>Now many Law-makers and great States-men haue gone <note place="margin">2 <hi>Againſt the equalitie &amp; inequalitie of riches.</hi>
                     </note> about to take away theſe two extreamities, and this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie of goods and fortunes, and to bring in a mediocritie and equalitie, which they called the nourſing-mother of peace and amitie; and others likewiſe haue attempted to make all things common, which could neuer be but by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. But beſides that, it is impoſſible to eſtabliſh an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, by reaſon of the number of children which increaſe in one familie, and not in another; and that it can hardly be put in practiſe, although a man be enforced, and it coſt much

to attaine thereunto; it were alſo inexpedient, and to ſmall purpoſe, and by another way to fall into the ſame miſchiefe: for there is no hatred more capitall than betwixt equals; the enuie and iealouſie of equals is the ſeminarie of troubles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and cruell warres. Inequalitie is good, ſo it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Harmonie conſiſteth not of like ſounds, but different and well according.</p>
                  <q>Nihil est aequalitate inaequalius.</q>
                  <p>This great and deformed inequalitie of goods proceedeth from many cauſes, eſpecially two: the one is from vniuſt lones, as vſuries and intereſts, whereby the one eat the other, and grow fat with the ſubſtance of another: <hi>qui deuorant ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem ſicut eſcam panis.</hi> The other from diſpoſitions, whether amongſt the liuing, as alienations, donations, endowments in mariages; or teſtamentaries by reaſon of death. By both which meanes ſome doe exceſſiuely increaſe aboue others, who continue poore. The heires of rich men marrie with thoſe that are rich, whereby ſome houſes are diſmembred and brought to nothing; and others made rich and exalted. All which inconueniences muſt be ruled and moderated by auoiding exceſſiue extremities, and in ſome ſort approching to ſome mediocritie and reaſonable equality: for to haue either entire, is neither poſſible, nor good nor expedient, as hath beene ſayd. And this ſhall be handled in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Iuſtice.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing in the Firſt Booke layd open vnto man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> many and diuers meanes to know himſelfe and our humane condition, which is the firſt part, and a great introduction to Wiſdome, we are now to enter into the doctrine, and to vnderſtand in this Second Booke the generall rules and opinions thereof, reſeruing the more particular to the Third and laſt Booke. It is worthieſt conſideration, and as a Preamble to the reſt, to call man vnto himſelfe, to taſte, ſound, ſtudie himſelfe, to the end he may know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his defects and miſerable condition, and ſo make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe capable of holſome and neceſſarie remedies, which are the aduiſements and inſtructions of wiſdome.</p>
               <p>But it is a ſtrange thing, that the world ſhould take ſo little <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> care of it owne good and amendment. What wit is it for a man to be vtterly careleſſe that his buſineſſe be well done?
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16995:134"/>
Man would only liue, but he eares not to know how to liue well. That which a man ſhould eſpeciallie, and only know, is that which he knowes leaſt, and cares leaſt to know.</p>
               <p>Our inclinations, deſignments, ſtudies, are (as we ſee) from our youth diuers, according to the diuerſitie of natures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, inſtructions, occaſions, but there is not any that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth his eies to the other ſide, that indeuoreth to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wiſe, not any that ruminateth hereupon, or that doth ſo much as thinke thereon. And if perhaps ſometimes he do, it is but by chance, and as it were paſſing by, and he attendeth it, as newes that is told, which concerneth him not at all. The word pleaſeth ſome well, but that is all, the thing it ſelfe is neither accounted of, nor ſought for in this world of ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall corruption and contagion. To vnderſtand the merit and worth of wiſdome, ſome kind of aire or tincture of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is neceſſarie; for men are willing to vſe ſtudie and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, rather for thoſe things that haue their effects and fruits glorious, outward, and ſenſible, ſuch as ambition, auarice, paſſion haue, than for wiſdome whoſe effects are ſweet, darke, inward, and leſſe viſible.</p>
               <p>O how much doth the world erre in this account, it loueth better the wind with noiſe, than the bodie it ſelfe, the eſſence without it, opinion and reputation than veritie! Man (as hath been ſaid in the firſt booke) is nothing but vanitie and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, vncapable of wiſdome. Euery man hath a taſte of that aire which he breatheth, and where he liueth, followeth the traine and cuſtome of liuing followed by all, how then ſhould he aduiſe himſelfe of any other? We follow the ſteps of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea we preſſe and inflame one another, we inueſt our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and paſſions one into another; no man ſtayes vs, or cryes <hi>hola</hi> vnto it, ſo much do we faile and miſtake our ſelues. We haue neede of ſome ſpeciall fauour from heauen, and withall a great and generous force and conſtancie of nature to note that common error which no man findeth, in aduiſing and conſulting of that which no man conſidereth, and reſoluing our ſelues quite contrarie to the courſe of other men.</p>
               <p>There are ſome though rare, I ſee them, I vnderſtand them, I ſmell them with pleaſure and admiration; but what, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are all <hi>Democrites</hi> or <hi>Heraclites;</hi> the one ſort do nothing but
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16995:134"/>
mock and gibe, thinking they ſhew truth &amp; wiſdome enough in laughing at error and follie. They laugh at the world, for it is ridiculous, they are pleaſant, but not good and charitable. The other are weake and poore, they ſpeake with a low voice, their mouths halfe open, they diſguiſe their language, they mingle and ſtuffe their propoſitions, to make them paſſe more currantlie, with ſo many other things, and with ſuch arte, that they are hardly diſcerned. They ſpeake not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, clearely, aſſuredly, but doubtfully like oracles. I come after them and vnder them, but I ſpeake in good ſooth that which I thinke and beleeue clearely and perſpicuouſly.</p>
               <p>I giue heere a picture, with certaine leſſons of wiſdome, which perhaps may ſeeme to ſome new and ſtrange, and ſuch as no man in former time hath giuen in ſuch a faſhion; and I doubt not but malitious people, who haue neither patience, nor power to iudge truly and wiſely of things, malitiouſly condemne whatſoeuer agrees not with their palat, and with that which they haue alreadie receiued. But that is all one, for who is he that can aſſure himſelfe of the good opinion of all? But my hope is that the ſimple and debonairie, the Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian and ſublime ſpirits will iudge indifferentlie. Theſe are the two extremities and ſtages of peace and ſerenitie; In the middle are the troubles, tempeſts, and meteors, as hath beene <note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> ſaid.</p>
               <p>To the end we may haue ſome rude and generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The diuiſion of this Booke into</hi> 4. <hi>parts.</hi>
                  </note> of that which is handled in this booke, and the whole doctrine of wiſdome, we may diuide this matter into foure points or conſiderations. The firſt are preparatiues to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which are two, the one an exemption and freedome from all that may hinder the attainment thereof, which are <note place="margin">1 <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.</hi>
                  </note> either the externall errours and vices of the world, or inward, as paſſions: the other is a plaine, entire, and vniuerſall libertie of the mind. Theſe two firſt, and the more difficult make a man capable and apt for wiſdome, becauſe they emptie and cleanſe the place, to the end it may be more ample &amp; capable to receiue a thing of ſo great importance as wiſdome is, <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na &amp; ſpatioſares eſt ſapie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia, vacuo illi loco opus eſt, ſuperuacua ex animo tollenda ſunt.</hi> And this is the firſt. Afterwards they make him open, free, &amp; always ready to receiue it. This is the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:16995:135"/>
The ſecond are foundations of wiſdome, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe two, true and eſſentiall probitie, and to haue a certaine <note place="margin">2 <hi>Foundations.</hi>
                  </note> end and courſe of life. Theſe two reſpect nature, they rule and accommodate vs thereunto; the firſt to the vniuerſall nature, which is reaſon; for probitie or honeſtie, as ſhall be ſaid, is no other thing: the ſecond to the particular of euery one of vs; for it is the choice of the kind of life proper and fit for the nature of euery one.</p>
               <p>The third belongs to the raiſing of this building, that is to ſay, offices and functions of wiſdome, which are ſix, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">3 <hi>Offices.</hi>
                  </note> the three firſt are principallie for euery one in himſelfe, which are pietie, inward gouernment of our deſires and thoughts, and a ſweet cariage in all accidents of proſperitie and aduerſitie: the other three reſpect another, which are ſuch an obſeruation as is neceſſarie of lawes, cuſtomes, and ceremonies, a ſweet conuerſation with another, and prudence in all affaires. Theſe ſix do correſpond and comprehend the foure morall vertues, the firſt, fourth, and fift do properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to Iuſtice, and to that which we owe to God and our neighbour; the ſecond and third to <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> the ſixt to <hi>Prudence.</hi> And therefore theſe ſix, are the matter and ſubiect of the third booke, which handleth at large the foure morall vertues, and in particular the offices and duties of a wiſe man, but in this booke they are handled in generall.</p>
               <p>The fourth are the effects and fruits of wiſdome, which are two, to be alwaies readie for death, and to maintaine a <note place="margin">4 <hi>Fruites.</hi>
                  </note> mans ſelfe in true tranquillitie of ſpirit, the crowne of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the ſoueraigne good.</p>
               <p>Theſe are in all twelue rules and leſſons of wiſdome, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſo many Chapters, which are the proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar foot-ſteps and offices of a wiſe man, which are not found elſewhere. I meane in that ſenſe wherein we take them, and now deſcribe them: For although ſome of them, as honeſtie, the obſeruation of the lawes, ſeeme to be found in others of the common and prophane ſort, yet not ſuch as we heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and decipher them to be. He then is wiſe, who maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe truly free and noble, is directed in all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, accommodating his owne proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16995:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the vniuerſall, which is God; liuing and carying himſelfe before God, with all, and in all affaires, vpright, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, cheerefull, content, and aſſured, attending with one and the ſame foote, all things that may happen, and laſtly, death it ſelfe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Exemption and freedome from errours and the vices of the world, and from paſſions. The firſt dispoſition to Wiſdome.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is heere neceſſarie for the firſt leſſon and inſtruction vnto wiſdome to not the knowledge of our ſelues and our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane condition; for the firſt in euery thing is well to know the ſubiect, wherewith a man hath to do, and which he handleth and manageth to bring to perfection. But we hold that to be alreadie done, for it is the ſubiect of our firſt booke: We can only ſay heere, as a ſummary repetition of all that hath beene ſpoken, that a man aſpiring vnto wiſdome, ſhould aboue all things, and before all other works, ſufficientlie know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all men beſides. This is the true ſcience of man, very profitable, a matter of great ſtudie, fruit, and efficacie, for man is all in all: It is proper to a wiſe man, for only he that is wiſe knowes himſelfe, and he that knowes himſelfe well is wiſe: It is very difficult, for man is extreamely counterfeited and diſguiſed, not only man with man, but euery man with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Euery one takes a delight to deceiue himſelfe; to hide, to rob, to betray himſelfe, <hi>Ipſi nobis furto ſubducimur;</hi> flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and tickling himſelfe to make himſelfe laugh, extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his defects, ſetting a high price of whatſoeuer is good in himſelfe, winking of purpoſe leſt he ſhould too clearely ſee himſelfe: It is very rare and ſought for by a few, and therfore no maruell if wiſdome be ſo rare, for they are very few that do well know this firſt leſſon, or that do ſtudie it; there is not a man that is maſter to himſelfe, much leſſe to another. In things not neceſſarie and ſtrange, there are many maſters, many diſciples. In this point we are neuer with, nor within our ſelues, we alwaies muſe of outward things, and man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knoweth all things than himſelfe. O miſerie, O madneſſe! To be wiſe in this point, it is neceſſarie that we know all ſorts
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16995:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of men, of all aires, climats, natures, ages, eſtates, profeſſions, (to this end ſerues the traueller and the hiſtorie) their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inclinations, actions; not only publicke, (they are leaſt to be regarded, being all fained and artificiall) but priuate, and eſpecially the more ſimple and peculiar, ſuch as ariſe from their proper and naturall iuriſdiction; as likewiſe all thoſe that concerne them particularly, for in theſe two their nature is diſcouered: afterwards that we conferre them all together to make an entire bodie and vniuerſall iudgement; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that we enter into our ſelues, taſte and attentiuely ſound our ſelues, examin euery thought, word, action. Doubtleſſe we ſhall in the end learne that man is in truth on the one ſide a poore, weake, pitifull, and miſerable thing, and we cannot but pitie him; and on the other, we ſhall find him ſwollen and puffed vp with wind, preſumption, pride, deſires, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but diſdaine and deteſt him. Now he hath beene ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie deciphered and preſented vnto vs euen to the life, in the firſt booke, by diuers meanes, in all ſenſes, and according to all his viſages: and this is the reaſon why we ſpeake no more of this knowledge of man, and of our ſelues in this place, but we ſet downe heere for the firſt rule of wiſdome the fruit of this knowledge, to the end, that the end and fruit of the firſt booke might be the beginning and entrance of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. This fruit is to defend and preſerue men from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of the world and of themſelues; theſe are the two euils and formall hindrances of wiſdome, the one outward, as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinions &amp; vices, the generall corruption of the world; the other inward, that is, our paſſions. Now we are to ſee how difficult this is, and how a man may defend himſelfe againſt theſe two. Wiſdome is difficult and rare, and the greateſt, yea almoſt the only endeuor that we haue to attaine vnto it, is to ſet at libertie, &amp; to free our ſelues from that miſerable double captiuitie, publick and domeſticall, of another and of our ſelues: this being attained, the reſt will be eaſie. Let vs ſpeake of theſe two euils diſtinctlie and apart.</p>
               <p>As concerning the outward, we haue before ſufficientlie diplayed the vulgar nature, the ſtrange humors of the world, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Exemption of vulgar errours.</hi>
                  </note> and the common ſort of people, whereby it is eaſie enough to know what can proceed from them; for ſince they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16995:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of vanitie; enuious, malitious, vniuſt; without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſcretion, mediocritie; what can they deliberat, thinke, iudge, reſolue, ſpeake, do well and iuſtlie? We haue likewiſe as it were by example reported and quoted (in preſenting the miſerie of mankind) many great faults, which the world doth generally commit in iudgement and will, whereby it is eaſie to know, that it is whollie compoſed of error and vice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto all the ſayings of the wiſeſt of the world do accord, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that the worſer part is the greater: of a thouſand there is not one good; the number of fooles are infinit, and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is moſt dangerous in a preaſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore they counſell vs not only to preſerue our ſelues neate and cleare from popular opinions, deſignments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and affections, as being all baſe, feeble, indigeſted, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and very often falſe, at the leaſt imperfect: but alſo to flie aboue all things the multitude, the companie and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the vulgar ſort, becauſe a man cannot approch neere vnto it without ſome loſſe and empeachment. The frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the people is contagious and very dangerous euen to the wiſeſt and beſt ſetled men that are: for who is able to withſtand the force and charge of vices comming with ſo great a troope? One example of couetouſneſſe or inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie doth much harme. The companie of one delicate effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat perſon, doth ſoften and make nice by little and little thoſe that liue with him. One rich neighbour giues light and life to our couetouſneſſe. One diſſolute perſon worketh (if I may ſo ſay) and applieth his vice, like ruſt into the neateſt and pureſt minds. What then can we looke for from ſuch maners, after which the world runneth, as it were with a looſe bridle?</p>
               <p>But what? it is very rare and difficult ſo to do. It is a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing, and that hath great appearance of goodnes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> iuſtice, to follow the way approued by all; the great beaten way doth eaſily deceiue, <hi>lata eſt via ad mortem, &amp; multi per eam; mundus in maligno poſitus:</hi> we goe one after another like beaſts for companie; we neuer diue into the reaſon, the merit, the equitie of the cauſe; we follow examples and cuſtomes, and as it were of enuie and emulation, we ſtumble, and fall one vpon another; we throng one another, and draw euery

The ſecond remedie is little better than the euill it ſelfe, but yet more in vſe, that is, when a man conquereth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth <note place="margin">8 <hi>Counterpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </note> one paſſion by a ſtronger than it: for paſſions are neuer of equall force, but there is alwayes one or other (as in the humors of the bodie) which is the predominant, which ruleth and deuoureth the reſt; and we attribute many times very vntruly that vnto vertue and wiſdome which ariſeth from paſſion: but yet it is enough in theſe men, when thoſe paſſions that beare ſway in them are not of the worſt.</p>
               <p>The third remedie and good (though it be not the beſt) is wiſe and artificiall, whereby a man auoideth, flieth, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">9 <hi>Precaution.</hi>
                  </note> himſelfe from all ſuch accidents whatſoeuer, as may ſtirre, awaken, or kindle his paſſions. This is a kind of ſtudie and arte, whereby a man prepareth himſelfe before the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in diuerting of euils, and prouiding that he feele them not; like that King who brake a beautifull and rich cup that one gaue him, to take away in a good houre all matter of brawle and anger that might happen about it. The prayer of theſe kind of people is, <hi>ne nos inducas in tentationem.</hi> By this remedie, he that ſets himſelfe forward to the ſport, ſports not himſelfe; men of honor, prompt and cholerick, flie contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, altercations, and ſtay themſelues at the firſt onſet and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of paſſion. For when a man is once entred, it is no eaſie matter to carrie himſelfe wiſely and diſcretly: We guide our affaires in the beginning, and hold them at our mercie, but after they are once afoote and throughlie heated, they guide and carry vs. Paſſions are farre more eaſily auoided than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, <hi>excinduntur animo faciliùs quam temperantur,</hi> becauſe all things are in their firſt birth feeble and tender. In their weakenes we diſcouer not the danger, and in their full growth and ſtrength we know not how to withſtand them; as we may ſee in diuers, who eaſily and lightlie enter into quarels, and law, and contentions, but are afterwards enforced to get out as they can with ſhame enough, and to come to any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, be it neuer ſo baſe and diſhonorable, yea, to ſeeke falſe interpretations, to belie themſelues, to betray their own hearts, to plaſter and couer the fact, which are all remedies a hundred times worſe than the euill they go about to heale; <hi>melius non incipient, quàm deſinent;</hi> from the want of wiſdome,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16995:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they fall into want of heart: This is contrarie to that ſaying of <hi>Bias,</hi> Enterpriſe coldly, purſue ardentlie. It is like fooles, who out of a vitious ſhame are eaſily perſwaded to agree to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a man demands, and as eaſily flie from their words and reuoke that they haue ſpoken. We muſt therefore in all our affaires and commerce with men, from the beginning be prudent and aduiſed.</p>
               <p>The fourth and beſt remedie of all, is a liuely vertue, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and conſtancie of the mind, whereby a man ſeeth and <note place="margin">10 <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </note> confronteth all accidents without trouble, he wreſtleth and entreth into combat with them. It is a valiant, noble, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious impaſſibilitie, quite contrarie to the firſt which we haue ſpoken of, baſe ſtupiditie. Now to forme it, and to attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, there is nothing more neceſſarie than a precedent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Diſcourſe is the maſter of our paſſions, premeditation is that which giueth the temper to the ſoule, and makes it hard and ſteelie and impenetrable againſt whatſoeuer would wound, or hurt it. The proper meanes to appeaſe and ſweeten theſe paſſions, is to know them well, to examin, to iudge what power they haue ouer vs, and we ouer them. But aboue all, the ſoueraigne remedie is to beleeue, and not to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be caried with opinion, which is that which cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and kindleth our paſſions, and is (as hath bin ſaid) falſe, fooliſh, inconſtant, and vncertaine, the guide of fooles and the vulgar ſort; but to ſuffer himſelfe to be ſweetly led by reaſon and nature, which is the guide of the wiſer ſort, ripe, ſolid, and ſetled. But heereof, heereafter more at large.</p>
               <p>But aboue all other paſſions, it is neceſſarie that we do care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie <note place="margin">11 <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note> gard and defend our ſelues from that ſelfeloue preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fooliſh dotage of our ſelues, the plague of mankind, the capitall enemie of wiſdome, the true gangreene and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the ſoule, whereby we adore our ſelues, and reſt contented with our ſelues, we harken to none other, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue none other but our ſelues. Now we ſhould know that we are not in greater danger in the hands of any, than of our ſelues. It is an excellent mott originallie come from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh tongue, <hi>O God keepe my ſelfe, from my ſelfe.</hi> This preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fooliſh loue of our ſelues proceedes from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we haue of our ſelues, of our weakneſſe, and that little

that is in vs, not only in generall of the infirmitie and miſerie of mankind, but alſo of our owne proper and perſonall imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: but whoſoeuer he be that hath the leaſt graine or touch of this follie, ſhall neuer attaine vnto wiſdome. Faith, modeſtie, a hartie and ſerious acknowledgment of that little that we haue, is a great teſtimonie of a good and ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a right will, and is an excellent diſpoſition vnto wiſdome.</p>

               <p>THe other diſpoſition vnto Wiſdome, which followeth the firſt (which doth quit vs from this outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> captiuitie and confuſion, popular and paſſionate) is a plaine, entire, generous, and lord-like libertie of the mind, which is two-fold, that is to ſay, of iudgement, and will.</p>
               <p>The firſt, of iudgement, conſiſteth in the conſideration, iudgement, examination of all things, and in not tying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">1 <hi>The firſt part, libertie of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi>
                  </note> to any one, but remaining free in himſelfe, vniuerſall, readie, and open for all. And this is the higheſt point, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per law and true priuiledge of a wiſe and actiue man. But few they are that will vnderſtand it, and acknowledge it, fewer that practiſe it as they ſhould: and this is the reaſon why we muſt heere eſtabliſh it, againſt ſuch as are incapable of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And firſt, to auoid all miſcountings, we explaine the words, &amp; giue the ſenſe. There are heere three things which maintaine, cauſe, and conſerue one the other, that is, to iudge of all things, not to be maried or bound to any, to continue open and readie for all. When I ſay to iudge, my meaning is not to reſolue, affirme, determine: this were contrarie to the ſecond, which is, not to bind our ſelues to any thing: but it is to examine, and weigh the reaſons and counter-reaſons on all parts, the weight and merit of them, and thereby worke out the truth. So likewiſe not to bind our ſelues to any thing, is not to ſettle our ſelues, and to remaine ſhort of that we ſhould, bleating in the aire, and to ceaſe our indeuors, and to proceed in our neceſſarie actions and deliberations: For I will that in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16995:139"/>
all outward and common actions of our life, and in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is ordinarily vſed, a man ſhould agree and accommodate himſelfe to the common ſort; for our rule extendeth not it ſelfe to that which is outward, and to the action, but to that which is within, the thought, and ſecret, and inward iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yea and therein likewiſe I conſent, that a man ſettle and applie himſelfe to that which ſeemeth moſt agreeable to the truth, moſt honeſt and profitable; but yet that it be without determination, reſolution, affirmation, or condemnation of contrarie or diuers iudgements, old, or new; but alwaies to hold himſelfe readie to entertaine better if it appeare; yea not to be offended if another ſhall conteſt with him againſt that which he thinketh better, but rather deſire to heare what may be ſaid; for this is the meane, to exerciſe the firſt, which is to iudge, and alwaies to enter into the ſearch of the truth. Theſe three I ſay, doe maintaine and conſerue one the other; for he that iudgeth well, and without paſſion of all things, findeth in euery thing appearances of reaſon, which hinder his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he feareth to ſettle his iudgement, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth vndetermined, indifferent, and vniuerſall: whereas contrariwiſe, he that reſolueth, iudgeth no more, but ſetleth and reſteth himſelfe vpon that which he holdeth, and ſo makes himſelfe a partaker and a particular. To the former, fooles, ſimple and weake people are contrarie: to the ſecond, obſtinate opinatiue affirmers: to the third, both of them, which are particulars: but all three are practiſed by the wiſe, modeſt, diſcreet, and temperate ſearcher of the truth and true Philoſophie. It remaineth for the explication of this our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that I let you know, that by all things, and ſome thing (for it is ſaid, to iudge of all things, not to be aſſured of any) we vnderſtand not thoſe diuine verities which haue bin reuealed vnto vs, which we are to receiue ſimplie with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and ſubmiſſion, and without all controuerſie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, ſubmit our ſelues, and captiuate our minds thereunto, <hi>captiuantes intellectum ad obſequium fidei,</hi> but we vnderſtand heereby all other things without exception. This ſimple ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication would be ſufficient perhaps to perſwade an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpirit to receiue this rule of wiſdome; but I ſee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a ſort of people, glorious, reſolute, affirmatiue, which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16995:140"/>
would rule the world, and command it as it were with a rod, and as others in former times haue ſworne to certaine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and maried themſelues to certaine opinions, ſo they would that all others ſhould do the like, whereby they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues to this noble libertie of the ſpirit. It ſhall be neceſſarie therefore to eſtabliſh it more amplie, and by order to confirme and handle theſe three points and members thereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt is to iudge of all. It is the propertie of a wiſe and <note place="margin">2 <hi>The firſt, to iudge of all.</hi>
                  </note> ſpirituall man; ſaith one of the firſt and wiſeſt of the world, <hi>Spiritualis omnia dijudicat, &amp; à nemine iudicatur:</hi> The true of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of man, his moſt proper and naturall exerciſe, his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt profeſſion is to iudge. Why is he a man diſcourſing, reaſoning, vnderſtanding? Why hath he a ſpirit, to build (as they ſay) caſtles in the aire, and to feede himſelfe with foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and vanities, as the greateſt part of the world doth? <hi>Quis vnquam oculos tenebrarum cauſâ habuit?</hi> No doubtleſſe, but to vnderſtand, to iudge of all things, and therefore he is called the gouernour, the ſuperintendent, the keeper of nature, of the world, of the works of God. To go about to depriue him of this right, is to make him no more a man, but a beaſt; to do it ſingularly, excellently, is the part of a wiſe man: If not to iudge, hurts the ſimple and proper nature of man, what ſhall it doe in a wiſe man, who is as farre aboue the common ſort of men, as a common man is aboue beaſts? It is then ſtrange that ſo many men (I ſpeake not of idiots, and the weaker ſort, who haue not the facultie and meane to exerciſe it) who either are, or make ſhew of vnderſtanding and ſufficiencie, depriue themſelues willinglie of this right and authoritie ſo naturall, ſo iuſt, and excellent, who without the examining or iudging of any thing, receiue and approue whatſoeuer is preſented, either becauſe it hath a faire ſemblance &amp; appearance, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in authoritie, credit, and practiſe; yea, they thinke that it is not lawfull to examin or doubt of any thing, in ſuch ſort do they debaſe and degrade themſelues: they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and glorious in other things, but in this, they are feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſubmiſſe, though it do iuſtly appertaine vnto them, and with ſo much reaſon. Since there are a thouſand lies for one truth, a thouſand opinions of one and the ſame thing, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16995:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but one that is true, why ſhould not I examin with the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reaſon which is the better, the truer, the more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, honeſt, and profitable? Is it poſſible that amongſt ſo many lawes, cuſtomes, opinions, different maners, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ours, as there are in the world, there are none good but ours? Hath all the world beſides beene miſtaken? Who dares to ſay ſo, and who doubteth but others ſay as much of ours, and that he that thus condemneth others, if he had been there borne and brought vp, would thinke them better, and prefer them before thoſe he now accounteth the only good, and all becauſe he hath been accuſtomed vnto them? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, to him that ſhall be ſo foole-hardy to ſay it, I doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that this rule ſhall at the leaſt be good for all others, to the end that they iudging and examining all, may finde ours to be the better. Go to then, the wiſe man ſhall iudge of all, nothing ſhall eſcape him which he bringeth not to the barre, and to the ballance. It is to play the part of prophane men and beaſts, to ſuffer themſelues to be lead like oxen. I will that men liue, and ſpeake, and do, as others, and the common ſort do; but not that they iudge like the common ſort, but iudge them. What can a wiſe man, or a holie man haue aboue a prophane, if he muſt haue his ſpirit, his mind, his principall and heroicall part a ſlaue to the vulgar ſort? The publicke and common ſhould content it ſelfe, if a man conforme himſelfe thereunto in all apparent things; what hath it to do with our inſide, our thoughts, and iudgements? They ſhall gouerne as long as they will my hand, my tongue, but not my ſpirit, for that, by their leaue, hath another maſter. It is a hard thing to bridle the libertie of the ſpirit, and if a man would do it, it is the greateſt tyrannie that may be: a wiſe man will take heed thereof actiuely and paſſiuely, will maintaine himſelfe in his libertie, and not trouble that of other men.</p>
               <p>Now a wiſe man enioying this his right to iudge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin all things, it many times comes to paſſe, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">3 <hi>The effect of this firſt treatiſe. A wiſe man one within, another without.</hi>
                  </note> and the hand, the mind and the bodie, contradict one another, and that he will carie himſelfe outwardlie after one maner, and iudge inwardlie after another, will play one part before the world, and another in his mind, which he muſt do to preſerue equitie and iuſtice in all. That generall ſaying,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16995:141"/>
                  <hi>vniuerſus mundus exercet histrioniam,</hi> ſhould properly and truly be vnderſtood of a wiſe man, who is another man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than he outwardly ſhewes. If he were without ſuch as he is within, he ſhould not be accounted of, but in all things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the world: If he were within ſuch as without, he ſhould be no more a wiſe man, he ſhould iudge amiſſe, be corrupted in his mind. He muſt do, and carie himſelfe outwardly, for publike reuerence, and ſo as he offend no man, according to the law, cuſtome, and ceremonie of the countrey; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly iudge of the truth as it is, according to the vniuerſall reaſon, whereby it many times comes to paſſe that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth that which outwardly he doth. <hi>Sapiens faciet quae non probabit, vt ad maiora tranſitum inueniat, nec relinquet bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos mores, ſed tempori aptabit omnia quae imperiti faciunt, &amp; lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urioſi, faciet: ſed non eodem modo, nec eodem propoſito, multa ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes faciunt quâ homines ſunt, non quâ ſapientes.</hi> He will carie himſelfe in things and actions, as <hi>Cicero</hi> in words, who ſaid, I leaue the vſe or cuſtome of ſpeach to the people, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the true ſcience and knowledge of words, <hi>Loquendum &amp; extrà viuendum vt multi, ſapiendum vt pauci.</hi> Some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples heereof, and firſt of things of leſſe moment. In all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie I take off my hat, and keepe my head vncouered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſuperior, for ſo doth the cuſtome of my countrey re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; but yet I will not leaue to iudge, that the cuſtome of the Eaſt is farre better, to ſalute and do reuerence, by laying the hand vpon the breſt, without vncouering the head, to the preiudice of our health, and other inconueniences. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if I were in the Eaſt, I would take my repaſt, ſitting vpon the earth, or leaning on the elbow, or halfe lying loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the table ſide-wayes as they do there, and as our Sauiour with his Apoſtles did vſe to do, <hi>recumbentibus, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbentibus:</hi> and yet I would not ceaſe to iudge, that the maner of ſitting vpright at table, our faces towards it, as the cuſtome is heere, is more honeſt, more fit, and commodious. Theſe examples are of ſmall weight, and there are a thouſand the like: let vs take another of better importance. I will and I yeeld my conſent that the dead be interred and left to the mercie of the wormes, of rottenneſſe and ſtench, becauſe it is now the common cuſtome almoſt euery-where; but yet I will
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16995:141"/>
not ceaſe to iudge, that the ancient manner of burning them, and gathering their aſhes together, is more noble and more neate, to commit and commend them to the fire, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt element, enemie to putrefaction and ſtench, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to heauen it ſelfe, a ſigne of immortalitie, a ſhadow of the diuinitie, and whereof the vſe is proper and peculiar vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, rather than to the earth, which is the ordure, lees, dregs of the elements, the ſinke of the world, the mother of corruption, and to the wormes which is the extreameſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie and horror, and ſo to couple and handle alike a man and a beaſt. Religion it ſelfe teacheth and commandeth to diſpoſe after this maner of all things, as of the Paſchall lamb which might not be eaten, and (where popery beareth ſway) the conſecrated hoſt, and diuers the like; why then ſhould not the like reſpect be had of our bodies? What can a man do that is more diſhonorable to the bodie, than to caſt it into the earth there to corrupt? It ſeemeth to me to be the vttermoſt puniſhment that can be inflicted vpon infamous perſons and heinous offenders, and that the carcaſies of honeſt and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men ſhould be handled with better reſpect. Doubtleſſe of all the maners in diſpoſing of dead bodies, which may be reduced to fiue, that is, to commit them to the foure elements, and the bowels of wild beaſts, the vileſt, and baſeſt, and moſt ſhamefull is to interre them, the moſt noble and honorable to burne them. Again, I will and conſent, that this my Wiſe man in things naturall be modeſt, that he hide and couer thoſe parts and actions that are called ſhamefull, diſhonorable; and he that ſhould do otherwiſe, I would deteſt, and thinke hardlie of him, becauſe it is almoſt the cuſtome of the whole world; but yet I will neuertheleſſe that he iudge that ſimplie in themſelues, and according to nature, they are no more ſhamefull than the noſe or the mouth, to drinke and to eate: Nature, that is, God, hauing made nothing ſhamefull, but it is for another cauſe, not from nature, that is to ſay, from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of nature, which is ſinne. Diuinitie alſo more chaſte than Philoſophie telleth vs, that in entire nature, not yet alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſinne of man, theſe parts and actions were not ſhamefull, for then ſhame was not, it is the enemie of nature, the fruit of ſinne. I conſent to apparell my ſelfe like thoſe of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16995:142"/>
my countrey and profeſſion, and if I had beene borne in thoſe countries where they go naked, I would haue gone ſo too: but yet I ceaſe not to iudge, that neither of the two faſhions is very good; and if I were to chuſe, and ordaine, I would chuſe a faſhion indifferent betwixt both, out of thoſe countries where they couer themſelues with one only and ſimple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, light and eaſie enough, without faſhion, or coſt; for our maner of attiring is not good, yea worſe than to goe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to be ſo faſt wrapped and bound, with ſuch a multitude and varietie of couerings of diuers ſtuffes, euen to the number of foure, fiue, ſix, one vpon another, and whereof ſome are double, that they hold vs preſt and packt vp with ſo many tyes, binding, butnings (not to ſpeake of that diſſolute and abominable exceſſe condemned by all good lawes) that we can hardlie ſtirre our ſelues in them. I will content my ſelfe with theſe examples. The ſelfeſame a man may ſay of all lawes, cuſtomes, maners, and of that which is <hi>de facto,</hi> and much more of opinions, and that which is <hi>de iure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man ſhall ſay that I haue iudged amiſſe in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and that generally, if libertie be giuen to iudge of all <note place="margin">4 <hi>An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </note> things, the ſpirit will wander and loſe it ſelfe, filling and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing it ſelfe with follies and falſe opinions; I anſwere to the firſt, which toucheth me in particular, that it is very eaſie to erre in finding the truth in all theſe inſtances, and yet it is ouer-boldnes to accuſe any man; for it is as much as if he ſhould ſay, that a man knowes where and what the truth is in things, which who can perfectlie know or iudge of? Now not to find the truth, is not to iudge amiſſe; to iudge amiſſe, is to wey, and ballance, and compare amiſſe, that is to ſay, not to examin the reaſons, and to ponder them according to the firſt and vniuerſall nature, (both which though a man do, yet it followeth not that he muſt needs find out the truth.) Now I beleeue nothing that is but ſimplie affirmed, if it be not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proued; but if any man by contrarie reaſons more ſtrong and forcible ſhall make good what he ſaith, of all others he is the welcomeſt man vnto me, and the man I looke for; for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and contradictions well vrged, and with reaſon, are the true meanes to exerciſe this iudging office. I had neuer ſet downe theſe opinions, but that I looked that ſome one or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16995:142"/>
other ſhould abrogate them, and help me to better, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere more effectuallie; and to that generall obiection of the danger that there is in this libertie, beſides that which hath been ſpoken, and ſhall more expreſly be ſaid in the third leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Wiſdome and Chapter following, that the rule which we ought to hold in iudging, and in all things is nature, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and vniuerſall reaſon, following which a man can neuer erre. See heere the other member of this iudicious libertie which we are about to handle, which will furniſh vs with a remedie againſt this pretended danger.</p>
               <p>The other point of this lord-like libertie of ſpirit, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie of taſte, and a differring of a ſetled reſolution, <note place="margin">

                  </note> whereby a wiſe man conſidering coldly and without paſſion all things, as is ſaid, is not obſtinate, doth not ſweare, tye, bind himſelfe to any opinion; keeping himſelfe alwaies readie to receiue the truth, or that which ſeemes to him to haue beſt ſemblance of truth; and ſaying in his inward and ſecret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that which our ancients were wont to ſay in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and publicke, <hi>it a videtur,</hi> it ſeemeth ſo; there is great appeerance of truth on this ſide; and if any man do contradict and oppoſe himſelfe, with patience he is readie to vnderſtand the contrarie reaſons and to receiue them, finding them more ſtrong &amp; better; and when he hath heard what he can heare, he ſtill thinketh that either there is, or may be better, though as yet it appeareth not. This dilation and putting off of a mans iudgement is founded firſt vpon thoſe propoſitions ſo much celebrated among the wiſe, That there is nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; that we know nothing; that there is nothing in nature but doubt; nothing certaine but incertaintie, <hi>Solum certum, nihil eſſe certi; hoc vnum ſcio, quòd nihilſcio;</hi> That of all things a man may diſpute alike; that we do nothing but ſearch, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and grope after appearances, <hi>ſcimus nihil, opinamur ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſimilia;</hi> That veritie is not a thing of our owne inuention and purchaſe, and when it yeelds it ſelfe into our hands, we haue nothing in our ſelues whereby we may challenge it, poſſeſſe it, or aſſure our ſelues of it; That truth and falſhood enter into vs by one and the ſame gate, and there hold the ſame place and credit, and maintaine themſelues by the ſame meanes; That there is no opinion held by all, or currant in all places,

none that is not debated and diſputed, that hath not another held and maintained quite contrarie vnto it; That all things haue two handles and two viſages, and there is reaſon for all, and there is not any that hath not his contrarie, it is of lead, it turneth and accommodateth it ſelfe to whatſoeuer a man will haue it: To be ſhort, it is the doctrine and practiſe of all the wiſeſt, greateſt, and moſt noble Philoſophers, who haue made profeſſion of ignorance, doubting, enquiring, ſearching. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers notwithſtanding they haue beene dogmatiſts, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, yet it hath beene of geſtures and words only, and that to ſhew how far they could wade in the purchaſe and ſearch of the truth, <hi>quam docti fingunt magis quàm norunt;</hi> giuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things no other nor ſtronger title, than probabilitie and true likelihood, and handling them diuerſly, ſometimes with one viſage and in one ſenſe, ſometimes in another, by proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall queſtions, rather enquiring than inſtructing; and many times ſhewing that they ſpeake not in earneſt, but in ſport and for exerciſe; <hi>non tam id ſenſiſſe quod dicerent, quàm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercere ingenia materiae difficultate voluiſſe videntur.</hi> And who will beleeue that it was the purpoſe of <hi>Plato</hi> to tie men to his Common-wealth and his <hi>Idees,</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to his numbers, of <hi>Epicurus</hi> to his <hi>Atomes,</hi> or to giue them for currant coine?

And <hi>Aristotle</hi> the moſt reſolute of all the reſt, the prince of dogmatiſts, and peremptorie affirmers, the god of pedanties, how often hath he been croſt in his opinions, not knowing what to reſolue in that point of the ſoule, wherein he is almoſt alwaies vnlike to himſelfe, and in many other things more baſe which he knew not how to find or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ingeniouſly confeſſing ſometimes the great weakenes of man in finding and knowing the truth.</p>
               <p>They that haue come after, of a pedanticall and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſpirit, who make <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others ſay what they <note place="margin">6 <hi>Obiects.</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16995:143"/>
this modeſtie, and academicall ſtayednes, glorying in their obſtinate opinions, whether they be right or wrong; louing better a headie froward affirmer againſt their owne opinions, and againſt whom they may exerciſe their wit and skill, than a modeſt peaceable man, who doubteth and maketh ſtay of his iudgement, againſt whom their wits are dulled, that is to ſay, a foole than a wiſe man; like to women, who loue better to be contradicted, euen with iniurie, than that a man either out of the coldnes of his nature, or contempt ſhould ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, whereby they imagin they are either ſcorned or condemned, wherein they ſhew their iniquitie. For why ſhould it not be as lawfull to doubt, and conſider of things as doubtfull, not determining of any thing, as it is to them to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme? Why ſhould it not be lawfull ingenuouſly to confeſſe that which a man knoweth not, ſince in veritie he knoweth it not, and to hold in ſuſpence that which he is not aſſured of, and againſt which there are many reaſons and oppoſitions? It is certaine according to the opinion of the wiſeſt, that we are ignorant of much more than we know, that all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the leſſer part, and almoſt nothing, in regard of that we know not: the cauſes of our ignorances are infinit, and both in reſpect of the things themſelues either too farre from vs, or too neere, too great, or too little, too durable, or not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough, perpetuallie changing, and in reſpect of our ſelues, and the maner of knowing them, which as yet is not ſufficientlie learned. And that which we thinke we know, we know not, neither can we hold it well, for with violence it is got from vs, and if it may not be gotten becauſe our obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in opinion is ſtrong, yet we are contended with, and much troubled. Now how ſhould we be capable to know more or leſſe, if we grow reſolute in our opinions, ſettle and repoſe our ſelues in certaine things, and in ſuch maner, that we ſeeke no farther, nor examine any more that which we thinke to hold? They thinke this ſuſpenſion a ſhame and a weaknes, becauſe they know not what it is, and they perceiue not that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt men that are haue made profeſſion thereof; they bluſh, and haue not the heart freely to ſay, I know not, ſo much are they poſſeſſed with the opinion and preſumption of ſcience; and they know not that there is a kind of ignorance &amp; doubt,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16995:144"/>
more learned, and more certaine, more noble and generous, than all their ſcience and certaintie. This is that that hath made <hi>Socrates</hi> ſo renoumed and held for the wiſeſt man: It is the ſcience of ſciences, and the fruit of all our ſtudies: It is a modeſt, mild, innocent, and hartie acknowledgement of the myſticall height of truth, and of the pouertie of our humane condition full of darknes, weaknes, vncertaintie; <hi>cogitationes mortalium timidae, incertae adinuentiones nostrae: Deus nouit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitationes hominum quoniam vanae ſunt.</hi> Heere I would tell you, that I cauſed to be grauen ouer the gate of my little houſe which I built at <hi>Condom</hi> in the yeare 1600, this word, <hi>I know not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they will needs that we ſubmit our ſelues in all dutie to certaine principles, which is an vniuſt tyrannie. I yeeld my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conſent, that a man employ them in all iudgement, and make vſe of them, but yet not ſo as that a man may not ſpurne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, for againſt that opinion I oppoſe my ſelfe. Who is he in the whole world, that hath right to command, and giue lawes to the world, to ſubiect the ſpirits of men, and to giue principles which may be no more examined, that a man may no more denie or doubt of, but God himſelfe the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſpirit, and true principle of the world, who is only to be beleeued becauſe he ſaith it? All other things are ſubiect to triall and oppoſition, and it is weaknes to ſubiect our ſelues vnto it. If they will that I ſubmit my ſelfe to principles, I will ſay to them as the Curat ſaid to his pariſhoners in a matter of time, and as a Prince of ours to the Secretaries of this age in a point of religion, Do you firſt agree to theſe principles, and then I will ſubmit my ſelfe vnto them. Now there is as great doubt and diſpute in the principles, as in the concluſions, in the <hi>Theſes,</hi> as in the <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> whereby there are ſo many ſects among them, that if I yeeld my ſelfe to the one, I offend all the reſt. They ſay likewiſe, that it is a great affliction not to be reſolued, to remaine alwaies in doubt, yea, that it is a matter of difficultie for a man to continue long in that ſtate. They haue reaſon to ſay it, for they find it ſo in themſelues, being the propertie of fooles, and weake minds, of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous fooles, paſſionate and obſtinate in certaine opinions, who condemne all others, and although they be ouercome,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16995:144"/>
neuer yeeld themſelues, vexing and putting themſelues into choler, neuer acknowledging any reaſon. If they be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to change their opinions, being altered, they are as reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and obſtinate in their new, as they were before in their firſt opinion, not knowing how to hold any thing without paſſion, and neuer diſputing to learne and find the truth, but to maintaine that which they haue ſworne and bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto. Theſe kind of people know nothing, neither know they what it is to know, becauſe they thinke to know and to hold the truth in their ſleeue: Becauſe thou thinkeſt thou ſeeſt, thou ſeeſt nothing, ſaith the Doctor of truth to the <note place="margin">Ioh. 9.</note> glorious and preſumptuous man; <hi>Si quis existimet ſe ſcire ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, nondum cognouit quemadmodum oporteat cum ſcire.</hi> It is fit <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.</note> that weake men that haue not ſtrength, to keepe themſelues vpright vpon their feet, be kept vp with props, they cannot liue but in bonds, nor maintaine themſelues free, a people borne to ſeruitude, they feare Bug-beares, or that the Wolfe will eate them if they be alone. But in wiſe, modeſt, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men it is quite contrarie, the ſureſt ſtay and moſt happie eſtate of the ſpirit, which by this meanes keepeth it ſelfe firme, vpright, conſtant, inflexible, alwaies free and to it ſelfe: <hi>hoc liberiores &amp; ſolutiores ſumus, quia integra nobis iudicandi potestas manet.</hi> It is a very ſweet, peaceable, and pleaſant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorne or delay, where a man feareth not to faile or miſcount himſelfe, where a man is in the clame, vnder couert, and out of danger of participating ſo many errors produced by the fantaſie of man, and whereof the world is full of entangling himſelfe in complaints, diuiſions, diſputes, of offending di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts, of belying and gainſaying his owne beleefe, of changing, repenting, and readuiſing himſelfe. For how often hath time made vs ſee that we haue beene deceiued in our thoughts, and hath enforced vs to change our opinions? To be breefe, it is to keepe the mind in peace and tranquillitie, farre from agitations and vices, which proceed from that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of ſcience which we thinke to haue in things; for from thence do ſpring pride, ambition, immoderate defires, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie in opinion, preſumption, loue of nouelties, rebellion, diſobedience: from whence come troubles, ſects, hereſies, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, but from men fierce, obſtinate, &amp; reſolute in opinion?
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16995:145"/>
not from Academiques, neuters, modeſt, indifferent, ſtaied, that is to ſay, wiſemen. Moreouer let me tell them, that it is a thing that doth more ſeruice to piety, religion, and diuine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, than any thing whatſoeuer. I ſay ſeruice as well in the generation and propagation, as the conſeruation thereof. Diuinity, yea the myſticall part thereof, teacheth vs, that well to prepare our ſoules for God and the receiuing of his holy ſpirit, we muſt empty, cleanſe, purifie them, and leaue them naked of all opinion, beleefe, affection; make them like a white paper, dead to it ſelfe and to the world, that God might liue and worke in it, driue away the old maſter, to eſtabliſh the new, <hi>expurgate vetus fermentum, exuite veterem hominem:</hi> So that it ſeemeth, that to plant and eſtabliſh Chriſtianity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong infidels, or miſ-beleeuing people, as in theſe daies in <hi>China,</hi> it were a very excellent method to begin with theſe propoſitions and perſwaſions: That all the wiſedome of the world is but vanity and leaſing: That the world is wholly compoſed, torne, and vilefied with the forged phantaſticall opinions of euery priuate mans braine: That God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man to know the truth, but that hee cannot know it of himſelf, nor by any humane meanes: And That it is neceſſary that God himſelfe, in whoſe boſome it reſideth, and who hath wrought a deſire thereof in man, ſhould reueale it as he doth. But That the better to prepare himſelfe for this reuelation, man muſt firſt renounce and chaſe away all opinions and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefs, wherewith the ſpirit is already anticipated and beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and preſent himſelfe white, naked, and ready to receiue it. Hauing well beaten and gained this point, and made men as it were Academicks and Pyrrhonians, it is neceſſary that we propoſe the principles of Chriſtianity as ſent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, brought by the Embaſſadour and perfect meſſenger of the diuinity, authoriſed and confirmed in his time by ſo many maruellous proofes and authenticall teſtimonies. So that we ſee that this innocent and modeſt delay from reſolution, is a great meanes to true piety, not only to receiue it, as hath been ſaid, but to preſerue it, for with it there neuer are hereſies, and ſelected particular extrauagant opinions. An <hi>Academicke</hi> or <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> was neuer hereticke, they are things oppoſite. It may be ſome man will ſay that he will neuer bee either good
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16995:145"/>
Chriſtian or Catholike, becauſe he will as well be a neuter and irreſolute in the one, as the other. This is to vnderſtand amiſſe that which hath beene ſpoken, becauſe there is no delay to be made, nor place to iudge, nor liberty in that which concerneth God, but wee muſt ſuffer him to put and engraue that which pleaſeth him, and none other. I haue made heere a digreſſion for the honour of this our rule againſt ſuch as contradict it. Let vs now returne to the matter.</p>
               <p>After theſe two, to iudge of all, to be ſlow in determining, there commeth in the third place, the vniuerſality of ſpirit, <note place="margin">7 3. <hi>The third part, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                  </note> whereby a wiſe man taketh a view and entreth into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole Vniuerſe, hee is a citizen of the world like <hi>Socrates,</hi> hee containeth in his affection all humanekind, hee walketh through all, as if they were neere vnto him; hee ſeeth like the ſunne, with an equall, ſetled, and indifferent regard, as from a high watch-tower all the changes and interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able courſes of things, not changing himſelfe; but alwaies continuing one and the ſame, which is a liuery of the diuinitie, and a high priuiledge of a wiſe man, who is the image of God vpon earth. <hi>Magna &amp; generoſares animus humanus, nullos ſibi poni niſi communes &amp; cum Deo terminos patitur.

It is a ſottiſh weakeneſſe to thinke that a man muſt beleeue, doe, liue in all reſpects as at home in his owne village and country, or that the accidents that fall out heere, concerne and are common with the reſt of the world. A foole, if a man tell him that there are diuers maners, cuſtomes, lawes, opinions, contrary to thoſe which hee ſeeth in vſe, either he will not beleeue them, and ſaith they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; or hee preſently refuſeth and condemneth them as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, ſo partiall is hee, and ſo much enthralled with thoſe his municipall maners, which hee accounteth the onely true, naturall, vniuerſall. Euery man calleth that barbarous that agreeth not with his palat and cuſtome, and it ſeemeth that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16995:146"/>
we haue no other touch of truth and reaſon, than the example and the <hi>idea</hi> of the opinions and cuſtomes of that countrie where we liue. Theſe kind of people iudge of nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they, they are flaues to that they hold, a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and anticipation of opinions doth whollie poſſeſſe them, they are ſo beſorted, that they can neither ſay, nor do otherwiſe. Now partialitie is an enemie to libertie, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulleth the mind alreadie tainted and preoccupated with a particular cuſtome, that it cannot iudge aright of others; an indifferent man iudgeth all things. He that is faſtned to one place, is baniſhed and depriued from all others. The paper that is blurred with another colour, is no more capable of any other, whereas the white is fit to receiue any. A iudge that heares a cauſe! with a preiudicate opinion, and inclineth to one part more than to another, cannot be a iuſt, vpright, and true iudge. Now a wiſe man muſt free himſelfe from this bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh blockiſhnes, and preſent vnto himſelfe as in a table this great image of our mother Nature in her entire maieſtie, marke and conſider hir in a Realme, an Empire, yea in this whole viſible world, as in the figure of a ſmall point, and there reade that generall and conſtant varietie in all things, ſo many humours, iudgements, beleefes, cuſtomes, lawes; ſo many alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ſtates, changes of fortune; ſo many victories and conqueſts buried and forgotten, ſo many pomps and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes vaniſhed, as if they had neuer been. Heereby a man may learne to know himſelfe, to admire nothing, to thinke nothing new, or ſtrange, to ſettle and reſolue himſelfe in all things.

The Egyptian prieſts told <hi>Herodotus</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:16995:146"/>
that ſince their firſt King (which was aboue eleuen thouſand yeares before, the picture and ſtatue of whom, and of all that ſucceeded him, they ſhewed him drawne to the life) the Sun had changed his courſe four times. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in the time of <hi>Diodorus</hi> (as he ſaith) &amp; <hi>Cicero,</hi> had a regiſter of ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand yeares. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith they of the citie of <hi>Sais,</hi> had memorials in writing of eight thouſand yeares; and that the citie of <hi>Athens</hi> was built a thouſand yeares before the ſaid citie of <hi>Sais. Zoroaster, Plinie,</hi> and others haue affirmed, that <hi>Socrates</hi> liued ſix thouſand yeares before the time of <hi>Plato.</hi> Some haue ſaid, that the world hath been from all eternitie, mortall, and growing and being againe by interchangeable courſes. Others and the more noble Philoſophers, haue held the world for a god, made by another god greater than it, or as <hi>Plato</hi> auerreth; and others argue from the motions thereof, that it is a creature compoſed of a bodie and of a ſoule, which ſoule lodging in the centre thereof, diſperſeth and ſpreadeth it ſelfe by muſicall numbers into the circumference, and parts thereof, the heauen, the ſtarres, compoſed of bodies and of a ſoule, mortall by reaſon of their compoſition, immortall by the decree and determination of the Creator. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that the world changeth countenance in all reſpects: that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the ſtarres, the ſunne change and quite alter by turnes their motions, in ſuch ſort, that that which was firſt is laſt, the Eaſt is made the Weſt; and according to the ancient and moſt authenticall opinion, and of the more famous ſpirits, worthie the greatnes of God, and founded vpon reaſon, there are many worlds, in ſo much that there is nothing one and only in this world, all kinds are multiplied in number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſeemeth not to haue ſemblance of truth, that God hath made this only worke, without companion, and that all is concluded in this one <hi>indiuiduum;</hi> at the leaſt diuinitie ſaith that God could make many, and infinite worlds, for if he could make no more but this one viſible, his power ſhould be finite, becauſe the world is ſuch.</p>
               <p>By that which we haue learned of the diſcouerie of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> new world, the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, we ſee firſt that all our ancient writers haue beene deceiued, thinking to haue found the meaſure of the habitable earth, and to haue comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16995:147"/>
the whole <hi>Coſmographie,</hi> except ſome ſcattered Ilands, doubting of the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> for now behold another world, almoſt ſuch as ours is, and that all vpon firme land, inhabited, peopled, politiquely gouerned, diſtinguiſhed by realmes, and Empires, beautified with cities, that excell in beautie, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, opulencie, all thoſe of <hi>Aſia, Africa, Europe,</hi> many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares ago: And who doubteth but that in time heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after there will be diſcouered diuers others? If <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and other our ancient Writers haue been heeretofore deceiued, why ſhould not he be likewiſe deceiued that affirmeth, that all is alreadie found and diſcouered? Say it he that will, I will beleeue him as I liſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſee that the Zones which were thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable by reaſon of their exceſſiue heate and cold, are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that in theſe new countries, almoſt all things which we ſo much eſteeme of heere, and hold that they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> firſt reuealed and ſent from heauen, were commonly beleeued and obſerued (from whence they came, I will not ſay, who dares determine it?) Yea many of them were in vſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares before we heard any tidings of them, both in the matter of religion, as the beleefe of one only man the father of vs all, of the vniuerſall deluge, of one God, who ſometimes liued in the forme of a man vndefiled and holy, of the day of iudgement, the reſurrection of the dead, circumciſion like to that of the Iewes, and <hi>Mahumet:</hi> And in the matter of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as that the elder ſonne ſhould ſucceed in the inheritance, that he that is exalted to a dignitie, loſeth his owne name &amp; takes a new; tyrannicall ſubſidies, armories, tumblers, muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtruments; all ſorts of ſports, Artillerie, Printing. From all theſe diſcourſes we may eaſily draw theſe concluſions: That this great bodie which we call the world, is not that which we thinke and iudge it to be; That neither in the whole, nor parts thereof, it is alwaies the ſame, but in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall flux and reflux; That there is nothing ſaid, held, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at one time and in one place, which is not likewiſe ſaid, held, beleeued in another, yea and contradicted, reprooued, condemned elſe-where; the ſpirit of man being capable of all things, the world alwaies tumbling, ſometime the ſame, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16995:147"/>
diuers; That all things are ſetled and comprehended in this courſe and reuolution of nature, ſubiect to increaſe, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, ending, to the mutation of times, places, climats, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, aires, countries. And from theſe concluſions we learne, to marie our ſelues, to ſweare to nothing, to admire, to trouble our ſelues at nothing; but whatſoeuer ſhall happen, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer men talke of and trouble themſelues about, to reſolue vpon this point, that it is the courſe of the world, that it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that worketh theſe things; but yet wiſely to prouide that nothing hurt vs by our own weaknes and deiection of mind. Enough is ſaid of this perfect libertie of iudgement, eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by theſe three parts, to iudge of all, to iudge nothing, to be vniuerſall, wherein I haue the rather inſiſted, becauſe I know that it pleaſeth not the palat of the world, it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to pedanterie as well as wiſdome, but yet it is a faire floure or ornament of wiſdome, which preſerueth vs from two contrarie rocks, whereon the vulgar ſort do commonly loſe themſelues, that is to ſay, from being headie, opinatiue, ſhamefull gainſayers, repenters, mutable; and a man maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelfe in a ſweet, peaceable, and aſſured modeſtie and great libertie of ſpirit, noble and magnificall vniuerſalitie. This is that great qualitie and ſufficiencie of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricaeus</hi> of the wiſe, by the confeſſion of all, of whom it is ſaid as <hi>Plutarch</hi> diſcourſeth, That he neuer brought forth, but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as a Midwife, he made others to bring foorth. This is very neere and in ſome ſenſe the diſorder of the <hi>Pyrhonians,</hi> the neutralitie and indifferencie of the <hi>Academicks,</hi> from whence proceedeth, not to be aſtoniſhed at any thing, not to admire any thing, the ſoueraigne good of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the magnanimitie of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>

               <p>It is a ſtrange thing that man will not ſo much as taſte it, yea is offended to heare ſpeach thereof, loueth better to continue a ſlaue to runne from one part to another, than to be to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to liue of his owne, to be aboue all, and to paſſe equallie through all. 5. Hath he not reaſon to cry with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> farre more iuſtly, <hi>O homines ad ſeruitutem nati?</hi> What monſter is this, to deſire to haue all things free, his bodie, his members,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16995:148"/>
his goods, and not his ſpirit, which neuertheleſſe is only borne vnto libertie? A man will willinglie make benefit of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is in the world, that comes from the Eaſt or the Weſt, for the good and ſeruice of his bodie, nouriſhment, health, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, and accommodate it all vnto his vſe, but not for the culture of his ſpirit, benefit and enriching, giuing his bodie the libertie of the fields, and holding his ſpirit in cloſe priſon.</p>
               <p>The other libertie which is of the will, muſt likewiſe be in high eſteeme with a wiſe man. We ſpeake not heere of the <note place="margin">7 2 <hi>The ſecond part, libertie of will.</hi>
                  </note> free will of man, according to the maner of Diuines: we ſay, that a wiſe man to maintaine himſelfe in reſt and libertie, muſt manage his will and his affections, in giuing himſelfe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting but few things, and thoſe iuſt (for the iuſt are but few in number if a man iudge well) and that without violence and aſperitie. There enter heere into combat (or to ſpeake more mildly, there are to be explicated and vnderſtood) two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and plauſible opinions in the world; the one teacheth to be readie and willing in the ſeruice of another, to forget our ſelues for our neighbor, and principallie for the weale-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, in reſpect whereof the particular is not to be reſpected: the other to cary our ſelues couragiouſly with actiuitie, zeale, affection. He that doth not the firſt, is accuſed not to haue any charitie; He that doth not the ſecond, ſuſpected to be cold, not to be a friend, and not to haue that zeale or ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that he ought. Some would haue theſe two opinions to preuaile beyond reaſon and meaſure, and there is not any thing which hath not been ſpoken heerof: for the heads or Cheeftaines many times preach things according to that vſe for which they ſerue, not according as they are: And many times the trueſt opinions are not the more profitable. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſeeing we hold our ſelues too much to our ſelues, and with a tye too naturall, they would diſtract vs and draw vs along, as they that go about to ſtreighten a crooked ſtaffe, bend it as much more the contrary way.</p>
               <p>But theſe opinions ill vnderſtood and ill taken, as they are by diuers, bring with them iniuſtice, trouble, paine, and much <note place="margin">8 <hi>The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others.</hi>
                  </note> euill, as a man may ſee in thoſe who backbite and detract from all, giuing themſelues to hire, and the ſeruice of another: They do not only ſuffer themſelues to be caried, and feaſed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16995:148"/>
vpon, but they likewiſe thruſt themſelues into all matters, as well into thoſe that concerne them not, as thoſe that do, as well into ſmall as great, and many times for no other cauſe, but to employ and buſie themſelues, <hi>in negotijs ſunt negotij cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa;</hi> and becauſe they cannot hold and ſtay themſelues, asif they had nothing to doe, with and within themſelues, and that for want of inward, eſſentiall, proper and domeſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, they ſeeke and vndergoe thoſe that are ſtrange vnto them. They are good husbands and frugall enough of their purſe, but prodigall of their ſoules, their liues, their time, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and willes, the good husbandrie whereof is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and commendable. And if they giue themſelues to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, it is with ſuch paſſion and violence, that they are no more their owne men, ſo whollie doe they engage and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelues thereinto. Great men ſeeke after ſuch people, that will grow into paſſion and kill themſelues for them, and they allure them with faire promiſes and much Arte, to win them vnto them; and they alwaies find fooles enow that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, but thev that are wiſe will take heed of them.</p>
               <p>This is firſt vniuſt, it wholly troubleth the ſtate, driues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the reſt, and libertie of the ſpirit. It is, not to know that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> which euery one ought to know, and by how many offices euery man is obliged vnto himſelfe; whileſt they ſeeke to be officious and ſeruiceable to another, they are vniuſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Wee haue all buſineſſe enough with and within our ſelues, and neede not ſeeke meanes to loſe our ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and to giue our ſelues vnto others: euery man muſt hold him to himſelfe. He that knowes not how to liue honeſtly, healthfully, and merrily, is ill aduiſed, and takes an ill and vnnaturall courſe, if he thinke to doe it by ſeruing another. He muſt affect and tie himſelfe but to a few things and thoſe iuſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſharpe intention and paſſionate affection, troubleth all, and hindreth the conduct of thoſe affaires to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which he ſo much giueth himſelfe; as in a precipitate paſe too much haſt makes a man ſtumble and enterfeare, and ſo ſtaies him whether he will or no: <hi>Ipſa ſe volocitas implicat, vnde feſtinatio tarda eſt. Qui nimium properat ſeriùs abſoluit.</hi> So likewiſe a man being drunken with this violent intention, he
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16995:149"/>
entangleth and fettereth himſelfe, commits many indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and wrongs, growes into hard conceits and ſuſpicions of others, becomes impatient in croſſe or ſlow occurrents that fall not out according to his owne deſire: <hi>malè cuncta mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat impetus.</hi> This is ſeene not only in ſerious affaires, but alſo vaine and friuolous, as in play, where hee that is carried with an ardent thirſt of gaining, troubleth himſelfe, and the more hee troubleth himſelfe, the more hee loſeth. Hee that walkes moderately, is alwaies with himſelfe, directeth his buſineſſe with better aduantage, and more ſuredly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: he diſſembleth, applieth, deferreth all to his owne leaſure, and as his occaſions ſhall fall out: if hee chance to be conuicted in a matter, it is without torment and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being alwaies readie for a new charge: hee alwaies marcheth with the bridle in his hand, <hi>feſtinat lentè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this violent affection infecteth and corrupteth euen the iudgement it ſelfe: for following one part and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the aduantage thereof, they wax mad if they be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, attributing to their partie falſe praiſes and conditions, and to the contrary falſe accuſations; interpreting all prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtications and occurrents at their owne pleaſure, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſerue their owne deſignements. All that are of the contrary part, muſt needs be wicked and of contrarie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yea and they that ſpeake anie good, or deſcrie anie good thing in them, are likewiſe ſuſpected to be of their part. Can it not poſſiblie be that a man honeſt in all things elſe, or at leaſt in ſome thing, may follow a wicked perſon, maintaine a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cauſe? It is enough that paſſion enforce the will, but that it cary likewiſe the iudgement, and make that a foole, this is too much. It is the ſoueraigne and laſt part that ſhould alwaies maintaine it owne authority; and we muſt ingenuouſlie, and in good ſooth acknowledge the good that is in our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the euill that is in thoſe whom wee follow. The ground and foundation of the controuerſie being laid aſide we muſt keepe moderation and indifferency, and out of the buſineſſe it ſelfe baniſh all choler, all diſcontent. And thus we ſee the euils that this ouergreat affection to any thing whatſoeuer bringeth with it; of all, yea of goodneſſe and wiſedome it ſelfe a man may haue too much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:16995:149"/>
But for a rule heerein, we muſt remember, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">12 <hi>An aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> and moſt lawfull charge that we haue, is in euery man the conduct and guide of himſelfe. The reaſon why we are here, is, that we ſhould maintaine our ſelues in tranquillitie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. And to do this, the beſt remedie is, to lend our ſelues to others, and to giue our ſelues to none but to our ſelues; to take our affaires into our hands, not to place them in our hearts; to take buſineſſe vpon vs, but not incorporate them into vs; to be diligent, not paſſionate, not to tie our ſelues but to a few, but rather alwaies to reſerue our ſelues vnto our ſelues. This counſell condemneth not thoſe offices due to the weale-publike, to our friends, our neighbour, yea it is ſo farre from it, that a wiſe man muſt be officious and charitable, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie vnto himſelfe the cuſtomes of other men and the world, and the rather to do it, he muſt contribute to publike ſocietie thoſe offices and duties which concerne him. <hi>Qui ſibi amicus est, hunc omnibus ſcito eſſe amicum.</hi> But I require a double mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and diſcretion heerein; the one, that a man applie not himſelfe to all that is preſented vnto him, but to that which is iuſt and neceſſarie; and that is not hard to be done: the other, that it be without violence and trouble. He muſt deſire little, and that little moderately; buſie himſelfe little, and that peaceably: and in thoſe charges that he vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, employ his paſe, his ſpeech, his attentions, his ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, his meanes, and if need be, his blood, his life; but yet without vexation and paſſion, keeping himſelfe alwayes to himſelfe in health and tranquillitie. A man may performe his dutie ſufficiently without this ardencie, and this ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of will. And they deceiue themſelues very much, that thinke that a buſineſſe is not well done, and there is no maner of affection, if it be not done with tempeſt, clamour and clatter: for contrariwiſe, it is that that hindreth and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the good guide and conduct thereof, as hath been ſaid. O how many men hazzard their liues euery day in thoſe warres which no way concerne them, and thruſt themſelues into the danger of that bartell, the loſſe whereof doth no way trouble their ſleepe: and all to the end they may not faile in their dutie! whileſt there is another in his owne houſe, that dares not enter the danger, or looke the enemie in the face, is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16995:150"/>
more affected with the iſſue of that warre, and hath his mind more troubled than the ſouldier that aduentureth his blood and life in the field.</p>
               <p>Finally, we muſt know how to diſtinguiſh and ſeparate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> our ſelues from our publike charges: euery one of vs playeth two parts, two perſons; the one ſtrange and apparent, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper and eſſentiall: we muſt diſcerne the skinne from the ſhirt. An actiue man will performe his charge, and yet withall not leaue to iudge of the follie, vice, deceit that is therein: he will conforme himſelfe to euery thing, becauſe the cuſtome of his countrey requireth it, it is profitable to the weale-publike: the world liues ſo, and therefore it muſt be done. A man muſt ſerue and make vſe of the world ſuch as he findeth it; in the meane time, he muſt likewiſe conſider it as a thing eſtranged from it ſelfe, know how to keepe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie himſelfe apart, and to communicate himſelfe to his owne truſtie good, howſoeuer things fall out with himſelfe.</p>

               <p>HAuing prepared and diſpoſed our ſcholar to wiſdome by theſe precedent aduiſements, that is to ſay, hauing purified and freed him from all euils, and placed him in a good eſtate, of a full and vniuerſall libertie, to the end he may haue a perfect view, knowledge and power ouer all things (which is the priuiledge of a wiſe and ſpirituall man, <hi>ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis omnia dijudicat)</hi> it is now time to giue him inſtructions and generall rules of wiſdome. The two firſt ſhall be as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles and foundations, whereof the firſt and principall is honeſtie or probitie.</p>
               <p>It will not be, perhaps, any matter of difficultie, to make good this propoſition, That honeſtie is the firſt principall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and fundamentall part of wiſdome: for all (whether in truth and good earneſt, or in outward ſhew, for ſhame or feare to ſay the contrarie) doe applaud it; they alwayes honour it in the firſt place, confeſſing themſelues ſeruitours and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate followers thereof: but it will coſt me ſome labour to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16995:150"/>
ſhew and perſwade, which is that true and eſſentiall probitie we heere require. For that which is in authoritie and credit, wherewith the whole world contenteth it ſelfe, that which is only knowne, ſought for, and poſſeſſed (I alwaies except ſome few of the wiſer) is baſtardly, artificiall, falſe, and counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Firſt we know that many times we are lead &amp; pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">2 <hi>Maſques of honestie.</hi>
                  </note> to vertue and honorable actions, by wicked and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned meanes, by default &amp; naturall impotencie, by paſſion, and vice it ſelfe; chaſtitie, ſobrietie, temperancie may be in vs by reaſon of our corporall imbecillitie; the contempt of the world, patience in aduerſitie, conſtancie in danger, proceede many times from want of apprehenſion and iudgement: valor, liberalitie, iuſtice it ſelfe, from ambition: diſcretion, prudence, from feare, from auarice. And how many beautifull actions hath preſumption and temeritie brought forth? So that the actions of vertue are many times no other but maſques, they carie the outward countenance, but they haue not the eſſence; they may very well be termed vertuous in conſideration of another, and of the viſage they cary out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and in publike, but in truth and with the actor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe they are nothing ſo; for it will appeare at the laſt, that profit, glorie, cuſtome, and other the like ſtrange cauſes haue induced him to do them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they ariſe from ſtupiditie and brutiſh ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and therefore it is ſaid, that wiſdome and ſottiſh ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie do meete in one and the ſame point, touching the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſuffering of humane actions. It is then very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to iudge of the probitie or improbitie of a man by his actions: we muſt ſound him within, from what foundation theſe motions doe ariſe: wicked men performe many times many good and excellent actions, and both good and euill preſerue themſelues alike from doing euill, <hi>oderunt peccare boni &amp; mali.</hi> To diſcouer therefore and to know which is the true Honeſtie, we muſt not ſtay in the outward action, that is but the ſigne, the ſimpleſt token, and many times a cloke and maske to couer villanie: we muſt penetrate into the inward part, and know the motiue which cauſeth the ſtrings to play, which is the ſoule and the life that giueth motion to all. It is that whereby we muſt iudge, it is that wherein euery man

                  </note> make expreſſe profeſſion, who haue the title and publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to be men of honeſtie and ſetled conſtancie, is ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall, and pedanticall, ſeruant to the lawes, enforced by hope, and feare, acquired, learned and practiſed out of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion too, &amp; a conſideration of the religion, lawes, cuſtomes, commaunds of ſuperiors, other mens examples, ſubiect to preſcript formes, effeminate, fearefull, and troubled with ſcruples and doubts; <hi>ſunt quibus innocentia niſi metu non placet:</hi> which is not only in reſpect of the world diuers and variable, according to the diuerſitie of religions, lawes, examples, formes, (for the iuriſdictions changing, the motions muſt likewiſe alter) but alſo in it ſelfe vnequall, wauering, deambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorie, according to the acceſſe, receſſe, and ſucceſſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, the occaſions which are preſented, the perſons with whom a man hath to do, as a ſhip driuen with the winds and the oares, is caried away with an vnequall tottering paſe, with many blowes, blaſts, and billows. To be breefe, theſe are honeſt men by accident and occaſion, by outward and ſtrange euents, and not in veritie and eſſence; they vnderſtand it not, and therefore it is eaſie to diſcouer them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them, by ſhaking of a little their bridle, and ſounding them ſomewhat nearer, but aboue all, by that inequalitie and diuerſitie which is found in them: for in one and the ſame action they will giue diuers iudgements, and cary themſelues altogether after a diuers faſhion, going ſometimes a ſlow paſe, ſometimes running a maine gallop. This vnequall diuerſitie proceedeth from this, that the outward occaſions which moue and ſtirre them, do either puffe them vp, multiplie and increaſe them, or make them luke-warme and deiect them, more or leſſe like accidents, <hi>quae recipiunt magis &amp; minus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that true honeſtie, which I require in him that will be wiſe, is free, manly, and generous, pleaſant, and cheerefull, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall <note place="margin">4 <hi>The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true honestie.</hi>
                  </note>, vniforme, and conſtant, which marcheth with a ſtayed paſe, ſtately and hawtie, going alwaies his owne way, neither looking on this ſide, or behind him, without ſtaying or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16995:151"/>
his paſe, or gate for the wind, the times, the occaſions, which are changed, but that is not, I meane in iudgement and will, that is in the ſoule, where honeſtie reſideth and hath it ſeate. For outward actions, eſpeciallie the publike haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iuriſdiction, as ſhall be ſaid in his place: This honeſtie I will deſcribe in this place, giuing you firſt to vnderſtand, that following the deſignment of this booke declared in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, I ſpeake of humane honeſtie and wiſdome, as it is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, whereby a man is called an honeſt man and a wiſe, and not of Chriſtian, though in the end I may chaunce to ſpeake a word or two thereof.</p>
               <p>The iuriſdiction of this honeſtie is Nature, which bindeth <note place="margin">5 Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie.</note> euery man to be, and to make himſelfe ſuch as he ought, that is to ſay, to conforme and rule himſelfe according vnto it. Nature is together both a miſtris which enioyneth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth honeſtie, and a law and inſtruction which teacheth it vnto vs. As touching the firſt, there is a naturall obligation inward and vniuerſall in euery man to be honeſt, iuſt, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, following the intention of his author and maker. A man ought not to attend or ſeeke any other cauſe, obligation, inſtinct, or motiue of this honeſtie; and he can neuer know how to haue a more iuſt and lawfull, more powerfull, more ancient, it is altogether as ſoone as himſelfe, borne with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Euery man ſhould be, or ſhould deſire to be an honeſt man, becauſe he is a man, and he that takes no care to be ſuch is a monſter, renounceth himſelfe, belieth, deſtroyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, by right he is no more a man, and in effect ſhould deſiſt to be a man. It is neceſſarie that honeſtie grow in him by himſelfe, that is to ſay, by that inward inſtinct which God hath put in him, and not from any other outward and ſtrange cauſe, any occaſion, or induction. A man will not, out of a iuſt and regular will, any thing that is depraued, or corrupt, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it owne nature requireth, it implieth a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deſire or accept a thing, and nothing to care whether it be worth the caring for; a man would haue all his parts good and ſound, his bodie, his head, his eies, his iudgement, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, yea his hoſe and ſhooes; and why will he not like wiſe haue his will, and his conſcience good, that is to ſay, be whollie good and ſound? I will therefore that he be good,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16995:152"/>
and haue his will firme and reſolued to equity and honeſty, for the loue of himſelfe, and becauſe he is a man, knowing that he can be no other, without the renouncing and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of himſelfe, and ſo his honeſty ſhall be proper, inward, eſſentiall, euen as his owne eſſence is vnto him, and he vnto himſelfe. It muſt not then be for any outward conſideration, and proceeding from without, whatſoeuer it bee, for ſuch a cauſe being accidentall and outward, may happen to faile, grow weake, and alter, and conſequently all that honeſty that is grounded thereupon, muſt doe the like. If he be an honeſt man, for honour, or reputation, or other recompence, being in a ſolitary place, where he hath no hope to be knowen, hee either ceaſeth to be honeſt, or putteth it in practiſe very cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and negligently. If for feare of the lawes, magiſtrates, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, if he can deceiue the lawes, circumuent the iudges, auoid or diſprooue the proofes, and hide himſelfe from the knowledge of another, there is an end of his honeſty. And this honeſtie is but fraile, occaſioned, accidentall and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and yet it is that which is in authoritie and vſe, no man knowes of any other, there is not an honeſt man, but ſuch as is enforced or inuited by ſome cauſe, or occaſion, <hi>nemo gratis bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt.</hi> Now I would haue in this my wiſe man an eſſentiall and inuincible honeſtie, which dependeth of it ſelfe, and ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from it owne root, and may as hardlie bee ſeparated, and rooted out, as humanitie from a man. I will that he neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto euill, and though his honeſtie be not made knowen to any, yet if he know it himſelfe, what needs any more? If all the world beſides ſhould know it, it is not ſo much, <hi>quid tibi prodeſt non habere con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ium, habenti conſcient iam?</hi> And what though he receiue no great recompence for it? For what may it be that concerneth him ſo neere, as his own proper eſſence? This were not to care how bad the horſe is, ſo the ſaddle bee faire. I will then that thoſe things be inſeparable, to be, and to conſent to liue a man, to be, and to be willing to bee an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man. This firſt hath beene ſufficientlie preſſed. Let vs come to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Now the paterne and rule to bee honeſt, is this nature it <note place="margin">6 <hi>Nature tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</hi>
                  </note> ſelfe, which abſolutely requireth that wee be ſuch, it is, I ſay, this equitie and vniuerſall reaſon which ſhineth in euery one
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16995:152"/>
of vs. Hee which worketh according to it, worketh truely according to God, for it is God, or at leaſt, his firſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and vniuerſall law, which hath brought it into the world, and which came firſt from God; for God and nature are in the world, as in a ſtate, the king, the author and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the fundamentall law which he hath made for the preſeruation and gouernment of the ſaid eſtate. This is a lightning and ray of the diuinitie, a ſtreame and dependance of the eternall law, which is God himſelfe and his will: <hi>quid natura niſi Deus, &amp; diuina ratio toti mundo, &amp; partibus eius inſerta?</hi> He worketh alſo according to himſelfe, for he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth according to the ſterne, and animated inſtinct, which he hath within himſelfe mouing and ſtirring him: and ſo he is an honeſt man eſſentially, and not by accident and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for this law and light is eſſentiall and naturall in vs, and therefore it is called Nature, and the law of nature. He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by conſequent an honeſt man, alwaies and perpetually, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformly and equally at all times and in all places: for this law of equitie, and naturall reaſon is perpetuall in vs, <hi>edictum perpetuum,</hi> inuiolable, which can neuer be extinct nor defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>quam nec ipſa delet iniquitas; vermis eorum non morietur,</hi> vniuerſall and conſtant in all things, and alwaies the ſame, equall vniforme, which neither time nor place can alter nor diſguiſe, receiueth neither acceſſe nor receſſe, more nor leſſe, <hi>ſubſtantia non recipit magis &amp; minus.</hi> What ſeckeſt thou elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, either law or rule in the world? What may a man ſay or alleadge which thou haſt not about thee and within, if thou wilt but feele and hearken to thy ſelfe? A man may ſay to thee, as to a bad debtor, who asked for what the debt is, and will ſee the bill which he hath about him, <hi>Quod petis intus habes;</hi> Thou demandeſt that which thou haſt in thy owne boſome. <hi>Signatum est ſuper nos lumen vultus tui.

Theſe are all riuers, but ſuch as neither haue ſo much water, nor ſo pure as the ſource and inuiſible fountaine, which is within thee, if thou ſuffer it not to periſh, and to be loſt: I ſay not ſo much water, <hi>Quam multa pietas, humanitas, liberalitas, fides exigunt, quae extra tabulas ſunt.</hi> O the miſerable honeſtie of formaliſts, who hold themſelues to the words of the law, and ſo thinke themſelues diſcharged!

Nature hath diſpoſed all things in the beſt ſtate that they could be, and hath giuen them the firſt motion to good, and the end which they ſhould ſeeke, in ſuch ſort, that he that will follow hir, need not obtaine and poſſeſſe his owne good and his owne end, <hi>Sapientia eſt in naturam conuerti, &amp; eò restitui vnde publicus error expulerit; Ab illa non deerr are, ad illius legem exemplum<expan>

themſelues, and conſequently more ſoundly: Others mount themſelues vpon their great horſes, play the light horſemen, bandie themſelues one againſt the other, keepe their braines alwaies in worke and agitation.

This fault and follie proceedeth from another, that is, that we eſteeme not of things according to their true and eſſentiall value, but according to the ſhew and report. How many are there more ſcrupulous and exact in thoſe things that belong to the poſitiue and municipall law, than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall?

dutie, conſcience. So that the ſhadow is more vnto vs than the bodie, the root, the countenance more than the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ſound veritie. That we may not offend a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, we couer and hide things naturall; we dare not name, and we bluſh at the ſound of things, which we doe in no ſort feare to do, both lawfull and vnlawfull. We dare not ſpeake that which is permitted to doe, we dare not directly to name our owne proper members, and yet we feare not to employ them in all maner of wickedneſſe: we pronounce, ſpeake, and do, without feare and without ſhame, wicked things, and ſuch as are againſt nature and reaſon, forſweare, betray, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, kill, deceiue; and we bluſh to ſpeake of things good, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, neceſſarie, iuſt and lawfull. There is not a husband, which is not more aſhamed to embrace his wife in the open view of the world, than to kill, lie, aſſaile; nor a woman that will not rather vtter any wickedneſſe in the world, than name that wherein ſhe taketh moſt delight, and may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doe. Euen to treaſons and murders, they tie themſelues to the lawes of a ceremonie, and there faſten their deuoires. A ſtrange thing, that iniuſtice ſhould complaine of inciuility, malice of indiſcretion! The act of a ceremonie, doth it not preuaile againſt nature? The ceremonie forbiddeth vs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe naturall things and lawfull, and we giue credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: Nature and reaſon forbiddeth vs things vnlawfull, and no man beleeues it: A man ſends his conſcience to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thell-houſe, and keeps his outward countenance in order. All this is monſtrous, and the like is not found amongſt beaſts. I will not for all this ſay (as I perceiue malice doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mutter) that ceremonie and decencie ought not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be kept, which is the ſalt and ſeaſoning of our actions and conuerſations. <hi>Amo verecundiam, in ea ornatus vitae, &amp;</hi>

of a naturall law is the vniuerſitie of approbation: for that which Nature ſhall haue truly ordemed for vs, we with a common conſent ſhall follow without doubting; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euery nation, but euery particular perſon.</p>
               <p>Now there is not any thing in the world which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and contradicted, not by one nation, but by diuers: and there is not any thing ſo ſtrange and vnnaturall in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diuers, which is not approued and authoriſed in many places by common vſe. The little care of hauing children, the murther of parents, of children, of himſelfe, mariage of the neereſt in bloud, theft, publike marchandize of their libertie and bodies, as well of males as females, are receiued by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vſe in many nations.</p>

               <p>So then the true honeſtie (the foundation and piller of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) is to follow nature, that is to ſay, reaſon. The good and <note place="margin">12 <hi>True hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</hi>

True honeſtie is a right and firme diſpoſition of the will to follow the counſell of reaſon: And as the heedle touched with the adamant neuer reſteth it ſelfe vntill he ſee the north point, and thereby ordereth and directeth the nauigation; ſo a man is neuer well, yea, he is as it were vndone, and diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, vntill he ſee this law, and directeth the courſe of his life, his maners, his iudgements and willes, according to the firſt, diuine, naturall law, which is an inward domeſticall light, whereof all the reſt are but beames.</p>

But to effect it, and to come to the practiſe, it is farre more eaſie to ſome, than to others. There are ſome that haue their <note place="margin">13 <hi>The distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of true honestie.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This kind of naturall and eaſie honeſtie, and as it were <note place="margin">Naturall goodnes.</note> borne with vs, is properly called goodneſſe, a qualitie of a ſoule well borne and well gouerned, it is a ſweetneſſe, facilitie, and debonairie mildneſſe of nature: and not (leſt any bodie ſhould be deceiued) a ſoftneſſe, a feminine, ſottiſh calmeneſſe and vitious facilitie, whereby a man delighteth to pleaſe all, and not to diſpleaſe or offend any, although he haue a iuſt and a lawfull cauſe, and it be for the ſeruice of reaſon and iuſtice; whereby it comes to paſſe, that they will not employ themſelues in lawfull actions, when it is againſt thoſe that take offence thereat; nor altogether refuſe the vnlawfull, when they pleaſe thereby thoſe that conſent thereunto. Of theſe kind of people it is ſaid (and this commendation is iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) He is good, ſince he is good euen to the wicked; and this accuſation true, How ſhould he be good, ſince he is not euill, to thoſe that are euill? We ſhould rather call this kind of goodneſſe innocencie, as men call little children ſheepe, and the like, innocent creatures. But an actiue, valiant, manly, and effectuall goodneſſe is that I require, which is a readie, eaſie, and conſtant affection vnto that which is good, right, iuſt, according to reaſon and nature.</p>
               <p>There are others ſo ill borne and bred, that it ſeemeth (that like monſters) their particular natures are made, as it were in deſpite of the vniuerſall nature, ſo croſſe and contrarie are they thereunto. In this caſe the remedie to correct, reforme, ſweeten, make tame, and amend this euill, rough, ſauage, and crooked nature, to bend it and applie it to the rule of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and great miſtris the vniuerſall nature, is to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

to the ſtudy of philoſophie (as <hi>Socrates</hi> did) and vnto <note place="margin">Acquired vertue.</note> vertue, which is a combate and painfull endeuor againſt vice, a labourious ſtudie, which requireth time, labour, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. <hi>Virtus in arduo &amp; circa difficile: ad ianuam virtutis excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant labor &amp; ſudor.

               <p>By all this that hath beene ſaid, it appeareth that there are <note place="margin">14 <hi>Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
                  </note> two ſorts of true honeſtie; the one naturall, ſweet, eaſie, iuſt, called goodneſſe; the other acquired, difficult, painfull, and laborious, called vertue. But to ſay the truth, there is alſo a third, which is, as it were, compoſed of the two, and ſo there ſhould be three degrees of perfection. The loweſt of the three is a facill and debonairie nature, diſtaſted by it ſelfe by reaſon of vice; we haue named it goodneſſe, innocencie. The ſecond more high, which wee haue named vertue, is with a liuelie force to hinder the progreſſe of vice, and hauing ſuffered himſelfe to be ſurpriſed, with the firſt motions of the paſſions, to arme and bend himſelfe to ſtaie their courſe, and to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. The third and chiefeſt, is out of a high reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a perfect habit, to be ſo well framed, that temptations cannot ſo much as grow in him, and the ſeedes of vice are whollie rooted out, in ſo much that his vertue is turned into a complexion, and into nature. This laſt may be called perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. That &amp; the firſt, which is called goodneſſe, do reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one the other, and differ from the ſecond, in that they are without ſtirre, paine, or endeuour. This is the true tincture of the ſoule, hir naturall and ordinary courſe, which coſteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The ſecond is alwaies in care and in awe. The laſt and perfect is acquired by the long ſtudie and ſerious exerciſe of the rules of philoſophie, ioined to a beautifull and rich nature. For both are neceſſarie, the naturall and the acquired. This
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16995:156"/>
is that thoſe two ſects did ſo much ſtudie, the <hi>Stoickes</hi> and much more the Epicures (which would haue ſeemed ſtrange if <hi>Seneca</hi> and other ancient Philoſophers did not teſtifie it, who are rather to bee credited, than all the other more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne) who made aſport and play game of ſhame, want, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, griefes, tortures, death: They did not only contemne, patiently endure and vanquiſh all aſperities and difficulties, but they fought them, they tooke pleaſure and delight in them, and all to keepe their vertue in breath, and in action, which made them not only firme, conſtant, graue and ſeuere, as <hi>Cato</hi> and the <hi>Stoickes,</hi> but cheerefull, merry, wanton, and if a man may ſo ſay, foole-hardy too.</p>
               <p>By the compariſon of theſe three together, it ſeemeth to ſome (who vnderſtand not the height and value of the third) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that the ſecond, which we call vertue, by reaſon of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, dangers, endeuours thereof, carrieth the honour, and that as <hi>Metellus</hi> ſaid, to doe euill is an idle and a baſe thing; to doe good where there is neither paine nor danger, is a common thing and too eaſie; but to doe good where there is danger and paine, is the part of an honeſt man, and of vertue: it is the mot of that diuine Philoſopher <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But to ſpeake in truth that which it is, beſides that difficultie (as elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where hath beene ſaid) is no true, not iuſt and lawfull cauſe, why a thing ſhould be the more eſteemed, it is certaine that in the like thing the natural is more worth than the acquired, that it is far more noble, more excellent and diuine to worke by nature than by Art, eaſily, equally, vniformedly, than painfully, vnequally, with doubt and danger. God is good after the firſt maner, that is, the naturall and eſſentiall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we dare not call him vertuous, nor the Angels and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits fortunate they are called good. But becauſe vertue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a greater clamor and ſtirre, and worketh with greater vehemencie than goodneſſe, it is more admired and eſteemed of the vulgar ſort (who are but fooliſh iudges) but wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For theſe great exalters and extravagant productions; which ſeeme to be all zeale and fire, are no part of the play, and do not in any ſore appertaine to true honeſty; they are rather maladies and furious entrances, faire diſtant from that wiſdome we here require, which is ſweet, equal, &amp; vniforme.</p>

Thus much be ſpoken in groſſe of honeſtie; for the parts thereof and the duties ſhall be handled in the third booken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> eſpeciallie in the vertue of Iuſtice I will heere adde a word or two (according to promiſe) to rebate and blunt the point of detraction, and to ſtay the plaints of thoſe, that diſlike that I attribute ſo much to nature (although it be God as hath been ſaid, and this booke ſpeaketh not but of the naturall and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane) as if that were all, and there were nothing elſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Wherefore beſides all that hath been ſaid, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet one thing to make this worke complete and perfect, and that is the grace of God, whereby this hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, goodnes, vertue, hath life, is brought forth in his due tune, and receiueth it laſt and perfect portraict, it is eleuated, chriſtned, crowned, that is to ſay, accepted, verified, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by God, and made (after a ſort) worthie it due reward. Honeſtie is like to a good Organiſt, who toucheth well and truly according to arte: the grace and ſpirit of God, is the blaſt and wind which expreſſeth the touch, giueth life, and maketh the inſtrument to ſpeake, and to make a pleaſant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie. Now this good conſiſteth not in long diſcourſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and inſtructions, neither is it attained by our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act and labour, it is a free gift from aboue, whereof it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the name, Grace: but we muſt deſire it, aske, implore it, both humblie and ardentlie: O God, vouchſafe of thy infinit goodneſſe to looke vpon me with the eye of thy clemencie, to accept &amp; to like of my deſire, mine eſſaye, my little worke, which comes originallie from thee, by that obligation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which thou haſt giuen me in the law of nature, which thou haſt planted in me, to the end it may returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and that thou mayeſt end that thou haſt begun, that ſo thou mayeſt be both my α and ω Sprinckle me with thy grace, keepe me, and account me thine, and ſo forth.

That may well be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, and hath his worth, as in thoſe philoſophers &amp; great men in times paſt, admirable in nature, and in all kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertue, and is likewiſe found in misbeleeuers or Infidels; but this cannot be without that, no more than the couering, the crowne and perfection can be without the entire bodie.

There are three ſorts of wickedneſſe and wicked people ſome are incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into euill, by diſcourſe and reſolution, or by long habit, in ſuch ſort, that their vnderſtanding it ſelfe approueth it and conſenteth there unto. This falleth out, when ſinne hauing met with a ſtrong and vigorous heart, is in ſuch ſort rooted therein, that it is there formed and as it were naturalized, and the ſoule infected and wholly tainted therewith. Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe do ill by impulſions, according as the violent winde of temptation troubleth, ſtirreth and precipitateth the ſoule vnto ſinne, and as they are ſurpriſed and caried by the force of paſſion. The third, as midlings betwixt theſe two, account
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16995:158"/>
their vice ſuch as it is, they accuſe and condemne it, contrarie to the firſt, and they are not carried by paſſion or temptation as the ſecond; but in colde blood, hauing well thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they enter into the market, they ballance it with ſome great pleaſure or profit, and in the end at a certaine price and meaſure they yeeld thereunto, and they thinke they haue ſome excuſe to doe it. Of this ſort of ſinnes are vſuries, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenities or venereous pleaſures, and other ſinnes manie times reſumed, conſulted, deliberated, as alſo the ſinnes of complexion.</p>
               <p>Of theſe three, the firſt do neuer repent, without ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie <note place="margin">20 <hi>Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</hi>
                  </note> touch from heauen: for being ſetled and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in wickedneſſe, they feele not the pricke and ſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for ſince the vnderſtanding approueth it, and the ſoule is wholly tainted therewith, the will hath no will to gainſay it. The third repent, or ſeeme in a certaine faſhion, that is to ſay, ſimply conſidering the diſhoneſt action in it ſelfe, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards weighing it with profit or pleaſure, they repent not at all: and to ſay the truth, and to ſpeake properly, they do not repent, ſince both their reaſon and conſcience willeth and conſenteth to the fault. The ſecond are they that repent and readuiſe themſelues, and of whom properly it is called repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; whereof I will heere take occaſion to ſpeake a word or two.</p>
               <p>Repentance is a diſauowing or deniall, and a retractation <note place="margin">21 <hi>Of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                  </note> of the will, that is, a ſorrow or griefe ingendred in vs by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which driueth away all other ſorrowes and griefs which proceed from outward cauſes. Repentance is inward, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ingendred, and therfore more ſtrong than any other, as the heat and colde of a feauer is more violent than that which is outward. Repentance is the medicine of the ſoule, the death of ſinne, the cure of our willes and conſciences: but it is neceſſarie that we well know it. Firſt, it is not of euerie ſinne, as hath beene ſayd, not of that which is inueterate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated, authorized by the iudgement it ſelfe, but of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall, and that which happeneth either by ſurpriſe or by force; nor of things that are not in our power, whereof we are ſorrie we cannot repent; neither can it be in vs, by reaſon of bad iſſues, and contrary to our counſels and deſignments.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16995:159"/>
If a matter fall out beſides a mans thought, conceipt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; for that he muſt not repent him of his counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, if he therein carrie himſelfe as he ought, for a man cannot diuine of euents; and if a man did know them, yet he hath no place to conſult of them; and we neuer are to iudge of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels by their iſſues; neither muſt it grow in him by the age, impotencie, &amp; diſtaſte of things, this were to ſuffer his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be corrupted: for the things are not changed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are changed, by age, ſickneſſe, or other accidents. The growing wiſe, or amendment, which comes by anxietie, diſtaſte, or feeblenes, is not true and religious, but idle and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing. The weakneſſe of the bodie is no fit poſt to carie vs to God, and to our dutie and repentance, but true repentance is the gift of God, which toucheth our heart, and muſt grow in vs not by the weakneſſe of the bodie, but by the force of the ſoule and of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now from true repentance there ariſeth a true, free, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious confeſſion of our faults. As in the maladies of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <note place="margin">22 <hi>Of confeſſion and excuſe.</hi>
                  </note> we ſee two kinds of remedies, the one which healeth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the cauſe and roote of the maladie, the other which doth only couer it and bring it aſleepe, and therefore the former is more forcible and more wholſome. So likewiſe in the maladies of the ſoule, the true remedie which clenſeth and healeth, is a ſerious and modeſt confeſſion of our faults; the other falſe which doth only diſguiſe and couer, is excuſe, a remedie inuented by the author of euill it ſelfe, whereof the prouerb is, That ſinne ſoweth itſelfe a garment, that is, excuſe, the garment made of figge leaues by the firſt offenders, who couered themſelues both with words and deeds, but it was a garment without warmth. We ſhould therefore learne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our ſelues, boldly to confeſſe all our actions &amp; thoughts; for beſides that it were a faire and generous libertie, it were likewiſe a meane not to do or thinke any thing, which were not honeſt and fit to be publiſhed: for he that will be content to be bound to tell all, will be likewiſe content to bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to do nothing that a man is conſtrained to hide; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, euery man is diſcret and ſecret in confeſſion, but not in action. Boldnes to ſinne, is in ſome ſort bridled by boldnes to confeſſe. If it be vndecent to do a thing, it is farre more vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:16995:159"/>
not to dare to auouch it. Many great and holy men, as Saint <hi>Austin, Origen, Hippocrates,</hi> haue publiſhed the errours of their opinions, and we ſhould doe the like of our maners. By going about to hide them, a man falleth many times into greater euils, as he that ſolemnly denieth that he hath abuſed his bodie with another, by thinking to mend the matter marres it, at leaſtwiſe multiplies his ſinne. This is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vice, but to adde thereunto.</p>

Some are happie therein, who by a great goodnes and felicitie of nature, haue knowne both ſpeedily and eaſily how to chooſe, and either by a certaine good hap, without any great deliberation, are, as it were, whollie caried into that courſe of life, which doth beſt befit them, in ſuch ſort that fortune hath been their chooſer, and led them vnto it, or by the friendly and prouident hand of another, they haue been guided and directed. Others contrarily are vnhappie, who hauing failed euen from the entrance, and wanting the ſpirit or induſtrie to know themſelues, and in a good houre to be readuifed how they might cunningly withdraw their ſtake

in the middeſt of the game, are in ſuch ſort engaged, that they can no more recall themſelues, and ſo conſtrained to lead a life full of inconuenience and repentance.</p>
               <p>But it likewiſe proceedeth many times from the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of him that deliberateth, either in not knowing himſelfe well, and preſuming too much of himſelfe, whereby it falleth out that he muſt either ſhamefully deſiſt from that which he hath vndertaken, or endure much paine and torment in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting therein. Hee muſt remember that to carrie a burthen, it is neceſſary there be more ſtrength than burthen, otherwiſe a man is conſtrained either to leaue it, or to ſinke vnder it. A wiſe man doth neuer charge himſelfe with more buſineſſe, than he knoweth how to goe thorow: or in not ſetling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in any thing, but changing from day to day, as they doe that are neuer pleaſed nor ſatisfied with any thing, but that which they haue not, euery thing diſcontenteth them, as well eaſe, as buſineſſe, to command as to obey. Theſe kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple liue miſerablie, and without reſt, as men conſtrained. The other likewiſe cannot hold themſelues quiet, they ceaſe not to go and come to no purpoſe, they ſeeme to do much and do nothing; the actions of a wiſe man do alwaies tend to ſome certaine end, <hi>Magnam rem puta vnum hominem agere, praeter ſapientem nemo vnum agit, multiformes ſumus.</hi> But the moſt part doe not deliberate, and conſult of any thing, they ſuffer themſelues to be led like oxen, or carried according to the times, company, occaſion, and they know not how to giue a reaſon, why they are rather of this calling than another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be becauſe their father profeſt the ſame, or that they were vnawares carried into it, and ſo haue continued therein, in ſuch ſort, that as they did neuer well conſider of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, ſo they know not which way to get out, <hi>Pauci ſunt qui conſilio ſe ſuaque diſponant, caeteri eorum more qui fluminibus inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, non eunt ſed feruntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that a man may carrie himſelfe well heerein, chooſe well, and well acquite himſelfe, he muſt know two things and <note place="margin">3 <hi>Counſell in choſe afairs.</hi>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16995:160"/>
heauens, to leaue the buſineſſe vndone, becauſe hee cannot doe it, <hi>nec quidquam ſequi quod aſſequinequeas,</hi> and to expoſe himſelfe to laughter and mockery. Afterwards hee muſt know that which belongs to his affires, that is to ſay, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, profeſſion, and kinde of life that is propoſed. There are ſome wherein the affaires are great and weighty, others where they are dangerous, others where they are not ſo great, but are mingled, and full of entaglements, and that draw after them many other buſineſſes; theſe charges doe much afflict the ſpirit. Euery profeſſion requireth more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially one certaine facultie of the ſoule, one the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, another the imagination, another the memorie. Now to know theſe two natures, his owne, and that of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and courſe of life, that which hath beene ſaid of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers temperatures of the inward parts and faculties, will helpe much. Knowing theſe two natures, we muſt compare them together, to ſee whether they can well ioine and endure together, for it is neceſſarie that they agree; if a man be to conteſt with his owne nature, and to enforce it for the ſeruice and performance of a function and charge which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh; or contrarily, if to follow his nature, whether willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or that by force and inſenſibly it draw him, a man happen to faile or erre in his dutie, what diſorder is there? Where is equitie? Where is decencie? <hi>Si quicquam decorum, nihil profectò magis quàm aequabilitas vitae vniuerſae, &amp; ſingularum actionum, quam conſeruare non poſſis: ſi aliorum imiteris na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam, omittas tuam.</hi> This is the account wee muſt make, when we thinke to doe any thing that hath worth or grace in it, if nature it ſelfe be wanting,</p>

               <p>But no man doubteth, neither is it a matter of labour to know which is the trueſt, the Chriſtian religion hauing ſo <note place="margin">4 <hi>Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion aboue all.</hi>
                  </note> many aduantages and priuileges, ſo high and ſo authenticall

aboue others, and eſpecially theſe. It is the ſubiect of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond veritie, where is ſhewed how farre all others are inferior vnto it.</p>
               <p>Now as they ſpring vp one after another, the younger doth alwayes build vpon the more ancient and next precedent, <note place="margin">5 <hi>The latter are built vpon the former.</hi>
                  </note> which from the toppe to the bottome it doth not wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue &amp; condemn; for then it could not be heard or take foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but it only accuſeth it either of imperfection, or of the end, and that therfore it commeth to ſucceed it and to perfect it; and ſo by little and little ouerthroweth it, and inricheth it ſelfe with the ſpoiles therof: as the Iudaicall, which hath retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many things of the Gentile Egyptian religion the elder, the Hebrewes not being eaſily purified of their cuſtomes: the Chriſtian built vpon the verities and promiſes of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall; the Turkiſh vpon them both, retaining almoſt all the verities of Chriſt Ieſus, except the firſt and principall, which is his Diuinity: ſo that if a man will leape from Iudaiſme to Mahumatiſme, he muſt paſſe by Chriſtianity: and ſuch there haue beene among the Mahumatiſts as haue expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to torments, to maintaine the trueth of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a Chriſtian would do to maintaine the truth of the Old Teſtament. But yet the elder and more ancient doe wholly condemne the yonger, and holde them for capitall enemies.</p>
               <p>All religions haue this in them, that they are ſtrange and <note place="margin">6 <hi>All are ſtrange to nature.</hi>
                  </note> horrible to the common ſenſe; for they propoſe and are built and compoſed of parts, whereof ſome ſeeme to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man baſe, vnworthy and vnbefitting, wherewith the ſpirit of man ſomwhat ſtrong and vigorous, ieſteth and ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe; others too high, bright, wonderfull, and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, where he can know nothing, wherewith it is offended. Now the ſpirit of man is not capable but of indifferent things, it contemneth and diſdaineth the ſmall, it is aſtoniſhed and confounded with the great; and therefore it is no maruell if it be hardly perſwaded at the firſt onſet to receiue all religion, where there is nothing indifferent and common, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be drawen thereunto by ſome occaſion: for if it be ſtrong, it diſdaineth and laugheth at it; if it be feeble and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, it is aſtoniſhed and ſcandalized: <hi>praedicamus Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum crucifixum, Iudaeis ſcandalum, gentib us ſtultitiam.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16995:163"/>
it comes to paſſe, that there are ſo many miſ-beleeuers and irreligious perſons, becauſe they conſult and hearken too much to their owne iudgements, thinking to examine and iudge of the affaires of religion according to their owne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, and to handle it with their owne proper and naturall inſtruments. We muſt be ſimple, obedient, and debonaire, if we will be fit to receiue religion, to beleeue and liue vnder the law, by reuerence and obedience to ſubiect our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſuffer our ſelues to be led and conducted by publike authoritie, <hi>Captiuantes intellectum ad obſequium fidei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it was required ſo to proceed, otherwiſe religion ſhould not be reſpected and had in admiration as it ought; now it is neceſſarie that it be receiued and ſworne to, as well authenticallie and reuerentlie, as difficultlie: If it were ſuch as were whollie pleaſing to the palat and nature of man without ſtrangenes, it would be thought more eaſily, yet leſſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently receiued.</p>
               <p>Now the religions and beliefs being ſuch as hath been ſaid, ſtrange vnto the common ſenſe, very farre exceeding all the <note place="margin">7 Why they are not to be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means.</note> reach and vnderſtanding of man, they muſt not, nor cannot be gotten nor ſetled in vs by naturall and humane meanes (for then among ſo many great minds as there haue been rare and excellent, ſome had attained thereunto) but it muſt needs be, that they be giuen vs by extraordinarie and heauenlie reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, gotten and receiued by diuine inſpiration, and as ſent from heauen. In this maner likewiſe all do affirme, that they hold their religion and beleeue it, not from men, or any other creature, but from God.</p>
               <p>But to ſay the truth and not to flatter or diſguiſe, this is <note place="margin">8 <hi>And yet they are gotten by humane meanes.</hi>
                  </note> nothing; they are, whatſoeuer ſome ſay, held by humane hands and meanes, which is true in euery reſpect, in falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, being nothing but prayers, and humane or diabolicall inuentions: the true, as they haue another iuriſdiction, ſo are they both receiued and held by another hand; neuertheleſſe we muſt diſtinguiſh. As touching the receiuing of them, the firſt and generall publication and inſtallation of them hath beene <hi>domino cooperante, ſermonem confirmante ſequentes ſignis,</hi> diuine and wonderfull, the particular is done by humane hands and meanes; the nation, countrie, place, giues the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16995:163"/>
and that a man profeſſeth which is in force in that place and among thoſe perſons where he is borne, and where he liueth; He is circumciſed, baptiſed, a Iew, a Chriſtian, before he knowes that he is a man; for religion is not of our choyce or election, but man without his knowledge is made a Iew or a Chriſtian, becauſe he is borne in Iudaiſme or Chriſtianitie; and if he had been borne elſewhere among the Gentiles, or Mahumetans, he had beene likewiſe a Gentile or a Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. As touching the obſeruation, the true and good profeſſors thereof, beſides the outward profeſſion, which is common to all, yea to misbeleeuers, they attribute to the gift of God, the teſtimonie of the Holy Ghoſt within; but this is a thing not common nor ordinarie, what faire colour ſoeuer they giue it, witnes the liues and maners of men, ſo ill agreeing with their beleefe, who for humane occaſions and thoſe very light, goe againſt the tenor of their religion. If they were held &amp; planted with a diuine hand, nothing in the world could ſhake vs, ſuch a tye would not be ſo eaſily broken: If it had any touch or ray of diuinitie, it would appeare in all, it would produce won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effects that could not be hid, as Truth it ſelfe hath ſaid, If you haue but as much faith as a muſtard ſeed, you ſhould remoue mountaines. But what proportion or agreement is there betwixt the perſwaſion of the immortalitie of the ſoule, and a future reward ſo glorious and bleſſed, or ſo inglorious and accurſed, and the life that a man leadeth? The only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of thoſe things that a man ſaith he doth firmely beleeue, wil take his ſenſes from him: The only apprehenſion and feare to die by iuſtice, and in publike place, or by ſome other ſhamefull and diſhonorable action, hath made many to loſe their ſenſes, and caſt them into ſtrange trances: and what is that in reſpect of the worth of that which religion teacheth vs is to come? But is it poſſible in truth to beleeue, to hope for that immortalitie ſo happie, and yet to feare death a neceſſarie paſſage thereunto? to feare and apprehend that infernall puniſhment, and liue as we do? Theſe are things as incompatible as fire and water. They ſay they beleeue it, they make themſelues beleeue they beleeue it, and they will make others beleeue it too; but it is nothing, neither do they know what it is to beleeue. For a beleefe, I meane ſuch as
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16995:164"/>
the ſcripture calleth hiſtoricall, is diabolicall, dead, informed, vnprofitable, and which many times doth more hurt than good: Such beleeuers (ſaith an ancient Writer) are mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and impoſtors; and another ſaith, that they are in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the moſt fierce and glorious, in another the moſt looſe, diſſolute, and villanous of the world; more than men in the articles of their beleefe, and worſe than ſwine in their liues. Doubtleſſe if we hold our ſelues vnto God, and our religion, I ſay not by a diuine grace as we ſhould, but only after a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and common maner, as we beleeue a hiſtorie, or a friend or companion, wee ſhould place them farre aboue all other things for that infinite goodneſſe that ſhineth in them, at the leaſt they ſhould be put in the ſame ranke or degree with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, riches, friends. Now there are very few that doe not feare leſſe to commit an offence againſt God, and any point of his religion, than againſt his father, his maſter, his friend, his equalls. All this hurteth not the dignitie, puritie, and height of Chriſtianitie, no more than the dunghill infecteth the beames of the Sunne, which ſhines vpon it; for as one ſaith, <hi>Fides non à perſonis, ſed contrà:</hi> But a man cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſo great a <hi>Vae</hi> againſt thoſe falſe hypocrites, whom <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> Verity it ſelfe ſo much condemneth, as they belch out of their owne mouthes againſt themſelues.</p>
               <p>The better to know true pietie, it is neceſſarie firſt to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it from the falſe, fained and counterfeite, to the end wee <note place="margin">9 <hi>A diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the true and falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </note> may not equiuocate as the moſt part of the world doth. There is nothing that maketh a fairer ſhew, and that taketh greater paines to reſemble true pietie and religion, and yet that is more contrarie and enemie thereunto, than ſuperſtition: like the Woulfe, which doth not a little reſemble the dogge, but yet hath a ſpirit and humour quite contrarie: and the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer who counterfetteth a zealous friend, and is nothing leſſe; or like falſe coine which maketh a more glittering ſhew than the true. <hi>Gens ſuperſtitioni obnoxia, religionibus aduerſae.</hi> It is likewiſe enuious and iealous like an amorous adultereſſe, <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> who with her ſmooth ſpeeches makes ſhew of greater affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and care of the husband, than the true and lawfull wife, whom ſhe endeuoureth to make odious vnto him. Now the notable differences of theſe two are, that religion loueth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16995:164"/>
and honoureth God, ſetleth a man in peace and reſt, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in a liberall, free and generous ſoule: Superſtition trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth a man, and makes him wild, and iniureth God himſelfe, teaching to feare with horror and aſtoniſhment, to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to flie from him, if it were poſſible; it is a weake, poore, and baſe malady of the ſoule; <hi>Superſtitio error inſanus,</hi>

               <p>A ſuperſtitious man ſuffereth neither God nor man to liue <note place="margin">10 <hi>Superſtition deſcribed.</hi>
                  </note> in peace. Hee apprehendeth God as one anxious, ſpitefull, hardly contented, eaſily moued, with difficulty appeaſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining our actions after the humane faſhion of a ſeuere Iudge, that watcheth our ſteps; which he prooueth true by his maner of ſeruing him, which is all after one faſhion. He trembleth for feare, he is neuer ſecure, fearing hee neuer doth well enough, and that he hath left ſomething vndone, by the omiſſion whereof all is worth nothing that he hath done; hee doubteth whether God be well content, and laboureth to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, to the end he may appeaſe and winne him; he impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuneth him with praiers, vowes, offerings; he faineth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe miracles, eaſily beleeueth and receiueth ſuch as are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfetted by others, and interpreteth all things though purely naturall, as expreſlie ſent and done by God; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after whatſoeuer a man ſaith with all the care that may be, <hi>duo ſuperſtitionis propria, nimius timor, nimius cultus.</hi> What is all this but by puniſhing himſelfe, vilely, baſely, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily to deale with God, and more mechanicallie, than a man would doe with a man of honour? Generally al ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fault in religion, proceedeth from this, that wee make not that account of God that we ſhould, we reuoke him, and compell him into order, wee iudge of him according to our ſelues, we put vpon him our humours. O what blaſphemie is this!</p>
               <p>Now this vice and malady is almoſt naturall vnto vs, and <note place="margin">11 <hi>It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi>
                  </note> we haue all a kind of inclination thereunto. <hi>Plutarch</hi> deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the infirmity of man, who neuer knoweth how to keepe a meaſure, or to ſettle himſelfe vpon his feet: for it leaneth and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:16995:165"/>
degenerateth either into ſuperſtition and vanitie, or into a contempt and careleſneſſe of diuine things. We are like to an ill aduiſed husband, beſotted and couſened with the coyning ſubtilties of a light woman, with whom he conuerſeth more by reaſon of hir artificiall flatteries, than with his honeſt ſpouſe, who honoreth and ſerueth him with a ſimple and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſhamefaſtnes: and euen ſo ſuperſtition pleaſeth vs more than true religion.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe vulgar, it proceedeth from a weakneſſe of the ſoule, an ignorance or miſ-knowledge of God, and that very <note place="margin">12 <hi>Popular.</hi>
                  </note> groſſe, and therefore it is moſt commonly found in children, women, old men, ſick and ſuch as haue been aſſaulted with ſome violent accident. To be briefe, it is in barbarous natures, <hi>Inclinant natura ad ſuperstitionem barbari.</hi> Of this then it is <note place="margin">Plutarch. in ſectorio.</note> ſaid, and not of true religion, that it is true that <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth, that the weakneſſe and idleneſſe of men hath brought in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and made it preuaile, whereby children, women, and old men ſhould be moſt capable of religion, more ſcrupulous and deuout: this were to wrong true religion to giue it ſo poore and fraile a foundation.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe ſeeds and naturall inclinations to ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are many that ſhake hands with it, and fauour it <note place="margin">13 <hi>Nouriſhed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by humane reaſon.</hi>

               <p>Now quitting our ſelues of this foule and baſe ſuperſtition (which I would haue him to abhorre, whom I deſire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct <note place="margin">14 <hi>An entrance to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of true religion.</hi>
                  </note> vnto wiſdome) let vs learne to guide our ſelues to true religion and pietie, whereof I will giue ſome grounds and pourtraites as leſſer lights thereunto. But before we enter thereinto, let me heere ſay in generall, and by way of preface, that of ſo many diuers religions, and maners of ſeruing God, which are, or may be in the world, they ſeeme to be the moſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16995:165"/>
noble, and to haue greateſt appearance of truth, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great externall and corporall ſeruice, draw the ſoule into itſelfe, and raiſe it by pure contemplation to admire and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the greatneſſe and infinite maieſtie of the firſt cauſe of all things, and the eſſence of eſſences, without any great declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or determination thereof, or preſcription of his ſeruice; but acknowledging it indefinitly, to be goodnes, perfection, and infinitnes, whollie incomprehenſible &amp; not to be known, as the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and moſt famous Philoſophers do teach. This is to approch vnto the religion of the angels, and to put in practiſe that word of the ſonne of God, to adore in ſpirit and truth, for God accounteth ſuch worſhippers the beſt. There are others on the other ſide, and in another extremitie, who will haue a viſible Deitie, capable by the ſenſes, which baſe and groſſe error hath mocked almoſt all the world, euen Iſrael in the deſert, in framing to themſelues a molten calfe. And of theſe they that haue choſen the ſunne for their god, ſeeme to haue more reaſon than the reſt, becauſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, beautie, and reſplendent and vnknowne vertue thereof, euen ſuch as enforce the whole world to the admiration and reuerence of itſelfe. The eye ſeeth nothing that is like vnto it, or that approcheth neere vnto it in the whole vniuerſe, it is one ſunne, and without companion. Chriſtianitie, as in the middle, tempereth the ſenſible and outward with the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inward, ſeruing God with ſpirit and body, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating itſelfe to great and little, whereby it is better eſtabliſhed, and more durable. But euen in that too, as there is a diuerſitie, and degrees of ſoules, of ſufficiencie and capacitie of diuine grace; ſo is there a difference in the maner of ſeruing of God; the more high &amp; perfect incline more to the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more ſpirituall and contemplatiue, and leſſe externall, the leſſe and imperfect <hi>quaſi ſub paedagogo</hi> remaine in the other, and do participate of the outward and vulgar deformities.</p>
               <p>Religion conſiſteth in the knowledge of God, and of our ſelues: (for it is a relatiue action betweene both) the office <note place="margin">15 <hi>Diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of religion.</hi>
                  </note> thereof is to extoll God to the vttermoſt of our power, and to beate downe man as low as low may be, as if he were vtterly loſt, and afterwards to furniſh himſelfe with meanes to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to make him feele his miſery &amp; his nothing, to the end
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16995:166"/>
he may put his whole confidence in God alone.</p>
               <p>The office of religion is to ioyne vs to the author and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> cauſe of all our good, to reunite, and faſten man to his firſt cauſe, as to his roote, wherein ſo long as he continueth firme and ſetled, he preſerueth himſelfe in his owne perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and contrariwiſe when he is ſeparated, he inſtantly fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and languiſheth.</p>
               <p>The end and effect of religion is faithfullie to yeeld all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> honor and glorie vnto God, and all the benefit vnto man. All good things may be reduced to theſe two; The profit, which is an amendment, and an eſſentiall and inward good, is due vnto poore, wretched, and in all points miſerable man: the glory, which is an outward ornament, is due vnto God alone, who is the perfection and fulnes of all good, whereunto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added, <hi>Gloria in excelſis Deo, &amp; in terra pax ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much being firſt knowen, our inſtruction to pietie is <note place="margin">

To be briefe, we muſt thinke, ſpeake, and deale with God, as if all the world did behold vs; we muſt liue and conuerſe with the world, as if God ſaw vs.</p>

Touching the particularities as well of the beleefe as obſeruation, it is neceſſarie that we tye our ſelues to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as to the true, more rich, high, and honorable to God, commodious and comfortable to man, as we haue ſhewed in our ſecond Veritie; and therein remaining, we muſt with a ſweet ſubmiſſion ſubmit and ſettle our ſelues to that which the Catholike Church in all times hath vniuerſally held, and holdeth, and not intangling our ſelues with nouelties, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and particular opinions, for the reaſons ſet downe in my third Veritie, and eſpeciallie in the firſt &amp; laſt Chapters, which may ſuffice vnto him, that cannot, or will not reade the whole booke.</p>

                  </note> honeſtie, whereof we haue ſpoken before, and ſo content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with one of them, much leſſe to confound and mingle them together. Theſe are two things very different, &amp; which haue diuers iuriſdictions, pietie and probitie, religion and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, deuotion and conſcience; I will that both of them be iointly in him whom I heere inſtruct, becauſe the one cannot be without the other entire and perfect, but confuſed. Behold heere two rocks whereof we muſt take heed, and few there be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16995:167"/>
that know them, to ſeparate them and to reſt contented with the one, to confound and mingle them, in ſuch ſort, that the one be the iuriſdiction of the other.</p>
               <p>The firſt that ſeparate them, and that haue but one of them, <note place="margin">26 <hi>Of thoſe which haue piety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out probitie.</hi>
                  </note> are of two ſorts, for ſome doe wholly giue themſelues to the worſhip and ſeruice of God, taking no care at all of true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honeſtie, whereof they haue no taſte, a vice noted as naturall to the Iewes eſpeciallie (a race aboue all others ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and for that cauſe odious to all) and much diſplayed by their prophets, and afterwards by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them, that of their temple they had made a denne of theeues, a cloake and excuſe for many wickedneſſes, which <note place="margin">Matth. 15. and 22.</note> they perceiued not; ſo were they beſotted with this outward deuotion, wherein putting their whole confidence, they thought themſelues diſcharged of all dutie, yea they were made more hardie to do any wickedneſſe. Many are touched with this feminine and popular ſpirit, wholly attentiue to thoſe ſmall exerciſes of outward deuotion, whereby they are made neuer the better; from whence came that prouerb, <hi>An angell in the Church, a diuell in the houſe;</hi> they lend the ſhew and outward part vnto God, like the Phariſes, they are ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, white walles, <hi>populus hic labijs me honor at, cor eorum lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge à me;</hi> yea they make pietie a couer for impietie, they make it (as they ſay) an occupation or a merchandize, and alleadge their offices of deuotion, to extenuate and recompence their ſinne and iniquitie. Others quite contrary make no account but of vertue and honeſtie, little caring for any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to religion, a fault of many Philoſophers, and which is likewiſe too common amongſt our Atheiſts. Theſe are two vitious extremities, but which is the more or the leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, <note place="margin">27 <hi>A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
                  </note> or which of the two is the more worthie, religion, or honeſtie, it is not my purpoſe to determin; I will only ſay (to compare them in three points) that the firſt is far more eaſie, of greater ſhew, of ſimple and vulgar ſpirits: the ſecond is far more difficult and laborious in the performance, of leſſe ſhew, of ſpirits valiant and generous. <note place="margin">28 <hi>Againſt thoſe that confound pietie and probitis.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>I come to others, who differ not much from the firſt, who take no care but of religion. They peruert all order, and trouble all, confounding honeſtie, religion, the grace of God
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16995:168"/>
(as hath beene ſaid before) whereby it comes to paſſe that they haue neither true honeſtie, nor true religion, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the grace of God; as they thinke, a people only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with themſelues, and ready to cenſure and condemn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>qui confidunt in ſe, &amp; aſperndnt abios.</hi> They thinke that religion is a generalitie of all good and of all vertue, that all vertues are contained in it, and neceſſarily follow it, whereby they acknowledge no other vertue nor honeſtie but that which is opened with the key of religion. Now it is quite contrarie; for religion which is the later, is a ſpeciall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vertue, diſtinguiſhed from all other vertues, which may be without them and without probitie, as hath beene ſaid of the Phariſies, religious and wicked; and they without religion, as in many Philoſophers good and vertuous, but yet irreligious. It is likewiſe, as all diuinitie teacheth, a morall humane vertue, appertaining to iuſtice, one of the foure car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall vertues, which teacheth vs in generall to giue vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thom. p.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 81.</note> one that which belongeth vnto him, reſeruing to euery one his place. Now God being aboue all, the vniuerſall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and maſter; wee muſt giue vnto him all ſouereigne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſeruice, obedience, and this ſubalcerne religion, and the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of iuſtice, which is the generall <hi>Theſis,</hi> more ancient and naturall. They on the other ſide, will that a man be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious before he be honeſt, and that religion (which is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and gotten by an outward cauſe, <hi>ex auditu; Quomodo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſine praedicante?)</hi> engendreth honeſtie, which we haue ſhewed ſhould proceed from nature, from that law and light which God hath put into vs, from our firſt beginning. This is an inuerted order. Theſe men will that a man be an honeſt man, becauſe there is a Paradiſe and a hell: ſo that if they did not feare God, or feare to be damned (for that is often their language) they would make a goodly peece of worke. O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable honeſtie! What thankes deſerueſt thou, for that thou doeſt? ô cowardly and idle innocencie, <hi>quae niſi metu non pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet!</hi> Thou keepeſt thy ſelfe from wickedneſſe, becauſe thou dareſt not be wicked, and thou feareſt to be beaten, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen therein art thou wicked, <hi>Oderunt peccare mali formidine poenae.</hi> Now I will that thou dare, but yet that thou wilt not though thou be neuer chidden; I will that thou be an honeſt
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16995:168"/>
man, not becauſe thou wouldeſt goe to paradiſe, but becauſe nature, reaſon, God willeth it, becauſe the law and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall policy of the world, whereof thou art a part, requireth it; ſo as that thou canſt not conſent to be any other, except thou goe againſt thy ſelfe, thy eſſence, thy end. Doubtleſſe ſuch honeſtie occaſioned by the ſpirit of religion, beſides that it is not true and eſſentiall, but accidentall, it is likewiſe very dangerous, producing many times very baſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous effects (as experience in all times hath taught vs) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the faire and glorious pretext of piety. What execrable wickedneſſes hath the zeale of religion brought foorth? Is there any other ſubiect or occaſion that hath yeelded the like?

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>To gouerne his deſires and pleaſures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is a principall dutie of a wiſe man, to know well how to moderate and rule his deſires and pleaſures; for wholly to renounce them, I am ſo farre from requiring it in this my wiſe man, that I hold this opinion to be not only fantaſticall, but vitious and vnnaturall. Firſt then we muſt confute this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which baniſheth and whollie condemneth all pleaſures, and afterwards learne how to gouerne them.</p>
               <p>It is a plauſible opinion, and ſtudied by thoſe that would ſeeme to be men of vnderſtanding, and profeſſors of ſingular <note place="margin">1 <hi>The firſt part.</hi>
                  </note> ſanctitie, generally to contemne and tread vnder-foote all ſorts of pleaſures, and all care of the bodie, retiring the ſpirit vnto it ſelfe, not hauing any commerce with the bodie, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuating <note place="margin">An opinion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world.</note> it ſelfe to high things, and ſo to paſſe this life as it were inſenſiblie neither taſting it, nor attending it. With theſe kind of people that ordinarie phraſe of paſſing the time, doth very well agree; for it ſeemeth to them, that well to vſe and employ this life, is ſilently to paſſe it ouer, and as it were to eſcape it, and rob themſelues of it, as if it were a miſerable, burthenſome, and tedious thing, being deſirous ſo to ſlide through the world, as that not only recreations and paſtimes are ſuſpected, yea odious vnto them, but alſo naturall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which God hath ſeaſoned with ſome pleaſure. They come not where any delight is, but vnwillinglie, and being where it is, they hold their breath till they be gone, as if they were in a place of infection: and to be briefe, their life is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:16995:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto them, and death a ſolace, pleaſing themſelues with that ſaying, which may be as well ill taken and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as well, <hi>vitam habere in patientia, mortem in deſiderio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the iniquitie of this opinion, may many wayes be ſhewed. Firſt, there is nothing ſo faire and lawfull, as well and <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reiected.</hi>
                  </note> duly to play the man, well to know how to leade this life. It is a diuine knowledge &amp; very difficult, for a man to know how he ſhould lawfully enioy his owne eſſence, leade his life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common and naturall modell, to his proper conditions, not ſeeking thoſe that are ſtrange; for all thoſe extrauagancies, all thoſe artificiall and ſtudied endeuors, thoſe wandring wayes from the naturall and common, proceede from follie and paſſion: theſe are maladies, without which whileſt theſe men would liue, not by playing the men, but the diuines, they play the fooles; they would transforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into angels, and they turne themſelues into beaſts: <hi>aut deus aut bestia: homo ſum, humani à me nihil alienum puto:</hi> Man is a bodie and a ſoule, and it is not well done to diſmember this building, to diuide and ſeparate this brotherlie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall coniunction; but contrariwiſe, we ſhould renue it by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall offices, the ſpirit muſt awaken and reuiue the heauie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the bodie muſt ſtay the lightnes of the ſpirit, which many times prooues but a trouble-feaſt; the ſpirit muſt aſſiſt and fauor the bodie, as the husband the wife, and not reiect it, not hate it. It muſt not refuſe to participate the naturall pleaſures thereof, which are iuſt, and ſuch as befit that mariage that is betwixt them, alwaies holding therein, as the more wiſe, a true moderation. A man muſt ſtudie, know, and meditate on this life, to the end he may returne condigne thanks vnto him who hath lent it. There is nothing which God hath made for vs in this preſent life vnworthie our care, and we are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for them, euen to the very haires of our head; for it is no friuolous warrant or commiſſion for a man to direct himſelfe and his life according to his naturall condition, but God hath giuen it him ſeriouſly and expreſly.</p>
               <p>But what greater follie is there, and more againſt nature, than to account our actions vitious, becauſe they are naturall <note place="margin">3 Lib. 3. cap. 38.</note>; vnworthie becauſe they are neceſſarie? Now this neceſſitie and pleaſure is an excellent mariage made by God himſelfe.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:16995:170"/>
Nature willeth very wiſely, that thoſe actions which it hath enioyned vs for our neceſſitie, be alſo delightfull, inuiting vs thereunto not only by reaſon, but alſo by appetite; and theſe rules theſe kind of men goe about to breake. It is an equall fault and iniuſtice, to loath and condemne all pleaſures, and to abuſe them, by louing them ouer-much, we muſt neither run to them, nor flre from them, but receiue them, and vſe them diſcreetly and moderatly, as ſhall preſently be ſaid in the rule. Temperance which is the rule of our pleaſures, condemneth as well the inſenſibilitie and priuation of all pleaſure, <hi>ſtuporem naturae,</hi> which is the failing extremitie, as intemperancie, <hi>libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem,</hi> which is the exceeding extremitie. <hi>Contra naturam eſt torquere corpus ſuum, faciles odiſſe munditias &amp; ſquallorem appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere: delicat as res cupere luxuriae eſt, vſitatas &amp; non magno para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles fugere dementiae eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that deſireth to diſcard his ſoule, let him boldly do it if he can, when his bodie is not in health, but endureth ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> torment, to the end he may disburthen himſelfe of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion: but he cannot do it, as likewiſe he ought not to do it; for to ſpeake according to right and reaſon, it ſhould neuer abandon the bodie; it is apiſhnes to do it, it ſhould behold pleaſure and ſorrow with a like ſetled countenance, in the one line ſeuerely, the other cheerefully: but in all caſes it ſhould aſſiſt the bodie to maintaine it alwaies in order.</p>
               <p>To contemne the world, is a braue propoſition, and many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> delight, nay glory to ſpeake, to diſcourſe thereof, but I can not perceiue that they well vnderſtand it, much leſſe that they practiſe it: what is it to contemne the world? What is this world? Is it the heauen, the earth, and in a word the creatures that are therein? No I thinke not ſo; What then? Is it the vſe, the profit, the ſeruice, and commoditie that we gather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? If ſo, what ingratitude is this againſt the authour that hath made them to theſe ends? What accuſation againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What reaſon to contemne them? If (in the end) thou wilt ſay that it is neither the one, nor the other, but it is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of them, the vanities, follies, exceſſe and wickednes that is in the world; I may anſwere that it were well ſaid, if this were of the world, but they are not ſo, but againſt the world, and the policie thereof, they are thy owne additions, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:16995:170"/>
but artificiall. To preſerue thy ſelfe from them as wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the rule following teacheth, is not to contemne the world, which remaineth whollie entire without it; but it is wel to vſe the world, well to gouerne thy ſelfe in the world, and as diuinitie teacheth, to make vſe and benefit of the world, and not to enioy it, <hi>vti, non frui.</hi> Now theſe kind of people thinke to practiſe the contempt of the world, by certaine outward particular maners and faſhions, ſeparated from the common courſe of the world: but this is but mockerie. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world ſo exquiſite; the world laugheth not, and is not ſo wanton within it ſelfe, as without, in thoſe places where men make profeſſion of flying it, and trampling it vnder foot, which is ſpoken againſt hypocrites, who haue ſo much dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from their beginning, that there remaineth nothing but the habit, and is alſo very much changed, if not in forme, at the leaſt in matter, which ſerueth them for no other vſe, than to puffe them vp, to make them more bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which is quite contrarie to their inſtitution, <hi>vae vobis qui circuit is mare &amp; aridam, vt faciatis vnum proſelytum, &amp; cùm fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus</hi>

                  <hi>fuerit, facitis filium gehennae:</hi> and not againſt the good, much leſſe againſt the eſtate in it ſelfe which is the ſchoole of true and holy Philoſophie. It is then a fantaſticall and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall opinion, generally to reiect and condemne all deſires and pleaſures. God is the creator and authour of pleaſure, <hi>Plantauit dominus paradiſum voluptatis, poſuit hominem in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſo voluptatis, protulit omne lignum pulchrum, ſuaue, delectabile,</hi> as ſhal be ſaid. But we muſt firſt learne how to cary our ſelues therein.</p>
               <p>This inſtruction may be reduced to foure points (which if <note place="margin">6 <hi>The ſecond part the rule in our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and deſires.</hi>
                  </note> theſe mortified men, and great contemners of the world did know how to put in practiſe, they would worke wonders) to know little, naturally, moderately, and by a ſhort relation to himſelfe. Theſe foure go almoſt alwayes together, and make an entire and perfect rule, and he that will may gather and comprehend all theſe foure in this word, Naturally, for nature is the fundamentall and ſufficient rule for all. But yet to make the matter more cleare and eaſie, we will diſtinguiſh theſe foure points. The firſt point of this rule, is to deſire little: A <note place="margin">Little.</note> ſhort good, but an aſſured meanes to braue fortune, taking
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16995:171"/>
from it all accidents, and all power ouer vs to hinder the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie content of our life: and in a word, to be wiſe, is to ſhorten our deſires, to deſire either little, or nothing at all. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth nothing, although he haue nothing, is as rich as he that poſſeſſeth the whole world, for both come to one end: <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil intereſt an habeas, an non concupiſcas:</hi> and therefore it was well ſayd, That it is not multitude and abundance that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth and inricheth, but want, yea nothing. It is the want of deſire, for he that is poore in deſires is rich in contentment, <hi>ſummae opes inopia cupiditatum.</hi> To be briefe, he that deſireth nothing is in ſome ſort like vnto God, and thoſe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie bleſſed, who are happy and bleſſed, not becauſe they haue and poſſeſſe all, but becauſe they deſire nothing: <hi>qui deſiderium ſuum clauſit, cum Ioue de foelicitate contendit.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, if we let looſe the bridle to our appetite to follow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and delicacie, we ſhall continue in perpetuall paine and labour; ſuperfluous things will become neceſſarie, our ſoules will be made ſlaues to our bodies, and we can liue no longer, than that we liue in pleaſure and delight. If we mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate not our pleaſures and deſires, and meaſure them not by the compaſſe of reaſon, opinion will carie vs into a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long downfall, where there is neither bottome nor brinke: as for example, we will make our ſhooes of veluet, afterwards of cloth of golde, and laſtly of embroderie with pearles and diamonds; we will build our houſes of marble, afterwards of iaſper and porpherie. Now this meane for a man to inrich himſelfe, and to make him content, is very iuſt, and in the power of euery man: he need not to ſeeke this contentment elſewhere and without himſelfe, let him but aske it, and he preſently obteineth it of himſelfe. Let him ſtay the courſe of his deſires; it is iniuſtice to importune God, Nature, the world by vowes and prayers, to giue him any thing, ſince he hath ſo excellent a meane in his owne power to attaine thereunto. Why ſhould I rather deſire another to giue vnto me, than my ſelfe not to deſire? <hi>Quare potius a fortuna impetrem vt det, quàm a me ne petam? quare autem petam oblitus fragilitatis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae?</hi> If I can not or will not obteine of my ſelfe not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, how and with what face can I preſſe another to giue, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whom I haue no right nor power? The firſt rule then
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:16995:171"/>
touching our deſires and pleaſures is, that this (little) or at leaſt a mediocritie and ſufficiencie is that which doth beſt content a wiſe man and keepes him in peace. And this is the reaſon why I haue choſen for my deuice, <hi>Peace and pouertie.</hi> With a foole nothing ſufficeth, nothing hath certeintie or content: hee is like the Moone, who asked a garment that <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> might fit it; but it was anſwered, That that was not poſſible, becauſe it was ſometimes great, ſometimes little, and alwaies changeable.</p>
               <p>The other point couſen-germane to this, is (naturally): for <note place="margin">7 <hi>Naturally.</hi>
                  </note> we know that there are two ſorts of deſires and pleaſures, the one naturall, and theſe are iuſt and lawfull, and are likewiſe in beaſts limited and ſhort, whoſe end a man may ſee: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe, no man is indigent, for euery thing yeelds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to content. Nature is contented with little, and hath ſo prouided, that in all things, that which ſufficeth is at hand and in our owne power, <hi>parabile est quod natura deſiderat &amp;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                  <hi>expoſitum: ad manum est quod ſat est.</hi> It is this which nature demandeth for the preſeruation of it owne eſſence, it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour for which we are to thanke Nature, that thoſe things that are neceſſarie for this life, it hath made eaſie to finde, and ſuch as are hardly obteined are not ſo neceſſarie; and that ſeeking without paſſion that which nature deſireth, fortune can no way depriue vs of it. To theſe kinde of deſires a man may adde (though they be not truly naturall, yet they come very neere) thoſe that reſpect the vſe and condition of euery one of vs, which are ſomewhat beyond, and more at large than thoſe that are exactly naturall, and ſo are iuſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the ſecond place. The other deſires are beyond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, proceeding from an opinion and fantaſie, artificiall, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, and truly paſſions, which we may to diſtinguiſh them by name from others, call cupidities or luſts, whereof we haue ſpoken before at large in the paſſions: from which a wiſe man muſt wholly and abſolutely defend himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The third, which is moderately and without exceſſe, hath <note place="margin">8 <hi>Moderately. See lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 38.</note> a large field and diuers parts, but which may be drawen to two heads; that is to ſay, to deſire without the hurt of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of himſelfe; of another without his ſcandall, offence, loſſe, preiudice; of himſelfe, without the loſſe of his health,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:16995:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his leaſure, his functions and affaires, his honour, his duty.</p>
               <p>The fourth is a ſhort and eſſentiall relation to himſelfe; <note place="margin">9 <hi>By relation.</hi>
                  </note> beſides that the carriere of our deſires and pleaſures muſt be circumſcribed, limited, and ſhort, their courſe likewiſe muſt be managed, not in a right line, which makes an end elſwhere and without it ſelfe; but in a circle, the two points whereof doe meet and end in our ſelues. Thoſe actions that are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without this reflexion, and this ſhort and eſſentiall tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as of couetous and ambitious men, and diuers others, who runne point blanke, and are alwayes without them, are vaine and vnſound.</p>

               <p>Againſt all proſperitie, the common doctrine and counſell conſiſteth in three points: The firſt, that honors, riches, and <note place="margin">5 Of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> the fauours of fortune, are ill and wrongfullie accounted and called goods, ſince they neither make a man good, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme a wicked man, and are common both to good and wicked. He that calleth them goods, and in them hath placed the good of man, hath faſtned our felicitie to a rotten cable, and ancred it in the quick-ſands. For what is there more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and inconſtant, than the poſſeſſion of ſuch goods, which come and goe, paſſe and runne on like a riuer? like a riuer they make a noyſe at their comming in, they are full of violence, they are troubled; their entrance is full of vexation, and they vaniſh in a moment; and when they are quite dried vp, there remaineth nothing in the bottome but the mud.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point is to remember, that proſperitie is like a honnied poiſon, ſweet and pleaſant, but dangerous, whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> we muſt take very good heed. When fortune laugheth, and euery thing falleth out according to our owne hearts, then ſhould we feare moſt, and ſtand vpon our gard, bridle our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, compoſe our actions by reaſon, aboue all auoid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, which ordinarily followeth the fauour of the time. Proſperitie is a ſlipperie paſe, wherein a man muſt take ſure
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:16995:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
footing, for there is no time wherein men doe more forget God. It is a rare and difficult thing to find a man who doth willinglie attribute vnto him the cauſe of his felicitie. And this is the cauſe why in the greateſt proſperitie we muſt vſe the counſell of our friends, and giue them more authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, than at other times; and therefore we muſt cary our ſelues as in an euill and dangerous way, go with feare and doubt, deſiring the hand and help of another. In theſe times of proſperitie, aduerſitie is a medicine, becauſe it leadeth vs to the knowledge of our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The third is to retaine our deſires, and to ſet a meaſure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Proſperitie puffeth vp the heart, ſpurreth vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> findeth nothing difficult, breedeth alwayes a deſire of great matters (as they that by eating get an appetite) and it carieth vs beyond our ſelues, and in this ſtate it is where a man loſeth himſelfe, drowneth &amp; maketh a mockery of himſelfe. He playeth the Monkey, who leapeth from bough to bough, till he come to the top of the tree, and then ſheweth his taile. O how many haue been loſt, and haue periſhed miſerablie, by the want of diſcretion to moderate themſelues in their proſperitie! We muſt therefore either ſtay our ſelues, or go forward with a ſlower paſe, if we will inioy the benefit of our proſperitie, and not hold our ſelues alwaies in chaſe and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. It is wiſdome to know how to ſettle our owne reſt, our owne contentment, which cannot be where there is no ſtay, no end. <hi>Si qua finiri non poſſunt, extra ſapientiam ſunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt all aduerſitie, theſe are the generall aduiſements. In the firſt place, we muſt take heed of the common and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <note place="margin">8 <hi>Of aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that it is no euill.</hi>
                  </note> opinion, erroneous and alwaies different from true reaſon, for to diſcredit and to bring into hatred and horror all aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and afflictions, they call them euils, diſaſters, miſchiefs, although all outward things be neither good nor euill. Neuer did aduerſitie make a man wicked, but hath rather ſerued as a meanes to mend thoſe that are wicked, and are common both to the good and to the wicked.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe, croſſes and heauie accidents are common to all, but they worke diuers effects, according to that ſubiect <note place="margin">9 <hi>It is common to all, but diuerſly.</hi>
                  </note> whereupon they light. To fooles and reprobate perſons they ſerue to driue them into deſpaire, to afflict and enrage them:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16995:174"/>
Perhaps they enforce them (if they be heauie &amp; extreame) to ſtoope, to crie vnto God, to looke vp vnto Heauen; but that is all: To ſinners and offenders they are ſo many liuely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and compulſions to put them in minde of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to bring them to the knowledge of God: To vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, they are the liſts and theaters wherein to exerciſe their vertue, to winne vnto themſelues greater commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and a neerer alliance with God: To wiſe men they are matter of good, and ſometimes ſtages and degrees whereby to paſſe and mount vp to all height and greatneſſe, as wee ſee and may read of diuers, who being aſſailed by ſuch and ſo great croſſes, as a man would haue thought them their vtter ouerthrow and vndoing, haue beene raiſed by the ſelfeſame meanes to the higheſt pitch of their owne deſires, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe without that infelicitie, had ſtill remained vnder hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as that great <hi>Athenian</hi> Captaine knew well when hee ſaid, <hi>perier amus niſi perijſſemus.</hi> A very excellent example heere of was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iacob.</hi> It is true that theſe are blowes from heauen, but the vertue and wiſedome of man ſerueth as a proper inſtrument, from whence came that wiſe ſaying of the Sages, <hi>To make of neceſſitie a vertue.</hi> It is a very good husbandrie, and the firſt propertie of a wiſe man, to draw good from euill, to handle his affaires with ſuch dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and ſo to winne the winde, and to ſet the bias, that of that which is ill, he may make good vſe, and better his owne condition.</p>
               <p>Afflictions and aduerſities proceede from three cauſes, <note place="margin">10 <hi>It hath three cauſes and three effects.</hi>
                  </note> which are the three authors &amp; workers of our puniſhments; ſinne the firſt inuentor which hath brought them into nature; the anger and iuſtice of God, which ſetteth them aworke as his Commiſſaries and executioners; the policie of the world troubled and changed by ſinne, wherein as a generall reuolt, and cruill tumult, things not being in their due places, and not doing their office, all euils do ſpring and ariſe; as in a body the diſiointing of the members, the diſlocation of the bones bringeth great paine, and much vnquietneſſe. Theſe three are not fauourable vnto vs, the firſt is to be hated of all as our enemie, the ſecond to be feared as terrible, the third to be auoided as an impoſture. That a man may the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16995:174"/>
and quit himſelfe from all three, there is no better way than to vſe their owne proper armes, wherewith they puniſh vs, as <hi>Dauid</hi> cut off <hi>Goliahs</hi> head with his owne ſword, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of neceſſity a vertue, profit of paine and affliction, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them againſt themſelues. Affliction is the true fruit or ſcience of ſinne, being well taken is the death and ruine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and it doth that to the author therof, which the viper doth to his damme that brought him foorth. It is the oile of the Scorpion, which healeth his owne ſting, to the end it may periſh by it owne inuention: <hi>perijt arte ſua: patimur quia pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauimus: patimur vt non peccemus.</hi> It is the file of the ſoule, which ſcoureth, purifieth and clenſeth it from all ſinne. And conſequently it appeaſeth the anger of God, and freeth vs from the priſons and bands of Iuſtice, to bring vs into the faire and cleare ſun-ſhine of grace and mercy. Finally, it weaneth vs from the world, it plucketh vs from the dug, and maketh vs diſtaſte with the bitterneſſe thereof, like wormwood vpon the teat of the nurſe, the ſweet milke and food of this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world.</p>
               <p>A great and principall meane for a man to carrie himſelfe well in aduerſitie, is to be an honeſt man. A vertuous man <note place="margin">11 <hi>A generall aduice.</hi>
                  </note> is more peaceable in aduerſitie, than a vitious in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: like thoſe that haue a feuer, who feele and find more harme and violence in the heat and cold thereof, and in the extreamitie of their fittes, than ſuch as are ſound in the heat and cold of Summer and Winter. And euen ſo they that haue their conſciences ſicke, are much more tormented, than they that are ſound, that are honeſt men. For hauing the inward part whole and healthfull, they can no way bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged by the outward, eſpecially oppoſing againſt it a good courage.</p>
               <p>Aduerſities are of two ſorts: ſome are true and naturall, as <note place="margin">12 <hi>An aduice more ſpeciall.</hi>
                  </note> ſickneſſe, griefes, loſſe of thoſe things we loue: others are falſe and fained, either by a common or particular opinion, and not in veritie. That it is ſo, man hath his ſpirit and body as much at command, as before they hapned. To theſe kind of men, only this one word; That which thou complaineſt of, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther painfull nor troubleſome, but thou makeſt it ſuch, and makeſt thy ſelfe to beleeue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:16995:175"/>
As touching the true and naturall, the more prompt and popular and more ſound opinions are the more naturall and <note place="margin">13 <hi>Naturall.</hi>
                  </note> more iuſt. Firſt we muſt remember, that a man indureth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the humane and naturall law, ſince euen at the <note place="margin">To endure is naturall and humane.</note> birth of man all theſe things are annexed, and giuen as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie. In whatſoeuer doth afflict vs, let vs conſider two things, the nature of that that hapneth vnto vs, and that which is in our ſelues: and vſing things according to nature, we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no tediouſneſſe or offence thereby. For offence is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie of the ſoule contrarie to nature, and therefore ſhould by no meanes come neere vnto vs. There is not any accident in the world which may happen vnto vs, wherein nature hath not prepared an aptneſſe in vs to receiue it, and to turne it to our contentment. There is no maner of life ſo ſtrait that hath not ſome ſolace and recreation. There is no priſon ſo ſtrong and darke that giues not place to a ſong ſometimes to comfort a priſoner. <hi>Ionas</hi> had leaſure to make his prayers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God euen in the bellie of the Whale, and was heard. It is a fauor of nature that it findeth a remedie and eaſe vnto our euils in the bearing of them, it being ſo that man is borne to be ſubiect to all ſorts of miſeries, <hi>omnia ad quae gemimus, quae expaueſcimus tributa vitaeſunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt remember, that there is only the leſſer part of man ſubiect to fortune; we haue the principall in our <note place="margin">14 <hi>It toucheth but the leſſer part of man.</hi>
                  </note> owne power, and it cannot be ouercome without our owne conſent. Fortune may make a man poore, ſick, afflicted, but not vitious, diſſolute, deiected; it cannot take from vs probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, courage, vertue.</p>
               <p>Afterwards we muſt come to fidelitie, reaſon, iuſtice. Many times a man complaineth vniuſtlie, for though he be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">15 <hi>It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon and iustice.</hi>
                  </note> ſurpriſed with ſome ill accident, yet he is more often with a good, and ſo the one muſt recompence the other. And if a man conſider well thereof, he ſhall find more reaſon to content himſelfe with his good fortunes, than to complaine of his bad: and as we turne our eyes from thoſe things that offend vs, and delight to caſt them vpon greene and pleaſant colours, ſo muſt we diuert our thoughts from heauie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike occurrents, and applie them to thoſe that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and pleaſing vnto vs. But we are malicious reſembling
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:16995:175"/>
cupping-glaſſes, which draw the corrupt bloud, and leaue the good; like a couetous man who ſelleth the beſt wine, and drinks the worſt, like little children, from whom if you take away one of their play-games, in a furie they caſt away all the reſt. For if any misfortune happen vnto vs, we torment our ſelues, and forget all the reſt that may any way comfort vs: yea ſome there are that for ſmall loſſes terme themſelues vnfortunate in all things, and forget that they euer receiued any good, in ſuch ſort that an ounce of aduerſitie brings them more hartie griefe then ten thouſand of proſperitie, pleaſure or delight.</p>
               <p>We muſt likewiſe caſt our eyes vpon thoſe that are of a <note place="margin">16 <hi>It is little in compariſon.</hi>
                  </note> far worſe condition than our ſelues, who would thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues happie if they were in our place.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Cum tibi diſpliceat rerum fortuna tuarum,</l>
                  <l>Alterius ſpecta, quo ſis diſcrimine peior.</l>
               </q>
               <p>It were good and neceſſarie that theſe complainers did practiſe the ſaying and aduice of a wiſeman, that if all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that men ſuffer ſhould be compared with the bleſſings they enioy, the diuiſion being equallie made, they may ſee by the ouerplus of that good they enioy, the iniuſtice of their complaint.</p>
               <p>After all theſe opinions, we may conclude that there are two great remedies againſt all euils and aduerſities, which may be reduced almoſt to one: Cuſtome for the vulgar and baſer ſort, and meditation for the wiſer. Both of them haue their force from time, the common and ſtrongeſt ſalue againſt all euils; but the wiſe take it before hand, this is foreſight, and the feeble and vulgar ſort after hand. That Cuſtome preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth much it doth plainly appeare, in that thoſe things that are moſt tedious and offenſiue, are made thereby eaſie and pleaſing. <hi>Natura calamitatum mollimentum conſuetudinem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenit.</hi> Slaues weepe when they enter into the gallies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three months be ended they ſing. They that haue not beene accuſtomed to the ſea, are afeard, though it be at the calmeſt, when they wey anckor, whereas the mariners laugh in the middeſt of a tempeſt. The wife groweth deſperate at the death of hir husband, and before a yeare be expired ſhe loues another. Time and Cuſtome brings all things to paſſe;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:16995:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that which offendeth vs is the noueltie of that which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto vs, <hi>omnia nouitate grauiora ſunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meditation performeth the ſame office with wiſe men, and by the force thereof things are made familiar and ordinarie, <note place="margin">18 <hi>Foreſight or prouidence.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>quae alij diu patiendo leuia faciunt, ſapiens leuia facit diu cogitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> Hee conſidereth exactly the nature of all things that may offend him, and preſenteth vnto himſelfe whatſoeuer may happen vnto him moſt grieuous and inſupportable, as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, pouerty, exile, iniuries, and examineth in them all that which is according to nature or contrary to it. For foreſight or prouidence is a great remedy againſt all euils, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring any great alteration or change, hapning to a man that attendeth them; whereas contrarily they wound and hurt him greatly, that ſuffereth himſelfe to bee ſurpriſed by them. Meditation and diſcourſe is that which giueth the true temper to the ſoule, prepareth it, confirmeth it againſt all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, makes it hard, ſteely, impenetrable againſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would wound or hurt it. Sudden accidents how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, can giue no great blow to him that keepes himſelfe vpon his guard, and is alwaies readie to receiue them, <hi>praemeditati mali mollis ictus venit: quicquid expectatum eſt diu, leuiùs acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> Now to attaine this foreſight, we muſt firſt know that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath placed vs heere, as in a thorny and ſlipppery place; that that which is happened vnto another, may alſo light vpon vs; that that which hangeth ouer all, may fall vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs; and that in all the affaires that wee vndertake wee premeditate the inconueniences and euill encounters which may happen vnto vs, to the end wee bee not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnawares. O how much are wee deceiued, and how little iudgement haue we, when wee thinke that that which hapneth to others cannot likewiſe fall vpon vs! When wee will not bee wary and prouident, for feare leſt wee ſhould bee thought fearefull. Contrariwiſe, if wee take knowledge of things, as reaſon would haue vs, we would rather wonder that ſo few croſſes happen vnto vs, and that thoſe accidents that follow vs ſo neare, haue ſtaied ſo long before they catch vs, and hauing caught vs, how they ſhould handle vs ſo mildly. He that taketh heede, and conſidereth the aduerſitie of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a thing that may happen vnto himſelfe, before it ſhall
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16995:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
happen, is ſufficiently armed. We muſt thinke of all, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the worſt; they are fooles and ill aduiſed, that ſay, I had not thought it. It is an old ſaying, that he that is ſuddenly ſurpriſed, is halfe beaten, and he that is warned is halfe armed, nay is two againſt one. A wiſe man in time of peace makes his preparation for warre: A good mariner before hee goe foorth of the hauen, makes prouiſion of what is neceſſarie to reſiſt the violence of a tempeſt: it is too late to prouide againſt an euill, when it is already come. In whatſoeuer we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before hand, wee finde our ſelues apt and admirable, what difficultie ſoeuer it haue; and contrariwiſe there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſo eaſie that doth not hurt and hinder vs, if wee bee but noueliſts therein; <hi>Id videndum ne quid inopinaium ſit nobis, quia omnia nouitate grauiora ſunt.</hi> Doubtleſſe it ſeemeth that if we were ſo prouident as we ſhould and may be, we ſhould wonder at nothing. That which thou ſaweſt before it came, is hapned vnto thee, why then wondereſt thou? Let vs then take a courſe that accidents doe not ſurpriſe vs; let vs euer ſtand vpon our gard, and foreſee what is to come. <hi>Animus aduerſus omnia firmandus, vt dicere poſſimus, non vlla laborum, O virgo, noua mi facies inopináue ſurgit, Omnia percepi at<expan>

Now this maieſtie and authoritie is firſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the perſon of the ſoueraigne prince and lawmaker, where it is liuely, actuall and mouing; afterwards in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and ordinances, that is to ſay, in the law, which is the head of the worke of the prince, and the image of a liuely and originall maieſtie.

Againe, cuſtome hath with it neither reward nor puniſhment; the law hath them both, at leaſt puniſhment, neuertheleſſe they may mutuallie help and hinder one another. For cuſtome which is but of ſufferance, authorized by the ſoueraigne, is better confirmed: and the law likewiſe ſetleth it owne authoritie by poſſeſſion and vſe; and contrariwiſe cuſtome may be caſchiered by a contrarie law, and the law loſeth the force thereof by ſuffering a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie cuſtome: but ordinarily they are together, that is law and cuſtome; wiſe and ſpirituall men conſidering it as a law, idiots and ſimple men as a cuſtome.</p>
               <p>There is not a thing more ſtrange, than the diuerſitie and ſtrangenes of ſome lawes and cuſtomes in the world; Neither <note place="margin">4 <hi>Their diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and ſtrangeneſſe.</hi>
                  </note> is there any opinion or imagination ſo variable, ſo mad, which is not eſtabliſhed by lawes and cuſtomes in ſome place or other. I am content to recite ſome of them, to ſhew thoſe <note place="margin">Of lawes and customes in the world.</note> that are hard of beleefe heerein, how farre this propoſition doth go. Yet omitting to ſpeake of thoſe things that belong to religion, which is the ſubiect where the greateſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and groſſeſt impoſtures are: but becauſe it is without the commerce of men, and that it is not properly a cuſtome, and where it is eaſie to be deceiued, I will not meddle with it. See then a brief of thoſe that for the ſtrangenes are beſt worth the noting. To account it an office of pietie in a certaine age to kill their parents &amp; to eate them. In Innes to pay the ſhot, by yeelding their children, wiues and daughters to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the hoſte: publike brothelhouſes of males: old men lending their wiues vnto yong: women common: an honor to women to haue accompaned with many men, and to cary their locks in the hembes of their garments: daughters to go with their priuie parts vncouered, and maried women care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie to keepe them couered: to leaue the daughters to their
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16995:178"/>
pleaſures, and being great with child to enforce an obort in the ſight and knowledge of all men; but maried women to keepe themſelues chaſte and faithfull to their husbands: wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the firſt night before they companie with their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, to receiue all the males of the eſtate and profeſſion of their husbands, inuited to the mariage, and euer after to be faithfull to their husbands: yong maried women to preſent their virginitie to their prince, before they he with their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: mariages of males: women to go to warre with their husbands: to die and to kill themſelues at the deceaſe of their husbands, or ſhortly after: to permit widowes to marie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if their husbands die a violent death, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: husbands to be diuorced from their wiues without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging any cauſe: to ſell them if they be barren, to kill them for no other cauſe but becauſe they are women, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to borrow women of others at their neede: women to be deliuered without paine or feare: to kill their children becauſe they are not faire, well featured, or without cauſe: at meate to wipe their fingers vpon their priuities and their feete: to liue with mans fleſh: to eate fleſh and fiſh raw: many men and women to lie together to the number of tenne or twelue: to ſalute one another by putting the finger to the ground, and afterwards lifting it towards heauen: to turne the back when they ſalute, and neuer to looke him on the face whom a man will honor: to take into the hand the ſpittle of the prince: not to ſpeake to the king but at a peepe-hole: in a mans whole life neuer to cut his haire nor nailes: to cut the haire on one ſide, and the nailes of one hand, and not of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: men to piſſe ſitting, women ſtanding: to make holes and pits in the fleſh of the face, and the dugs, to hang rings and iewels in: to contemne death, to receiue it with ioy, to ſue for it, to pleade in publike for the honor thereof, as for a dignitie and fauour: to account it an honorable buriall to be eaten with dogs, birds, to be boyled, cut in peeces and poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the powder to be caſt into their ordinarie drinke.</p>
               <p>When we come to iudge of theſe cuſtomes, that is the complaint and the trouble: the vulgar ſot and pedante, are <note place="margin">5 Examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> not troubled he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16995:178"/>
that is to ſay, the common vſe and cuſtome of their countrie. And if a man ſhall tell them, that others do ſpeake and iudge the ſame of ours, and are as much offended with ours, as we with theirs, they cut a man ſhort after their maner, tearming them beaſts and barbarians, which is alwaies to ſay the ſame thing. A wiſe man is more aduiſed, as ſhall be ſaid, he maketh not ſuch haſte to iudge, for feare leſt he wrong his owne iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and to ſay the truth, there are many lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes which ſeeme at the firſt view to be ſauage, inhumane, and contrarie to all reaſon, which if they were without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſoundly conſidered of, if they were not found to be altogether iuſt and good, yet at the leaſt they would not be without ſome reaſon and defence. Let vs take amongſt the reſt for example the two firſt which wee haue ſpoken of, which ſeeme to be both the ſtrangeſt and fartheſt off from the dutie of pietie; to kill their owne parents at a certaine age, and to eate them. They that haue this cuſtome do take it to be a teſtimonie of pietie and good affection, endeuoring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by firſt of meere pitie to deliuer their old parents, not only vnprofitable to themſelues and others, but burthenſome, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, and leading a painfull and troubleſome life, and to place them in reſt and eaſe: afterwards giuing them the moſt worthie and commendable ſepulchre, lodging in themſelues and their owne bowels the bodies and reliques of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in a maner reuiuing them againe, and regenerating them by a kind of tranſmutation into their liuing fleſh, by the meanes of the digeſtion and nouriſhment. Theſe reaſons would not ſeeme ouer-light to him that is not poſſeſſed with a contrarie opinion: and it is an eaſie matter to conſider, what crueltie and abomination it had been to theſe people, to ſee their parents before their owne eies to ſuffer ſuch griefe and torment, and they not able to ſuccour them, and afterwards to caſt their ſpoiles to the corruption of the earth, to ſtench and rottennes, and the foode of wormes, which is the worſt that can be done vnto it. <hi>Darius</hi> made a triall, asking ſome Greekes for what they would be perſwaded to follow the cuſtome of the Indians in eating their dead fathers. To whom they anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they would not do it for any thing in the world. And on the other ſide aſſaying to perſwade the Indians to burne
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16995:179"/>
the bodies of their dead parents as the Greekes did, it ſeemed to them a matter of ſuch difficultie and horror, as that they would neuer be drawne vnto it. I will adde only one other, which concerneth only matter of decencie and comelineſſe, and is more light and more pleaſant: One that alwaies blew his noſe with his hand, being reprehended for inciuilitie, in the defence of himſelfe, asked what priuiledge that filthie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement had, that a man muſt affoord it a faire handker chiefe to receiue, and afterwards carefullie wrap &amp; fold it vp, which he thought was a matter of greater lothſomnes than to caſt it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. So that we ſee that for all things there may be found ſome ſeeming reaſon, and therefore we are not ſuddenly and lightlie to condemne any thing.</p>
               <p>But who would beleeue how great and imperious the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of cuſtome is? He that ſaid it was another nature, did <note place="margin">6 <hi>The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thereof.</hi>
                  </note> not ſufficientlie expreſſe it, for it doth more than nature, it conquereth nature: for hence it is that the moſt beautifull daughters of men draw not vnto loue their naturall parents; nor brethren, though excellent in beautie, winne not the loue of their ſiſters. This kind of chaſtirie is not properly of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of the vſe of lawes and cuſtomes, which forbid them, and make of inceſt a great ſinne, as we may ſee in the fact not <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 20. 29. 35.

Reg. 12. 3. Reg. 2.</note>: and which is more, betweene the naturall brother and ſiſter of diuers wombs, but alſo in the right line of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that is to ſay, of the ſonne with the mother in law; for in the right line of bloud, it ſeemeth to be altogether againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, notwithſtanding the fact of the daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> with their father, which neuertheleſſe was produced purely by nature, in that extreame apprehenſion and feare of the end of humane kind, for which cauſe they haue beene excuſed by <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Ambroſe. Auguſt.</note> great and learned doctors. Now againſt nature there is not any diſpenſation, if God the only ſuperior thereunto giue it
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16995:179"/>
not. Finally of caſuall inceſts and not voluntarie the world is full, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> teacheth. Moreouer, cuſtome doth enforce <note place="margin">In Apolog.</note> the rules of nature, witnes thoſe Phyſitians who many times leaue the naturall reaſons of their arte by their owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as they that by cuſtome do liue and ſuſtaine their liues with poyſon, Spiders, Emmets, Lyzards, Toades, which is a common practiſe amongſt the people of the Weſt Indies. It likewiſe dulleth our ſenſes, witnes they that liue neere the fall of the riuer of <hi>Nilus,</hi> neere clocks, armories, milles, and the whole world according to ſome Philoſophers, with the ſound of a heauenly kind of muſick, and the continuall and diuers motions of the heauens dulleth our ſenſes, that we heare not that which we heare. To conclude, (and it is the principall fruit thereof) it ouercommeth all difficultie, maketh things eaſie that ſeeme impoſſible, ſweetneth all ſower, and therefore by the meanes heereof a man liues in all things content, but yet it maſtereth our ſoules, our beliefs, our iudgements, with a moſt vniuſt and tyrannicall authoritie. It doth and vndoeth, authoriſeth and diſauthoriſeth whatſoeuer it pleaſe, without rhythme or reaſon, yea many times againſt all reaſon: It eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth in the world againſt reaſon &amp; iudgement all the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, religions, beleefs, obſeruances, maners, and ſorts of life moſt fantaſticall and rude, as before hath been ſaid. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, it wrongfully degradeth, robbeth, beateth downe in things that are truly great and admirable, their price and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and maketh them baſe and vile.</p>

               </q>
               <p>So that we ſee that cuſtome is a thing great and powerfull. <hi>Plato</hi> hauing reprehended a youth for playing at cobnut, or chery-pit, and receiuing this anſwere from him, That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled him for a matter of ſmall moment, replied, My child, cuſtome is not a matter of ſmall moment. A ſpeech wel worth the noting for all ſuch as haue youth to bring vp. But it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth it power with ſo abſolute authoritie, that there is no ſtriuing againſt it, neither is it lawfull to reaſon, or call into queſtion the ordinances thereof: it enchanteth vs in ſuch ſort, that it maketh vs beleeue that what is without the bounds
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:16995:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereof, is without the bounds of reaſon, and there is nothing good and iuſt, but what it approueth; <hi>ratione non componimur,</hi>

               <p>Now the aduice which I heere giue vnto him that would be wiſe, is to keepe and obſerue both in word and deede the <note place="margin">7 An aduice.</note> lawes &amp; cuſtomes which he findeth eſtabliſhed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie where he is: and in like maner to reſpect and obey the magiſtrates and all ſuperiors, but alwaies with a noble ſpirit, and after a generous maner, and not ſeruilely, pedanticallie, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly, and withall not taking offence, nor lightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning other ſtrange lawes and cuſtomes, but freely and ſoundly iudging and examining the one and the other, as hath been ſaid, and not binding his iudgement and beleefe but vnto reaſon only.

               <p>In the firſt place according to all the wiſeſt, the rule of rules, and the generall law of lawes, is to follow and obſerue <note place="margin">1 <hi>Lawes and customes are to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi>

               <p>But that it be (which is the ſecond rule) out of a good mind and after a good maner; nobly and wiſely, neither for the loue <note place="margin">2 <hi>Not for their iuſtice and equity.</hi>

Lawes and cuſtomes are maintained in credit, not becauſe they are iuſt and good, but becauſe they are lawes and cuſtomes; this is the myſticall foundation of their authoritie, they haue no other; and ſo is it with ſuperiours, becauſe they are ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, <hi>quia ſupra Cathedram ſedent,</hi> not becauſe they are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and honeſt, <hi>quae faciunt, nolite facere.</hi> Hee that obeyeth them for any other cauſe, obeyeth them not becauſe hee ſhould, this is an euill and a dangerous ſubiect, it is not true obedience, which muſt be pure and ſimple, <hi>vnde vocatur de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio diſcretionis mera executio, abnegatio ſui.</hi> Now to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to meaſure one obedience by the iuſtice and goodneſſe of lawes and ſuperiours, were by ſubmitting them to our iudgement, to ſerue them with proceſſe, and to call our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience into doubt, and diſputation, and conſequently the ſtate and the policie according to the inconſtancie and diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of iudgements. How many vniuſt and ſtrange lawes are there in the world, not only in the particular iudgements of men, but of vniuerſall reaſon, wherewith the world hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a long time in continuall peace and reſt, with as great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as if they had beene very iuſt and reaſonable? And he that ſhould goe about to change or mend them, would be accounted an enemie to the weale-publike, and neuer bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: The nature of man doth accommodate it ſelfe to all with the times, and hauing once caught his fiſh, it is an act of hoſtilitie to goe about to alter any thing: we muſt leaue the world where it is, theſe trouble-houſes and newfan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſpirits, vnder a pretext of reformation marre all.</p>
               <p>All change and alteration of lawes, beleefes, cuſtomes and <note place="margin">Against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouatours.</note> obſeruances is very dangerous, and yeeldeth alwaies more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill than good; it bringeth with it certaine and preſent euils, for a good that is vncertaine and to come. Innouatours haue alwaies glorious and plauſible titles, but they are but the more ſuſpected, and they cannot eſcape the note of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſumption, in that they thinke to ſee more cleerely than others, and that to eſtabliſh their opinions, the ſtate,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:16995:181"/>
policie, peace and publike quiet muſt be turned topſy turuy.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay for all this that hath beene ſaid before, that <note place="margin">3 <hi>Strange things are not lightly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
                  </note> we muſt abſolutely obey all lawes, all commandements of ſuperiours, for ſuch as a man knoweth euidently to be either againſt God or nature, hee is not to obey, and yet not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and to trouble the ſtate: how he ſhould gouerne himſelfe in ſuch a caſe ſhall be taught heereafter, in the obedience due vnto princes; for to ſay the truth, this inconuenience and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, is rather, and more common in the commandements of princes, than in the lawes: neither is it ſufficient to obey the lawes and ſuperiours becauſe of their worth and merrit, nor ſeruilely and for feare, as the common and prophane ſort doe; but a wiſe man doth nothing by force or feare, <hi>ſoli hoc ſapienti contingit, vt nil faciat inuitus, recta ſequitur, gaudet officio,</hi> he doth that which he ſhould, and keepes the lawes, not for feare of them, but for the loue of himſelfe, being iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his dutie; he hath not to doe with the lawes, to doe well; that is that wherein he differeth from the common ſort, who cannot do well, nor know what they ought to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawes; <hi>at iuſto &amp; ſapienti non est lex poſita.</hi> By right a wiſe man is aboue the lawes, but in outward and publike effect, he is their voluntarie and free obedient ſubiect. In the third place thereof, it is an act of lightneſſe and iniurious preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea a teſtimonie of weakeneſſe and inſufficiencie, to condemne that which agreeth not with the law and cuſtome of his countrie. This proceedeth either from want of leaſure or ſufficiencie to conſider the reaſons and grounds of others; this is to wrong and ſhame his owne iudgement, whereby he is enforced many times to recant, and not to remember that the nature of man is capable of all things; It is to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the eie of his ſpirit to be hood winked, and brought aſleepe by a long cuſtome, and preſcription to haue power ouer iudgement.</p>
               <p>Finally it is the office of a generous ſpirit and a wiſe man <note place="margin">4 <hi>Wiſely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xamine all things.</hi>
                  </note> (whom I heere endeuour to deſcribe) to examine all things, to conſider apart, and afterwards to compare together all the lawes and cuſtomes of the world, which ſhall come to his knowledge, and to iudge of them (not to rule his obedience by them, as hath beene ſaid, but to exerciſe his office, ſince
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:16995:181"/>
he hath a ſpirit to that end) faithfully and without paſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of truth and vniuerfall reaſon and nature, whereunto he is firſt obliged, not flattering himſelfe, or ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his iudgement with error: and to content himſelfe to yeeld obedience vnto thoſe whereunto hee is ſecondly and particularly bound, whereby none ſhall haue cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him. It may fall out ſometimes, that wee may doe that, by a ſecond particular and municipall obligation (obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawes and cuſtomes of the country) which is againſt the firſt and more ancient, that is to ſay, vniuerſall nature and reaſon; but yet we ſatisfie nature by keeping our iudgements and opinions true and iuſt according to it. For wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much ours, and whereof we may freely diſpoſe; the world hath nothing to do with out thoughts, but the outward man is engaged to the publicke courſe of the world, and muſt giue an account thereof: ſo that manie times, wee doe iuſtlie that, which iuſtly we approoue not. There is no remedie, for ſo goes the world.</p>
               <p>After theſe two miſtreſſes, Law and Cuſtome, comes the <note place="margin">8 <hi>Of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>
                  </note> third, which hath no leſſe authority &amp; power with many, yea is more rough &amp; tyrannicall to thoſe that too much tie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thereunto. This is the ceremony of the world, which to ſay the truth, is for the moſt part but vanity; yet holdeth ſuch place, and vſurpeth ſuch authority, by the remiſneſſe and contagious corruption of the world, that manie thinke that wiſedome conſiſteth in the obſeruation thereof, and in ſuch ſort do voluntarilie enthrall themſelues thereunto, that rather than they wil contradict it, they preiudice their health, benefit, buſineſſe, libertie, conſcience and all; which is a very great follie, and the fault and infelicity of manie Courtiers, who aboue others are the idolaters of ceremonie. Now my will is, that this my Wiſe-man, do carefullie defend himſelfe from this captiuity. I doe not meane, that out of a kind of looſe inciuilitie, he abuſe a ceremonie, for we muſt forgiue the world in ſome thing, and as much as may be outwardlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues to that which is in practiſe; but my will is, that he tie not, and enthrall himſelfe thereunto, but that with a gallant and generous boldneſſe hee know how to leaue it when he will, and when it is fit, and in ſuch maner, as that he
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:16995:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
giue all men to know, that it is not out of careleſnes, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, or ignorance, or contempt, but becauſe he would not ſeeme ignorant how to eſteeme of it as is fit, not ſuffer his iudgement and will to be corrupted with ſuch a vanitie, and that he lendeth himſelfe to the world when it pleaſeth him, but neuer giueth himſelfe.</p>

               <p>There is heere a two-fold conſideration (and conſequently two parts in this Chapter) according to the two maners of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> conuerſing with the world, the one is ſimple, generall and common; the ordinarie commerce of the world, whereunto the times, the affaires, the voyages, and encounters do daily leade, and change acquaintance from thoſe we know, to thoſe we know not, ſtrangers, without our choice, or voluntarie conſents: the other ſpeciall is in affected and deſired compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and acquaintance, either ſought after and choſen, or being offered and preſented, hath beene embraced, and that either for ſpirituall or corporall profit or pleaſure, wherein there is conference, communication, priuitie, and familiaritie: each of them haue their aduiſements apart. But before we enter into them, it ſhall not be amiſſe by way of preface, to giue you ſome generall and fundamentall aduice of all thereſt.</p>
               <p>It is a great vice (whereof this our Wiſe-man muſt take heed) and a defect inconuenient both to himſelfe and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">3 <hi>Facilitie and vniuerſalitie of humours.</hi>
                  </note>, to be bound and ſubiect to certaine humours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, to one only courſe, that is, to be a ſlaue to himſelfe, ſo to be captiuated to his proper inclinations, that he cannot be bent to any other, a teſtimonie of an anxious ſcrupulous mind, and ill bred, too amorous, and too partiall to it ſelfe.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:16995:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theſe kind of people haue much to endure and to conteſt; and contrariwiſe it is a great ſufficiencie and wiſdome to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelfe to all, <hi>I ſtud eſt ſapere, qui vbicun<expan>

The faireſt minds, and the beſt borne, are the more v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall, the more common, appliable to all vnderſtandings, communicatiue and open to all people. It is a beautifull qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which reſembleth and imitateth the goodnes of God, it is the honor which was giuen to old <hi>Cato, huic verſatile inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, ſic pariter adomnia fuit, vt natum ad id vnum diceres, quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ageret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs ſee the aduiſements of the firſt conſideration, of the ſimple and common conuerſation, I wil heere ſet downe ſome <note place="margin">4 <hi>The firſt part. Aduice touching ſimple and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation.</hi>
                  </note>, whereof the firſt ſhall be, to keepe ſilence and modeſtie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, not to be ouer-formall, in not applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the follies, indiſcretions and lightneſſes which may be committed in his preſence; for it is an indiſcretion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all that pleaſeth not our palat. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               </p>
               <p>The third, to ſpare, and thriftily to order that which a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> knoweth, and that ſufficiencie that he hath attained, and to be more willing to heare than to ſpeake, to learne than to teach; for it is a vice to be more readie and forward to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne, to talke of himſelfe, and to ſhew all that is in him, than to learne knowledge of another, and to ſpend his owne ſtock than to get new.</p>
               <p>The fourth, not to enter into diſcourſe and conteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, neither againſt great men to whom we owe a dutie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and reſpect, nor againſt our inferiours, where the match is not equall.</p>
               <p>The fift, to be honeſtlie curious in the enquirie of all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>, and knowing them, to order them frugallie, to make profit by them.</p>
               <p>The ſixt and principall is, to employ his iudgement in all things, which is the chiefe part which worketh, ruleth, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> doth all; without the vnderſtanding all other things are blind, deafe, and without a ſoule, it is leaſt to know the hiſtorie, the iudgement is all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:16995:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The ſeuenth is, neuer to ſpeake affirmatiuely, and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, with obſtinacie and reſolution; that hurteth and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all.</p>
               <p>Peremptorie affirmation and obſtinacie in opinion, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſignes of ſenſleſneſſe and ignorance. The ſtile of the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> was, that the witneſſes depoſing, and the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges determining that which of their owne proper knowledge they knew to be true, they expreſſed their mind by this word, It ſeemeth <hi>(it a videtur).</hi> And if theſe did thus, what ſhould others do? It were good to learne to vſe ſuch words as may ſweeten and moderate the temeritie of our propoſitions, as, It may be, It is ſaid, I thinke, It ſeemeth, and the like: and in anſwering, I vnderſtand it not, What is that to ſay? It may be, It is true. I will ſhut vp this generall part in theſe few <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> words; To haue the countenance and the outward ſhew open and agreeable to all, his mind and thought couered and hid from all, his tongue ſober and diſcreet, alwaies to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to himſelfe, and to ſtand on his gard, <hi>frons aperta, lingua parca, mens clauſa, nulli fidere,</hi> to ſee and heare much, to ſpeake little, to iudge of all, <hi>vide, audi, iudica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs come to the other conſideration, and kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation more ſpeciall, whereof the inſtructions are theſe. <note place="margin">11 <hi>The ſecond part, of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi>
                  </note> The firſt is to ſeeke, to conferre, and conuerſe with men of conſtancie and dexteritie; for thereby the mind is confirmed and fortified, and is eleuated aboue it ſelfe, as with baſe and weake ſpirits it is debaſed, and vtterly loſt: the contagion heerein is, as in the bodie, and alſo more.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is not to be aſtoniſhed at the opinions of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for how contrarie ſoeuer to the common ſort, how ſtrange, how friuolous or extrauagant they ſeeme, yet they are ſutable to the ſpirit of man, which is capable to produce all things, and therfore it is weaknes to be aſtoniſhed at them.</p>
               <p>The third is not to feare or to be troubled with the rude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuilitie and bitter ſpeeches of men, whereunto he muſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> and accuſtome himſelfe. Gallant men beare them with courage; this tendernes, and fearefull &amp; ceremonious mildnes is for women. This ſocietie and familiaritie muſt be valiant and manly, it muſt be couragious both to giue hard ſpeeches,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:16995:183"/>
and to endure them, to correct and to be corrected. It is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pleaſure, to haue to do with a people that yeeld, flatter, and applaud a man in all things.</p>
               <p>The fourth is to aime alwaies at the truth, to acknowledge it, ingenuouſly and cheerefully to yeeld vnto it, of what ſide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> ſoeuer it be; vſing alwaies and in all things ſinceritie, and not as many, eſpeciallie pedanties, by right or by wrong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe, and to quell his aduerſarie. It is a fairer victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to range himſelfe according to reaſon, and to vanquiſh himſelfe, than to ouercome his aduerſarie, whereunto his own weakneſſe doth many times help, being farre from all paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To acknowledge his fault, to confeſſe his doubt and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, to yeeld when there is occaſion, are actes of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gentlenes and ſinceritie, which are the principall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an honeſt and wiſe man; whereas obſtinacie in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion accuſeth a man of many vices and imperfections.</p>
               <p>The fift is, in diſputation not to employ all the meanes that a man may haue, but ſuch as are beſt and fitteſt, that are more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> pertinent and preſſing, and that with breuitie; for euen in a good cauſe a man may ſay too much; for long diſcourſes, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications and repetitions are a teſtimonie of oſtentation, deſire to ſpeake, and tedious to the whole companie.</p>
               <p>The ſixt and principall is, in all things to keepe a forme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/>, order and aptnes. O what a troubleſome thing it is to diſpute and conferre with a foole, a trifler, that vttereth nothing but matter impertinent to the matter! It is the only iuſt excuſe to cut off all conference: for what can a man gaine but torment, that knowes not how, or what to ſpeake as he ſhould? Not to vnderſtand the argument that is made, to wed himſelfe to his owne opinion, not to anſwere directly, to tye himſelfe to words, and to leaue the principall, to mingle and trouble the conference with vaine amplifications, to denie all, not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the forme of diſputation, to vſe vnprofitable prefaces and digreſſions, to be obſtinate in opinion, and to mouth it out, to tye himſelfe to formes, and neuer to diue into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, are things that are ordinarily practiſed by pedanties and Sophiſters. See heere how wiſdome is diſcerned from follie; this is preſumptuous, raſh, obſtinate, aſſured; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſatisfieth it ſelfe, is fearefull, aduiſed, modeſt: this pleaſeth
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:16995:184"/>
it ſelfe, goes foorth of the liſts merrily and gloriouſly, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wonne the victorie, when it neuer came neere it.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth, if there be place of contradiction, hee muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> take heede that he be not bold, obſtinate, bitter, for either of theſe three makes it vnwelcome, &amp; doth more hurt himſelfe, than an other. That it may winne good entertainment of the companie, it muſt ariſe from that very houre of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie that is handled, from the preſent occaſion, and not from elſewhere, nor from any former precedent ground; neither muſt it touch the perſon, but the matter onely, with ſome commendation of the perſon, if there be cauſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis doth properly belong to the vertue of prudence, whereof wee ſhall ſpeake in the beginning of the booke following, where ſhall bee ſet downe in particular diuers counſels and aduiſements according to the diuers kindes of prudence and occurrents in our affaires. But I will heere ſet downe the principall points and heads of wiſedome, which are generall &amp; common aduiſements to inſtruct in groſſe our diſciple, to carrie himſelfe well and wiſely in the trafficke and commerce of the world, and the managing of all affaires; and they are eight.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſiſteth in vnderſtanding, that is, well to know the perſons with whom a man hath to deale, their proper and <note place="margin">1 <hi>Knowledge of the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and affaires.</hi>
                  </note> particular nature, their humour, their ſpirit, inclinatino, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement, and intention, their proceedings: to know likewiſe the nature of the buſineſſe which he hath in hand, and which is propoſed vnto him, not only in their ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and outward appearance, but to penetrate into the inſide thereof, not only to ſee and know things in themſelues, but the accidents and conſequents that belong thereunto. The better to doe this, he muſt looke into them with all maner of viſages, conſider them in all ſenſes; for there are ſome that in one ſide are very pretious and pleaſing, and on the other baſe and pernicious. Now it is certaine, that according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers natures of the perſons and affaires, we muſt change our
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:16995:184"/>
ſtile and maner of proceeding, like a Seaman, who according to the diuers ſtate of the ſea, and the diuerſitie of the windes, doth diuerſly turne and guide his ſailes and his oares. For he that in all things ſhall direct and carrie himſelfe after one and the ſame faſhion, would quickly marre all, play the foole, and make himſelfe ridiculous. Now this twofold knowledge of the perſons and affaires is no eaſie matter, ſo much is man diſguiſed and counterfeited; but the way to attaine thereunto, is to conſider them attentiuely and aduiſedly, reuoluing them many times in our mindes, and that without paſſion.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt likewiſe learne to eſteeme of things according to their true worth, giuing vnto them that price and place <note place="margin">2 <hi>Eſtimation of things.</hi>
                  </note> which appertaineth vnto them, which is the true office of wiſedome and ſufficiencie. This is a high point of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie; but the better to attaine thereunto, we muſt take heede of paſſion, and the iudgement of the vulgar ſort. There are <note place="margin">Not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vulgar iudgement.</note> ſix or ſeuen things which mooue and leade vulgar ſpirits, and make them to eſteeme of things by falſe enſignes, whereof wiſe men will take heed; which are, noueltie, raritie, ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, difficultie, Art, inuention, abſence, and priuation or deniall, and aboue all, report, ſhew, and prouiſion. They eſteeme not of things if they be not poliſhed by Art and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if they be not pointed and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nted out. The ſimple and naturall, of what value ſoeuer they be, they attend not; they eſcape and droppe away inſenſibly, or at leaſt are accounted plaine, baſe, and fooliſh; a great teſtimonie of humane vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and imbecillitie, which is paied with winde, with falſe and counterfeit mony, in ſteede of currant, from whence it is, that a man preferreth Art before nature, that which is ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and difficult, before that which is eaſie; vehement moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impulſions, before complexion, conſtitution, habit; the extraordinary before the ordinary; oſtentation &amp; pompe, before true and ſecret veritie; another mans, and that which is ſtrange, which is borrowed, before that which is proper and naturall. And what greater follie can there bee than all this? Now the rule of the wiſe is not to ſuffer themſelues by all this, to be caught and carried, but to meaſure and iudge <note place="margin">But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wiſe.</note> and eſteeme of things, firſt by their true, naturall and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all value, which is many times inward and ſecret; and then
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16995:185"/>
by their profit and commoditie; the reſt is but deceit or moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie. This is a matter of difficultie, all things being ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed and ſophiſticated: many times the falſe and wicked being more plauſible, than the true and good. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that there are many falſhoods, which are more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and haue a better outward appearance, than verities. But as it is difficult, ſo is it excellent and diuine: <hi>Si ſeparaueris pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſum</hi>

                  </note> their contraries. This precedency &amp; preheminence of things is a high and excellent knowledge, and yet difficult, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when many preſent themſelues, for plurality hindreth, and heerein men are neuer of one accord. The particular taſtes and iudgements of men are diuers, and it is fit and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it ſhould be ſo, to the end that all runne not together after one and the ſame thing, and ſo bee a let or hindrance to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For example, let vs take the eight principall heads, of <note place="margin">Eight prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heads of goods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and corporall.</note> all goods ſpirituall and corporall, foure of each kind, that is to ſay, <hi>Honeſty, Health, Wiſedome, Beauty, Ability</hi> or <hi>Aptneſſe, Nobility, Science, Riches.</hi> We do heere take the words accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common ſenſe and vſe, wiſdome for a prudent and diſcreet maner of life and carriage with and towards all; Abilitie for ſufficiency in affaires; Science for the knowledge of things acquired out of bookes: the other are cleare enough. Now touching the ranging of theſe eight, how many diuers opinions are there? I haue told my owne, and I haue mingled and in ſuch ſort enterlaced them together, that after and next vnto a ſpirituall, there is a corporall corroſpondent therunto, to the end we may couple the ſoule and the body together. Health is in the body, that which honeſtie is in the ſoule; the health of the ſoule, is the honeſtie of the body, <hi>mens ſana in corpore ſano:</hi> Beauty, is as wiſedome, the meaſure, proportion, and comelineſſe of the body, and wiſedome a ſpirituall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Nobility is a great aptneſſe and diſpoſition to vertue. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are the riches of the ſpirit. Others do range theſe parts otherwiſe, ſome place all the ſpirituall firſt, before they come
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16995:185"/>
to the firſt corporall, and the leaſt of the ſpirit aboue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of the bodie: ſome place them apart, and all diuerſly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one aboundeth in his owne ſenſe.</p>
               <p>After and from this ſufficiencie and part of prudence, to know well how to eſteeme of things, doth ſpring and ariſe <note place="margin">3 <hi>Choice and election of things.</hi>
                  </note> another, that is, to know well how to chooſe, where not only the conſcience, but alſo the ſufficiencie and prudence is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many times ſhewed. There are choices very eaſie, as of a difficultie, &amp; of a vice, of that which is honeſt, and that which is commodious, of dutie and of profit: for the preheminence of the one is ſo great aboue the other, that when they come to encounter, honeſtie alwaies winneth the field, except (it may be) ſome exception very rare, and with great circumſtance, and in publike affaires only, as ſhall be ſaid heereafter in the vertue of Prudence: but there are other choices farre more hard and troubleſome, as when a man is caught or driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrow ſtreit betweene two vices, as was that Doctor <hi>Origen,</hi> either to become an Idolater, or to proſtitute hunſelfe to the carnall pleaſure of a baſe impure Aethiopian. The rule is, that when a man findeth himſelfe in any doubt or perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie touching the choice of thoſe things that are not euill, he muſt chooſe that part that hath moſt honeſtie and iuſtice in it; for though it fall out otherwiſe than well, yet it ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſome comfort and glorie to a man to haue choſen the better; and beſides a man knoweth not (if he had choſen the contrarie part) what would haue hapned, or whether he had eſcaped his deſtinie: when a man doubteth which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſhorteſt way, hee muſt take the ſtreiteſt. And in thoſe things that are euill (whereof there is neuer any choice) a man muſt auoid the more baſe and vniuſt: this is a rule of conſcience, and belongeth to honeſtie. But to know which is the more honeſt, iuſt, and profitable, which the more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, vniuſt, and vnprofitable, it is many times very difficult, and belongeth to prudence and ſufficiencie. It ſeemeth that in ſuch like ſtreits and extremities the ſurer and better way is to follow nature, and to iudge that the more iuſt and honeſt which commeth neereſt vnto nature, that the more vniuſt and diſhoneſt which is fartheſt from it. Before we leaue this diſcourſe of the choice &amp; election of things, in two words let
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16995:186"/>
vs remoue this queſtion: From whence commeth in our ſoules the choice of two indifferent things in all things alike? The Stoicks ſay, from an extraordinarie, immoderate, ſtrange and raſh operation of the ſoule. But a man may ſay, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer do two things preſent themſelues vnto vs, wherein there is not ſome difference or other be it neuer ſo little, and that there is alwaies ſomething in the one, which moueth vs to that choice, although it be inſenſible, and ſuch as we cannot expreſle. He that is equallie ballanced betwixt two deſires, can neuer chooſe, for euery choice and inclination doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre an inequalitie.</p>
               <p>Another precept in this matter, is to take aduice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of another: for, for a man to beleeue himſelfe, and to truſt <note place="margin">4 <hi>Conſultation.</hi>
                  </note> only in himſelfe, is very dangerous. Now heere are required two aduertiſements of Prudence; the one is in the choice of thoſe, to whom a man muſt addreſſe himſelfe for counſell; for there are ſome whoſe counſell we ſhould rather auoid, and flie from. Firſt, they muſt be honeſt and faithfull men (which is heere all one) and ſecondly, men ſenſible, aduiſed, wiſe, and of experience. Theſe are the two qualities of good counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, honeſtie, and ſufficiencie. A man may adde a third, and that is, that neither they nor their neereſt and inward friends haue any particular intereſt in the buſineſſe; for although a man may ſay, that this cannot hinder them to giue good counſell, being, as is ſaid, honeſt men; yet I may anſwere, that beſides that this ſo great and philoſophicall honeſtie, which is no way touched with it owne proper intereſt, be very rare, it is alſo a great point of follie to bring it into doubt and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctie, and as it were to put the finger betwixt two ſtones. The other aduertiſement is, well to heare and entertaine the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, receiuing them without attending the euent, with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gentlenes, delighting in the free deliuerie of the truth. Hauing entertained and followed it as good, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from a good hand and a friendly, he muſt not repent himſelfe of it, although it ſucceed not well, and according to expectation. Many times good counſels haue bad euents. But a wiſe man muſt rather content himſelfe to haue followed good counſell which hath brought foorth bad effects, than bad counſell which hath had a happie euent, as <hi>Marius; ſic</hi>

                  <hi>correcti Marij temeritas gloriam ex culpa inuenit,</hi> and not to do like fooles, who hauing aduiſedly deliberated and choſen, thinke afterwards to haue choſen the worſe, becauſe they weigh only the reaſons of the contrarie opinion, neuer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſing them with thoſe with firſt induced them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Thus much breefly be ſaid of thoſe that ſeeke counſell: <note place="margin">Lib. 3. ca. 2. art. 17.</note> of thoſe that giue it, we ſhal ſpeake in the vertue of Prudence, whereof the counſell is a great and ſufficient part.</p>
               <p>The fift aduice which I heere giue, to carie himſelfe well in his affaires, is a temperature and mediocritie betwixt too <note place="margin">5 Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betwixt feare and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</note> great a confidence, and diſtruſt, feare and aſſurance. To truſt and ſecure himſelfe, doth many times hurt, and to diſtruſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth: he muſt take ſpeciall heed of making any ſhew of diſtruſt, euen when there is cauſe; for it diſpleaſeth, yea of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth much, and many times maketh a friend an enemy. But yet a man is not to be ouer-credulous, and confident, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be of his beſt aſſured friends, he muſt alwaies keepe the bridle in his hands, holding it neither too looſe nor too ſtreight. He muſt neuer ſpeake all, and let that which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth be euer true. He muſt neuer deceiue, but yet let him take heed he be not deceiued. He muſt euer temper and moderate that columbine innocencie and ſimplicitie, in not offending any man with his ſerpentine wiſdome and ſubtiltie, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping himſelfe vpon his gard, and preſeruing himſelfe from the deceits, treaſons, and ambuſhments of another. Subtiltie to defend, is as commendable, as it is diſhoneſt to offend. He muſt neuer therefore aduance and engage himſelfe ſo farre, but that he haue alwaies a meane when he will, and when it ſhall be neceſſarie to retire himſelfe without great dammage or diſlike. He muſt neuer forſake his owne hold, nor ſo much deſpiſe another, and preſume of himſelfe, that he fall into a kind of preſumption and careleſnes of his affaires; like thoſe that thinke that no man ſees ſo cleere as themſelues, that looke that euery man ſhould yeeld vnto them, that no man ſhould dare to entertaine a thought to diſpleaſe them, and by that meanes become diſſolute, and caſt away care, and in the end they are blinded, ſurpriſed, and deceiued.</p>
               <p>Another aduice and very important, is to take all things in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:16995:187"/>
their times and ſeaſons, and to good purpoſe, and for that <note place="margin">To take time and occaſion.</note> cauſe, he muſt aboue all things auoid precipitation, an enemie to wiſdome, the ſtep-mother of all good actions, a vice much to be feared in yong and youthfull people. It is in truth the <note place="margin">Againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation.</note> worke of a skilfull and actiue man, to applie euery thing to his true end, well to manage all occaſions and commodities, to make vſe both of the times and the meanes. All things haue their ſeaſons, and euen the good which a man may doe without purpoſe. Now too much ſpeed and precipitation is contrarie heereunto, which troubleth, marreth, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all: <hi>canis festinans caecos facit catulos.</hi> It proceedeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for that paſſion which carieth vs, <hi>Nam qui cupit festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat: qui festinat euertit: vnde festinatio improuida &amp; caeca: duo aduerſiſſima rectae menticeleritas &amp; ira:</hi> and often enough from inſufficiencie. The contrarie vice, lazineſſe, ſloth, careleſneſſe, <note place="margin">Idleneſſe.</note> which ſeemeth ſometimes to haue ſome aire of maturitie and wiſdome, is likewiſe pernitious and dangerous eſpeciallie in the execution. For it is ſaid, that it is lawfull to be ſlow and long in deliberation and conſultation, but not in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore the wiſeſt ſay, That a man muſt conſult ſlowly, execute ſpeedely, deliberate with leiſure, and with ſpeede accompliſh. It falleth out ſometimes that the contrarie is practiſed with good ſucceſſe, and that a man is happie in the euent, though he haue been ſuddaine and raſh in his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; <hi>Subiti conſilijs, euentu faelices,</hi> but this is very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by chaunce or fortune; according to which wee muſt not rule and direct ourſelues; but take heed leſt enuie and emulation ouertake vs; for commonly a long and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable repentance is the reward of headlong haſtineſſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then two rocks and extremities which we muſt equallie auoid; for it is as great a fault to take occaſions before they be readie, whileſt they be greene and raw, as to ſuffer them to grow till they be ouer-ripe &amp; paſt the taking. The firſt fault, yoong men and forward hot-ſpurres commit, who for want of patience, giue no leaſure to time and the heauens to do any thing for them, they runne, but they catch nothing: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, heauie, lazie dull ſpirited men do commonly fall into. To know the occaſion, and to take it, a man muſt haue his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:16995:187"/>
valiant and vigilant, and likewiſe patient: he muſt foreſee it, watch, attend it, ſee it comming, and prepare for it, and ſo take it iuſt at that inſtant when it is readie.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth aduice is, well to cary himſelfe with theſe two maſters &amp; ſuperintendants of the affaires of the world, which <note place="margin">7 Industrie and Fortune.</note> are induſtrie or vertue, and fortune. It is an ancient queſtion which of theſe two hath moſt credit, force, and authoritie: for it is out of all doubt, that both haue; and it is clearely falſe, that one only doth all, and the other nothing. It were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to be wiſhed that it were true, and that one only had the whole empire, the buſineſſe would go the better, a man would wholly attend that, whereby it would be the more eaſie; the difficultie is to ioyne them together, and to attend them both. Commonly they that ſettle themſelues vnto the one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the other, the yonger and bolder ſort reſpect and truſt to fortune, hoping much good from it, and many times by them it worketh great matters, in ſomuch that it ſeemes to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour them; the more ancient and ſtayed, truſt to their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie; and theſe of the two, haue the more reaſon. If we ſhould compare them, and chuſe one of the two, induſtrie is the more honeſt, the more certaine, glorious; for though fortune be contrarie to it, and ſhall make all induſtrie &amp; diligence vaine, yet neuertheleſſe there remaineth great contentment, in that a man hath not kept holy day, hath performed his office or dutie, hath caried himſelfe like a man of courage. They that follow the other part, are in danger to attend in vaine, and though perhaps things ſucceed according to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, yet they want that honor and glory that the former hath. Now the aduice of wiſdome is, not wholly, and ſo much to ſettle our ſelues to the one, that we contemne, and exclude the other; for they haue both a good part, yea many times they help, and do mutually attend one the other. A wiſe man then muſt cary himſelfe with them both, but yet vnequally, for the aduantage and preheminence muſt be giuen, as hath beene ſaid, to vertue, induſtrie; <hi>virtute duce, comite fortuna.</hi> This aduice likewiſe is required, to keepe diſcretion, which ſeaſoneth and giueth a taſte or reliſh to all things; this is not a particular qualitie, but common, which mingleth it ſelfe in all: Indiſcretion marreth all, and taketh away the grace from
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:16995:188"/>
the beſt actions, whether it be to doe good to another; for all gratifications are not well beſtowed vpon all ſorts of people; or to excuſe himſelfe; for inconſiderate excuſes ſerue for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, or to play the part of an honeſt and curteous man, for a man may exceede and degenerate into ruſticitie, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to offer, or to accept.</p>

               <p>Fortune from farre ſeemeth to watch, and lie in wait for vs, againſt this laſt day, as a day long ſince named and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to ſhew her power, and in a moment to ouerthrow all that wee haue built, and gathered together in many yeers, and to make vs crie out with <hi>Laberius, Nimirum hac die vna plùs vixi mihi, quàm viuendum fuit:</hi> And ſo was it well and wiſely ſaid of <hi>Solon</hi> to <hi>Croeſus; Ante obitum nemo beatus.</hi>

To be briefe, the ſcience of dying is the ſcience of libertie, the way to feare nothing, to liue well, contentedly and peaceably; without this knowledge there is no more pleaſure in life, than in the fruition of that thing which a man feareth alwaies to loſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt and aboue all, we muſt endeuour, that our ſinnes die before our ſelues: Secondly, that we be alwaies ready and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> prepared for death. O what an excellent thing is it for a man to end his life before his death, in ſuch ſort, that at that houre he haue no other thing to doe, but to die! that hee haue no more neede of any thing, not of time, not of himſelfe, but ſweetly and contentedly departeth this life, ſaying:</p>

                  <hi>Vixi, &amp; quem dederat curſum fortuna peregi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee muſt endeuour, that our death be voluntarie; for to die well, is to die willingly.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that a man may carry himſelfe in death fiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers waies: He may feare and flie it, as a very great euill; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <note place="margin">4 <hi>A fiue fold maner of carriage in death.</hi>
                  </note> it ſweetly and patiently, as a thing naturall, ineuitable, reaſonable; contemne it, as a thing indifferent, and of no great importance; deſire and ſeeke after it, as the only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of reſt from all the torments of this life, yea a very great gaine; giue it to himſelfe, by taking away his owne life. Of theſe fiue, the three middlemoſt are good, befitting a good and ſetled ſoule, although diuerſly, and in a different condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life; the two extreames are vitious and out of weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though it be with diuers viſages. A word or two of them all.</p>
               <p>The firſt is not approued by men of vnderſtanding, though by the greater part it be practiſed: a teſtimonie of great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <note place="margin">5 <hi>To feare death.</hi>
                  </note> Againſt theſe kinde of men, and for your better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, either againſt your owne death, or the death of another, thus much briefly. There is not a thing that men feare more, or haue more in horrour than death: neuertheleſſe, there is not a thing where there is leſſe occaſion or matter of feare, or that contrarily yeeldeth greater reaſons to perſwade vs with
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:16995:189"/>
reſolution to accept of it. And therefore we muſt ſay, that it is a meere opinion, and a vulgar errour that hath woon the world thus to thinke of it. Wee giue too much credit to the <note place="margin">It is opinion.</note> inconſiderate vulgar ſort, who tell vs, That it is a very great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; and to little credit to wiſedome it ſelfe which teacheth vs, that it is a freedome from all euils and the hauen of life. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did a preſent death do hurt to any man; and ſome that haue made triall, and partly knew what it is, complaine not of it: and if death be counted an euill, it is of all the euils the only that doth no harme, that hath no euill in it; it is the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only of death before it come, that maketh vs to feare it when it is come. It is then but opinion, not verity; and it is truely where opinion bandeth it ſelfe moſt againſt reaſon, and goeth about to deface it in vs, with the maske of death: there cannot be any reaſon to feare it, becauſe no man knowes what it is, that hee ſhould feare it: for why, or how ſhould a man feare that he knoweth not? And therefore wiſely ſaid he, that of all others was accounted the wiſeſt, that to feare death is to make ſhew of greater vnderſtanding and ſufficiency than can be in a man, by ſeeming to know that, that no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and what he ſpake he practiſed himſelfe; for being ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited at his death by his friends, to pleade before the Iudges, for his iuſtification, and for his life, this oration he made vnto them: My maſters and friends, if I ſhould plead for my life, and deſire you that I may not die, I doubt I may ſpeak againſt my ſelfe, and deſire my owne loſſe and hinderance, becauſe I know not what it is to die, nor what good or ill there is in death: they that feare to die preſume to know it, as for my ſelfe I am vtterly ignorant what it is, or what is done in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; perhaps death is a thing indifferent, perhaps a good thing, and to be deſired. Thoſe things that I know to be euill, as to offend my neighbour, I flie and auoid; thoſe that I know not to be euill, as death, I cannot feare. And therefore I commit my ſelfe vnto your ſelues; and becauſe I cannot know whether it is more expedient for me to die, or not to dy, determine you thereof as you ſhall thinke good.</p>
               <p>For a man to torment himſelfe with the feare of death, it is <note place="margin">6 <hi>It is weaknes.</hi>
                  </note> firſt great weakneſſe and cowardlineſſe: There is not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that in few daies is not appeaſed and content with the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:16995:189"/>
death, yea the moſt painefull that may be, either of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or her child; And why ſhould not reaſon and wiſdome do that in an houre, at an inſtant (as we haue a thouſand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples) which time performeth in a foole, in the weakeſt ſex? What vſe is there of wiſdome and conſtancie in man, to what end ſerue they, if they ſpeed him not in a good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he can do no more with their help, than a foole with his follie? From this weaknes it is, that the moſt part of men dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot reſolue themſelues, that it is their laſt houre, and there is not any thing where this deceitfull hope doth more buſie man; which it may be, doth likewiſe proceed from this, that we account our death a great matter, and that all things haue an intereſt in vs, and at our death muſt ſuffer with vs, ſo much do we eſteeme our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Againe a man ſheweth himſelfe heerein vniuſt; for if death be a good thing, as it is, why doth he feare it? If an euill thing, <note place="margin">7 <hi>Iniustice.</hi>
                  </note> why doth he make it worſe, and adde vnto death euill vpon euill, ſorrow and griefe where there is none? like him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robbed of a part of his goods by the enemie, caſteth the reſt into the ſea, to let men know how little he is greeued with his loſſes.</p>
               <p>Finally to feare death, is for a man to be an enemy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <note place="margin">8 <hi>To be enemy to his owne life.</hi>
                  </note> and to his owne life: for he can neuer liue at eaſe and contentedlie, that feareth to dye. That man is only a free man, which feareth not death; and contrarily, life is but a ſlauery if it were not made free by death: For death is the only ſtay of our libertie, the common and readie receptacle of all euils: It is then a miſerie (and miſerable are all that do it) to trouble our life with the care and feare of death, and our death with the care of life.</p>
               <p>But to ſay the truth, what complaints and murmuring would there be againſt nature, if death were not, if we ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> haue continued heere will we, nill we, with and againſt our owne wils? doubtleſſe men would haue curſed nature for it.

What were it on the other ſide, if there were not mingled with death ſome little bitterneſſe? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men would runne vnto it with great deſire and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. To keepe therefore a moderation, that is, that men might neither loue life too much, nor flie it, feare death, nor runne after it, both of them, ſweetnes and ſharpnes, are therein tempered together.</p>
               <p>The remedie that the vulgar ſort do giue heerein, is too ſimple; and that is, neuer to thinke or ſpeake thereof: Beſides <note place="margin">10 <hi>Remedies not to feare death.</hi>
                  </note> that ſuch a kind of careleſnes cannot lodge in the head of a man of vnderſtanding, it would likewiſe at the laſt coſt him deere: for death comming vnawares, and vnexpected, what torments, outcryes, furies and diſpaires are there commonlie ſeene? Wiſdome aduiſeth much better, that is, to attend and expect death with a conſtant foot, and to encounter it: and the better to do this, it giueth vs contrarie counſell to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſort, that is, to haue it alwaies in our thoughts, to practiſe it, to accuſtome our ſelues vnto it, to tame it, to preſent it vnto vs at all houres, to expect it, not only in places ſuſpected and dangerous, but in the middeſt of feaſts and ſports: that the burthen of our ſong be, <hi>Remember thy end;</hi> that others are dead, that thought to haue liued as long as our ſelues; that, that which hapned then to them may happen now to vs; following heerein the cuſtome of the Egyptians, who in their ſolemne banquets placed the image of death before their eies; and of the Chriſtians and all other, who haue their Church-yards neere their temples, and other publike and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented places, that men might alwaies (as ſaith <hi>Licurgus)</hi> be put in mind of death. It is vncertaine in what place death at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends vs, and therefore let vs attend death in all places, and be alwaies readie to receiue it.</p>

The complaint of the vulgar ſort, who meaſure all by the ell, and account no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pretious, but that which is long, and durable, whereas contrarily, things exquiſite and excellent are commonly thin, fine, and delicate.

Life is meaſured by the end, prouided that that be good, and all the reſt hath a proportion thereunto: the quantitie is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make it more or leſſe happie, no more than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a circle makes the circle more round than the leſſe; the figure heere doth all: A little man is as perfect a man as a greater: Neither men nor their liues are meaſured by the ell.</p>
               <p>Againe, it troubleth them to die farre from their friends, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or to be ſlaine, and to remaine vnburied: they deſire to die in peace, in their beds, amongſt their friends, being comforted by them &amp; comforting them. All they that follow the warres, and ride poſt to be in the battell, are not of this mind: theſe men runne willinglie to their end, and ſeeke a tombe amongſt the dead bodies of their enemies. Little children feare men when they are masked; diſcouer their faces, and they feare them no more: And euen ſo beleeue it, fire and ſword aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs, when we thinke of them; take off their maske, the death wherewith they threaten vs, is but the ſame death wherewith women and children die.</p>
               <p>They are troubled to thinke they muſt leaue all the world. And why? They haue ſeene all, one day is like another, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is no other light, nor other night, nor other ſunne, nor other courſe of the world. One yeare telleth vs that all things grow euery yeare worſe and worſe, they haue ſeene the childhood, the youth, the virilitie, the old age of the world: there is no arte, no way to begin againe.</p>
               <p>Yea, but they leaue their parents and their friends. Where they go they ſhall find more, and ſuch as they haue neuer yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:16995:191"/>
ſeene, and they they leaue behind them and deſire ſo much ſhall ſhortly follow them.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall become of their ſmall children and orphans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> left without guide, without ſupport? As if thoſe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were more theirs than Gods, or as if they could loue them more than he that is their firſt and their trueſt father; and how many ſuch ſo left haue riſen to higher place and greater abilitie than other men?</p>
               <p>But it may be they feare to go alone. This is great ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſo many people dying with them, and at the ſelfe-ſame houre.</p>
               <p>Finallie, they go into a place where they ſhall not deſire this life. How deſire it? If it were lawfull to reſume it, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> would refuſe it; and if a man were worthie to know what it is before he receiueth it, he would neuer accept of it, <hi>vitam nemo acciperet, ſi daretur ſcientibus.</hi> Why, or how ſhould they deſire it, ſince they are either wholly nothing as miſcreants beleeue, or in farre better ſtate than before, as the wiſeſt of the world do affirme? Why then are they offended with death, ſince it quits them of all griefe? The ſelfe-ſame iourney they haue made from death, that is to ſay, from nothing to life, without paſſion, without feare, they make againe from life vnto death; <hi>reuerti vnde veneris, quid graue eſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be that the ſpectacle of death diſpleaſeth them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> becauſe they that die looke gaſtlie. It is true, but this is not death, but the maske of death, that which is hid vnder it, is very beautifull, for death hath nothing in it that is fearefull: we haue ſent idle and poore ſpies to know it, who report not what they haue ſeene, but what they haue heard, and what they feare.</p>
               <p>But it taketh out of our hands ſo many things, or rather ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs from them, and vs from our ſelues, it taketh vs from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> that we know, and haue been accuſtomed vnto, and bringeth vs to an eſtate vnknowne, <hi>at horremus ignota,</hi> it taketh vs from the light, to bring vs into darknes; and to conclude, it is our end, our ruine, our diſſolution. Theſe are the weightieſt obiections: whereunto in a word a man may anſwere, that death being the ineuitable law of nature (as ſhall be ſaid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) we neede not diſpute ſo much thereof, for it is a follie to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:16995:191"/>
feare that which a man cannot auoid. <hi>Dementis eſt timere mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, quia certa expectantur, dubia metuuntur, mors habet neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem aequam &amp; inuictam.</hi> But theſe kind of people make not their count well, for it is quite contrarie to that which they ſay, for in ſteed of taking any thing from vs, it giueth vs all; in ſtead of taking vs from our ſelues, it ſets vs in libertie, and makes vs free to our ſelues; in ſteed of bringing vs into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, it taketh it from vs, and puts vs into the light; and it doth the ſame to vs, that we do to all fruits, ſpoyling them of their barks, their ſhells, their foldings, their ſperes, their skinnes, to bring them into ſight, vſe, nature; <hi>ita ſolet ſieri, pereunt ſemper velamenta naſcentium;</hi> it taketh vs from a ſtrait, incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, rumatike darke place, where we ſee but a ſmall part of the heauens, and the light but afarre off, through the two narrow holes of our eyes, to bring vs into an open libertie, an aſſured health, a perpetuall light, into ſuch a place, ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, where we may wholly ſee the whole heauens, and the light in his naturall place; <hi>aequaliter tibi ſplendebit omne caeli la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, totam lucem ſuo loco propè totus aſpicies quam nunc per angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſſimas oculorum vias procul intueris &amp; miraris.</hi> To conclude, it taketh vs from that death, which began in the wombe of our mother, and now endeth, to bring vs to that life which ſhall neuer end. <hi>Dies iste quem tanquam extremum reformidas, aeterni natalis eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond maner of the cariage of man in this matter of <note place="margin">12 2 <hi>To attend death it is good.</hi>
                  </note> death, is of a good, ſweete, and moderate ſoule, and is iuſtly practiſed in a common and peaceable life, by thoſe that with reaſon account of this condition of life, and content themſelues to indure it, but gouerning themſelues according to reaſon, and accepting of death when it commeth. This is a well tempered mediocritie, ſutable to ſuch a condition of life, betweene the extremities (which are to deſire and feare, to ſeeke and to flie, vitious and faultie, <hi>ſummum ne metuas diem, nec optes (mortem concupiſcentes, &amp; timentes aequè obiurgat Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus)</hi> if they be not couered and excuſed by ſome reaſon not common and ordinarie, as ſhall be ſaid in his place. To ſeeke and deſire death is ill; it is iniuſtice to deſire death without a cauſe, and to be out of charitie with the world, which our liues may be beneficiall vnto. It is to be vnthankfull to nature to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:16995:192"/>
contemne it, and not to make the beſt vſe thereof; to be ouer anxious and ſcrupulous, and not to endure that eſtate that is not burthenſome, and wee are called vnto. To flie and feare death on the other ſide, is againſt nature, reaſon, iuſtice, and all dutie.</p>
               <p>For to die is a thing naturall, neceſſarie, and ineuitable, iuſt <note place="margin">13 <hi>Death is naturall.</hi>
                  </note> and reaſonable; Naturall, for it is a part of the order of the whole Vniuerſe, &amp; of the life of the world: wilt thou then that the world be ruinated, and a new made for thy ſelfe? Death holdeth a high place in the policie &amp; great common-wealth of the world, and it is very profitable for the ſucceſſion and continuance of the workes of nature: the fading or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one life, is the paſſage to a thouſand others: <hi>Sicrerum ſumma nouatur.</hi> And it is not only a part of this great whole Vniuerſe, but of our particular eſſence, not leſſe eſſential than to liue, to be borne. In flying death, thou flieſt thy ſelfe; thy eſſence is equally parted into theſe two, life and death, it is the condition of thy creation. If it grieueth thee to die, why wert thou borne? Men come not into the world with any other purpoſe but to goe foorth againe, and therefore he that is not willing to goe foorth, let him not come in. The firſt day of thy birth bindeth thee, and ſetteth thee as well in the way to deat, as to life.</p>
               <q>

                     <hi>Naſeentes morimur ſiniſque ab origine pendet.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sola mors ius aequum est generis humani, viuere noluit qui mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non vult, vita cum exceptione mortis data est, tam ſtultus qui timet mortem, quàm qui ſenectutem.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>To be vnwilling to die, is to be vnwilling to be a man, for all men are mortall, and therefore a wiſe man ſaid, and that without paſſion, hauing receiued newes of the death of his ſonne; I knew I begot, and bred him vp a mortall man. Death being then a thing ſo naturall and eſſentiall, both for the world in groſſe, and forthy ſelf in particular, why ſhould it be horrible vnto thee? Thou goeſt againſt nature, the feare of griefe and paine is naturall, but not of death: for being ſo ſeruiceable to nature, and nature hauing inſtituted it, to what end ſhould it imprint in vs a hatred and horror there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Children and beaſts feare not death, yea many times they ſuffer it cheerefully: it is not then nature that teacheth
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:16995:192"/>
vs to feare it, but rather to attend and receiue it, as being ſent by it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is neceſſarie, fatale, ineuitable; and this thou knoweſt that feareſt and weepeſt. What greater follie can <note place="margin">14 <hi>Neceſſarie.</hi>
                  </note> there be, than for a man to torment himſelfe for nothing, and that willingly and of purpoſe, to pray and importune him, whom he knowes to bee inexorable; to knocke at that dore that cannot be opened? What is there more inexorable and deafe than death? Wee muſt therefore feare things vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, doe our beſt endeuours in things that are not remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; but ſuch as are certaine, as death, we muſt attend, and grow reſolute in things paſt remedie. The ſot feareth and fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death, the foole ſeekes it and runs after it; the wiſe man attendeth it: It is follie to grieue at that, that cannot be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; to feare that, that cannot be auoided; <hi>Feras non culpes, quod vitari non potest.</hi> The example of <hi>Dauid</hi> is excellent, who vnderſtanding of the death of his deare childe, put on his beſt apparell, and made himſelfe merry, ſaying to thoſe that wondered at this kinde of carriage, that whileſt his ſon liued, he importuned God for his recouerie, but being dead, that care was ended, and there was no remedie. The foole thinks he maketh a better anſwer to ſay, that that is the cauſe of his griefe, and that he tormenteth himſelfe, becauſe there is no remedie; but he doubleth and perfecteth his owne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thereby, <hi>Scienter fruſtra niti extremae dementiae eſt.</hi> Now death being ſo neceſſarie and ineuitable, it is not only to no purpoſe to feare, but making of neceſſitie a vertue, wee muſt welcome it and receiue it kindely; for it is better for vs to goe to death, than that death ſhould come to vs, to catch that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that catch vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to die is a thing reaſonable and iuſt, it is reaſon to <note place="margin">15 Iust and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

It is reaſon that thou giue place to others, ſince others haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen place to thee: If thou haue made thy commoditie of this life, thou muſt be ſatisfied and be gone, as he that is inuited to a banquet takes his refection and departeth. If thou haue not knowen how to make vſe and profit thereof, what needeſt
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:16995:193"/>
thou care, if thou loſe it, or to what end wouldeſt thou keepe it? It is a debt that muſt be paid, a pawne that muſt bee reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whenſoeuer it is demanded. Why pleadeſt thou againſt thy own ſchedule, thy faith, thy duty? It is then againſt reaſon to ſpurne againſt death, ſince that thereby thou acquiteſt thy ſelfe of ſo much, and diſchargeſt thy ſelfe of ſo great an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. It is a thing generall and common to all to die, why then troubleſt thou thy ſelfe? Wilt thou haue a new priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that was yet neuer ſeene, and bee a lone man by thy ſelfe? Why feareſt thou to goe whither all the world goeth, where ſo many millions are gone before thee, and ſo many millions ſhall follow thee? Death is equally certaine to all, and equallity is the firſt part of equity, <hi>omnes eodem cogimur: om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium verſatur vrna: ſerius ocyus ſors exitura, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is the part of a valiant and generous minde, which is practiſed with reaſon, in a publike, eleuated, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, <note place="margin">16 <hi>To contemne death is good, if it be for a thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues it.</hi>
                  </note> and buſie condition of life, where there are many things to be preferred before life, and for which a man ſhould not doubt to die. In ſuch a caſe howſoeuer matters go a man muſt more account thereof than of his life, which is placed vpon the ſtage and ſcaffold of this world: hee muſt runne his race with reſolution, that he may giue a luſtre to his other actions, and performe thoſe things that are profitable and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Hee muſt lay downe his life, and let it runne his fortune. He that knoweth not how to contemne death, ſhall neuer not only performe any thing of worth, but he expoſeth himſelfe to diuers dangers; for whileſt he goeth about to keepe his life ſafe and ſure, hee laieth open and hazardeth his deuoire, his honour, his vertue and honeſtie. The contempt of death is that which produceth the boldeſt, and moſt honourable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits whether in good or euill. Hee that feareth not to die, feares nothing: he doth whatſoeuer he will, hee makes him-himſelfe a maſter both of his owne life, and of anothers: the contempt of death is the true and liuely ſource of all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and generous actions of men: from hence are deriued the braue reſolutions and free ſpeeches of vertue vttered by ſo many great perſonages. <hi>Fluidius Priſcus</hi> whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> had commanded not to come to the ſenat, or comming, to ſpeake as he would haue him, anſwered, That
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:16995:193"/>
as he was a Senator it was fit he ſhould be at the Senate; and if being there he were required to giue his aduice, he would ſpeake freely that which his conſcience commaunded him. Being threatned by the ſame man, that if he ſpake he ſhould die; Did I euer tell you (ſaith he) that I was immortall? Do you what you will, and I will do what I ought: It is in your power to put me vniuſtlie to death, and in me to die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantlie. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being threatned much hard dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if they did not ſpeedily yeeld themſelues to <hi>Philip</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was entred into their countrie with a great power; one for the reſt anſwered, What hard dealing can they ſuffer that feare not to die? And being told by the ſame <hi>Philip</hi> that he would breake and hinder all their deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; What, ſay they, will he likewiſe hinder vs from dying? Another being asked by what meanes a man may liue free, anſwered, By contemning death. And another youth being taken and ſold for a ſlaue, ſaid to him that bought him, Thou ſhalt ſee what thou haſt bought, I were a foole to liue a ſlaue whileſt I may be free, and whileſt he ſpake caſt himſelf down from the top of the houſe. A wiſe man ſaid vnto another, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating with himſelfe how he might take away his life to free himſelfe from an euil that at that time preſſed him ſore, Thou doeſt not deliberate of any great matter: it is no great thing to liue, thy ſlaues, thy beaſts do liue, but it is a great matter to die honeſtlie, wiſely, conſtantly. To conclude and crowne this article, our religion hath not had a more firme and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red foundation, and wherein the authour thereof hath more inſiſted, than the contempt of this life. But many there are that make a ſhew of contemning death, when they feare it. Many there are that care not to be dead, yea they wiſh they were dead, but it greeueth them to die. <hi>Emori nolo, ſed me eſſe mortuum nihili astimo.</hi> Many deliberate in their health and ſoundeſt iudgements to ſuffer death with conſtancie, nay to murther themſelues, a part played by many, &amp; for which end <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> made many ſumptuous preparations; but being come to the point, ſome wer terrified by the bleeding of their noſe, as <hi>Lucius Domitius,</hi> who repented that he had poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe. Others haue turned away their eyes and their thoughts, as if they would ſteale vpon it, ſwallowing it downe
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16995:194"/>
inſenſiblie as men take pilles, according to that ſaying of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> that the beſt death was the ſhorteſt; and of <hi>Plinie,</hi> that a ſhort death was the happieſt houre of a mans life. Now no man can be ſaid to be reſolute to die, that feareth to confront it, and to ſuffer with his eyes open, as <hi>Socrates</hi> did, who had thirtie whole daies to ruminate and to digeſt the ſentence of his death, which he did without any paſſion or alteration, yea without any ſhew of endeuor, mildly and cheerfullie. <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Atticus, Tullius Marcellinus,</hi> Romans, <hi>Cleantes</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, all three almoſt after one maner: for hauing aſſayed to die by abſtinence, hoping thereby to quit themſelues of thoſe maladies that did torment them, but finding themſelues rather cured thereby, neuertheleſſe they would not deſiſt till they had ended that they went about, taking pleaſure by little and little to pine away, and to conſider the courſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of death. <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> hauing prepared all things fit for their death, vpon the very point of the execution ſetled themſelues to ſleepe, and ſlept profoundly, being no more aſtoniſhed at death, than at any other ordinarie and light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the part of a valiant and reſolute mind, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in former times by great and holie perſonages, and that <note place="margin">17 <hi>To deſire death.</hi>
                  </note> in two caſes; the one the more naturall and lawfull is a painfull and troubleſome life, or an apprehenſion of a far worſe death: To be briefe, a miſerable eſtate which a man cannot remedie. This is to deſire death as the retrait and only hauen from the torments of this life, the ſoueraigne good of nature, the only ſtay and pillar of our libertie. It is imbecillitie to yeeld vnto euils, but it is follie to nouriſh them. It is a good time to die, when to liue is rather a burthen than a bleſſing, and there is more ill in life than good; for, to preſerue our life, to increaſe our torment, is againſt nature. There are ſome that ſay, that we ſhould deſire to die, to auoid thoſe pleaſures that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature; how much more then to flie thoſe miſeries that are againſt nature? There are many things in life farre worſe than death, for which we ſhould rather die and not liue at all, than liue. And therefore the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being cruelly threatned by <hi>Antipater,</hi> if they yeelded not to his demaund, anſwered, If thou threaten vs with any thing that is worſe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16995:194"/>
than death, death ſhall be welcome vnto vs. And the wiſeſt were woont to ſay, That a wiſe man liueth as long as he ſhould, not ſo long as he can, death being more at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and in his power, than life. Life hath but one entrance, and that too dependeth vpon the will of another. Our death dependeth on our owne willes, and the more voluntarie it is, the more honorable; and there are a thouſand waies vnto it. We may want meanes whereby to liue, but not to die. Life may be taken away from euery man by euery man, but not death, <hi>vbi<expan>

Wherefore complaineſt thou in this world? It holdeth thee not; if thou liue in paine, thy idlenes and feare is the cauſe; for to die, there is nothing neceſſarie, but a will.</p>
               <p>The other caſe is a liuely apprehenſion and deſire of the life to come, which maketh a man to thirſt after death, as after a great gaine, the ſeed of a better life, the bridge vnto para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the way to all good, and an earneſt pennie of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. A firme beleefe and hope of theſe things is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the feare and horror of death: it perſwadeth vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be wearie of this life, and to deſire death, <hi>vitam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere in patientia, &amp; mortem in deſiderio,</hi> to haue life in affliction, and death in affection: their life is a croſſe, their death a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and therefore their vowes and their voices are, <hi>cupio diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolui: mihi mors lucrum: quis me liberabit de corpore montis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius?</hi> And for this cauſe thoſe Philoſophers and Chriſtians haue been iuſtlie reproched (which is to be vnderſtood of thoſe that are weake and idle, and not of all) that play the publike diſſemblers, and do not in veritie beleeue that which they do ſo much talke of, and ſo highlie commend touching that happie immortalitie, and thoſe vnſpeakable pleaſures in the ſecond life, ſince they doubt, and feare death ſo much, the neceſſarie paſſage thereunto.</p>
               <p>The fift and laſt, is the execution of this precedent deſire, <note place="margin">18 <hi>To kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
                  </note> which is for a man to be his owne executioner, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of his owne death. This ſeemeth to proceed from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:16995:195"/>
and the greatnes of a mans courage, hauing been anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie practiſed by the greateſt and moſt excellent men and women of euerie nation and religion, <hi>Greekes, Romanes, Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Perſians, Medes, French, Indians,</hi> Philoſophers of all ſects, <hi>Iewes,</hi> witnes that good old man <hi>Razis,</hi> called the father of the <hi>Iewes</hi> for his vertue; and his wiues, who vnder <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> hauing circumciſed their children, caſt themſelues hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the rock with them: And Chriſtians too, witnes thoſe two canonized Saints, <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Sophronia,</hi> whereof the firſt, with his mother and ſiſters caſt himſelfe into the riuer, and the other killed hir ſelfe with a knife, to auoid the violence of <hi>Maxentius</hi> the Emperour: Yea witnes diuers people and whole cities, as <hi>Capona</hi> in <hi>Italy, Astupa, Numantia</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> beſieged by the <hi>Romans;</hi> the <hi>Abideens</hi> enforced by <hi>Philip,</hi> a citie in <hi>India</hi> beſieged by <hi>Alexander.</hi> But this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been likewiſe approued and authorized by many common-weales, by lawes and rules eſtabliſhed thereupon, as at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Cea;</hi> in <hi>Nigropont,</hi> and other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as in the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Ilands, and iuſtified by many great reaſons, drawne from the precedent article, which is of the iuſt deſire of death. For if it be permitted to deſire, to aske, to ſeeke after death, why ſhould it be an ill acte to giue it vnto our ſelues? If a mans owne death be iuſt in the will, why ſhould it not be as iuſt in the hand, and the execution? Why ſhould I expect that from another, which I can do my ſelfe? and why ſhould it not be better to giue it, than to ſuffer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue it; to meete, than to attend it? for the faireſt death is the more voluntarie. Finallie, I offend not the law made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theeues and robbers, when I take but my owne goods, and cut but my owne purſe; neither am I guiltie of the lawes made againſt murtherers by taking away my owne life. But this opinion is reproued by diuers, not only Chriſtians, but Iewes, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> diſputeth againſt his captaines in the caue <hi>du Puis:</hi> and Philoſophers, as <hi>Plato, Scipio,</hi> who held this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding not only for a vice of cowardlines and impatiencie, for it is for a man to hide himſelfe from the blowes of fortune. Now a true and liuely vertue muſt neuer yeeld, for euils and croſſes are nouriſhments thereunto, and it is greater conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie well to vſe the chaine wherewith we are tied, than to

               <p>But alſo for a fault of deſertion; for a man ought not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his charge without the expreſſe commaundement of him that gaue it him; we are not heere for our ſelues, nor our owne maſters. This then is not a matter beyond all doubt or diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>It is firſt beyond all doubt, that wee are not to attempt this laſt exploit without very great and iuſt cauſe (nay I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> ſee how any cauſe ſhould be great and iuſt enough) to the end that it be as they ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an honeſt and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable departure. It muſt not then be for any light occaſion, whatſoeuer ſome ſay, that a man may die for light cauſes, ſince they that hold vs in life are not weightie. It is ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to nature not to accept and vſe hir preſent, it is a ſigne of lightnes to be too anxious and ſcrupulous, to breake compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie for matters of no moment, and not for ſuch as are iuſt and lawfull, if there be any ſuch. And therefore they had not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient excuſe, and iuſt cauſe of their death of whom I made mention before, <hi>Pomponius Atticus, Marcellinus,</hi> and <hi>Cleantes,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who would not ſtay the courſe of their death, for this only reaſon, becauſe they were alreadie neere vnto it. The wiues of <hi>Petus,</hi> of <hi>Scaurus,</hi> of <hi>Labio,</hi> of <hi>Fuluius</hi> the friend of <hi>Augustus,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and diuers others, who died only to accompanie their husbands in death, or rather to encourage them therein. <hi>Cato</hi> and others, who died becauſe their buſineſſe ſucceeded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not well, and becauſe they would not fall into the hands of their enemies, notwithſtanding they feared no ill vſage at their hands. They that haue murthered themſelues becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they would not liue at the mercie, and by the grace and fauor of thoſe whom they hated, as <hi>Grauius Siluanius,</hi> and <hi>Statius Proximus,</hi> being pardoned by <hi>Nero.</hi> They that die to recouer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a ſhame and diſhonor paſt, as that Romane <hi>Lucretia, Sparza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pizes</hi> the ſonne of Queene <hi>Tomyris, Boges</hi> the Lieutenant of king <hi>Xerxes.</hi> They that for no particular cauſe, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> they ſee the weale-publike in a bad and declining eſtate
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:16995:196"/>
murther themſelues, as <hi>Nerua</hi> that great Lawyer, <hi>Vibius Vircus, Iubellius</hi> in the taking of <hi>Capona.</hi> They that are weary with liuing, or for priuate cauſes loath to liue any longer. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Neither is it ſufficient that the cauſe be great and iuſt, but that it be neceſſarie and remedileſſe, and that all maner of meanes to preſerue life be firſt put in practiſe. For precipitation and anticipated deſpaire is very vitious, as in <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who killing themſelues before the time and occaſion, loſt the reliques of the Romane libertie whereof they were prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. A man, ſaith <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> muſt manage his life, and make vſe thereof to the vttermoſt: for to take it away, a man neuer wants time, it is a remedie which he hath alwaies in his owne hands; but the ſtate of things may change and grow better. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and diuers others haue to their great benefit practiſed this counſell: things that ſeeme altogether deſperate, do many times change and haue a happie ſucceſſe; <hi>aliquis carnifici ſuo ſuperstes fuit.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>A man muſt carie himſelfe in his place and calling as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant againſt him that aſſaileth him, <hi>cum moderamine incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patae tutelae,</hi> he muſt trie all maner of meanes before he come to this extremitie. Secondly and without doubt it is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more commendable to ſuffer, and to continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and firme to the end, than fearefullie &amp; cowardlie to flie or die: but foraſmuch as it is a gift not giuen vnto all no more than continencie is, <hi>non omnes capiunt verbum istud, vnde me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius nubere quam vri:</hi> the queſtion is, whether an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and remedileſſe euill hapning, which may vtterlie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe and turne topſy-turuie our whole reſolution, and driue vs into deſpaire, deſpite and murmuring againſt God, it be more expedient, or a leſſe euill for a man couragiouſlie to deliuer himſelfe, hauing his ſenſes ſound and ſetled, than by ſtanding to it, for feare of failing in his dutie, expoſe himſelfe to the danger of ſinking and being vtterly loſt. It is not a leſſe euill to quit the place, than to be obſtinate and periſh, to flie, than to be taken. It is true that it ſeemeth by all humane and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſoph call reaſon to be practiſed, as hath been ſaid, by ſo many famous people of all countries and climats. But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:16995:196"/>
doth no way approue it, nor alloweth therein any diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is a great point of wiſdome to learne to know the point and period, to chuſe a fit houre to die: Euery man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hath his time and ſeaſon to die; ſome preuent it, others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long it: there is weakeneſſe and valour in them both, but there is required diſcretion. How many men haue ſuruiued their glorie, and by a deſire to lengthen their life but a little, haue darkened it againe, and liued to helpe bury their owne honour? And that which laſtly ſticketh by them, hath no reliſh or feeling of what is paſt, but continueth like an old fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie clout ſowed to the hemme of a rich and beautifull orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is a time to gather fruit from the tree, which if it hang too long, it rotteth and growes worſe and worſe; and the loſſe is as great too, if it bee gathered too ſoone. Many ſaints and holy men haue fled from death, becauſe they are yet profitable to the church and weale-publike, though in reſpect of their owne particular they could be content to die. It is an act of charitie to deſire to liue for the benefit of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Si populo tuo ſum neceſſarius, non recuſo laborem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Death hath diuers formes, ſome more eaſie than other, and <note place="margin">21 <hi>Formes of deaths di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</hi>
                  </note> taketh diuers qualities according to the fantaſie of euery one. Among thoſe that are naturall they that proceed from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and a numneſſe of the members, are the ſweeteſt and the eaſieſt: among thoſe that are violent, the beſt is the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, &amp; the leaſt premeditated. Some deſire to make an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie and demonſtratiue death of conſtancie and ſufficiencie; this is to conſider another thing, and to ſeeke their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: but this is vanitie, for this is no act of ſocietie, but of one only perſon, who hath enough to doe with himſelfe, to miniſter to himſelfe inward comfort, and hath no neede to trouble himſelfe with what belongeth to another, eſpecially all the intereſt hee hath in his reputation, ceaſing with his death. That is the beſt death which is well recollected in it ſelfe, quiet, ſolitarie, and attendeth wholly to that, which at that time is fitteſt. That great aſſiſtance of parents &amp; friends, bringeth a thouſand diſcommodities, it oppreſſeth and ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth him that is dying, one tormenteth his eares, another his eies, another his mouth; their cries and complaints, if they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:16995:197"/>
be true, ſtifle the heart; if fained, afflict and torment it. Many great perſonages haue ſought to die farre from their friends, to auoide this inconuenience, accounting it a childiſh thing, and a fooliſh humour, to be willing by their miſeries to moue ſorrow and compaſſion in their friends; wee commend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie to ſuffer bad fortune, wee accuſe and hate it in our friends, and when it is our owne caſe, it is not ſufficient that they ſuffer with vs, but they muſt afflict themſelues too: A wiſe man that is ſicke, ſhould content himſelfe with the ſetled countenance of his aſſiſtants.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe tranquillitie of the ſpirit is the ſouereigne good of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> man. This is that great and rich treaſure, which the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſeeke by ſea and by land, on foote and a horſebacke; all our care ſhould tend thereunto, it is the fruit of all our labors and ſtudies, the crowne of wiſdome. But leſt a man ſhould miſtake himſelfe heerein, you muſt know that this tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is not a retrait or vacation from all affaires, a delightfull ſolitarineſſe and corporally pleaſant, or a profound careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all things: if it were ſo, many women, idle, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and voluptuous perſons, would at their pleaſure enioy as great a good, as the wiſeſt can aſpire vnto with all their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: Neither multitude nor ſcarſitie of buſineſſe doth any thing heerein. It is a beautifull, ſweete, equall, iuſt, firme and pleaſant eſtate of the ſoule, which neither buſineſſe nor idleneſſe, nor good accidents, nor ill, nor time can any way trouble, alter, mend, or depreſſe; <hi>Vera tranquillitas non concuti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meanes to attaine thereunto, to get and preſerue it, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the points that I haue handled in this ſecond booke, whereof this is a briefe collection. They conſiſt in freeing and disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of a man from all lets and impediments, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with thoſe things that entertaine and preſerue it. The things that doe moſt hinder and trouble the reſt and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the ſpirit, are common and vulgar opinions, which for the moſt part are erroneous; and ſecondly deſires and paſſions, which ingender in vs a kinde of delicacy and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:16995:197"/>
which are the cauſe that a man is neuer content, and theſe are kindled and ſtirred in him by thoſe two contrary fortunes, proſperity and aduerfity, as with two violent and mighty winds: and finally that vile and baſe captiuity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſpirit (that is to ſay, the iudgement and will) is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled like a beaſt vnder the yoke of certaine locall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rules and opinions. Now he muſt emancipate and free himſelfe from theſe ſtockes and vniuſt ſubiections, and bring his ſpirit into libertie, reſtore himſelfe to himſelfe, free, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, open, ſeeing into all, and wandring through the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and vniuerſall circuit of the world and of nature. <hi>In commune genitus mundum vt vnam domum ſpectans toti ſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens mundo, &amp; in omnes eius actus contemplationem ſuam mittens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The place being thus trimmed and made ready, the firſt foundations that are to be laid, are a true honeſty, and to liue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in ſuch an eſtate and vocation whereunto a man is fit. The principall parts wherwith he muſt raiſe, aſſure, and ſettle this building, are firſt true piety, whereby, with a ſoule not aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but ſetled, pure, free, deuout, a man contemplateth God, the great, ſoueraigne, and abſolute work-maſter of all things, who can neither be ſeene nor knowen: but yet he muſt be knowen, adored, worſhipped, ſerued with the whole heart, from whom he is to hope for all maner of good, and to feare no euill: afterwards he muſt walke roundly in ſimplicity and truth, according to the lawes and cuſtomes, liue with a heart open both to the eies of God and the world, <hi>Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſuam aperiens ſemperque tanquam in publico viuens, ſe magis veritus, quàm alios.</hi> Againe hee muſt keepe in himſelfe and with others, and generally in all things, in his thoughts, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, deſignments, actions, a moderation the mother or nurſe of tranquillity, laying aſide all pompe and vanity, rule his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, content himſelfe with a mediocrity and ſufficiency, <hi>quod ſit eſſe velit, nihil<expan>

It is an opinion iuſtly receiued, that we ought not to iudge of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, nor of the ſufficiencie and capacitie of perſons by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents. And therefore one anſwered thoſe well that maruelled and were aſtoniſhed at the ill ſucceſſe of their buſineſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with how wiſe and mature deliberation they were vndertaken, That they were maſters of their deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, not of the ſucceſſe of their affaires: for that was in the power of fortune, which ſeemeth to ſport it ſelfe with all our faireſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments &amp; counſels, ouerthroweth in a moment that which hath a long time been proiected and deliberated, and ſeemeth to be ſtrongly fortified, choking, as they ſay, our artillarie. And indeed fortune to ſhew it authoritie in all things, and to abate our preſumption, not being able to make men wiſe, that are not apt thereunto, maketh them neuertheleſſe happie in deſpite of vertue, whereby it many times comes to paſſe, that ſimple men bring to a happie end great matters both publike and priuate. Prudence then is a ſea without either bottome or brinke, and which cannot be limited and preſcribed by precepts and aduiſements. It doth but compaſſe things and goeth about them, like a darke cloude, many times vaine and friuolous.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe it is of ſuch weight and neceſſitie, that alone and of it ſelfe it can do much, and without it all the reſt is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <note place="margin">6 <hi>Neceſſarie.</hi> Horat. 3. od.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:16995:200"/>
for it doth not more willinglie ſet it ſelfe againſt any, than againſt thoſe that would contemne it. Now Prudence is the arte to handle it, and a gentle bridle, that holdeth it within <note place="margin">Xenoph. in poedag.</note> the compaſſe of obedience.</p>
                     <p>Now though the ſeed of Prudence, as of other vertues, be in vs by nature, yet it is acquired and learnt more than any <note place="margin">7 <hi>The acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</hi>
                        </note> other, and that in ſome ſort by precepts and aduiſements; this is the Theorick: but much better and principally (though with more time) by experience and practiſe, which is two-fold: the one, and the true, is that which is proper and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, whereof it takes the name; this is the knowledge of thoſe things which we haue ſeene and handled: the other is ſtrange by the acte of another; this is hiſtorie which we know by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or by reading. Now experience and vſe is more firme and more aſſured; <hi>vſus efficaciſſimus omnium rerum magister,</hi> the father and miſtris of the artes, but more long; it is old, <hi>ſeris venit vſus ab annis,</hi> more difficult, painefull, rare. The knowledge of hiſtorie, as it is leſſe firme and aſſured, ſo is it more eaſie, more frequent, open and common to all. A man is made more reſolute and aſſured at his owne charges, but it is more eaſie at the charge of another. Now from theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, Experience, and Hiſtorie, doth Prudence ariſe, <hi>vſus me genuit, mater peperit memoria, ſeu memoriae anima &amp; vita hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Prudence may and muſt be diuerſlie diſtinguiſhed <note place="margin">8 <hi>The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                        </note> according to the perſons and the affaires. In regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there is priuate prudence, whether it be ſolitarie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduall, which can hardlie be tearmed prudence; or ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able &amp; Economical among a ſmall companie, and prudence publike and politike. This more high, excellent, difficult, and vnto which thoſe foreſaid qualities do properlie belong; and it is two-fold, peaceable, and militarie.</p>
                     <p>In regard of the affaires, foraſmuch as they are of two ſorts, the one ordinarie, eaſie; the other extraordinarie. Theſe are accidents which bring with them ſome new difficultie and ambiguitie. A man may likewiſe ſay that there is an ordinarie and eaſie prudence, which walketh according to the lawes, cuſtomes, and courſe alreadie eſtabliſhed, another extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and more difficult.</p>

There is likewiſe another diſtinction of prudence both in reſpect of the perſons, and of the affaires, which concerneth <note place="margin">Heſiod. Liuius. Cicero.</note> rather the degrees, than the kindes thereof, that is to ſay, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per prudence whereby a man is wiſe, and taketh counſell of himſelfe; the other borowed, whereby a man followeth the counſell of another. The wiſe ſay that there are two ſorts and degrees of wiſe men; the firſt and chiefeſt is of thoſe that haue a cleere inſight into all things, and know of themſelues how to finde the remedies and helps; but where are theſe to be found? Doubtleſſe they are rare and ſingular: the other is of thoſe that know how to take, to follow, to make vſe of the good counſels of another; for they that know neither how to giue, nor to take counſell, are fooles.</p>
                     <p>The generall and common aduiſements, which belong to all ſorts of prudence, all ſorts of perſons and affaires, hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> beene touched and briefly deliuered in the ſecond booke, and they are eight; firſt, knowledge of the perſons and affaires; ſecondly, eſtimation of things; thirdly, choice and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <note place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> fourthly, from them to take counſell vpon all; fiftly, temperature betweene feare and aſſurance, confidence and diffidence; ſixtly, to take all things in their ſeaſon, and to ſeaſe vpon the occaſion; ſeuenthly, to carrie himſelfe well, with induſtrie and fortune; laſtly, diſcretion in all.

                        <hi>Of the politike prudence of a ſouereigne to gouerne ſtates.</hi> THE PREFACE.</head>
                     <p>THis doctrine belongeth to ſouereignes and gouernours of ſtates. It is vncertaine, infinite, difficult, and almoſt impoſſible to be ranged into order, to be limited and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by rules and precepts: but wee muſt endeuour to giue ſome ſmall light, and briefe inſtruction thereof. Wee may referre this whole doctrine to two principall heads, which are the two duties of a ſouereigne. The one comprehendeth and intreateth of the props and pillars of a ſtate, principall &amp;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:16995:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eſſentiall parts of publike gouernment, as the bones and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of this great bodie, to the end that a ſouereigne may prouide for himſelfe and his ſtate; which are ſeuen principall, that is to ſay, knowledge of the ſtate; vertue; maners and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions; counſels; treaſure; forces and armes; alliances. The three firſt are in the perſon of the ſouereigne, the fourth in him and neere him, the three latter without him. The other is to act, well to employ and to make vſe of the aforeſaid meanes, that is to ſay, in groſſe, and in a word, well to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and maintaine himſelfe in authoritie, and the loue both of his ſubiects and of ſtrangers, but diſtinctly; this part is twofold, peaceable and militarie. Behold heere ſummarily and groſſely the worke cut out, and the firſt great draughts that are to be handled heereafter. We will diuide then this politicke matter, and of ſtate, into two parts; the firſt ſhall be of prouiſion, that is to ſay, of the ſeuen neceſſarie things; the ſecond, and which preſuppoſeth the firſt, ſhall be of the action of the prince. This matter is excellently handled by <hi>Lipſius,</hi> according as he thought good: the marrow of his booke is heere: I haue not taken, nor wholly followed his method, nor his order, as you may already ſee in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall diuiſion, and more you ſhall heereafter: I haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe left ſomewhat of his, and added ſomething of my owne, and other mens.</p>

                     <head>The firſt part of this politicke prudence and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſtate, which is of prouiſion.</head>
                     <p>THe firſt thing that is required before all others, is the knowledge of the ſtate: for the firſt rule of all prudence <note place="margin">1 <hi>The chiefe point of this prouiſion, to know the ſtate.</hi>
                        </note> conſiſteth in knowledge, as hath beene ſaid in the ſecond booke. The firſt in all things, is to know with whom a man hath to deale. For in as much as this ruling and moderating prudence of ſtates, which is a knowledge and ſufficiency to gouerne in publike, is a thing relatiue, which is handled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſouereigne and the ſubiects; the firſt dutie and office thereof is in the knowledge of the two parts, that is, of the people, and the ſouereigntie, that is to ſay, of the ſtate.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:16995:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt then the humours and natures of the people muſt bee knowne. This knowledge formeth, and giueth aduice vnto him that ſhould gouerne them. The nature of the people in generall, hath beene deſcribed at large in the firſt booke, (light, inconſtant, mutinous, vaine, a louer of nouelties, fierce and inſupportable in proſperitie, cowardly and deiected in aduerſitie) but it muſt likewiſe be knowne in particular: ſo many cities and perſons, ſo many diuers humours. There are people cholericke, audacious, warriers, fearefull, giuen to wine, ſubiect to women, ſome more than others, <hi>noſcenda natura vulgi eſt, &amp; quibus modis temperanter habeatur.</hi> And in this ſenſe is that ſaying of the wiſe to be vnderſtood: He that hath not obeied, cannot tell how to command; <hi>nemo bene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat, niſi qui ante paruerit imperio.</hi> Not becauſe ſoueraignes <note place="margin">Senec.</note> ſhould or can alwaies take vpon them the name of ſubiects; for many are borne kings and princes: and many ſtates are ſucceſſiue: but that he that wil wel command, ſhould acquaint himſelfe with the humors and willes of his ſubiects, as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were of their ranke, and in their place. He muſt likewiſe know the nature of the ſtate, not only in generall, ſuch as it hath beene deſcribed, but in particular that which hee hath now in hand, the forme, eſtabliſhment, birth thereof; that is to ſay, whether it be old or new, fallen by ſucceſſion, or by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, obtained by the lawes, or by armes, of what extent it is, what neighbours, meanes, power it hath. For according to theſe and other circumſtances, hee muſt diuerſlie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the ſcepter, looſe and ſtraiten the raines of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>After this knowledge of the ſtate, which is as a preamble, <note place="margin">2 <hi>The ſecond head of this prouiſion is vertue.</hi>
                        </note> the firſt of thoſe things that are required, is vertue, neceſſary in a ſoueraigne, as well for himſelfe as for the ſtate. It is firſt neceſſary and conuenient that hee that is aboue all ſhould bee better than all, according to the ſaying of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And then it ſtandeth him vpon for his credit and reputation. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame and report gathereth and ſpreadeth abroad the ſpeeches and actions of him that gouerneth. Hee is in the eie of all, and can no more hide himſelfe than the ſun: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what good or ill ſoeuer he doth, ſhall not want meanes to blaſen it, ſhall bee talked of enough. And it importeth him
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:16995:202"/>
much, both in reſpect of himſelfe and his ſtate, that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects haue a good opinion of him. Now a ſoueraigne ought not only in himſelfe, and in his life and conuerſation to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, but he muſt likewiſe endeuour that his ſubiects be like vnto himſelfe. For as all the wiſeſt of the world haue euer taught, a ſtate, a city, a company cannot long continue nor <note place="margin">Saluſt. ad Caeſar.</note> proſper where vertue is baniſhed; and they do groſly aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, who thinke that princes are ſo much the more aſſured in their ſtates, by how much the more wicked their ſubiects are, becauſe, ſay they, they are more proper and as it were borne to ſeruitude and the yoke, <hi>patientiores ſeruitutis, quos</hi>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe example preſſeth more than law. It is a mute law which carieth more credit than a commaund, <hi>nec tam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio</hi>

Vertue then is honorable and profitable in a ſoueraigne, yea, all vertue.</p>
                     <p>But eſpeciallie and aboue all, Pietie, Iuſtice, Valour, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie. Theſe are the foure principall and princely vertues <note place="margin">3 <hi>Eſpecially</hi> 4. <hi>vertues.</hi>
                        </note> in principalitie. And therefore that great Prince <hi>Augustus</hi> was wont to ſay, that Pietie and Iuſtice did deifie Princes. And <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, that clemencie agreeth better with a Prince, than any other. The pietie of a ſoueraigne conſiſteth in his care for the maintenance and preſeruation of religion, as the protector thereof. This maketh for his owne honor, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of himſelfe: for they that feare God, dare not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nay thinke of any thing either againſt their Prince, who is the image of God vpon earth, or againſt the ſtate. For
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:16995:202"/>
as <hi>Lactantius</hi> doth many times teach, it is a religion that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth humane ſocietie, which cannot otherwiſe ſubſiſt, and would ſoone be filled with all maner of wickednes and ſauage cruelties, if the reſpect and feare of religion did not bridle men and keepe them in order. The ſtate of the Romans did increaſe, and flouriſh more by religion, ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelfe, than by all other meanes. Wherefore a Prince muſt take care and endeuor that religion be preſerued in it puritie, according to the ancient lawes and ceremonies of the countrie, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all innouation, and controuerſies therein, roughlie chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe that goe about to breake the peace thereof. For doubtleſſe change in religion, and a wrong done thereunto, draweth with it a change and declination in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <note place="margin">Dion.</note> as <hi>Mecenas</hi> well diſcourſeth to <hi>Augustus.</hi>

Curſed be the doctrine of thoſe, who teach (as hath beene ſaid) that all things are good and lawfull for ſoueraignes: but yet it is ſometimes neceſſarie and required, that he mingle profit with honeſtie, and that he enter into compoſition with both. He muſt neuer turne his back to honeſtie, but yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times goe about and coaſt it, employing therein his skill and cunning, which is good, honeſt and lawfull, as ſaith that great <hi>S.

To be brief, doing that cloſely which he may not do openly, ioyne wiſdome to valor, arte and ſpirit, where nature and the hand ſufficeth not; be, as <hi>Pindarus</hi> ſaith, a Lyon in his blowes, a Fox in his counſell; a Doue and a Serpent as diuine veritie ſpeaketh.</p>
                     <p>And to this matter more diſtinctly, there is required in a ſoueraigne diſtruſt, and that he keepe himſelfe cloſe, yet ſo, as <note place="margin">6 <hi>Diſtruſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Prince.</hi>
                        </note> that he be ſtill vertuous and iuſt. Diſtruſt, which is the firſt, is wholly neceſſary, as the contrary, which is credulitie; and a careleſſe truſt or confidence, is vitious, and very dangerous in a ſoueraigne. He watcheth ouer all, and muſt anſwere for all, his faults are not light, and therefore he muſt be well aduiſed. If he truſt much, he diſcouereth himſelfe, and is expoſed to ſhame, and many dangers, <hi>opportunus fit iniuriae,</hi> yea, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth ſuch as are falſe and treacherous, who may with little danger, and much recompence commit great wickedneſſe, <hi>aditum nocendi perfido praestat fides.</hi> It is neceſſary therefore <note place="margin">Senec.</note> that he couer himſelfe with this buckler of diſtruſt, which the wiſeſt haue thought to be a great part of prudence, and the ſinowes of wiſdome, that is to ſay, that he watch, beleeue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, take heed of all: and heereunto doth the nature of the <note place="margin">Epichar.

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:16995:204"/>
and dangerous, namely ſuch as are neere vnto him in the court and houſes of great perſonages. He muſt then truſt but few, and thoſe knowne by long experience and often tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: Neither is it neceſſarie that he abandon them, and in ſuch ſort leaue all the cord, that he ſtill hold it not by one end, and haue an eye vnto them: But he muſt couer and diſguiſe his diffidence, yea when he diſtruſteth, he muſt make a ſhew and countenance of great truſt and confidence. For open diſtruſt wrongeth, and inuiteth as much to deceiue, as an ouer-care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe confidence, and many by making too great a ſhew of feare to be deceiued, ſhew the way how they may be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <hi>Multi fallere docuerunt dum timent falli:</hi> as contrarily a profeſſed and open truſt, hath taken away the deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, <note place="margin">Senec.</note> hath obliged to loyaltie, and ingendred fidelitie; <hi>vult quiſque ſibi credi, &amp; habita fides ipſam plerumque obligat fidem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From diſtruſt comes diſſimulation the ſcience or ſeed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for if that were not, and that there were truſt and fidelitie <note place="margin">7 And diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> in all, diſſimulation which openeth the front, and couereth the thought, could haue no place. Now diſſimulation which is vitious in priuat perſons, is very neceſſarie in Princes, who otherwiſe could not know how to reigne, or well to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. And they muſt many times diſſemble not only in warre, with ſtrangers and enemies, but alſo in time of peace, and with their ſubiects, though more ſparinglie. Simple and open men, and ſuch as cary, as they ſay, their hearts in their foreheads, are not in any ſort fit for this myſterie of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and betray many times both themſelues and their ſtate: But yet he muſt play this part with arte and dexteritie, and to the purpoſe, neither ſo openly nor ſo ſimplie as that it may be diſcerned. For to what purpoſe doeſt thou hide and couer thy ſelfe, if a man may ſee thee obliquely or ſidewaies? Wilie deceipts and cunning ſubtilties, are no more deceits and ſubtilties when they are knowne and vented out. A Prince then the better to couer his arte, muſt make profeſſion of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſimplicitie, muſt make much of free and open minded men, as being enemies to diſſimulation; and in matters of leſſe importance he muſt proceed openly, to the end he may be taken for ſuch as he ſeemeth.</p>

it is likewiſe required ſometimes that he paſſe farther and come to action, and this is two-fold. The one is to make and frame ſecret practiſes and intelligences, cunningly to winne and draw vnto him the hearts and ſeruices either of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſeruants, and truſtieſt friends of other Princes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Lords, or of his owne ſubiects. This is a ſubtiltie which is much in requeſt and authoritie, and very common among Princes, and a great point of prudence, ſaith <hi>Cicero.</hi> It is wrought in ſome ſort by perſwaſion, but eſpeciallie by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and penſions, meanes ſo powerfull, that not only the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, the chiefe of the counſell, the moſt inward friends and fauorites, haue been thereby drawne to giue aduice, and to diuert the deſignments of their maſter, yea, great captaines to giue their helping hand in the warre, but alſo wiues haue beene woon to diſcouer the ſecrets of their husbands. Now this ſubtile policie is all allowed and approoued by many without difficultie or ſcruple. And to ſay the truth, if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an enemie, againſt a ſubiect whom he ſuſpecteth, and likewiſe againſt any ſtranger, with whom he hath no alliance nor league of fidelitie and amitie, it is not greatly to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But againſt his alliance, his friends and confederates, it cannot be good; and it is a kind of treacherie, which is neuer permitted.</p>
                     <p>The other is to winne ſome aduantage, and to obtaine his purpoſe, by cloſe and couert meanes, by equiuocations and <note place="margin">9 Subtilties.</note> ſubtilties, to circumuent by faire ſpeeches and promiſes, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ambaſſages, working and obtaining by ſubtile meanes, that which the difficultie of times and affaires will not permit him otherwiſe to doe, and to doe that cloſely which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe openly.

                        </note> alſo others, though leſſe worthie and neceſſarie, yet in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place very profitable, and requiſit in a ſoueraigne, that is to ſay, liberalitie, ſo fit and neceſſarie for a Prince, as it is leſſe befitting him to be vanquiſhed by armes, than by mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence. But yet there is heerein required a great diſcretion, otherwiſe it will be more hurtfull, than commodious.</p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold liberalitie, the one conſiſteth in charge and ſhew, and this ſerues to ſmall purpoſe. For it is an idle <note place="margin">Liberalitie two-fold.</note> thing in ſoueraignes, and to little end, to indeuor by great and exceſſiue charges to make ſhew of themſelues, or to increaſe their credit eſpeciallie with their ſubiects where they haue power to doe what they liſt. It is a teſtimonie of puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that they vnderſtand not what they are, and beſides that, it ſeemeth to their ſubiects, the ſpectators of theſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, that they make this glorious ſhew with their owne ſpoiles, that they feaſt it at their charges, that they feede their eyes with that, that ſhould feede their bellies. And againe a Prince ſhould thinke that he hath nothing properlie his: he oweth himſelfe to another. The other liberalitie, conſiſteth in gifts beſtowed vpon another, and this is farre more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and commendable, but then it muſt be well gouerned, and he muſt be well aduiſed to whom, how, and how much he muſt giue. He muſt giue to thoſe that haue deſerued it, that haue done ſeruice to the weale-publike, that haue runne their fortunes, and ſpent themſelues in the warres. No man will enuy them, if they be not very wicked. Whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, great gifts, beſtowed without reſpect and merit, ſhame the giuer, and purchaſe enuie to the receiuer, and is receiued
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:16995:207"/>
without thankfulneſſe and acknowledgement. Some tyrants haue been ſacrificed to the malice of the people, euen by thoſe whom they haue aduanced, railing on them with the reſt of the people, and ſecuring their goods, by making knowne how much they contemne and hate him from whom they receiued them. Againe, this liberalitie muſt be with meaſure, for if it be not, and that he giue vnto all, and vpon all occaſions, the ruine of the ſtate and ſoueraigne muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: This is to play, and to loſe all. For men will neuer be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but be as exceſſiue in asking as the Prince ſhall be in giuing, framing themſelues not according to reaſon, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; ſo that when the common treaſurie ſhall faile, he ſhall be enforced to lay hands vpon the goods of another, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie by iniuſtice, that which ambition and prodigalitie did diſſipate, <hi>quod ambitione exhaustum, per ſcelera ſupplendum.</hi> Now it is farre better not to giue at all, than to take away to giue, for a man ſhall neuer inioy in ſo high a degree the loue and good will of thoſe whom he hath clothed, as the hatred and ill will of thoſe whom he hath robbed and ſpoiled. And againe, this liberalitie without meaſure, worketh the ruine of himſelfe, for a fountaine drieth vp if it be ouer-much drawne. <hi>Liberalitate liberalitas perit.</hi> Liberalitie likewiſe muſt be ſpun <note place="margin">Hieronym.</note> with a gentle thread by little &amp; little, and not all together, for that which is done ouer-ſpeedily, be it neuer ſo great, is in a maner inſenſible, and ſoone forgotten. Pleaſant and pleaſing things muſt be exerciſed with eaſe and leaſure, that a man may haue time to taſte them: Things rude and cruell (if they muſt needs be done) muſt contrarily be executed ſpeedily. There is then arte and prudence in giuing, and in the practiſe of liberalitie. <hi>Falluntur quibus luxuria ſpecie liberalitatis impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit: perdere multi ſciunt, donare neſciunt.</hi> And to ſay the truth, <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> liberalitie is not properlie any of the royall vertues, for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth and carieth it ſelfe well with tyrannie it ſelfe. And ſuch as are the gouernours of young Princes do wrong in working ſo ſtrong an impreſſion of this vertue of bountie in their minds and willes, that they ſhould refuſe no meanes to put it in practiſe, and thinke nothing well employed but that which they giue (this is their common language) but they do it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their owne benefit, or elſe they know not to whom
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:16995:207"/>
they ſpeake it. For it is a dangerous thing to imprint libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the mind of him that hath meanes to furniſh himſelfe as much as he will at the charges of another. A prodigall or liberall Prince without diſcretion and meaſure, is worſe than a couetous: but if this liberalitie be well ruled and ordered, as hath been ſaid, it is well beſeeming a Prince, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable both to himſelfe, and the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Another vertue requiſite in a Prince in a ſecond degree, is magnanimitie and greatnes of courage, to contemne iniuries <note place="margin">14 <hi>Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and moderation of choler.</hi> Senec.</note> and bad ſpeaches, and to moderate his choler; neuer to vex himſelfe for the outrages and indiſcretions of another, <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam fortunam magnus animus decet: Iniurias &amp; offenſiones ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perne deſpicere indignus Caeſaris irae.</hi> For a man to afflict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to be moued, is to confeſſe himſelfe to be faultie, whereas by neglect and light account it eaſily vaniſheth. <hi>Conuitia ſi iraſcare, agnita videntur: ſpreta exoleſcunt.</hi> And if <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> there be fit place, and a man muſt be angrie, let it be openly, and without diſſimulation, in ſuch ſort that he giue not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuſpect a hidden grudge and purpoſe of reuenge: this is a token of a bad and incurable nature, and beſt befitting the baſer ſort: <hi>Obſcuri &amp; irreuocabiles reponunt odia: Saeuae cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis</hi>

                        </note> Prince. I will not ſtand vpon this point: I only ſay as it were paſſing by, that not only nature helpeth much heereunto, but alſo arte and ſtudie. Heereunto do appertaine the good and beautifull compoſition of the viſage, his port, paſe, ſpeech, habilliments. The generall rule in all theſe points, is a ſweet, moderate and venerable grauitie, walking betwixt feare and loue, worthie of all honor and reuerence. There is likewiſe his reſidence and conuerſation or familiaritie. Touching his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or abode, let it be in ſome glorious, magnificent, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent place, and as neere as may be in the middle of the whole ſtate, to the end he may haue an eye ouer all, like the Sunne, which from the middle of heauen giueth light to all: for keeping himſelfe at one end, he giueth occaſion to thoſe
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:16995:208"/>

His conuerſation and companie, let it be rare, for to ſhew and to communicate himſelfe too much, breedeth contempt and deiecteth maieſtie, <hi>continuus aſpectus minùs verendos magnos homines ipſa ſatietate facit.

                     </p>
                     <p>After theſe three things, knowledge of the ſtate, vertue and maners, which are in the perſon of the prince, come thoſe <note place="margin">16 <hi>The fourth head of this prouiſion, Counſell.</hi>
                        </note> things which are neere and about the prince; That is to ſay, in the fourth place Counſell, the great and principall point of this politique doctrine, and ſo important that it is in a maner all in all. It is the ſoule of the ſtate, and the ſpirit that giueth life, motion and action to al the other parts: and for that cauſe it is ſaid that the managing of affaires conſiſteth in prudence. Now it were to be wiſhed that a prince had in himſelfe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and prudence ſufficient to gouerne and to prouide for all, which is the firſt and higheſt degree of wiſdome, as hath beene ſaid; and if ſo it were, the affaires would goe farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> but this is rather to be wiſhed than hoped for, whether it be for want of a good nature, or a good inſtitution; and it is almoſt impoſſible that one only head ſhould be ſufficiently furniſhed for ſo many matters, <hi>Nequit princeps ſua ſcientia cuncta complecti, nec vnius mens tantae molis est capax.</hi> A lone <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> man ſeeth and heareth but little. Now kings haue neede of many eies, and many eares; and great burthens, and great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires haue neede of great helpes. And therefore it is requiſite that he prouide and furniſh himſelfe with good counſell, and ſuch men as know how to giue it: for he, whoſoeuer hee be, that will take all vpon himſelfe, is rather held to bee proud, than diſcreet or wiſe. A Prince then had neede of faithfull friends and ſeruitours to be his aſſiſtants, <hi>quos aſſumat in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem curarum.</hi> Theſe are his true treaſures, and profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments <note place="margin">Tit. Liui. Tacit.</note> of the ſtate. In the choice whereof hee ſhould eſpecially labour and imploy his whole iudgement, to the end he may haue them good. There are two ſorts of them, <note place="margin">Plin.</note> the one aide the prince with their dutie, counſell and tongue, and are called Counſellers; the other ſerue him with their hands and actions, and may be called Officers. The firſt are
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:16995:208"/>
farre more honourable: for the two greateſt philoſophers ſay, that it is a ſacred and diuine thing, well to deliberate, and to giue good counſell.</p>
                     <p>Now Counſellers muſt be firſt faithfull, that is to ſay in a word, honeſt men, <hi>Optimum quemque fideliſſimum puto.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">17 <hi>The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good counſellers.

                        </note> they muſt be ſufficient in this point, that is to ſay, skilfull in the ſtate, diuerſly experimented and tried (for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and afflictions are excellent leſſons and inſtructions; <hi>mihi fortuna multis rebus ereptis vſum dedit bene ſuadendi)</hi> And in a word, they muſt be wiſe and prudent, indifferent quicke and not ouer ſharpe: for ſuch kind of men are too moueable, <hi>nouandis quàm gerendis rebus aptiora ingenia illa ignea.</hi> And that <note place="margin">Curtius.</note> they may be ſuch, it is requiſite, that they bee old and ripe, for beſides that yong men by reaſon of the ſoft and delicate tenderneſſe of their age, are eaſily deceiued, they do as eaſily beleeue and receiue euery impreſſion. It is good that about Princes there be ſome wiſe, ſome ſubtile; but much more ſuch as are wiſe, who are required for honour and for all times, the ſubtile only ſometimes for neceſſitie. Thirdly, it is neceſſary that in propoſing and giuing good and holeſome counſell, they carrie themſelues freely and couragiouſly, without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <note place="margin">Liberty.</note> or ambiguity, or diſguiſement, not accommodating their language to the preſent ſtate of the prince; <hi>Ne cum fortuna po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius principis loquantur quàm cum ipſo,</hi> but without ſparing the <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> truth, ſpeake that which is fit and requiſite. For although li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, roundneſſe of ſpeech and fidelity, hurt and offend for the time, thoſe againſt whom it oppoſeth it ſelfe, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is reuerenced and eſteemed. <hi>In praeſentia quibus riſiſtis, offendis, deinde illis ipſis ſuſpicitur laudaturque.</hi> And fourthly, conſtantly, without yeelding, varying and changing at euery meeting to pleaſe and follow the humour, pleaſure and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, but without opinatiue obſtinacy, and a ſpirit of contradiction, which troubleth and hindereth all good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, he muſt ſometimes change his opinion, which is not inconſtancy but prudence. For a wiſe man marcheth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with one and the ſame paſe, although hee follow the ſame waie, he changeth not, but accommodateth himſelfe; <note place="margin">Senec.</note>

the winde, it is neceſſary many times to turne and winde, and to arriue to that place, obliquely by fetching a compaſſe, when he can not doe it directly, and by a ſtraight line. Again, a religious dexteritie to keepe ſecret the counſels and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations <note place="margin">Silence.</note> of Princes, is a thing verie neceſſarie in the managing of affaires, <hi>res magnae ſuſtineri nequeunt ab eo cui tacere graue eſt.</hi> And it ſufficeth not to bee ſecret, but hee muſt not prie and <note place="margin">Curtius.</note> ſearch into the ſecrets of his Prince, this is an ill, and a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing; <hi>exquirere abditos principis ſenſus illicitum &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps:</hi>

                     <p>Now a prince muſt make choice of ſuch as are good, either by his owne knowledge and iudgement, or if hee cannot ſo <note place="margin">18 <hi>The duty of the prince in abuſing good counſellers.</hi>
                        </note> doe, by their reputation, which doth ſeldome deceiue; whereupon one of them ſaid to his prince, Hold vs for ſuch as we are eſteemed to be. <hi>Nam ſinguli decipere &amp; decipipoſſunt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo omnes, neminem omnes fefellerunt.</hi> And let him take heede that he chuſe not his minions and fauorites, courtiers, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, ſlaues who ſhame their maſters and betray them. There is nothing more dangerous than the counſell of the cabinet. And hauing choſen and found them, he muſt wiſely make vſe of them, by taking counſell of them at due times and houres,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:16995:209"/>
not attending the euent and execution, and loſing the time whileſt he harkneth to them; and this muſt he do with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not ſuffering himſelfe to be caried ouer-looſely by their counſels, as that ſimple Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> was; and with mildneſſe, without roughneſſe, being more reaſonable, as that wiſe <hi>Marc. Antonius</hi> was woont to ſay, to follow the counſell of a good number of friends, than ſuch as are conſtrained to bend vnto his will. And making vſe of them, do it with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different authoritie, neither rewarding them with preſents for their good counſell, leſt by the hope of the like preſents he draw ſuch as are wicked vnto him, nor vſe them ouer-roughlie for their bad counſels; for he ſhall hardlie find any <note place="margin">Curtius.</note> to giue him counſell, if there be danger in giuing it: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, many times bad counſell hath a better ſucceſſe than good, by the prouident care and direction of the ſoueraigne. And ſuch as giue good counſell, that is to ſay, happie and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, are not therefore alwaies the beſt, and moſt faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitours, nor for their libertie of ſpeech neither, which hee ſhould rather agree vnto, looking into ſuch as are fearefull and flatterers with a warie eye.

                        </note> ſerue the Prince and ſtate in ſome charge, hee muſt make choice of honeſt men, of good and honeſt families. It is to be thought that ſuch as ſerue the Prince, are the beſt ſort of people, and it is not fit that baſe people ſhould be neere him, and commaund others, except they raiſe themſelues by ſome great, and ſingular vertue, which may ſupplie the want of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: but by no meanes let them be infamous, double, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and men of ſome odious condition.

And therefore a Prince muſt prouide that his treaſurie neuer faile, neuer be dried vp. This ſcience conſiſteth in three points, to lay the foundation of them, to imploy them well, to haue alwaies are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, <note place="margin">Exchequer knowledge in three points.</note> and to lay vp ſome good part thereof for all needs and occaſions that may happen. In all theſe three a Prince muſt auoid two things, iniuſtice, and baſe nigardlines, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing right towards all, and honor for himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Touching the firſt, which is to lay the foundation and to increaſe the treaſurie, there are diuers meanes, and the ſources <note place="margin">21 1 <hi>To lay the foundation.</hi>
                        </note> are diuers, which are not all perpetuall, nor alike aſſured; that is to ſay, the demaine and publike reuenue of the ſtate, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> muſt be managed and vſed, without the alienating of it in any ſort, foraſmuch as by nature it is ſacred and inalienable. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> made vpon the enemie, which muſt be profitablie em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and not prodigallie diſſipated, as the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> were woont to doe, carying to the Exchequer very great ſummes, and the treaſuries of conquered cities and countries, as <hi>Liuy</hi> reporteth of <hi>Camillus Flaminius, Paulus Emillius,</hi> of the <hi>Scipioes, Lucullus, Caeſar;</hi> and afterwards receiuing from thoſe conquered countries, whether from their naturall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries left behind them, or from colonies ſent thither, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine annuall reuenue. Preſents, gratuities, penſions, free do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, tributes of friends, allies, and ſubiects, by teſtaments, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by donations amongſt the liuing, as the lawyers tearme it, or otherwiſe. The entrance, comming and going, and paſſages of merchandize, into docks, hauens, riuers, as well vpon ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as ſubiects, a meanes iuſt, lawfull, ancient, generall, and very commodious with theſe conditions: Not to permit the trafficke and tranſportation of things neceſſarie for life, that the ſubiects may be furniſhed; nor of raw vnwrought wares, to the end the ſubiect may be ſet on worke, and gaine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his owne labours. But to permit the trafficke of things
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:16995:210"/>
wrought and dreſſed, and the bringing in of ſuch wares as are rawe, and not of ſuch as are wrought; and in all things to charge the ſtranger much more than the ſubiect. For a great forraine impoſition increaſeth the treaſure, &amp; comforteth the ſubiect: to moderate neuertheleſſe the impoſts vpon thoſe things that are brought in, neceſſarie for life. Theſe foure meanes are not only permitted, but iuſt, lawfull, and honeſt. The fift which is hardly honeſt, is the trafficke which the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne <note place="margin">5 Antoninus Pius. Seuerus. Auguſt.</note> vſeth by his factors, and is practiſed in diuers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more or leſſe baſe; but the vileſt and moſt pernitious is of honors, eſtates, offices, benefices. There is a meane that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neere to trafficke, and therefore may be placed in this ranke, which is not very diſhoneſt, and hath beene practiſed by very great and wiſe princes, which is, to imploy the coine of the treaſure or exchequer to ſome ſmall profit, as fiue in the hundred, and to take good ſecuritie for it, either gages, or ſome other ſound and ſufficient aſſurance. This hath a three-fold vſe, it increaſeth the treaſure, giueth meanes to particular men to traffick and to make gaine; and which is beſt of all, it ſaueth the publike treaſure from the pawes of our theeuing courtiers, the importunate demaunds and flatteries of fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and the ouer-great facilitie of the prince. And for this only cauſe, ſome princes haue lent their publike treaſure without any profit or intereſt, but only vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine of a double forfeiture for not paiment at the day. The ſixt and laſt is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the lones and ſubſidies of ſubiects, whereunto he muſt not come but vnwillinglie, and then when other meanes do faile, and neceſſitie preſſeth the ſtate. For in this caſe it is iuſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rule, That all is iuſt that is neceſſarie. But it is requiſit, that theſe conditions be added, after this firſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, To leuy by way of lone (for this way will yeeld moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſiluer, becauſe of the hope men haue to recouer their owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and that they ſhall loſe nothing, beſides the credit they receiue by ſuccoring the weale-publike) and afterwards the neceſſitie being paſt, and the warres ended, to repay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did, being put to an extremitie by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi> And if the common treaſurie be ſo poore that it cannot repay it, and that they muſt needs proceed by way of impoſition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is neceſſarie that it be with the conſent of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:16995:211"/>
making knowne vnto them the pouertie and neceſſitie, and preaching the word of that king of kings, <hi>Dominus ijs opus habet,</hi> inſomuch that they make them ſee, if need be, both the receit, and the charge. And, if it may be, let perſwaſion preuaile without conſtraint, as <hi>Themistocles</hi> ſaid, <hi>Impetrare melius quàm imperare.</hi> It is true that the prayers of ſoueraignes are commandements, <hi>Satis imperat qui rogat potentiâ, armatae ſunt preces regum;</hi> but yet let it be in the forme of a free dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the leaſt that they be extraordinarie monies; for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prefixt time, and not ordinarie; and neuer preſcribe this law vpon the ſubiects, except it be with their owne conſent. Thirdly, that ſuch impoſitions be leuied vpon the goods, and not the heads of men (capitation being odious to all honeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> people) be reall and not perſonall (being vniuſt that the rich, the great, the nobles, ſhould not pay at all, and the poorer people of the countrie ſhould pay all.) Fourthly that they be equallie vpon all. Inequalitie afflicteth much, and to theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ends theſe monies muſt be beſtowed vpon ſuch things as the whole world hath need of, as ſalt, wine, to the end that all may contribute to the preſent neceſſitie. Well may a man, and he ought, to lay ordinarie impoſts and great, vpon ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and other things as are vitious, and that ſerue to no other end, than to corrupt the ſubiects, as whatſoeuer ſerueth for the increaſe of luxurie, inſolencie, curioſitie, ſuperfluitie in viands, apparell, pleaſures, and all maner of licentious liuing, without any other prohibition of theſe things. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of a thing ſharpneth the appetite.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond point of this ſcience, is well to employ the treaſure. And theſe in order are the articles of this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">22 <hi>To employ the treaſure.</hi>
                        </note> and charge; The maintenance of the kings houſe, the pay of men of warre, the wages of officers, the iuſt rewards of thoſe that haue deſerued well of the Common-weale, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and charitable ſuccors to poore, yet commendable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Theſe fiue are neceſſarie, after which come thoſe that are very profitable, to repaire cities, to fortifie and to defend the frontiers, to mend the high waies, bridges, and paſſages, to eſtabliſh colledges of honor, of vertue, and learning; to build publike houſes. From theſe fiue ſorts of reparations, fortifications, and foundations, commeth very great profit,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:16995:211"/>
beſides the publike good: artes and artificers are maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the enuie and malice of the people becauſe of the leuie of monies ceaſeth, when they ſee them well employed; and theſe two plagues of a common-weale, idleneſſe and pouertie, are driuen away. Contrarily, the great bounties, and vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable gifts, to ſome particular fauorites; the great, proud, and vnneceſſarie edifices, ſuperfluous and vaine charges are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſubiects, who murmure that a man ſhould ſpoile a thouſand to cloath one; that others ſhould braue it with their ſubſtance, build vpon their bloud and their labours.</p>
                     <p>The third point conſiſteth in the reſeruation, which a man <note place="margin">23 3 <hi>To make ſpare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.</hi>

Now as to gather together too great abundance of treaſure of gold and ſiluer, though it be by honeſt and iuſt meanes, is not alwaies the beſt, becauſe it is an occaſion of warre actiue or paſſiue, either by breeding enuie in others to ſee it done, when there is no cauſe, there being plentie of other meanes, or elſe becauſe it is a bait to allure an enemie to come, and it were <note place="margin">Eſay 30.</note> more honorable to employ them as hath been ſaid: So to ſpend all and to leaue nothing in the Exchequer is far worſe, for this were to play to loſe all; wiſe princes take heed of this. The greateſt treaſuries that haue beene in former times, are that of <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt king of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> where <hi>Alexander</hi> found foure ſcore millions of gold. That of <hi>Tiberius 67.</hi> mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; of <hi>Traian 55.</hi> millions kept in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But that of <hi>Dauid</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Paralip.</note> did farre exceed all theſe (a thing almoſt incredible in ſo ſmall a ſtate) wherein there were ſixe ſcore millions. Now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that theſe great treaſuries be not ſpent, violated or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the ancients cauſed them to be melted, and caſt into great wedges and bowles, as the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> or they put them into the temples of their gods as the ſafeſt places, as the <hi>Greekes</hi> in the temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which neuertheleſſe hath bin many times pilled and robbed; the <hi>Romans</hi> in the temple of <hi>Saturne.</hi> But the beſt and ſecureſt way and moſt profitable is, as hath been ſaid, to lend them with ſome ſmall profit to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, vpon good gages, or ſufficient ſecuritie. So likewiſe for the ſafer cuſtodie of the treaſures from theeues
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:16995:212"/>
and robbers; the managing of them, and the exchequer offices muſt not be ſold to baſe and mechanicall perſons, but giuen to gentlemen, and men of honor, as the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> were accuſtomed to do, who choſe out young men from amongſt their nobles and great houſes, and ſuch as aſpired to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honors and charges of the common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>After counſell and treaſure I thinke it not amiſſe to put armes, which cannot ſubſiſt, nor be well and happily leuied <note place="margin">24 <hi>The ſixt head of this prouiſion. An armed power.</hi>
                        </note> and conducted without theſe two. Now an armed power is very neceſſarie for a prince, to guard his perſon and his ſtate: for it is an abuſe to thinke to gouerne a ſtate long without armes. There is neuer any ſurety betweene the weake and the ſtrong; and there are alwaies ſome that will bee ſtirring either within or without the ſtate. Now this power is either ordinarie at all times, or extraordinarie in times of warre. The ordinarie conſiſteth in the perſons and places; The perſons are of two ſorts; the guard for the bodie and perſon of the ſouereigne, which ſerue not only for the ſurety and conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo for his honour and ornament: for that good ſaying of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> is not perpetually true, and it were too dangerous to trie &amp; truſt vnto it, That a prince may liue ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough without guard, if hee command his ſubiects, as a good father doth his children (for the malice of man ſtayeth not it ſelfe in ſo faire a way). And certaine companies, maintained and alwaies ready for thoſe neceſſities and ſudden occurrences that may fall out. For at ſuch times to be buſied in leuying powers is great imprudencie. Touching the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are the fortreſſes and cittadels in the frontiers, in place of which, ſome, and they ancient too, doe more allow of the colonies. The extraordinarie force conſiſteth in armes, which he muſt leuie and furniſh in times of warre. How he <note place="margin">In the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> ſhould gouerne himſelfe therein, that is to ſay, enterpriſe and make warre, it belongeth to the ſecond part, which is of the action: this firſt belongeth to prouiſion. Only I heere ſay, that a wiſe prince ſhould beſides the guards of his body, haue certaine people alwaies prepared, and experienced in armes, either in great number or leſſe, according to the extent or largeneſſe of his ſtate, to repreſſe a ſudden rebellion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, which may happen either without or within his
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:16995:212"/>
ſtate, reſeruing the raiſing of greater forces, vntill hee muſt make warre, either offenſiue or defenſiue, willingly and of purpoſe; and in the meane time keeping his arſenals and ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes well furniſhed, and prouided with all ſorts of offenſiue and defenſiue armes, to furniſh both foote and horſemen, as likewiſe with munitions, engins, and inſtruments for warre. Such preparation is not only neceſſarie to make warre, (for theſe things are not found and prepared in a ſhort time) but to let and hinder it. For no man is ſo foole-hardy, as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a ſtate, which he knoweth to be ready to receiue him, and throughly furniſhed. A man muſt arme himſelfe againſt warres, to the end he may not be troubled with it, <hi>qui cupit pacem, paret bellum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all theſe neceſſarie and eſſentiall prouiſions, wee will <note place="margin">25 <hi>The ſeuenth head of this prouiſion. Alliance or leagues. With whom.</hi>
                        </note> laſtly put alliances or leagues, which is no ſmall proppe and ſtay of a ſtate. But wiſdome is very neceſſarie in the choice thereof, to build well and to take heede with whom and how he ioyne in alliance; which hee muſt doe with thoſe that are neighbours and puiſſant: For if they be weake and farre off, wherewith can they giue aide? It is rather likely, that if they be aſſaulted, that from their ruine ours may follow. For then are wee bound to ſuccour them, and to ioyne with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this league, whoſoeuer they be. And if there be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in making this alliance openly, let it be done ſecretly, for it is the part of a wiſe man to treat of peace and alliance with one, in the view and knowledge of all, with another ſecretly; but yet ſo, as that it be without treacherie and wickedneſſe, which is vtterly forbidden, but not wiſdome and policie, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for the defence and ſurety of his ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Finally, there are many ſorts and degrees of leagues or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances: <note place="margin">2. <hi>How.</hi>
                        </note> the leſſer and more ſimple is for commerce and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fike only, but commonly it comprehendeth amitie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and hoſpitalitie; and it is either defenſiue only, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue and offenſiue together, and with exception of certaine princes and ſtates, or without exception. The more ſtrait and perfect is that which is offenſiue and defenſiue towards all, and againſt all, to be a friend to his friends, and an enemie to his enemies: and ſuch it is good to make with thoſe that are ſtrong and puiſſant, and by equall alliance. Leagues are
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:16995:213"/>
likewiſe either perpetuall, or limited to certaine times; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are perpetuall, but the better and ſureſt is, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to certaine times, to the end he may haue meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, to take away, or adde to the articles, or wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part if neede be, as he ſhall ſee it moſt expedient. And though a man would iudge them to be ſuch, as ſhould be perpetuall, yet it is better to renew them (which a man may and muſt do before the time be expired) than to make them perpetuall. For they languiſh and grow cold, and whoſoeuer findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aggrieued will ſooner breake them, if they be perpetuall than if they bee limited, in which caſe hee will rather ſtay the time. And thus much of theſe ſeuen neceſſarie prouiſions.</p>

But before we come to handle this diſtinctlie, according to the diuiſion which we haue made, wee may ſay in groſſe that well to gouerne and to maintaine himſelfe in his ſtate, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the acquiſition of two things, goodwill and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Goodwill is a loue and affection towards the ſoueraigne <note place="margin">Beneuolence, Authoritie two pillars of a prince and ſtate.</note> and his ſtate. Authoritie is a great and good opinion, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable eſteeme of the ſoueraigne and his ſtate. By the firſt, the ſoueraigne and the ſtate is loued, by the ſecond feared. Theſe are not contrary things, but different, as loue and feare. Both of them reſpect the ſubiects and ſtrangers, but it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that more properlie, Beneuolence belongeth to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and authoritie to the ſtranger; <hi>amorem apud populares, metum apud hoſtes quaerat.</hi> To ſpeake ſimplie and abſolutelie, <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> authoritie is the more ſtrong and vigorous, more large and durable. The temperature and harmonie of both is a perfect thing, but according to the diuerſity of ſtates, of peoples, their
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:16995:213"/>
natures and humours, the one is more eaſie and more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in ſome places, than in others. The meanes to attaine them both, are contained and handled in that which hath beene ſaid before, eſpeciallie of the maners and vertue of a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; neuertheleſſe of each we will ſpeake a little.</p>
                  <p>Beneuolence or goodwill (a thing very profitable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <note place="margin">2 <hi>Beneuolence is attained by clemency.</hi>
                     </note> wholly neceſſarie, inſomuch that of it ſelfe it preuaileth much, and without it all the reſt hath but little aſſurance) is attained by three meanes, gentlenes or clemencie, not only in words and deeds, but much more in his commaunds and the adminiſtration of the ſtate; for ſo doe the natures of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, who are impatient both of ſeruing wholly, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining themſelues in entire libertie, <hi>nec totam ſeruitutem pati,</hi>

But yet it muſt not be an ouer-looſe, and ſoft effeminate mildnes, leſt a man thereby come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which is worſe than feare, <hi>Sed incorrupto ducis honore.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> It is the part of wiſdome to temper this, neither ſeeking to be feared by making himſelfe terrible, nor loued by too much debaſing himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond meane to attaine beneuolence is beneficence, <note place="margin">3 <hi>Beneficence.</hi>
                     </note> I meane firſt towards all, eſpeciallie the meaner people, by prouidence and good policie, whereby corne and all other neceſſarie things for the ſuſtenance of this life may not be wanting, but ſold at an indifferent price, yea may abound if it be poſſible, that deareneſſe and dearth afflict not the ſubiect.

                  </p>

                     </note> which is a bait, yea, an enchantment, to draw, to winne and captiuate the willes of men: So ſweet a thing is it to receiue, honorable to giue. In ſuch ſort, that a wiſe man hath ſaid, That a ſtate did better defend it ſelfe by good deeds, than by
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:16995:214"/>
armes. This vertue is alwaies requiſite, but eſpeciallie in the entrance and in a new ſtate. To whom, how much, and how liberalitie muſt be exerciſed, hath beene ſaid before. The meanes of beneuolence haue beene wiſely practiſed by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>

                  <p>Authoritie is another pillar of ſtate, <hi>maiestas imperij, ſalutis</hi>

                     <hi>tutela;</hi> The inuincible fortreſſe of a prince, whereby he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth into reaſon all thoſe, that dare to contemne or make head againſt him. Yea becauſe of this they dare not attempt, and all men deſire to be in grace and fauor with him. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of feare and reſpect, by which two a prince and his ſtate is feared of all, and ſecured. To attaine this authoritie, beſides the prouiſion of things aboue named, there are three meanes which muſt carefully be kept in the forme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding. <note place="margin">By what it is acquired.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is ſeueritie, which is better, more wholſome, aſſured, durable, than common lenitie, and great facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">6 <hi>Seuerity.</hi>
                     </note> which proceedeth firſt from the nature of the people, which as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, is not ſo well borne and bred, as to be ranged into dutie and obedience by loue, or ſhame, but by force and feare of puniſhment; and ſecondly from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption of the maners, and contagious licentiouſnes of the world, which a man muſt not thinke to mend by mildnes and lenitie, which doth rather giue aid to ill attempts. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth contempt, and hope of impunitie, which is the plague of Common-weales and ſtates, <hi>Illecebra peccandi maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ſpes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> 
                     <hi>impunitatis.</hi> It is a fauour done to many, and the whole weale-publike ſometimes well to chaſtice ſome one. And he muſt ſometimes cut off a finger, leſt the Gangreene ſpread it ſelfe through the whole arme, according to that excellent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of a king of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whom one telling that he played the mad man, and not the king, anſwered, That his madnes made his ſubiects ſound and wiſe. Seueritie keepeth officers and magiſtrates in their deuoire, driueth away flatterers, courtiers, wicked perſons, impudent demaunders, and pety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrannies. Whereas contrariwiſe too great facilitie openeth the gate to all theſe kind of people, whereupon followeth an exhauſting of the treaſuries, impunitie of the wicked, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriſhing
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:16995:214"/>
of the people, as rheumes &amp; fluxes in a rheumatike &amp; diſeaſed bodie, fall vpon thoſe parts that are weakeſt. The goodnes of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> the licentious libertie of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> are thought to haue vndone and ruinated the Empire: The ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Alexander,</hi> did reeſtabliſh it, and brought it into good eſtate. But yet this ſeueritie muſt be with ſome moderation, intermiſſion, and to purpoſe, to the end that rigour towards a few might hold the whole world in feare, <hi>vt poena ad paucos, metus ad omnes.</hi> And the more ſeldome puniſhments ſerue more for the reformation of a ſtate, ſaith an ancient writer, than the more frequent. This is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if vices gather not ſtrength, and men grow not opina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely obſtinate in them; for then he muſt not ſpare either ſword or fire, <hi>crudelem medicum intemperans aeger facit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is conſtancie, which is a ſtayed reſolution, whereby the prince marching alwaies with one and the ſame <note place="margin">7 <hi>Constancy.</hi>
                     </note> paſe, without altering or changing, mainteineth alwaies, and enforceth the obſeruation of the ancient lawes and cuſtomes. To change and to be readuiſed, beſides that it is an argument of inconſtancie and irreſolution, it bringeth both to the lawes and to the ſoueraigne, and to the ſtate contempt and ſiniſter opinion. And this is the reaſon why the wiſer ſort do ſo much forbid the change, and rechange of any thing in the lawes and cuſtomes, though it were for the better: for the change or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue bringeth alwaies more euill and diſcommoditie, beſides the vncertaintie and the danger, than the noueltie can bring good. And therefore all innouators are ſuſpected, dangerous, and to be chaſed away. And there cannot be any cauſe or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſtrong and ſufficient enough to change, if it be not for a very great, euident, and certaine vtilitie, or publike neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And in this caſe likewiſe he muſt proceed as it were ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, ſweetly and ſlowly, by little and little and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſiblie, <hi>leuiter &amp; lentè.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is to hold alwaies faſt in the hand the ſterne of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the ſtate, the raines of gouernment, that is to ſay, the honour and power to commaund and to ordaine, and not to truſt or commit it to another, referring all things to his counſell, to the end that all may haue their eye vpon him, and may know that all dependeth vpon him. That ſoueraigne that loſeth neuer ſo little of his authoritie marreth all. And therefore it
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:16995:215"/>
ſtandeth him vpon, not ouer-much to raiſe and make great any perſon, <hi>Communis custodia principatus neminem vnum magnum facere.</hi> And if there be alreadie any ſuch, he muſt <note place="margin">Ariſtot.</note> draw him backe and bring him into order, but yet ſweetly and gently; and neuer make great and high charges and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces perpetuall or for many yeares, to the end a man may not get meanes to fortifie himſelfe againſt his maſter, as it many times falleth out. <hi>Nil tam vtile, quàm breuem potestatem eſſe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Senec.</note> 
                     <hi>quae magna ſit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold heere the iuſt and honeſt meanes in a ſoueraigne to maintaine with beneuolence and loue his authoritie, and to <note place="margin">9 <hi>Againſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunie.</hi>
                     </note> make himſelfe to be loued and feared altogether: for the one without the other is neither ſecure nor reaſonable. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we abhorre a tyrannicall authoritie, and that feare that is an enemy to loue and beneuolence, and is with a publike hate, <hi>oderint quem metuant,</hi> which the wicked ſeeke after abuſing their power. The conditions of a good prince and of a tyrant are nothing alike, and eaſily diſtinguiſhed. They may be all reduced to theſe two points, the one to keepe the lawes of God and of nature, or to trample them vnder foot; the other to do all for the publike good and profit of the ſubiects, or to employ all to his particular profit &amp; pleaſure. Now a prince that he may be ſuch as he ſhould, muſt alwaies remember, that as it is a felicitie to haue power to do what a man will, ſo it is true greatnes to will that that a man ſhould; <hi>Caeſari cum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Plin. de Traia.</note> 
                     <hi>omnia licent, propter hoc minus licet: vt felicitatis eſt poſſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum velis, ſic magnitudinis velle quantum poſſis, vel potius quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debeas.</hi> The greateſt infelicitie that can happen to a prince, is to beleeue that all things are lawfull that he can, and that pleaſeth him. So ſoone as he conſenteth to this thought, of good he is made wicked. Now this opinion is ſetled in them by the help of flatterers, who neuer ceaſe alwaies to preach vnto them the greatnes of their power; and very few faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruitours there are, that dare to tell them what their dutie is. But there is not in the world a more dangerous flattery, than that where with a man flattereth himſelfe, when the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer and flattered is one and the ſame; there is no remedie for this diſeaſe. Neuertheleſſe it falleth out ſometimes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the times, perſons, places, occaſions, that a good
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:16995:215"/>
king muſt do thoſe things which in outward appearance may ſeeme tyrannicall, as when it is a queſtion of repreſſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyrannie, that is to ſay, of a furious people, the licentious libertie of whom, is a true tyrannie: or of the noble and rich, who tyrannize ouer the poore and meaner people: or when the king is poore and needie, not knowing where to get ſiluer, to raiſe loanes vpon the richeſt. And we muſt not thinke that the ſeueritie of a prince is alwaies tyrannie, or his gards &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, or the maieſtie of his imperious commaunds, which are ſometimes profitable, yea neceſſarie, and are more to be deſired than the ſweet prayers of tyrants.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the two true ſtayes and pillars of a prince, and of a ſtate, if by them a prince know how to maintaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue <note place="margin">10 <hi>Hate and contempt, two murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of ae prince.</hi>
                     </note> himſelfe from the two contraries, which are the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of a prince and ſtate, that is to ſay, hatred and contempt, whereof the better to auoid them, and to take heed of them, a word or two. Hatred contrarie to beneuolence, is a wicked and obſtinate affection of ſubiects againſt the prince, and his <note place="margin">A riſt. lib. 5. Pol. <hi>Hatred.</hi>
                     </note> ſtate: It ordinarily proceedeth from feare of what is to come, or deſire of reuenge of what is paſt, or from them both. This hatred when it is great, and of many, a prince can hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape it, <hi>Multorum odijs nullae opes poſſunt reſistere.</hi> He is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> to all, and there needs but one to make an end of all. <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae illis manus, illi vna ceruix.</hi> It ſtandeth him vpon therefore to preſerue himſelfe, which he ſhall do by flying thoſe things that ingender it, that is to ſay, crueltie and auarice, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the aforeſaid inſtruments of beneuolence.</p>
                  <p>He muſt preſerue himſelfe pure and free from baſe cruelty, <note place="margin">11 <hi>Hatred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from crueltie.</hi> Cap. 2. art. 12.</note> vnworthie greatnes, very infamous to a prince: But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he muſt arme himſelfe with clemencie, as hath been ſaid before, in the vertues required in a prince. But for aſ much as puniſhments, though they be iuſt and neceſſarie in a ſtate, haue ſome image of crueltie, he muſt take heed to carie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therein with dexteritie, and for this end I will giue him this aduice: Let him not put his hand to the ſword of iuſtice, <note place="margin">

that without choler, or ioy, or other paſſion: And if he muſt needs ſhew ſome paſſion, that it be compaſſion: 4. That it be according to the accuſtomed maner of the countrie, and not after a new, for new puniſhments are teſtimonies of crueltie: 5. Without giuing his aſſiſtance, or being preſent at the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: 6. And if he muſt puniſh many, he muſt diſpatch it ſpeedily, and all at a blow; for to make delayes, and to vſe one correction after another, is a token that he taketh delight, pleaſeth and feedeth himſelfe therewith.</p>
                  <p>He muſt likewiſe preſerue himſelfe from auarice, a ſinne ill <note place="margin">12 <hi>Auarice.</hi>
                     </note> befitting a great perſonage. It is ſhewed either by exacting and gathering ouermuch, or by giuing too little. The firſt doth much diſpleaſe the people, by nature couetous, to whom their goods are as their blood and their life: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, men of ſeruice and merit, who haue laboured for the publike good, and haue reaſon to thinke that they deſerue ſome recompence. Now how a prince ſhould gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe heerein, and in his treaſure and exchequer affaires, either in laying their foundation, or ſpending or preſeruing them, hath beene more at large diſcourſed in the ſecond chapter. I will heere only ſay, that a prince muſt carefully preſerue himſelfe from three things; Firſt, from reſembling, by ouer great and exceſſiue impoſitions, theſe tyrants, ſubiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, canibals, <hi>qui deuorant plebem ſicut eſcam panis</hi>

This doth principally belong to receiuers and puruoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who by their rigorous courſes, expoſe the prince to the hatred of the people, and diſhonour him, a people ſubtile, cruell, with ſix hands and three heads, as one ſaith. A prince
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:16995:216"/>
therefore muſt prouide that they be honeſt men, and if they faile in their duties, to correct them ſeuerely, with rough cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, and great amends, to the the end they may reſtore and diſgorge like ſpunges, that which they haue ſucked and drawne vniuſtly from the people.</p>
                  <p>Let vs come to the other worſe enemie, contempt; which <note place="margin">13 <hi>Contempt.</hi>
                     </note> is a ſiniſter, baſe, and abiect opinion of the prince, and the ſtate: This is the death of a ſtate, as authoritie is the ſoule and life thereof. What doth maintaine one only man, yea an old and worne man, ouer ſo many thouſands of men, if not authoritie and the great eſteeme of his perſon? which if it be once loſt by contempt, the prince and ſtate muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground. And euen as authoritie, as hath been ſaid, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art</hi> 5.</note> is more ſtrong and large than beneuolence, ſo contempt is more contrarie and dangerous than hatred, which dareth not any thing, being held backe by feare, if contempt which ſhaketh off feare, arme it not, and giue it courage to execute. It is true that contempt is not ſo common, eſpecially if he be a true and lawfull prince, except he be ſuch a one, as doth wholly degrade and proſtitute himſelfe, <hi>&amp; videatur exire de</hi>

It proceedeth from things contrarie to thoſe meanes that winne and get authoritie, and eſpecially from three, that is to ſay, from too looſe, effeminate, milde, languiſhing and careleſſe, or very light forme of gouernment, without any <note place="margin">An ill forme of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> hold or ſtay; this is a ſtate without a ſtate, vnder ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the ſubiects are made bold, and inſolent, all things being permitted, becauſe the prince takes care of nothing. <hi>Malum principem habere, ſub quo nihil vlli liceat: peius ſub quo omnia omnibus.</hi> Secondly, from the ill hap and infelicitie of the <note place="margin">Infelicitie.</note> prince, whether it be in his affaires, which ſucceede not well, or in his line and iſſue, if hee haue no children, who are a great proppe and ſtay to a prince, or in the vncertaintie of his ſucceſſours, whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> the great complained, <hi>Orbitas mea quòd ſine liberis ſum, ſpernitur: Munimen aulae</hi>

                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:16995:217"/>
Thus in groſſe haue I ſpoken of the action of a prince. To handle it more diſtinctly and particularly, wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <note place="margin">14 <hi>The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the action of a prince.</hi>
                     </note> as hath beene ſaid in the beginning, that it is two-fold, peaceable and militarie; by the peaceable I heere vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ordinarie action, which is euerie day done, and at all times of peace and of warre; by the militarie, that which is not exerciſed, but in time of warre.</p>
                  <p>The peaceable and ordinarie action of a ſouereigne cannot <note place="margin">Of the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> be whollie preſcribed, it is an infinite thing, and conſiſteth as well in taking heed to doe, as to doe. Wee will heere giue the principall and more neceſſary aduiſements. Firſt therefore <note place="margin">An aduice.</note> a Prince muſt prouide that he be faithfullie and diligentlie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of all things. This all things may bee reduced to two heads, whereupon there are two ſorts of aduertiſements and aduertiſers, who muſt be faithfull and aſſured, wiſe and ſecret, though in ſome there be required, a greater libertie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy than in others. Some are to aduertiſe him of his honor and duty, of his defects, and to tell him the truth. There are no kind of people in the world, who haue ſo much need of ſuch friends, as Princes haue; who neither ſee nor vnderſtand, but by the eies and eares of another. They maintain and hold vp a publike life, are to ſatisfie ſo many people, haue ſo many things hid from them, that before they be aware, they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hatred and deteſtation of their people, for matters that would be eaſily remedied and cured, if they had been in time aduertiſed of them. On the other ſide free aduertiſements, which are the beſt offices of true amity, are perillous about ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes, though Princes be ouer delicate &amp; ſhew great infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, if for their good and profit, they cannot endure a free aduertiſment, which enforceth nothing, it being in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, whatſoeuer they heare, to do what they liſt. Others are to aduertiſe the Prince of whatſoeuer paſſeth, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his ſubiects, and within the circuit of his ſtate, but with his bordering neighbours. I ſay of all, that concerneth either a farre off, or neere at hand, his owne ſtate or his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Theſe two kind of people anſwer in ſome ſort to thoſe two friends of <hi>Alexander, Epheſtion</hi> and <hi>Crateras,</hi> of whom the one loued the King, the other <hi>Alexander,</hi> that is to ſay, the one the ſtate, the other the perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:16995:217"/>
Secondly, a Prince muſt alwaies haue in his hand a little <note place="margin">15 2 <hi>To haue a memoriall of the</hi> 1 <hi>Affaires.</hi>
                     </note> booke or memoriall containing three things: firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie a briefe regiſter of the affaires of the ſtate: to the end he may know what he muſt doe, what is begun to bee done, and that there remaine nothing imperfect, and ill executed: A ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue or bedrowle of the moſt worthy perſonages that <note place="margin">2 <hi>Perſons.</hi>
                     </note> haue well deſerued, or are likely to deſerue well of the weale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike: A memoriall of the gifts which he hath beſtowed, to whom and wherefore; otherwiſe without theſe three, there <note place="margin">3 <hi>Gifts.</hi>
                     </note> muſt neceſſarilie follow many inconueniences. The greateſt princes and wiſeſt polititians haue vſed it, <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberius, Veſpaſian, Traian, Adrian,</hi> the <hi>Antonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in aſmuch as one of the principall duties of a <note place="margin">16 3 <hi>To appoint rewards and puniſhments.</hi>
                     </note> prince, is to appoint and order both rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the one whereof is fauorable, the other odious, a prince muſt retaine vnto himſelfe the diſtribution of rewards, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, honours, immunities, reſtitutions, graces and fauours, and leaue vnto his officers, to execute and pronounce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations, forfeitures, confiſcations, depriuations, and other puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly in the diſtribution of rewards, gifts, and good <note place="margin">17 4 <hi>To distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
                     </note> deeds, he muſt alwaies be readie and willing, giue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be asked, if he can, and not to looke that he ſhould refuſe them; and he muſt giue them himſelfe, if it may be, or cauſe them to be giuen in his preſence. By this meanes gifts and good turnes ſhall be better receiued, and giuen to better purpoſe, and he ſhall auoid two great and common inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, which depriue men of honour and worth of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that are due vnto them: the one is a long purſuit, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and chargeable, which a man muſt vndergoe, to obtaine that which he would, and thinketh to haue deſerued, which is no ſmall griefe to honorable minds, and men of ſpirit: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that after a man hath obtained of the prince a gift, before he can poſſeſſe it, it coſteth the one halfe, and more, of that it is worth, and many times comes to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Let vs come to the militarie action, wholly neceſſarie for <note place="margin">18 <hi>Of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie action which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in three points.</hi>
                     </note> the preſeruation and defence of a prince, of the ſubiects, and the whole ſtate, let vs ſpeake thereof briefly. All this matter or ſubiect may be reduced to three heads, To enterpriſe,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:16995:218"/>
make, finiſh warre. In the enterpiſe there muſt be two things, iuſtice and prudence, and an auoidance of their contraries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice <note place="margin">To enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, where two things are required.</note> and temeritie. Firſt, the warre muſt be iuſt, yea iuſtice muſt march before valour, as deliberation before execution. Theſe reaſons muſt be of no force, yea abhorred, That right conſiſteth in force; That the iſſue or euent decideth it; That the ſtronger carieth it away. But a prince muſt looke into the cauſe, into the ground and foundation, and not into the iſſue; Warre hath it lawes and ordinances as well as peace. God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth iuſt warres, and giueth the victorie to whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, and therefore we muſt firſt make our ſelues capable of this fauor by the equitie of the enterpriſe. Warre then muſt not be begun and vndertaken for all cauſes, vpon euery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>non ex omni occaſione quaerere triumphum:</hi> And aboue all a <note place="margin">Plin. in Pan.</note> prince muſt take heed that ambition, auarice, choler, poſſeſſe him not, and cary him beyond reaſon, which are alwaies, to ſay the truth, the more ordinarie motiues to warre: <hi>vna &amp; ea</hi>

The principall prouiſions and munitions of war are three, Monie, which is the vitall ſpirit, and ſinewes of war, whereof hath been ſpoken in the ſecond Chapter. 2. Armes both offenſiue and defenſiue, whereof likewiſe heeretofore. Theſe two are ordinarie, and at all times. 3.

                  <p>In this compariſon all are not of one accord. Some, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie <note place="margin">25 <hi>Rather foote than horſe.</hi>
                     </note> rude and barbarous people, preferre horſemen before footmen; others quite contrarie. A man may ſay that the foote are ſimplie and abſolutely the better, for they ſerue both throughout the warre, and in all places, and at all occaſions; whereas in hillie, rough, craggie, and ſtrait places, and in ſieges, the caualarie is almoſt vnprofitable. They are likewiſe more readie and leſſe chargeable: and if they be well led and armed, as it is fit they ſhould, they endure the chock of the horſemen. They are likewiſe preferred by ſuch as are doctors in this arte. A man may ſay that the caualarie is better in a combat; and for a ſpeedie diſpatch; <hi>Equestrium virium pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium citò parare, citò cedere victoriam.</hi> For the foote are not ſo ſpeedie, but what they do they performe more ſurely.</p>
                  <p>As for naturall ſouldiers and ſtrangers, diuers men are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">26 <hi>And natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall than ſtrangers.</hi>

                  <p>More patient and obedient, carying themſelues with more honor and reſpect towards their leaders, more courage in combats, more affection to the victorie, and good of their countrie: They coſt leſſe, and are more readie than ſtrangers, who are many times mutinous, yea in greateſt neceſſities, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more ſtir, than doing ſeruice, and the moſt part of them are importunate, and burthenſome to the Common-weale, cruell to thoſe of the countrie, whom they forrage as enemies. Their comming and departure is chargeable, and many times they are expected and attended with great loſſe and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience. If in ſome extremitie there be neede of them, be it ſo, but yet let them be in farre leſſe number than the naturall, and let them make but a member and part of the armie, not the bodie. For there is danger that if they ſhall ſee themſelues equall in force, or more ſtrong than the naturall, they will make themſelues their maſters that called them, as many times it hath fallen out. For he is maſter of the ſtate, that is maſter of the forces. And againe, if it be poſſible, let them be
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:16995:220"/>
drawne from allies and confederates, who bring with them more truſt and ſeruice than they that are ſimplie ſtrangers. For to make more vſe of ſtrangers, or to employ them more than naturall ſubiects, is to play the tyrants, who feare their ſubiects, and becauſe they handle them like enemies, they make themſelues odious vnto them, whereby they feare to arme them, or to employ them in the warres.</p>
                  <p>As touching ordinarie ſouldiers and ſubſidiaries, both are <note place="margin">27 <hi>As well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary as ſubſidiary.</hi>

This is the ordinarie force of the prince, his honor in peace, his ſafegard in warre: ſuch were the <hi>Romane</hi> legions. Theſe ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by troopes in times of peace, to the end they raiſe no commotions. The ſubſidiaries are in farre greater number, but they are not perpetuall, and wholly deſtinated to warre: they haue other vocations: At a neede and in times of warre they are called by the ſound of a trumpet, enroled, muſtred, and inſtructed to the warres; and in times of peace they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and retire themſelues to their vocations.</p>

                     </note> parts, valour, and maners. To valour three things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; daily exerciſe in armes, wherein they muſt alwaies keepe themſelues in practiſe without intermiſſion; and from hence commeth the Latin word <hi>Exercitus,</hi> which ſignifieth an armie. This exerciſe in armes, is an inſtruction to manage and vſe them well, to prepare themſelues for combats, to draw benefit from armes, with dexteritie to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to diſcouer and preſent vnto them whatſoeuer may fal out in the fight, and come to the triall, as in a ranged battell: to propoſe rewards to the moſt apt and actiue, to enflame them.

Thirdly, in the march in the field, and againſt the enemie, that euery one hold his ranke; that they be equally diſtant the one from the other, neither too neere, nor too farre from one an other.

For they depend of ſo many things that are to be conſidered of, and wherunto a man muſt accommodate himſelfe, wherupon it was well ſaid, That men giue not counſell to the affaires, but the affaires to men, that a man muſt order his warre by his eie.

                  <p>HAuing ſpoken of that politicke prudence required in a ſoueraigne, for the cariage of himſelfe and his good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, wee will heere ſeuerally ſpeake of that prudence that is neceſſarie for the preſeruation of himſelfe, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying of thoſe affaires, and difficult and dangerous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which may happen either to himſelfe, or his particular ſubiects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt theſe affaires and accidents are very diuers: they are either publike or particular: either to come, and ſuch as threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">The diuiſion of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the accidents.</note> vs, or preſent and preſſing vs: the one are onely doubtfull and ambiguous, the other dangerous and important becauſe of their violence. And they that are the greater and more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, are either ſecret and hid; and they are two, that is to ſay, conſpiracy againſt the perſon of the Prince, or the ſtate, and treaſon againſt the places and companies: or manifeſt and open, and theſe are of diuers ſorts. For they bee either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forme of warre and certaine order, as popular commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for ſmall and light occaſions, factions and leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſubiects, of the one againſt the other, in ſmall and great number, great or little; ſeditions of the people againſt the prince or magiſtrate, rebellion againſt the authoritie and head of the Prince: or they are ripe and formed into a warre, and are called ciuill warres: which are of ſo many kindes, as the aboue named troubles and commotions, which are the cauſes, foundations and ſeedes of them: but haue growen, and are come into conſequence and continuance. Of them all wee will ſpeake diſtinctly, and wee will giue aduice and counſell, as well to ſoueraignes, as particular perſons, great and ſmall, how to carrie themſelues wiſely therein.</p>

                     <head>I. Of the euils and accidents that doe threaten vs.</head>
                     <p>IN thoſe croſſe and contrarie accidents, whereunto wee are ſubiect, there are two diuers maners of cariage: &amp; they may be both good, according to the diuers natures both of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and of thoſe to whom they happen. The one is ſtrongly to conteſt, and to oppoſe a mans ſelfe againſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, to remoue all things that may hinder the diuerting thereof, or at leaſt to blunt the point, to dead the blow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, either to eſcape it, or to force it. This requireth a ſtrong and obſtinate mind, and hath need of hard and painfull care. The other is incontinently to take and receiue theſe accidents at the woorſt, and to reſolue himſelfe to beare them ſweetly and patiently, and in the meane time to attend peaceablie whatſoeuer ſhall happen, without tormenting himſelfe, or hindering it. The former ſtudieth how to range the accidents; this himſelfe. That ſeemeth to be more couragious; this more ſure. That continueth in ſuſpence, is toſſed betweene feare and hope; this putteth himſelfe into ſafetie, and lieth ſo low that he cannot fall lower. The loweſt march is the ſureſt, and the ſeat of conſtancie. That laboureth to eſcape; this to ſuffer: and many times this maketh the better bargaine. Often times it falleth out, that there is greater inconuenience and loſſe in pleading and contending, than in loſing; in flying for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than in ſuffering. A couetous man tormenteth himſelfe more than a poore, a zealous than a cuckold. In the former, prudence is more requiſite, becauſe hee is in action; in this patience. But what hindreth, but that a man may performe both in order: and that where prudence and vigilancie can do nothing, there patience may ſucceed? Doubtleſſe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like euils a man muſt aſſay the firſt, which ſuch are bound to do, as haue the charge and can do it; in particular let euerie one chuſe the beſt.</p>

                     <p>THe proper meanes to lighten euils, and to ſweeten paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is not for a man to oppoſe himſelfe, for oppoſition
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:16995:226"/>
enflameth and increaſeth them much more. A man by the iealouſie of contention and contradiction ſharpneth and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the euill: but it is either in diuerting them elſe-where, as Phyſitians vſe to doe, who knowing not how to purge, and wholly to cure a diſeaſe, ſeeke to diuert it into ſome other part leſſe dangerous, which muſt be done ſweetly and inſenſiblie. This is an excellent remedie againſt all euils, and which is practiſed in all things, if a man marke it well, whereby we are made to ſwallow the ſowreſt morſels, yea death it ſelfe, and that inſenſiblie: <hi>abducendus animus eſt ad alia ſtudia, curas, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotia, loci denique mutatione tanquam aegroti non conualeſcentes ſaepe curandus eſt.</hi> As a man counſelleth thoſe that are to paſſe ouer ſome fearefull deepe place, either to ſhut or to diuert their eies. When a man hath occaſion to launce a ſore in a child, he flattereth him, and withdraweth his mind to ſome other matter. A man muſt practiſe the experiment and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of <hi>Hypomenes,</hi> who being to runne with <hi>Atlanta,</hi> a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of excellent beautie, and to loſe his life if he loſt the goale, to marrie the damſell if he woon it, furniſhed himſelfe with three faire apples of gold, which at diuers times he let fall, to ſtay the courſe of the damſell whileſt ſhe tooke them vp, and ſo by diuerting hir, get the aduantage of hir, and gained hir ſelfe: ſo if the conſideration of ſome preſent vnhappie acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or the memorie of any that is paſt do much afflict vs, or ſome violent paſſion, which a man cannot tame, do moue and torment vs, we muſt change and turne our thoughts to ſome thing elſe, and ſubſtitute vnto our ſelues ſome other accident and paſſion leſſe dangerous. If a man cannot vanquiſh it, he muſt eſcape it, goe out of the way, deale cunning lie, or weaken and diſſolue it, with other thoughts and alienations of the mind, yea breake it into many pieces; and all this by diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The other aduice, in the laſt and more dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities that are in a maner paſt hope, is a little to caſt downe the head, to lend vnto the blow, to yeeld vnto neceſſitie, for there is great danger, that by too much obſtinacie in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting at all, a man giueth occaſion to violence to trample all vnder foot. It is better to make the lawes to will that they can, ſince they cannot do that they would. It was a reproch vnto <hi>Cato</hi> to haue been ouer-rough in the ciuill warres of his
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:16995:227"/>
time, and that he rather ſuffered the common-weale to runne into all extremities, than ſuccored it by tying himſelfe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictlie to the lawes. Contrarily <hi>Epaminondas</hi> in a neceſſitie, continued his charge beyond his time, though the law vpon the paine of his life did prohibit him: and <hi>Philopemenes</hi> is commended, that being borne to commaund, he did not only know how to gouerne according to the lawes, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the lawes themſelues, when publike neceſſitie did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. A Leader at a neceſſitie muſt ſtoupe a little, applie himſelfe to the occaſion, turne the table of the law, if not take it away, goe a little out of the way, that he loſe not all; for this is prudence, which is no way contrarie either to reaſon or iuſtice.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 The ſecond aduice is, that he endeuor by clemencie and innocencie to winne the loue of all, euen of his enemies, <hi>fidiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma custodia principis innocentia.</hi> By offending no man, a man taketh a courſe to be offended by none: And it is to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for a man to ſhew his power by wrongs and outrages, <hi>malè vim ſuam potestas aliorum contumelijs experitur.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 The third is to make a good ſhew, to ſhew a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance according to the accuſtomed maner, not changing or depreſſing any thing; and to publiſh in all places, that he is well perſwaded of thoſe meetings and aſſemblies that men appoint, and to make them beleeue that he hath them not in the wind, that he deſcrieth not their plots and purpoſes. This was an experiment which <hi>Denys</hi> the tyrant made good vſe of againſt an enemie of his, which coſt him deere.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The fourth is to attend without aſtoniſhment &amp; trouble whatſoeuer may happen vnto him. <hi>Caeſar</hi> did well put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe theſe three latter meanes, but not the firſt. It is better, ſaith he, to die once, than to liue, nay to die alwaies in a trance, and a continuall feuer of an accident, which is paſt remedie, and muſt be wholly referred vnto God. They that haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken another courſe, and haue endeuored to preuent it by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and reuenge, haue very ſeldome found it the beſt way, and haue not for all that eſcaped the danger, as many Romane Emperours can well witneſſe.</p>

They are enemies to the libertie, good, and peace of all: Iuſtice requireth it. But yet wiſdome and diſcretion is neceſſarie heerein; and a man muſt not alwaies carie himſelfe after one and the ſame maner. Sometimes he muſt execute ſuddainely, eſpeciallie if the number of the conſpiratours be ſmall. But whether the number be little or great, he muſt not
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:16995:228"/>
ſeeke by tortures to know the confederates (if otherwiſe and ſecretlie he may know them, and to make as though he knew them not, is good) for a man ſeeketh that which he would not find. It is ſufficient that by the puniſhment of a ſmall number good ſubiects are conteined in their dutie, and they diuerted from their attempts, that either are not, or thinke not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues bewrayed. To know all by tortures doth perhaps ſtirre vp mens hearts againſt him. Sometimes he muſt delay the puniſhment, but yet neuer be ſlow in procuring his ſafetie. But yet the conſpiratours may be ſuch, and the treaſon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at ſuch a time, that a man muſt not diſſemble, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them inſtantlie is to play and loſe all. The beſt way of all others is, to preuent the conſpiracie, to fruſtrate it, faining ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe not to know the conſpiratours, but ſo to cary him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as if he would prouide for another thing, as the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians did to <hi>Hannon</hi> their Captaine, <hi>optimum &amp; ſolum ſaepe</hi>

                        </note> be hindred nor remedied: It is deſtinie, the will of God, who will chaſtiſe or wholly diſpeople a ſtate. <hi>In ſe magna ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, laetis hunc numina rebus creſcendi poſuere modum.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is well vnderſtood by the wiſe, and may happily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, if men will, and they to whom it appertaineth ſet to their helping hand. This is the diſſolution and generall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of maners, whereby men of no woorth, and that haue nothing to do, endeuor to turne all topſy turuie, to put all into combuſtion, couer their wounds with the hurt of the ſtate, for they loue better to be ouerwhelmed with the publike ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, than their owne particular. <hi>Miſcere cuncta &amp; priuata vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera reipublicae malis operire: nam ita ſe res habet, vt publicaruina quiſque malit quàm ſua proteri, &amp; idem paſſurus minus conspici.</hi>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:16995:232"/>
counſels and remedies in reſpect of the prince, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we now giue them for particular perſons. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be determined in a word: there are two queſtions; the <note place="margin">Two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</note> one, whether it be lawfull for an honeſt man to ioyne himſelfe to one part, or to remaine quiet and indifferent; the ſecond, how a man muſt cary himſelfe in both caſes, that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned to one part, or not ioyned to either. Touching the <note place="margin">The firſt.</note> firſt point, it is propoſed for ſuch as are free, and are not yet ingaged to any part, for if they be, this firſt queſtion belongs not to them, but we ſend them to the ſecond. This I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man may ioyne himſelfe to the one part, not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and by election, yea to that part which he approueth not, but only becauſe he findeth himſelfe caried and bound with ſtrong and puiſant bands, which hee may not eaſily breake, which cary with them a ſufficient excuſe, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and equiualent. Now the firſt queſtion hath contrarie reaſons and examples. It ſeemeth on the one ſide, that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man cannot do better than to keepe himſelfe quiet, for he knoweth not how to betake himſelfe to either part without offence, becauſe all theſe diuiſions are in their owne natures vnlawfull, and cannot be caried, nor ſubſiſt without inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and iniuſtice. And many good people haue abhorred it, as <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> anſwered <hi>Augustus,</hi> who deſired him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him againſt <hi>Marc Anthony.</hi> On the other ſide, is it not a thing reaſonable for a man to ioyne with the good, and ſuch as haue right on their ſide? Wiſe <hi>Solon</hi> hath iudged affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, yea roughlie chaſtiſed him, that retireth himſelfe and taketh not part. The profeſſor of vertue, <hi>Cato</hi> hath likewiſe put it in practice, not being content to take one part, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding it. To determine this doubt, it ſeemeth that men of worth and renowme, who haue both publike charge and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and ſufficiencie in the ſtate, may and ought to range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into that part which they ſhall iudge the better: for they muſt not abandon in a tempeſt the ſterne of that ſhip which in a calme ſea they are content to gouerne; eſpeciallie being an honorable part to prouide for the ſafetie of the ſtate; And ſecondly that priuat men, and ſuch as are of a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the charge of the ſtate, ſhould ſtay and retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into ſome peaceable and ſecure place, during the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:16995:233"/>
and both of them ſo to cary themſelues as ſhall be ſaid heereafter. Finally touching the choice of the part, ſometimes there is no difficultie, for the one is ſo vniuſt, and ſo vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that a man can not with any reaſon ioyne himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: But at another time the difficultie is very great, and there are many things to be thought of beſides the iuſtice and equitie of the parts.</p>
                     <p>Let vs come to the other point, which concerneth the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of all. This is determined in a word, by the counſell and <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> rule of moderation, following the example of <hi>Atticus,</hi> ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed for his modeſtie and prudence in ſuch tempeſts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies held to fauour the good part, yet neuer troubling, nor intangling himſelfe with armes, and without the offence of the contrarie part.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For they that are knowen to be of one part, muſt not be moued ouer-much, but cary themſelues with moderation, not <note place="margin">Outragious.

They that are not ingaged to any part (whoſe condition is ſweeteſt and beſt) though it may be inwardly and in affection they incline rather to one then another, muſt not remaine as neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that is, taking no care of the iſſue, and of the ſtate of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Neuters.</note> the one or the other, liuing to themſelues, and as ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in a Theater, feeding vpon the miſeries of other men. Theſe kind of men are odious to all, and at the laſt they runne a dangerous fortune, as we reade of the Thebanes in the warre of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and of <hi>Iabes Gilead.

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:16995:234"/>
ſheweth and ruleth it according to the paterne of that dutie and loue he oweth towards himſelfe: for as the Hebrews ſay, a man muſt begin charitie with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The beginning then of all iuſtice, the firſt and moſt ancient commaundement, is that of reaſon ouer ſenſualitie. Before a <note place="margin">2 <hi>The firſt and originall iustice.</hi>
                     </note> man can well commaund others, he muſt learne to commaund himſelfe, yeelding vnto reaſon the power of commaunding, and ſubduing the appetite, &amp; making it plaint to obedience. This is the firſt originall, inward, proper, and moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iuſtice that may be. This commaund of the Spirit ouer the brutall and ſenſuall part, from whence the paſſions do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, is compared to an eſquire or horſeman, who by reaſon that he keepeth his horſe and mounteth him often, and is euer in the ſaddle, he turneth and manageth him at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeake of that iuſtice which is outwardly practiſed and with another, we muſt firſt know that there is a two-fold <note place="margin">3 <hi>The distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of iustice.</hi>
                     </note> iuſtice; the one naturall, vniuerſall, noble, philoſophicall; the other after a ſort artificiall, particular, politike, made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the neceſſitie of policies and ſtates; That hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rules, is more firme, pure and beautifull, but it is out of vſe, vnprofitable to the world ſuch as it is; <hi>Veri iuris germanaeque iustitiae ſolidam &amp; expreſſam effigiem nullam tenemus; vmbris &amp; imaginibus vtimur;</hi> is not in a maner capable thereof, as hath been ſaid. That is the rule of <hi>Polycletus,</hi> inflexible, inuariable. This is more looſe and flexible accommodating it ſelfe to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane weaknes, and vulgar neceſſitie. It is the leaden Lesbian rule, which yeeldeth &amp; bendeth it ſelfe as there is need, and as the times, perſons, affaires, &amp; accidents do require. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth vpon a neceſſitie, and approueth many things, which that wholly reiecteth and condemneth. It hath many vices lawfull, and many good actions vnlawfull. That reſpecteth wholly and purely reaſon, honeſtie; This profit, ioyning it as much as may be with honeſtie. Of that, which is but an Idea and in contemplation we ſhall not need to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>The vſuall iuſtice, and which is practiſed in the world, is firſt two-fold, that is to ſay, equall, bound, and reſtrained to <note place="margin">4 <hi>Iustice in practiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</hi>
                     </note> the tearmes of the law; according to which iudges and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are to proceede: the other iuſt and conſcionable, which not enthralling it ſelfe to the words of the law, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:16995:234"/>
more freelie, according to the exegencie of the caſe, yea ſometimes againſt the words of the law. Now to ſpeake better, it handleth and ruleth the law as need requireth: And therefore ſaith a wiſe man, the lawes themſelues and iuſtice haue neede to be ordered and handled iuſtlie, that is to ſay, with equitie, <hi>quae expoſitio &amp; emendatiolegis eſt, exponit ſenſum, emendat defectum.</hi> This is the fine floure of iuſtice, which is in the hand of thoſe that iudge in ſoueraigntie. Againe to ſpeake more particularlie, there is a two-fold iuſtice; the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatiue, betwixt priuat men, which is handled and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Arithmeticke proportion; the other diſtributiue, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely adminiſtred by Geometricall proportion, it hath two parts, reward, and puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now this vſuall and practiſed iuſtice, is not truly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie iuſtice: humane nature is not capable thereof no more <note place="margin">5 There is no true iustice in the world.</note> than of all other things in their puritie. As humane iuſtice is mingled with ſome graine of iniuſtice, fauour, rigour, too much, or too little, and there is no pure and true mediocritie; from whence haue ſprung theſe ancient prouerbs, That he is enforced to do wrong by retaile, that will do iuſtice in groſſe: &amp; iniuſtice in ſmall things that will do iuſtice in great. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to giue courſe and paſſage to commutatiue iuſtice, doe couertlie and ſilentlie ſuffer themſelues to deceiue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that in a certaine meaſure, ſo that they paſſe not the moitie of the iuſt price; and the reaſon is, becauſe they know not how to do better. And in diſtributiue iuſtice, how many innocents are apprehended and condemned, how many guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie quit and ſet at libertie, and that without the fault of the Iudges, neuer dreaming either of that too much, or too little, which is almoſt perpetuall in the pureſt iuſtice? Iuſtice is a let and hindrance to it ſelfe, and humane ſufficiencie cannot ſee and prouide for all. And heere we may take notice among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, of a great defect in diſtributiue iuſtice, in that it puniſheth only and rewardeth not, although theſe are the two parts and the two hands of iuſtice: but as it is commonly practiſed it is ſame, and inclineth wholly vnto puniſhment. The greateſt fauour that a man receiueth from it, is indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which is a play too ſhort for ſuch as deſerue better than the common ſort. But yet this is not all; for if a man bee
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:16995:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
falſely accuſed, and vpon that accuſation committed, he is ſure to endure puniſhment ſufficient: at the laſt his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie being knowne, he eſcapeth perhaps his vttermoſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but without any amends of that wrongfull affliction he hath indured, euen ſuch perhaps as ſhall neuer leaue him. And the accuſer in the meane time, be the colour and ground of his accuſation neuer ſo light (which is eaſie to do) eſcapeth without puniſhment; ſo ſparing is iuſtice in rewarding, as that it conſiſteth wholly in chaſticement, whereof that common ſpeech ariſeth, That to do iuſtice, and to be ſubiect vnto iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is alwaies to be vnderſtood of puniſhment. And it is an eaſie matter for any man that will, to bring another man into danger and puniſhment, euen to ſuch an eſtate, as that he ſhall neuer know which way to get foorth, but with loſſe.</p>
                  <p>Of iuſtice and dutie there are three principall parts: for <note place="margin">6 <hi>The diuiſion of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt and fundamentall aduice is, to reſolue not to liue careleſſie, after an vncertaine faſhion, and by chance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, as almoſt all are accuſtomed to doe, who ſeeme to mocke and deceiue themſelues, and not to liue in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, not leading their life ſeriouſlie and attentiuely, but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from day to day, as it falleth out. They taſte not, they poſſeſſe not, they enioy not their life: but they vſe it to make
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:16995:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vſe of other things. Their deſignments and occupations doe many times trouble, and hurt their life more than doe it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Theſe kind of people doe all things in good earneſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be to liue. All their actions, and the leſſer parts of their life are ſerious, but the whole body thereof paſſeth away as if they thought not thereof: it is a bare ſuppoſition, that is not worth the thinking of. That which is but an accident is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall vnto them, and the principall as an acceſſarie. They affect and incline themſelues to all things, ſome to get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, honours, dignities, riches: others to take their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to hunt, to ſport themſelues, to paſſe away the time; others to ſpeculations, imaginations, inuentions: others to manage and order affaires: others to other things; but to liue is the leaſt they thinke of. They liue as it were inſenſibly, being wholly addicted, and faſtning their thoughts vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. Life is vnto them but as a tearme, and a procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination or delaie to employ it about other things. Now all this is very vniuſt, it is an infelicity and treaſon againſt a mans ſelfe: it is for a man to loſe his life, and to goe againſt that which euery man ſhould doe, that is, liue ſeriouſly, attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and cheerefully, <hi>bene viuere &amp; laetari: ſibi ſemper valere &amp; viuere doctus,</hi> to the end he may liue well, and well die: it is the fault of euery man.

To this firſt and principall aduice, theſe following doe ſerue:</p>
                     <p>To learne to dwell, to content, to delight himſelfe alone, yea to quit himſelfe of the world if need bee; the greateſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thing is for a man to know how to bee to himſelfe; vertue is content with it ſelfe, let vs winne ſo much of our ſelues, as to be able in good earneſt and willingly to liue alone, and to liue at our eaſe. Let vs learne to quit our ſelues of all thoſe bands that faſten and binde vs to another, and that our contentment depend of our ſelues, neither ſeeking nor diſdaining or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing company, but cheerefully to goe on with or without companie, as either our owne, or anothers need do require: but yet not ſo to ſhut vp our ſelues, and to ſettle and eſtabliſh our pleaſure as ſome that are halfe loſt being alone. A man muſt haue within himſelfe wherwith to entertaine &amp; content himſelfe, <hi>&amp; in ſinu ſuo gaudere,</hi> He that hath woon this point pleaſeth himſelfe in all places and in all things. He muſt cary a countenance conformable to the company and the affaires that are in hand and preſent themſelues, and accommodate himſelfe vnto another, be ſad if need be, but inwardly to keep himſelfe one and the ſame: this is the meditation and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which is the nouriſhment and life of the ſpirit, <hi>cuius viuere eſt cogitare.</hi> Now for the benefit of nature, there is not any buſineſſe which we do more often, continue longer, that is more eaſie, more naturall, and more our owne, than to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and to entertaine our thoughts. But this meditation is not in all after one maner, but very diuers, according to the diuerſity of ſpirits. In ſome it is weake, in others ſtrong; in ſome it is languiſhing idleneſſe, a vacancy and want of other buſineſſe. But the greater ſpirits make it their principall vacation and moſt ſerious ſtudy, whereby they are neuer more buſied, nor leſſe alone, (as it is ſaid of <hi>Scipio)</hi> than when they are alone, and quitting themſelues of affaires, in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God himſelfe, who liueth and feedeth himſelfe with his eternall thoughts and meditations. It is the buſineſſe of the goddes (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> from whence doth ſpring both their, <note place="margin">3 <hi>To know and culture himſelfe.</hi>
                        </note> and our bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Now this ſolitary imployment, and this cheerefull enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment

of a mans ſelfe, muſt not be in vanity, much leſſe in any thing that is vitious; but in ſtudy and profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and afterwards in the diligent culture of himſelfe. This is the price agreed, the principall, firſt and plaineſt trauell of euerie man. Hee muſt alwaies watch, taſte, ſound himſelfe, neuer abandon, but be alwaies neere, and keepe himſelfe to himſelfe: and finding that manie things go not well, whether by reaſon of vice, and defect of nature, or the contagion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or other caſuall accident that troubleth him, hee muſt quietlie and ſweetlie correct them, and prouide for them. He muſt reaſon with himſelfe, correct and recall himſelfe coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſlie, and not ſuffer himſelfe to be caried away either with diſdaine or careleſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>He muſt likewiſe in auoiding all idleneſſe, which doth but <note place="margin">4 <hi>To keepe himſelfe in exerciſe.</hi>
                        </note> ruſt and marre both the ſoule and body, keepe himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in breath, in office and exerciſe, but yet not ouer bent, violent and painfull, but aboue all, honeſt, vertuous and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And that he may the better do it, he muſt quit himſelfe of other buſineſſe, and propoſe vnto himſelfe ſuch deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may delight him, conferring with honeſt men, and good bookes, diſpenſing his time well, and well ordering his houres, and not liue tumultuouſlie and by chaunce and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
                     <p>Again, he muſt well husband, and make profit of all things <note place="margin">5 To make vſe of all things.</note> that are preſented vnto him, done, ſaid, and make them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction vnto him, applie them vnto himſelfe, without any ſhew or ſemblance thereof.</p>
                     <p>And to particulariſe a little more, we know that the duty of man towards himſelfe conſiſteth in three points, according <note place="margin">6 <hi>To gouerne his ſpirit, that is, his iudgement.</hi>
                        </note> to his three parts, to rule and gouerne his ſpirit, his body, his goods. Touching his ſpirit (the firſt and principall, whereunto eſpecially do belong theſe generall aduiſements which we are to deliuer) we know that all the motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are reduced to two, to thinke, and to deſire, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the will; whereunto do anſwer ſcience and vertue, the two ornaments of the ſpirit. Touching the former, which is the vnderſtanding, he muſt preſerue it from two things, in ſome ſort contrarie and extreame, that is, ſottiſhneſſe and follie, that is to ſay, from vanities and childiſh follies, on the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:16995:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one ſide; this is to baſtardiſe and to loſe it: it was not made to play the nouice or baboun, <hi>non ad iocum &amp; luſum genitus, ſed ad ſeueritatem potius;</hi> and from phantaſticall, abſurd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant opinions, on the other ſide; this is to pollute and debaſe it. It muſt be fed and entertained with things profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſerious, and furniſhed and indued with ſound, ſweet, and naturall opinions: and ſo much care muſt not be taken to eleuate and mount it, to extend it beyond the reach as to rule, and order it. For order and continencie is the effect of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and which giueth price to the ſoule, and aboue all to be free from preſumption and obſtinacie in opinion; vices very familiar with thoſe that haue any extraordinarie force and vigor of ſpirit; and rather to continue in doubt and ſuſpence, eſpeciallie in things that are doubtfull, and capable of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and reaſons on both parts, not eaſily digeſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. It is an excellent thing, and the ſecureſt way, well to know how to doubt, and to be ignorant, and the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble philoſophers, haue not beene aſhamed to make profeſſion thereof, yea it is the principall fruit and effect of ſcience.</p>
                     <p>Touching the will, it muſt in all things be gouerned and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſubmit it ſelfe to the rule of reaſon, which is the office of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not vnto fleeting inconſtant opinion, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly falſe, and much leſſe vnto paſſion. Theſe are the three that moue and gouerne our ſoules. But yet this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that a wiſe man ruleth and rangeth himſelfe according to nature and reaſon, regardeth his duty, holdeth for apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, and ſuſpects whatſoeuer dependeth vpon opinion, or paſſion: and therfore he liueth in peace, paſſeth away his life cheerefully and pleaſingly, is not ſubiect to repentance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations, changes; becauſe whatſoeuer falleth out, he could neither do, nor chooſe better, and therfore he is neuer kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led nor ſtirred; for reaſon is alwaies peaceable. The foole that ſuffereth himſelfe to bee led by theſe two, doth nothing but wander and warre with himſelfe, and neuer reſteth. He is alwaies readuiſing, changing, mending, repenting, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contented; which, to ſay the truth, belongeth to a wiſe man, who hath reaſon and vertue to make himſelfe ſuch a one. <hi>Nulla placidior quies niſi quam ratio compoſuit.</hi> An honeſt man muſt gouerne and reſpect himſelfe, and feare his reaſon
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:16995:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his conſcience, which is his <hi>bonus genius,</hi> his good ſpirit, in ſuch ſort that hee cannot without ſhame ſtumble in their preſence, <hi>rarum eſt, vt ſatis ſe quiſque vereatur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As touching the bodie, we owe thereunto aſſiſtance, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> conduct or direction. It is follie to goe about to ſeparate and ſunder theſe two principall parts the one from the other; but contrarily it is fit and neceſſarie they be vnited and ioyned together. Nature hath giuen vs a bodie as a neceſſarie inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to life: and it is fit that the ſpirit as the principall ſhould take vpon it the guardianſhip &amp; protection of the bodie. So farre ſhould it be from ſeruing the bodie, which is the moſt baſe, vniuſt, ſhamefull, and burthenſome ſeruitude that is, that it ſhould aſſiſt, counſell it, and be as a husband vnto it. So that it oweth thereunto care, not ſeruice: It muſt handle it as a lord, not as a tyrant; nouriſh it, not pamper it, giuing it to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it liueth not for it, but that it cannot liue heere below without it. This is an inſtruction to the workeman, to know how to vſe, and make vſe of his inſtruments. And it is likewiſe no ſmall aduantage to a man, to know how to vſe his bodie, and to make it a fit inſtrument for the exerciſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Finallie, the bodie is preſerued in good eſtate by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nouriſhment and orderly exerciſe. How the ſpirit muſt haue a part, and beare it companie in thoſe pleaſures that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto it, hath been ſaid before, and ſhall heereafter be ſet downe in the vertue of temperance.</p>
                     <p>Touching goods and the dutie of euery man in this caſe, there are many and diuers offices, for to gather riches, to keep <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> them, to husband them, to employ them, to yeeld vnto them all that is fit, are different ſciences. One is wiſe in the one of them, that in the other vnderſtandeth nothing, neither is it fit he ſhould. The acquiſition of riches hath more parts than the reſt. The employment is more glorious and ambitious. The preſeruation and cuſtodie, which is proper to the woman, is the arbour to couer them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are two extremities alike vitious, to loue and affect riches: to hate and reiect them. By riches I vnderſtand that which is more than enough, and more than is needfull. A wiſe man will do neither of both, according to that wiſh and praier of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Giue me neither riches nor pouertie: but he will
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:16995:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hold them in their place, eſteeming them as they are, a thing of it ſelfe indifferent, matter of good and euill, and to many good things commodious.</p>
                     <p>The euils and miſeries that follow the affecting and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, haue been ſpoken of before. Now in fiue words we ſet downe a rule touching a mediocritie therein. 1. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them, but not to loue them, <hi>ſapiens non amat diuitias, ſed mauult.</hi> As a little man and weake of bodie, would willinglie be higher and ſtronger, but this his deſire is without care or paine vnto himſelfe, ſeeking that without paſſion which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſireth, and fortune knoweth not how to take from him. 2. And much leſſe to ſeeke them at the coſt and dammage of another, or by arte, and bad and baſe meanes, to the end no man ſhould complaine or enuie his gaines. 3. When they come vpon him, entring at an honeſt gate, not to reiect them, but cheerfullie to accept them, and to receiue them into his houſe, not his heart; into his poſſeſſion, not his loue, as being vnworthie thereof. 4. When he poſſeſſeth them, to employ them honeſtlie and diſcreetlie, to the good of other men; that their departure may, at the leaſt, be as honeſt as their entrance. <hi>5.</hi> If they happen to depart without leaue, be loſt or ſtollen from him, that he be not ſorrowfull, but that he ſuffer them to depart with themſelues, without any thing of his, <hi>ſi diuitiae effluxerint, non auferent niſi ſemetipſas.</hi> To conclude, he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to be accepted of God, and is vnworthie his loue, and the profeſſion of vertue, that makes account of the riches of this world.</p>

                  <p>AMitie is a ſacred flame, kindled in our breaſts firſt by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hath expreſſed it firſt heate betweene the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <note place="margin">1 <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>
                     </note> and the wife, parents and children, brothers and ſiſters; and afterwards growing cold hath recouered heate by arte, and the inuention of alliances, companies, fraternities, colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and communities. But foraſmuch as in all this being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into many parts, it was weakned, and mingled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable &amp; pleaſant conſiderations, to the end it might reſtrengthen it ſelfe and grow more feruent, it hath recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it ſelfe, and vnited it owne forces into a narrower roome, betwixt two true friends. And this is perfect amitie, which is ſo much more feruent and ſpirituall than other, by how much the heart is hotter than the liuer, and the bloud than the vaines.</p>
                  <p>Amitie is the ſoule and life of the world, more neceſſarie (ſay the wiſe) than fire and water: <hi>amicitia, neceſſitudo, amici</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it is the ſumme, the ſtaffe, the ſalt of our life: for without it all is darknes, and there is no ioy, no ſtay, no taſte of life: <hi>amicitia iustitiae conſors, naturae vinculum, ciuitatis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidium, ſenectutis ſolatium, vitae humanae portus: ea omnia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, diſcordia cadunt.</hi> And we muſt not thinke that friendſhip <note place="margin">3 <hi>How neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the weale-pub.</hi>
                     </note> is profitable and delightfull to priuat men only, for it is more
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:16995:239"/>
commodious to the weale-publike: it is the true nurſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of humane ſocietie, the preſeruer of ſtates and policies. Neither is it ſuſpected, nor diſpleaſeth any but tyrants and monſters, not becauſe they honor not it in their hearts, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be of that number, for only friendſhip ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to preſerue the world. And if it were euery where in force, there would be no need of a law, which hath not been ordained but as a help, and as a ſecond remedie for want of friendſhip, to the end it might enforce and conſtraine by the authoritie thereof that which for loue and friendſhip ſhould be freelie and voluntarie; but howſoeuer, the law taketh place farre below friendſhip. For friendſhip ruleth the heart, the tongue, the hand, the will, and the effects, the law cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide but for that which is without. This is the reaſon why <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaid, That good law-makers haue euer had more care of friendſhip, than of iuſtice: And becauſe the law and iuſtice do many times loſe their credit, the third remedie and leaſt of all hath been in armes and force, altogether contrarie to the former, which is friendſhip. Thus we ſee by degrees the three meanes of publike gouerment. But loue or friendſhip is worth more than the reſt; for ſecond and ſubſidiarie helps are no way comparable to the firſt and principall.</p>
                  <p>The diuerſitie and diſtinction of friendſhip is great: That of the ancients into foure kinds, Naturall, Sociable, Hoſpitall, <note place="margin">4 <hi>The firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the cauſes.</hi>
                     </note> Venereous, is not ſufficient. We may note three; The firſt is drawne from the cauſes which ingender it, which are foure, nature, vertue, profit, pleaſure, which ſometimes goe together in troope; ſometimes two, or three, and very often one alone: But vertue is the more noble and the ſtronger, for that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and in the heart as friendſhip is: Nature in the bloud, profit in the purſe, pleaſure in ſome part, or ſenſe of the body. So likewiſe vertue is more liberall, more free, and pure, and without it the other cauſes are poore, and idle; and fraile. He that loueth for vertue is neuer weary with louing, and if friendſhip be broken, complaineth not. He that loueth for profit, if it faile, complaineth, and it turneth to his reproch, that when he hath done all he can, he hath loſt all. He that loueth for pleaſure, if his pleaſure ceaſe, his loue ceaſeth with it, and without complaint enſtrangeth himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="431" facs="tcp:16995:239"/>
The ſecond diſtinction which is in regard of the perſons, is <note place="margin">5 2 <hi>Of perſons</hi>
                     </note> in three kinds; the one is in a ſtraight line betweene ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and inferiours, and it is either naturall, as betweene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children, vncles and nephues; or lawfull, as between the prince and the ſubiects, the lord &amp; his vaſſals, the maſter and his ſeruants, the doctor and the diſciple, the prelat or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor and the people. Now this kind to ſpeake properly, is not friendſhip, both becauſe of the great diſparitie that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, which hindreth that inwardnes and familiaritie and entire communication, which is the principall fruit and effect of friendſhip, as likewiſe becauſe of the obligation that is therein, which is the cauſe why there is leſſe libertie and leſſe choice and affection therein. And this is the reaſon why men giue it other names than of friendſhip: for in inferiours there is required of them honor, reſpect, obedience; in ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours care and vigilancie ouer their inferiours. The ſecond kind of friendſhip in regard of the perſons, is in a collaterall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> line betweene equals, or ſuch as are neere equals. And this is likewiſe two-fold, for either it is naturall, as betweene bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſiſters, coſens, and this comes neerer to friendſhip than the former, becauſe there is leſſe diſparitie. But yet there is a bond of nature, which as on the one ſide it knitteth and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſo on the other it looſeth: for by reaſon of goods, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions, and affaires, it is not poſſible but brothers and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke muſt ſometimes differ; Beſides that many times the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencie and relation of humours and wills, which is the eſſence of friendſhip, is not found amongſt them; He is my brother or my kinſman, but yet he is a wicked man, a foole: Or it is free and voluntarie, as betweene companions and friends, who touch not in bloud, and hold of nothing but only of friendſhip and loue: and this is properly and truly friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third kind of friendſhip in regard of the perſons is mixt, and as it were compounded of the other two, whereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is, or it ſhould be more ſtrong; this is matrimoniall of maried couples, which holdeth of loue or friendſhip in a ſtreight line, becauſe of the ſuperioritie of the husband, and the inferioritie of the wife; and of collaterall friendſhip, being both of them companions ioined together by equall bands. And therefore
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:16995:240"/>
the wife was not taken out of the head, nor foote, but the ſide of man. Againe, ſuch as are maried, in all things and by turnes exerciſe and ſhew both theſe friendſhips, that which is in a ſtreight line in publike; for a wiſe woman honoreth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth hir husband; that which is collaterall in priuat, by priuat familiaritie. This matrimoniall friendſhip is likewiſe after another faſhion double and compounded; for it is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall &amp; corporall, which is not in other friendſhips, ſaue only in that which is reproued by all good lawes, and by nature it ſelfe. Matrimoniall friendſhip then is great, ſtrong, and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. There are neuertheleſſe two or three things that ſtay and hinder it, that it cannot attaine to the perfection of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; The one, that there is no part of mariage free but the entrance, for the progreſſe and continuance thereof is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtrained, enforced, I meane in chriſtian mariages; for euery where elſe it is leſſe enforced, by reaſon of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcements which are permitted: The other is the weaknes and inſufficiencie of the wiſe, which can no way correſpond to that perfect conference and communication of thoughts and iudgements: hir ſoule is not ſtrong and conſtant enough to endure the ſtreightnes of a knot ſo faſt, ſo ſtrong, ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: it is as if a man ſhould ſow a ſtrong and courſe peece of cloth to a ſoft and delicate. This filleth not the place, but vaniſheth and is eaſily torne from the other. Againe, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience followeth the friendſhip of maried cupples, that it is mingled with ſo many other ſtrange matters, children, parents of the one ſide &amp; the other, and ſo many other diſtaffe buſines that doe many times trouble and interrupt a liuely affection.</p>
                  <p>The third diſtinction of friendſhip reſpecteth the force and intention, or the weaknes and diminution of friendſhip. <note place="margin">7 3 <hi>Of degrees.</hi>

We ſhall know this better by the portrait &amp; deſcription of perfect friendſhip, which is a very free, plaine, and vniuerſall <note place="margin">9 <hi>The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
                     </note> confuſion of two ſoules. See here three words. 1. A confuſion, not only a coniunction, &amp; ioining together, as of ſolid things, which howſoeuer they be faſtned, mingled, &amp; knit together, may be ſeparated and knowen apart. For the ſoules of men in this perfect amity are in ſuch ſort plunged and drowned the one within the other, that they can no more be diuided, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they, than things liquid that are mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. Very free, and built vpon the pure choice and libertie of the will, without any other obligation, occaſion, or ſtrange cauſe. There is nothing more free and voluntarie than affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 3. Vniuerſall, without any exception of all things, goods, honors, iudgements, thoughts, willes, life. From this vniuerſall and full confuſion it proceedeth, that the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lend or giue to the other, and there is no ſpeech betwixt them of good turnes, obligations, acknowledgements, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, and other the like duties, which are the nouriſhers of common friendſhips, but yet teſtimonies of diuiſion and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as I know not how to thanke my ſelfe for the ſeruice I do vnto my ſelfe, neither doth that loue which I beare vnto my ſelfe increaſe by thoſe ſuccors and helps I giue vnto my ſelfe. And in mariage it ſelfe, to giue ſome reſemblance of this diuine knot, though it come farre ſhort thereof: donations are forbid betweene the husband and the wife: and if there were place for the one to giue vnto the other, he is the giuer that giues cauſe to his friend to expreſſe and imploy his loue, and he receiueth the good turne, that by giuing binds his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion: for the one and the other ſeeking aboue all things euen with a greedie deſire to do good to one another, he that giueth the occaſion and yeeldeth the matter, is he that is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, giuing that contentment to his friend, to effect that which he moſt deſireth.</p>
                  <p>Of this perfect friendſhip and communion, antiquitie yeeldeth ſome examples. <hi>Bloſius</hi> taken for a great friend of <note place="margin">10 <hi>Examples.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> then condemned to die, and being asked what hee would doe for his ſake, and hee anſwering that hee would refuſe nothing, it was demanded what he would doe if <hi>Gracchus</hi> ſhould intreat him to fire the Temples? To whom
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:16995:241"/>
he anſwered, that <hi>Gracchus</hi> would neuer intreat ſuch a matter at his hands, but if he ſhould he would obey him. A verie bold and dangerous anſwer. He might boldlie haue ſaid, that <hi>Gracchus</hi> would neuer haue required ſuch a matter, and that ſhould haue beene his anſwer, for according to this our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, a perfect friend doth not onlie fullie know the will of his friend, which might haue ſufficed for an anſwer, but he holdeth in his ſleeue, and wholly poſſeſſeth it. And in that he added, that if <hi>Gracchus</hi> would haue required it, hee would haue done it, it is as if he had ſaid nothing, it neither altereth nor hurteth his firſt anſwer concerning that aſſurance that he had of the will of <hi>Gracchus.</hi> This of willes and iudgements. 3. Touching goods, There were three friends (this word three is ſome impeachment to our rule, and may make vs thinke that this was no perfect amity) two rich, &amp; one poore charged with an old mother, and a daughter to marrie; this man dying made his will, wherein hee bequeathed to one of his friends his mother to be fed and maintained by him; to the other his daughter, to be married by him, enioining him withall to beſtow vpon hir the beſt dowrie that his ability would affoord, and if it ſhould happen that the one of them ſhould die, he ſhould ſubſtitute the other. The people made themſelues merry with this will or teſtament; the legataries accepted of it with great contentment, and each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vnto them their legacy; but he that had taken the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, departing this life within fiue daies after, the other ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing and remaining the ſole vniuerſall inheritour, did care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie intertaine the mother; and within a few daies after hee married in one day his owne and only daughter, and hir that was bequeathed vnto him, diuiding betwixt them by equall portions all his goods. The wiſe according to this deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on haue iudged that the firſt dying, expreſſed greateſt loue, and was the more liberall, making his friends his heires, and giuing them that contentment, as to employ them for the ſupplie of his wants. 4. Touching life, that hiſtory is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowen of thoſe two friends, wherof the one being condemned by the tyrant to die at a certaine day and houre, he requeſted that giuing baile, hee might in the meane time goe and diſpoſe of his domeſticall affaires, which the tyrant
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:16995:242"/>
agreeing vnto vpon this condition, that if he did not returne by that time his baile ſhould ſuffer the puniſhment. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner deliuered his friend, who entred into priſon vpon that condition: and the time being come, and the friend who was the baile reſoluing to die, his condemned friend failed not to offer himſelfe, and ſo quit his friend of that danger. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the tyrant being more than aſtoniſhed, and deliuering them both from death, deſired them to receiue, and to adopt him in their friendſhip as a third friend.</p>

                  <p>Neuertheleſſe the world is full of treacheries. There are <note place="margin">2 <hi>Fidelity rare</hi>
                     </note> but few that do well and truly keepe their faith. They break it diuers waies, and they perceiue it not. So they find ſome pretext and colour thereof, they thinke they are ſafe enough. Others ſeeke corners, euaſions, ſubtilties; <hi>Quaerunt latebras periurio.</hi> Now to remoue all the difficulties, that are in this matter, and truly to know how a man ſhould carrie himſelfe, <note place="margin">The diuiſion of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> there are foure conſiderations, whereunto all the reſt may be referred: The perſons, as well he that giueth faith, as he that receiueth it; the ſubiect whereof the queſtion is made, and the maner according to which the faith is giuen.</p>
                  <p>As touching him that giueth faith, it is neceſſarie that hee haue power to doe it. If he be ſubiect to another, hee cannot <note place="margin">3 <hi>He that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth faith.</hi>
                     </note> giue it, and hauing giuen it without the leaue and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his maſter, it is of none effect; as it did well appeare in the Tribune <hi>Saturnine</hi> and his complices, who comming foorth of the Capitoll (which they had taken by rebellion)
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:16995:242"/>
vpon the faith giuen by the Conſuls, ſubiects, and officers of the Common-weale, were iuſtly ſlaine. But euery free man muſt keepe his faith, how great and honourable ſo euer he be: yea the greater he is, the more he is bound to keep it, becauſe he is the more free to giue it. And it was well ſaid, That the ſimple word of a prince ſhould be of as great force, as the oth of a priuate man.</p>
                  <p>As touching him to whom faith is giuen, whoſoeuer he be <note place="margin">4 <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it.</hi>
                     </note>, it muſt carefully be kept, and there are but two exceptions which are cleare enough, the one if he receiued it not, and were not contented with it, but demanded other caution and aſſurance. For faith is a ſacred thing, muſt ſimplie bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; otherwiſe it is no more faith, nor truſt, when hoſtages are demanded, ſuerties are giuen; to take gages or cautions with faith, is a thing ridiculous. Hee that is held vnder the guard of men, or wals, if hee eſcape and ſaue himſelfe is not faultie. The reaſon of that Roman is good: <hi>Vult ſibi quiſque credi, &amp; habita fides ipſam ſibi obligat fidem: fides requirit fiduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp; relatiua ſunt.</hi> The other if hauing accepted it, he firſt brake it, <hi>Frangenti fidem, fides frangatur eidem: quando tu me non habes pro Senatore, nec ego te pro Conſule.</hi> A treacherous man deſerueth not by the law of nature that faith ſhould bee kept vnto him, except it be after an agreement, which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the treacherie and maketh reuenge vnlawfull. Now theſe two caſes excepted, a man muſt keepe his faith to whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, to his ſubiect as ſhall be ſaid. 2. To an enemy, witneſſe that act of <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> the proclamation of the Senat of <note place="margin">Cap. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> againſt all thoſe that had beene licenced by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their faith giuen to depart; and <hi>Camillus,</hi> who would not ſo much as make vſe of the treacherie of another, but reſent the children of the <hi>Faliſſians</hi> with their maſter. 3. To a theefe and publike offender, witneſſe that fact of <hi>Pompey</hi> to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and robbers, and of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to <hi>Crocotas.</hi> 4. To the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of religion, according to the example of <hi>Ioſua</hi> againſt the Gabaonites. But faith ought not to be giuen to theſe two latter, theeues and heretickes, or apoſtates, nor taken of them: for we ought not to capitulate, nor to treat wittinglie of peace and alliance with ſuch kind of people, except it bee in extreame neceſſitie, or for the winning of them to the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:16995:243"/>
truth, or for the publike good; but being giuen it ought to be kept.</p>
                  <p>As touching the thing ſubiect, if it be vniuſt or impoſſible, a man is quit: and being vniuſt, it is well done to flie from it, <note place="margin">5 <hi>The ſubiect of faith.</hi>
                     </note> and a double fault to keepe it. All other excuſes beſides theſe two, are of no account, as loſſe, damage, diſpleaſure, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie, difficultie; as the Romanes haue manie times practiſed, who haue reiected many great aduantages to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the breach of faith, <hi>quibus tanta vtilitate fides antiquior</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Liuy.</note> 
                     <hi>fuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the maner of giuing faith, there is ſome doubt: <note place="margin">6 <hi>The maner of giuing faith.</hi>
                     </note> for many thinke that if it haue beene extorted either by force and feare, or by fraud and ſudden ſurpriſe, a man is not bound vnto it, becauſe in both caſes, he that promiſed hath not a will whereby all things are to be iudged. Others are of a contrary opinion: and to ſay the truth, <hi>Ioſua</hi> kept his faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the Gabaonites, though it were extorted from him by a great ſurpriſe, and falſe intelligence, and it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declared that he did therein what he ought to do. And therefore it ſeemeth that a man may ſay, that where there is only a ſimple word and promiſe paſt a man is not bound, but if faith or promiſe giuen bee confirmed and authoriſed by an oath, as in the fact of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> hee is bound to performe it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the name of God: but yet that it is afterwards in iudgement to ſeeke meanes to right himſelfe of that either deceit or violence. Faith giuen with an oath, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the name of God, bindeth more than a ſimple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and the breach thereof which includeth periury with treacherie, is farre worſe. But to thinke to giue aſſurance of faith by new and ſtrange oathes, as many doe, is ſuperfluous amongſt honeſt men, and vnprofitable, if a man will bee diſloyall. The beſt way is to ſweare by the eternall God, the reuenger of thoſe that vainlie vſe his name, and breake their faith.</p>
                  <p>Treachery and periurie is in a certaine ſenſe, more baſe and execrable than atheiſm. The Atheiſt that beleeueth there <note place="margin">7 <hi>Treachery iniurious to God.</hi>
                     </note> is no God, is not ſo iniurious againſt him in thinking there is no God, as he that knoweth him, beleeueth in him, and in mockery and contempt doth periuriouſly abuſe his name.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:16995:243"/>
He that ſweareth to deceiue, mocketh God, and feareth man. It is a leſſe ſinne to contemne God, than to mocke him. The horrour of treachery and periury cannot bee better deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than it was by him that ſaid, It was to giue a teſtimony of the contempt of God, and the feare of men. And what thing is more monſtrous than to be a coward with men, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and valorous with God? Treachery is ſecondly the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and capitall enemy of humane ſociety. For it breaketh <note place="margin">To man.</note> and deſtroieth the band thereof, and all commerce which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the word and promiſes of men, which if it faile we haue nothing elſe to ſticke vnto.</p>
                  <p>To the keeping of faith belongeth the faithfull guard of <note place="margin">8 <hi>To keepe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</hi>
                     </note> the ſecrets of another, which is a charge ful of inconuenience, eſpecially of great perſonages, which though it may wiſely be performed, yet it is good to flie the knowledge of them, as ſometimes that Poet did the ſecrets of <hi>Lyſimachus.</hi> He that takes into his cuſtody the ſecrets of another, drawes a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble vpon him, than he dreams of: for beſides the care that he takes vnto himſelfe, to keepe them well, hee bindes himſelfe to faine, and to deny his owne thoughts, a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry irkſome to a noble and generous heart. Neuertheleſſe hee that takes that charge vpon him, muſt keepe it religiouſly, and to the end he may do it well, and play the good ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he muſt be ſuch a one by nature, not by arte and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

To obſerue place and time; that it be neither in times nor places of feaſting and great ioy, for that were (as they ſay) to trouble the feaſt; nor of ſorrow and aduerſitie, for that were a point of hoſtilitie, and the way to make an end of all; that is rather a fit time to ſuccour and comfort a man. <hi>Crudelis in re aduerſa, obiurgatio, damnare eſt obiurgare, cùm auxilio eſt opus.</hi> King <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus handled by two of his familiar friends, killed them both. 2. Not to reprehend all faults indifferentlie, not ſmall and light offences, this were to be enuious, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, ambitious reprehender; not great and dangerous, which a man of himſelfe doth ſufficientlie feele, and feares a worſe puniſhment to come, this were to make a man thinke he lies in wait to catch him. 3. Secretlie and not before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to the end he make him not aſhamed, as it hapned to a young man, who was ſo much abaſhed, that he was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that he hanged himſelf. And <hi>Plutarch</hi>

is of opinion, that it was for this cauſe that <hi>Alexander</hi> killed his friend <hi>Clitus,</hi> becauſe he reprehended him in companie: but eſpeciallie that it be not before thoſe whoſe good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he that is reprehended deſireth to retaine, and with whom he deſires to continue his credit, as before his wife, his children, his diſciples. 4. Out of a ſimple careleſſe nature and freedome of heart, without any particular intereſt, or paſſion of the mind, be it neuer ſo little. 5. To comprehend himſelfe in the ſame fault, and to vſe generall termes, as, We forget our ſelues; What do we thinke of? 6. To begin with commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to end with proffers of ſeruice and help, this tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the tartneſſe of correction, and giues a better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Such and ſuch a thing becomes you well, but not ſo well ſuch and ſuch a thing. 7. To expreſſe the fault with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words than the nature of the offence doth require; as, You haue not been altogether well aduiſed; in ſteed of, You haue done wickedlie: Receiue not this woman into your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, for ſhe wil vndoe you; in ſteed of, Allure hir not, perſwade hir not to yeeld to your deſires, for thereby you will vndoe your ſelfe: Enter not into diſpute with ſuch a man; in ſteed of, Quarrell not, enuie not ſuch a man. 8. The admonition being ended, be not preſentlie gone, but ſtay and fall into ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common and pleaſant diſcourſe.</p>

And if a prince be once corrupted by flattery, it neceſſarily follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that all that are about him, if they will liue in grace and fauour, muſt be flatterers.

                  <p>There are two ſorts of people ſubiect to be flattered, that is to ſay, ſuch as neuer want people to furniſh them with this <note place="margin">2 <hi>Eſpecially to two ſorts of people.</hi>

                  <p>Flattery is hardlie auoided, and it is a matter of difficultie to be preſerued from it, not only to women by reaſon of their <note place="margin">3 <hi>Hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</hi>
                     </note> weakneſſe, and their natures full of vanitie and deſirous of praiſe; and to princes, becauſe they are their kinſfolke, friends, principall officers, whom they cannot auoid, that profeſſe this myſterie; <hi>(Alexander</hi> that great king and philoſopher could not defend himſelfe from it, and there is not any priuat man that would not yeeld much more vnto it than kings, if he were daily aſſaulted and corrupted by ſuch baſe raſcall ſort of people as they are) but generallie vnto all; yea to the wiſeſt, both by reaſon of the ſweetnes thereof; in ſuch ſort, that though a man withſtand it, yet it pleaſeth, and though he oppoſe himſelfe againſt it, yet he neuer ſhutteth it quite out of dores, <hi>vnde ſaepe excluſa nouiſſimè recipitur;</hi> and becauſe of the hypocriſie thereof, whereby it is hardlie diſcouered: for it is ſo well counterfaited and couered with the viſage of amitie, that it is no eaſie matter to diſcerne it.</p>
                  <p>It vſurpeth the offices, it hath the voice, it carieth the name and counterfait thereof ſo artificiallie, that you will ſay that it <note place="margin">It imitateth and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth amitie, but it is the plague there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> is the ſame. It ſtudieth to content and pleaſe, it honoreth and commendeth; It buſieth it ſelfe much and takes much paines to do ſeruice, it accomodateth it ſelfe to the willes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of men: What more? It takes vpon it euen the higheſt and moſt proper point of amitie, which is to chide, and freely to reprehend. To be briefe, a flatterer will ſeeme to exceede in loue him that he flattereth, whereas contrariwiſe, there is nothing more oppoſite vnto loue, not detraction, not iniurie,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:16995:245"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore not to miſtake it, let vs by the true picture ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <note place="margin">4 <hi>The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis of flattery and amitie.</hi>
                     </note> find out the meanes to know it, and to diſcerne it from true amitie. 1. Flattery reſpecteth for the moſt part it owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular benefit, and thereby it is knowne; but true friendſhip ſeeketh not the good of it ſelfe. 2. The flatterer is changeable and diuers in his iudgements, like wax, or a looking-glaſſe that receiueth all formes: He is a Camelion, a <hi>Polypus:</hi> faine to praiſe or diſpraiſe, and he will do the like, accommodating himſelfe to the mind of him he flattereth. A friend is firme and conſtant. 3. He carrieth himſelfe too violentlie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſlie in all that he doth, in the view and knowledge of him he flattereth, euer praiſing and offering his ſeruice, <hi>non imitatur amicitiam, ſed praeterit.</hi> He hath no moderation in his outward actions, and contrariwiſe inwardlie he hath no affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which are conditions quite contrarie to a true friend. 4. He yeeldeth and alwaies giueth the victorie to him he flattereth, alwaies applauding him, hauing no other end than to pleaſe, in ſuch ſort that he commendeth all and more than all, yea ſometimes to his owne coſt, blaming and humbling himſelfe like a wreſtler, that ſtoopeth the better to ouerthrow his companion. A friend goes roundlie to worke, cares not whether he haue the firſt or the ſecond place, and reſpecteth not ſo much how he may pleaſe, as how he may profit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by faire meanes, or by foule, as a good Phyſitian vſeth to doe to cure his patient. 5. A flatterer ſometimes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpeth the liberty of a friend to reprehend; but it is with the left hand and vntowardly. For he ſtaies himſelfe at ſmall and light matters that are not worthy reprehenſion, faining want of knowledge of any greater; but yet hee will bee rude and rough enough in the cenſuring of the kindred and ſeruants of him he flattereth, as failing much in that duty they ſhould do vnto him. Or he faineth to haue vnderſtood ſome light accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt him, and that hee could not be quiet vntill hee knew the truth thereof, and if it fall out that hee that is flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:16995:246"/>
deny them, or excuſe himſelfe, hee taketh occaſion to commend him the more. I was much aſtoniſhed at it (ſaith he) and I could not beleeue it, for I ſee the contrarie. For how ſhould I thinke that you will take from another man, when you giue all that is your owne, and take more care to giue than to take? Or at leaſtwiſe he will make his reprehenſion to ſerue his turne, that hee may flatter the better, telling him that he takes not care enough of himſelfe, he is not ſparing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of his perſon and preſence ſo neceſſarie to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, as once a Senatour did to <hi>Tiberius</hi> in a full Senat, but with an ill ſent and a bad ſucceſſe. 6. Finally, to conclude in a word, a friend alwaies reſpecteth, procureth, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth that which is reaſon, and honeſty, and dutie; the flatterer that which belongs to paſſion and pleaſure, and that which is already a maladie in the mind of him that is flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And therefore hee is a proper inſtrument for all things that belong to pleaſure and licentious libertie, and not for that which is honeſt or painfull and dangerous. Hee is like an ape, who being vnfit for any other ſeruice, as other beaſts are, ſerues for a play-game and to make ſport.</p>
                  <p>A neere neighbour and alliance to flatterie is lying, a baſe vice; and therefore ſaid an ancient Philoſopher, That it was <note place="margin">5 <hi>Of lying, the fowleneſſe and hurt thereof.</hi>
                     </note> the part of ſlaues to lie, of freemen to ſpeake the truth. For what greater wickedneſſe is there, than for a man to belie his owne knowledge? The firſt ſteppe to the corruption of good maners is the baniſhment of truth, as contrarilie, ſaith <hi>Pindarus,</hi> To be true is the beginning of vertue. It is likewiſe pernicious to humane ſociety. We are not men, neither can we knit and ioine together in humane ſociety, as hath beene ſaid, if this be wanting. Doubtleſſe ſilence is more ſociable, than vntrue ſpeech. If a lie had but one viſage as truth hath, there were ſome remedy for it; for we would take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that which a lier ſpeaketh to bee the certaine truth. But the contrary to truth hath a hundred thouſand figures, and an indefinit &amp; vnlimited field. That which is good, that is to ſay, vertue and verity is finite and certaine, becauſe there is but one way to the marke: That which is euill, that is to ſay, vice and errour, and lying is infinite and vncertaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are a thouſand waies to miſſe the marke. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:16995:246"/>
if men knew the horrour of lying, they would purſue it with ſword and fire. And therfore ſuch as haue the charge of youth are with all inſtance and diligence to hinder it, and to withſtand the firſt birth and progreſſe of this vice, as likewiſe of opinatiue obſtinacy, and that in time, for they neuer leaue growing.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe a couered and diſguiſed lie, which is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and diſſimulation (a notable quality of Courtiers, and <note place="margin">6 <hi>Of hypocriſy</hi>
                     </note> in as great credit amongſt them as vertue) the vice of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and baſe mindes; for a man to diſguiſe and hide himſelfe vnder a maske, as not daring to ſhew himſelf to be that which he is, it is a cowardly and ſeruile humour.</p>
                  <p>Now he that makes profeſſion of this goodly myſterie, liues in great paine; for it is a great vnquietneſſe for a man to <note place="margin">7 <hi>The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof.</hi>
                     </note> endeuour to ſeeme other than that hee is, and to haue an eie vnto himſelfe, for feare leſt he ſhould be diſcouered. It is a torment for a man to hide his owne nature, to be diſcouered, a confuſion. There is no ſuch pleaſure as to liue according to his nature, and it is better to bee leſſe eſteemed and to liue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, than to take ſo much paines to counterfait and liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a canopie; ſo excellent and ſo noble a thing is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>But the myſterie of theſe kind of men is but poore; for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation <note place="margin">8 <hi>The diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</hi>
                     </note> continues not long vndiſcouered, according to that ſaying, Things fained and violent dure not long, and the reward of ſuch people is, that no man will truſt them, nor giue them credit when they ſpeake the truth, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer comes from them is held for apocryphall and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie.</p>
                  <p>Now heere is need of indifferency and wiſdome. For if <note place="margin">9 <hi>The counſell heereupon.</hi>
                     </note> nature be deformed, vitious and offenſiue to another, it muſt bee conſtrained, and to ſpeake better, corrected. There is a difference betweene liuing freely and careleſlie. Againe, a man muſt not alwaies ſpeake all hee knowes, that is a follie, but that which hee ſpeaketh, let it bee that which hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of people in whom diſſimulation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, <note place="margin">10 <hi>Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on befitting women.</hi>
                     </note> yea ſometimes requiſite, but yet for diuers reaſons, that is to ſay, in the prince for the publike benefit, and the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:16995:247"/>
good and peace of himſelfe or the ſtate, as before hath beene ſaid; and in women for the conueniency thereof, becauſe an ouer free and bold libertie becomes them not, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to impudency. Thoſe ſmall diſguiſements, fained ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, hypocriſies, which well befit their ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſtie, deceiue none but fooles, beſeeme them well and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their honors. But yet it is a thing which they are not to take great paines to learne, becauſe hypocriſie is naturall in them. They are wholly made for it, and they all make vſe of it, and too much, their viſage, their veſtments, their words, countenance, laughter, weeping; and they practiſe it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards their husbands liuing, but after their death too. They faine great ſorrow, and many times inwardly laugh. <hi>Iuctantius moerent quae minus dolent.</hi>

It is the worke of an honeſt and generous man to doe good, and to deſerue well of another, yea to ſeeke occaſions thereunto, <hi>liberalis etiam dandi cauſas quaerit.</hi> And it is ſaid that good bloud cannot lie, nor faile at a need.

He, ſaith one, that firſt inuented benefits or good turnes, made ſtockes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles to tie and captiuate another man. And therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue refuſed to take, leſt they ſhould wound their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſpecially from thoſe whom they would not loue, and bee beholding vnto, according to the counſell of the wiſe, which aduiſeth a man not to receiue any thing, from a wicked man, leſt he be thereby bound vnto him. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was woont to ſay, that there came no ſound more pleaſing vnto his eares, than praiers and petitions: It is the mot of greatneſſe, Aske mee, <hi>inuocame in die tribulationis (eruam te) &amp; honorificabis me.</hi> It is likewiſe the moſt noble, and honourable vſe of our meanes or ſubſtance, which ſo long as wee hold and poſſeſſe them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly, they carrie with them baſe and abiect names, houſen, lands, money, but being brought into light, and emploied to the good and comfort of another, they are enobled, with new and glorious titles, benefits, liberalities, magnificences. It is the beſt, and moſt commodious imploiment that may bee: <hi>ars quaeſtuoſiſſima, optima negotiatio,</hi> whereby the principall is aſſured, and the profit is very great. And to ſay the truth, a man hath nothing that is truly his owne, but that which hee giues, for that which he retaines, and keepes to himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits neither himſelfe, nor another; and if he imploy them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they conſume and diminiſh, paſſe through manie dangerous accidents, and at laſt death it ſelfe. But that which is giuen, it can neuer periſh, neuer wax old. And therefore <hi>Marc.

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:16995:248"/>
it is called inhumanity, which proceedeth from a contrarie cauſe, to that of bountie and benefits, that is to ſay, daſtardlie cowardlineſſe, as hath beene ſaid.</p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold maner of doing good vnto another, by profiting and by pleaſing him: for the firſt a man is admired <note place="margin">2 <hi>The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</hi>
                        </note> and eſteemed; for the ſecond beloued. The firſt is farre the better, it regardeth the neceſſitie and want of a man, it is to play the part of a father and true friend. Againe, there are two ſorts of bounties or good turnes, the one are duties, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of a naturall or lawfull obligation; the other are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and free, which proceed out of pure affection.

                        </note> the ſhew thereof, but it is the good will. That which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is many times but ſmall, that which is inward very great; for this hath commonlie with it a kind of hunger and affection, and is alwaies ſeeking occaſions to do good; It gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſo much as it can, and what is needfull, forgetting it owne benefit, <hi>in beneficio hoc ſuſpiciendum quod alteri dedit, ablaturus ſibi, vtilitatis ſuae oblitus.</hi> Contrarily where the gift is great, the grace may be ſmall; for it is commonly giuen with an ill will, with an expectation of much intreatie, and leaſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conſider whether he may giue it or no. This is to make too great preparation thereunto, and too great vſe thereof, to giue it rather to himſelfe, and his ambition, than to the good and neceſſitie of the receiuer. Againe that which is outward may incontinentlie vaniſh, that which is inward remaine firme: The libertie, health, honor, which is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, may all at an inſtant, by ſome accident or other, be taken away, the benefit neuertheleſſe remaining entire.</p>

                        </note> rules and inſtruction of the wiſe, are theſe: Firſt, to whom muſt he giue? to all? It ſeemeth that to do good vnto the wicked and vnworthie, is at one inſtant to commit many faults, for it brings an ill name vpon the giuer, entertaineth
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:16995:248"/>
and kindleth malice, giues that which belongs to vertue and merit, to vice alſo. Doubtleſſe free and fauorable graces are not due, but to the good and worthie; but in a time of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in a generalitie all in common. In theſe two caſes the wicked and vngratefull haue a part, if they be in neceſſitie, or if they be in ſuch ſort mingled with the good, that the one can hardlie receiue without the other. For it is better to do good to thoſe that are vnworthie, for their ſakes that are good, than to depriue the good for their ſakes that are euill. So doth God good vnto all, he ſuffereth the ſunne to ſhine, &amp; the raine to fall indifferentlie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all: But yet his ſpeciall gifts he giueth not but to thoſe whom he hath choſen for his; <hi>non eſt bonum ſumere panem filiorum &amp; proijcere canibus: multum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert vtrùm aliquem non excludas an eligas.</hi> At a need therefore, in a time of affliction and neceſſitie we muſt do good vnto all, <hi>hominibus prodeſſe natura iubet, vbicun<expan>

                     <p>Secondly, he muſt do good willinglie and cheerefullie, <hi>non ex tristitia aut neceſſitate; hilarem datorem diligit deus: Bis eſt</hi>

Graces are ſilken veſtments, tranſparent, free, and not conſtrained.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſpeedily and readily. This ſeemes to depend vpon the former, for benefits are eſteemed according to the <note place="margin">6 3. <hi>Speedily.</hi>
                        </note> will wherewith they are beſtowed; Now he that ſtayes long before he ſuccour and giue, ſeemes to haue beene a long time vnwilling to doe it, <hi>qui tarde fecit, diu noluit.</hi> As contrarily, a readineſſe heerein doubleth the benefit: <hi>bis dat, qui celeriter.</hi> That indifferencie and careleſſe regard, whether it be done, or not done, that is vſed heerein, is not approued by any, but impudent perſons. Diligence muſt bee vſed in all points. Heerein then there is a fiue-fold maner of proceeding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of three are reproued; to refuſe to do a good turne, and that ſlowly too, is a double iniurie: to refuſe ſpeedily, and to giue ſlowly, are almoſt one; And ſome there are that are leſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with a quick deniall; <hi>Minus decipitur cui negatur cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter.</hi> The beſt way then is, to giue ſpeedily; but that which is moſt excellent, is, to anticipate the demaund, to preuent the neceſſitie and the deſire.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, without hope of reſtitution, this is that wherein the force and vertue of a benefit doth principallie conſiſt. If it <note place="margin">7 4. <hi>Without hope of resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
                        </note> be a vertue, it is not mercenarie: <hi>tunc eſt virtus dare beneficia non reditura.</hi> A benefit is leſſe richly beſtowed, where there is a retrogradation and reflexion; but when there is no place for requitall, yea it is not knowne from whence the good turne commeth, there it is in it true luſtre and glorie. If a man looke after the like, he will giue ſlowly and to few. Now it is farre better to renounce all ſuch hopes of like returnes, than to ceaſe to merit, and to do good; for whileſt a man ſeeketh after that ſtrange and accidentall payment, he depriueth himſelfe of the true and naturall, which is that inward ioy and comfort he receiueth in doing good. Againe, he muſt not be twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for one thing. To do wrong, is in it ſelfe a baſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable thing, and there needs no other thing to diſſwade
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:16995:249"/>
a man from it: ſo to deſerue well of another, is an excellent and honorable thing, and there needs no other thing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame a man to it. And in a word, it is not to do good to looke after a like returne, it is to make merchandize &amp; profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>Non eſt beneficium quod in quaestum mittitur.</hi> A man ſhould not confound and mingle together actions ſo diuers: <hi>demus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia, non foeneremus.</hi> It is pitie but ſuch men ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that hope after ſuch requitals: <hi>dignus eſt decipi qui de recipiendo cogitaret, cùm daret.</hi> She is no honeſt woman who either for feare, or the better to inflame, or to draw a man on, refuſeth: <hi>quae quia non licuit non dedit, ipſa dedit.</hi> So hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues nothing that doth good, to receiue good againe. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are pure virgins, without hope of returne, ſaith <hi>Heſiodus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, to do good in a proportion anſwerable to the deſire <note place="margin">8 5. <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deſire of the receiuer.</hi>
                        </note> of a man, and as it may be acceptable to him that receiueth it, to the end he may know and find, that it is truly intended and done vnto him. Concerning which point, you are to know, that there are two ſorts of benefits, the one are honorable to the perſon that receiueth, and therefore they ſhould be done publickly: The other are commodious, ſuch as ſuccour the want, weakneſſe, ſhame, or other neceſſitie of the receiuer. Theſe are to be done ſecretlie, yea if neede be, that he only may take notice that receiueth them; and if it be fit, the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould not know from whence they come (becauſe it may be he is baſhfull, and the knowledge thereof may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him from taking, though his needs be great) it is good and expedient to conceale it from him, and to ſuffer the benefit to drop into his hand, as it were vnawares. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the benefactor know it, and his owne conſcience ſerue him for a witneſſe, which is better than if he had a thouſand lookers on.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, without the hurt and offence of another, and the <note place="margin">9 6. <hi>Without the offence of another.</hi>
                        </note> preiudice of iuſtice: to do good not doing euill: To giue to one at the charge of another, is to ſacrifice the ſonne in the preſence of the father, ſaith a wiſe man.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, wiſely. A man may be ſometimes hindered from anſwering demaunds and petitions, from refuſing or <note place="margin">10 7 <hi>Wiſely.</hi>
                        </note> yeelding vnto them. This difficultie proceedeth from the euill nature of man, eſpeciallie of the petitioner, who vexeth
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:16995:250"/>
himſelfe too much in the enduring of a repulſe, be it neuer ſo iuſt and reaſonable. And this is the reaſon why ſome promiſe and agree to all (a teſtimonie of weakneſſe) yea, when they haue neither power, nor will to performe, and referring the auoiding of this difficultie to the very point of the execution, they hope that many things may happen that may hinder and trouble the performance of their promiſe, and ſo thinke to quit themſelues of their obligation; or if it fall out there be queſtion made thereof, they find excuſes and auoidances, and ſo for that time content the petitioner. But none of all this is to be allowed, for a man ought not to promiſe or agree to any thing, but to that which he can, will, and ought to performe. And finding himſelfe betweene theſe two ſtraits and dangers, either of a bad promiſe, becauſe it is either vniuſt, or ill befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or an abſolute deniall, which may ſtirre vp ſome ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or miſconceit, the counſell is, that he ſalue this matter either by delaying the anſwere, or in ſuch ſort compoſing the promiſe in ſuch generall and doubtfull termes, that they bind not a man preciſely to the performance thereof. But heere is craft and ſubtiltie, farre different from true freedome, but this iniquitie of the petitioner is the cauſe thereof, and he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, it muſt proceed from a manlie heart, and hartie affection, <hi>homo ſum, humani a me nihil alienum puto,</hi> eſpeciallie <note place="margin">11 8. <hi>From a hartie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                        </note> towards thoſe that are afflicted and in want, and this is that which wee call mercie. They that haue not this affection, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>&amp; immanes,</hi> are inhumane, and cary the marks of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men. But yet this muſt proceed from a ſtrong, conſtant, and generous, not a ſoft, effeminate, and troubled mind: for that is a vitious paſſion, and which may fall into a wicked mind, whereof in this place we haue alreadie ſpoken: for there is a good and an euill mercie. A man muſt ſuccour the afflicted, not afflicting himſelfe, and applying the euill vnto himſelfe, derract nothing from equitie, and honor; for God ſaith, that wee muſt not haue pitie of the poore in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſo God and his Saints are ſaid to be mercifull and pitifull.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, it muſt be without boaſting, and ſhew, or publike proclamation thereof, for this is a kind of reproch: Theſe <note place="margin">12 9. <hi>Without boasting.</hi>

kind of vaunts do not only take away the grace, but the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and make a benefit odious, <hi>hoc eſt in odium beneficia perdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is ſaid, that a benefactor muſt forget his good deeds.</p>
                     <p>He muſt continue them, and by new benefits confirme, and renew the old, (this inuiteth the whole world to loue <note place="margin">13 10. <hi>Continue them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                        </note> him, and to ſeeke his loue) and neuer repent himſelfe of the old, howſoeuer it may ſeeme, that he hath caſt his ſeed vpon a barraine and vnthankfull ground, <hi>beneficij tui etiam infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas placeat, nuſquam haec vox, vellem non feciſſe.</hi> An vnthankfull man wrongs none but himſelfe, and a good turne is not loſt by his ingratitude; It is a holy conſecrated thing that cannot be violated, nor extinguiſhed by the vice of another. And it is no reaſon becauſe another is wicked, that therefore a man ſhould ceaſe to be good, or diſcontinue his office: and that which is more, the worke of a noble and generous heart is to continue to do well, to breake and to vanquiſh the malice and ingratitude of another man, and to mend his maners, <hi>optimi viri &amp; ingentis animi eſt tamdiu ferre ingratum, donec feceris gratum: vincit malos pertinax bonitas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, not to trouble, or importune the receiuer in the fruition thereof, as they do who hauing giuen an honor, or an <note place="margin">14 11. <hi>Not to reuoke or trouble a good turne.</hi>
                        </note> office to a man, will afterwards execute it themſelues; or at leaſtwiſe procure them one good, that they may reape ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelues. He that is the receiuer, ought not to indure this, and therefore is not vnthankfull; and the benefactor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faceth the benefit, and cancelleth the obligation. One of our Popes denying a Cardinall an vniuſt boone which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, all eaging vnto him that hee was the cauſe why hee was made Pope, anſwered him, Why then giue me leaue to be Pope, and take not that from me that thou haſt giuen me.</p>
                     <p>After theſe rules and aduiſements concerning good deeds, we muſt know that there are ſome benefits, more acceptable <note place="margin">15 <hi>Distinctions of benefits.</hi>
                        </note> and welcome than others, and which are more or leſſe bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. They are beſt welcome, that proceed from a friendlie hand, from thoſe whom a man is inclined to loue without this occaſion; and contrarily it is a griefe to be obliged vnto him, whom a man likes not, and to whom he would not willingly be indebted. Such benefits alſo are welcome, that come from
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:16995:251"/>
the hand of him, that is any way bound to the receiuer: for heere is a kind of iuſtice and they bind leſſe. Thoſe good deeds that are done in neceſſities, and great extremities, carie with them a greater force; they make a man forget all iniuries and offences paſt, if there were any, and binde more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as contrarilie, the deniall in ſuch a caſe, is very iniurious, and makes a man forget all benefits paſt. Such benefits like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as may be requited with the like, are more gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, than their contraries, which ingender a kind of hate, for he that findeth himſelfe wholly bound, without any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or poſſibility of repaiment, as often as he ſeeth his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, hee thinkes hee ſees a teſtimony of his inabilitie or ingratitude, and it is irkſome to his heart. There are ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, the more honeſt and gratious they are, the more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome are they to the receiuer, if he be a man of credit, as they that tie the conſcience and the will, for they lock faſter, keepe a man in his right memorie, and ſome feare of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and failing his promiſe. A man is a ſafer priſoner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his word, than vnder locke and keie. It is better to be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ciuill and publicke bands, than by the law of honeſtie, and conſcience: two notaries are better than one. I truſt your word and your faith, and conſcience: heere is more honour done to the receiuer; but yet conſtraint faſtneth, ſolliciteth, and preſſeth much more; and heere is more ſafety to the lender, and a man carrieth himſelfe more careleſly, becauſe he doubteth not but that the law, and thoſe outward ties will awaken him, when the time ſhall ſerue. Where there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the will is more looſe, where there is leſſe conſtraint, the will hath leſſe libertie: <hi>quod me ius coget vix a voluntate impetrem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From a benefit proceeds an obligation, and from it a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; <note place="margin">16 Obligation the mother and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or good turne.</note> and ſo it is both the child and the father, the effect, and the cauſe, and there is a twofold obligation, actiue and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue. Parents, princes and ſuperiours, by the dutie of their charge, are bound to do good vnto thoſe that are committed and commended vnto them, either by law or by nature; and generally all men that haue means are bound to releeue thoſe that are in want, or anie affliction whatſoeuer, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of nature. Behold heere the firſt obligation; afterwards
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:16995:251"/>
from benefits or good turnes, whether they be due, and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this firſt obligation, or free and pure merits, ariſeth the ſecond obligation, and diſcharge, whereby the receiuers are bound to an acknowledgement and thankfull requitall. All this is ſignified by <hi>Heſiodus,</hi> who hath made the Graces three in number, holding each other by the hands.</p>
                     <p>The firſt obligation is diſcharged by the good offices of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one that is in anie charge, which ſhall preſentlie be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed <note place="margin">17 The firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and mother.</note> of in the ſecond part, which concerneth particular duties: but yet this obligation is ſtrengthened, and weakned, and leſned accidentallie by the conditions and actions of thoſe that are the receiuers. For their offences, ingratitudes, and vnworthineſſe doe in a maner diſcharge thoſe, that are bound to haue care of them; and a man may almoſt ſay as much of their naturall defects too. A man may iuſtly with leſſe affection loue that child, that kinſman, that ſubiect, that is not onelie wicked and vnworthie, but foule, miſſhapen, crooked, vnfortunate, ill borne; God himſelfe hath abated him much, from their naturall price and eſtimation: but yet a man muſt in this abatement of affection, keepe a iuſtice, and a moderation, for this concerneth not the helpes and ſuccors of neceſſitie, and thoſe offices that are due by publike reaſon, but onlie that attention, and affection which is in the inward obligation.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond obligation, which ariſeth from benefits, is that <note place="margin">18 <hi>The ſecond obligation which is thankfulnes.</hi>
                        </note> which we are to handle, &amp; concerning which, we muſt at this time ſet down ſome rules: 1. the law of dutifull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; thankfulneſſe is naturall, witneſſe beaſts themſelues, not only priuat and domeſticall, but cruell and ſauage, among whom there are many excellent examples of this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, as of the Lion towards the Roman ſlaue. <hi>Officia etiam ferae ſentiunt.</hi> Secondly it is a certaine act of vertue, and a teſtimony of a good mind, and therefore it is more to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed than bountie or benefit, which many times proceeds from abundance, from power, loue of a mans proper intereſt, and very ſeldome from pure vertue, whereas thankfulneſſe ſpringeth alwaies from a good heart; and therefore howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the benefit may be more to be deſired, yet kinde acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement is farre more commendable. Thirdly it is an eaſie
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:16995:252"/>
thing, yea a pleaſant, and that is in the power of euery man. There is nothing more eaſie, than to doe according to nature, nothing more pleaſing, than to be free from bands, and to be at liberty.</p>
                     <p>By that which hath beene ſpoken, it is eaſie to ſee how baſe and vilanous a vice forgetfulneſſe and ingratitude is, <note place="margin">19 <hi>Of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi>
                        </note> how vnpleaſing and odious vnto all men, <hi>Dixeris maledicta cuncta, cum ingratum hominem dixeris;</hi> It is againſt nature, and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaking of his diſciple <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> calleth him an vngratefull mule. It is likewiſe without all excuſe, and cannot come but from a wicked nature, <hi>graue vitium, intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile quod diſſociat homines.</hi> Reuenge which followeth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, <note place="margin">Senec.</note> as ingratitude a good turne, is much more ſtrong and preſſing (for an iniurie inforceth more than a benefit, <hi>altius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriae quàm merita deſcendunt)</hi> it is a very violent paſſion, but yet nothing ſo baſe, ſo deformed a vice as ingratitude. It is like thoſe euils that a man hath, that are not dangerous, but yet are more grieuous and painful than they that are mortall. In reuenge there is ſome ſhew of iuſtice, and a man hides not himſelfe, to worke his will therein; but in ingratitude there is nothing but baſe diſhoneſty and ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Thankefulneſſe or acknowledgement that it may be ſuch <note place="margin">20 <hi>Rules of thankfulnes.</hi>
                        </note> as it ſhould bee, muſt haue theſe conditions. Firſt hee muſt gratiouſly receiue a benefit, with an amiable and cheerefull viſage, and ſpeech, <hi>qui gratè beneficium accepit, primam eius penſionem ſoluit.</hi> Secondly, he muſt neuer forget it, <hi>Ingratiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Senec.</note> 
                        <hi>omnium qui oblitus, nuſquam enim gratus fieri poteſt, cut to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum beneficium elapſum eſt.</hi> The third office is to publiſh it; <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genui</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Idem.</note> 
                        <hi>pudoris eſt fateri per quos profecerimus, &amp; haec quaſi merces authoris.</hi> As a man hath found the heart, and the hand of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <note place="margin">Plin.</note> open to do good, ſo muſt he haue his mouth open to preach and publiſh it, and to the end the memory thereof may be the more firme, and ſolemne, he muſt name the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and that by the name of the benefactor. The fourth office is to make reſtitution, wherein hee muſt obſerue theſe foure conditions: That it be not too ſpeedie, nor too curiouſly; for this carries an ill ſent with it, and it bewraies too great an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to be in debt, and too much haſte to bee quit of that band. And it likewiſe giueth an occaſion to the friend or

Heereof we haue ſpoken more at large in the firſt booke.</p>
                  <p>The other are particular and different, according to that inequalitie that is betwixt them, for thoſe of the husband <note place="margin">2 <hi>Particular duties of the husband.</hi>
                     </note> are: 1. To inſtruct his wife with mildneſſe in all things that belong vnto hir dutie, hir honor and good, and whereof ſhe is capable. 2. To nouriſh hir, whether ſhe brought dowrie with hir or no. 3. To cloath hir. 4. To lie with hir. 5. To loue and defend hir: The two extremities are baſe and vitious, to hold hir vnder like a ſeruant, to make her miſtris by ſubiecting himſelfe vnto hir. And theſe are the principall duties. Theſe follow after, to comfort hir being ſicke, to deliuer hir being captiue, to burie hir being dead, to nouriſh hir liuing, and to prouide for his children he hath had by hir, by his will and teſtament.</p>
                  <p>The duties of the wife, 1. are to giue honor, reuerence, and reſpect to hir husband, as to hir maſter and lord; for ſo haue <note place="margin">3 <hi>Of the wife.</hi>

She that diſchargeth hirſelfe of this dutie honoreth hir ſelfe more than hir husband: and doing otherwiſe, wrongs none but hir ſelfe. 2. To giue obedience in all things iuſt and lawfull; applying and accommodating hir ſelfe to the maners and humours of hir husband; like a true looking-glaſſe, which faithfullie repreſenteth the face, hauing no other particular deſignement, loue, thought, but as the dimenſions and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which haue no other proper action or motion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moue but with the bodie, ſhe applieth hir ſelfe in all things to hir husband. 3.

To keepe the houſe; and therefore ſhe is compared to the Tortuis, and is painted hauing hir feet naked, and eſpeciallie in the abſence of hir husband. For hir husband being farre from hir, ſhe muſt be as it were inuiſible, &amp; contrarie to the Moone (which appeareth in hir greatnes when ſhe is fartheſt from the ſunne) not appeare, but when ſhe comes neere hir ſunne. 5. To be ſilent, and not to ſpeake but with hir husband, or by hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: and foraſmuch as a ſilent woman is a rare thing and hardlie found, ſhe is ſaid to be a pretious gift of God. 6.

It is the only dowrie that ſerueth either to ruinate, or preſerue families, but it is very rare. There are diuers that are couetous, few that are good huſwiues.

It is a happie thing ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi> for a man to goe through his priuat affaires without iniuſtice. There is nothing more beautifull than a houſhold well and peaceably gouerned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is a profeſſion which is not difficult, for he that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any thing elſe, is not vncapable of this; but yet it is carefull, and painefull, and troubleſome, by reaſon of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of affaires, which though they be ſmall and of no great importance, yet foraſmuch as they are common &amp; frequent, and neuer at an end, they do much annoy and wearie a man. Domeſticall thornes prick, becauſe they are ordinarie; but if they come from the principall perſons of the familie, they gaule and exulcerate, and grow remedileſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is a great happines and a fit meane to liue at eaſe, to haue one whom a man may truſt, and vpon whom he may repoſe himſelfe; which that he may the better do, he muſt chooſe one that is true and loyall, and afterwards bind him to do well by that truſt and confidence he putteth in him: <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta fides ipſam obligat fidem; multi fallere docuerunt, dum timent falli; &amp; alijs ius peccandi, ſuspicando dederunt:</hi>

                  <p n="4">4 The principall precepts and counſels that belong to frugalitie, or good husbandrie are theſe: 1. To buy and ſell all things at the beſt times and ſeaſons, that is, when they are beſt and beſt cheape. 2. To take good heed leſt the goods in the houſe bee ſpoiled or miſcarrie, bee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt or caried away; This doth eſpeciallie belong to the woman, to whom <hi>Aristotle</hi> giues this authoritie and care. 3. To prouide firſt and principallie for theſe three, neceſſitie, cleanlineſſe, order: and againe, if there be meanes,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:16995:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome aduiſe to prouide for theſe three too; (but the wiſer ſort wiſh no great paines to bee taken therein: <hi>non ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſed munditer conuinium: plus ſalis quàm ſumptus):</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, pompe, and preparation, exquiſite and rich faſhion. The contrary is many times practiſed in good houſen, where you ſhall haue beds garniſhed with ſilke, embrodered with gold, and but one ſimple couerlid in winter, which were a commoditie farre more neceſſarie. And ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To rule and moderate his charge, which is done by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away ſuperfluities, yet prouiding for neceſſitie, and that which is fit and beſeeming. A ducket in a mans purſe will doe a man more honour and honeſtie, than tenne prodigallie ſpent, ſaith one. Againe (but this requires induſtrie and good ſufficiencie) to make a great ſhew with a little charge, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, not to ſuffer the expence to grow aboue the receit and the income.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To haue a care and an eie ouer all; the vigilancie and preſence of the maſter, ſaith the prouerbe, fatteth the horſe and the land. And in any caſe the maſter and miſtriſſe muſt take a care to conceale their ignorance and inſufficiencie in the affaires of the houſe, and much more their careleſneſſe, making a ſhew as if they attended and thought of nothing elſe. For if officers and ſeruants haue an opinion that their maſters looke not vnto them, they may chance to make his haire grow through his hood.</p>

And there comes not ſo much euill to a weale-publike by the ingratitude of children towards their parents, as by the careleſneſſe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the inſtruction of their children: and therefore with
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:16995:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great reaſon in Lacedemon and other good &amp; politike ſtates, there was a puniſhment and a penaltie laid vpon the parents when the children were ill conditioned. And <hi>Plato</hi> was wont to ſay, that he knew not in what a man ſhould bee more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent than to make a good ſonne. And <hi>Crates</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in choler, To what end doe men take ſo much care in heaping vp goods, and ſo little care of thoſe to whom they ſhall leaue them? It is as much as if a man ſhould take care of his ſhoo and not of his foot. What ſhould hee do with riches that is not wiſe and knowes not how to vſe them? It is like a rich and beautifull ſaddle vpon a iades backe. Parents then are doubly obliged to this duty; both becauſe they are their children, and becauſe they are the tender plants, and hope of the Common-weale: This is to till his owne land together with that of the weale-publicke.</p>
                  <p>Now this office or dutie hath foure ſucceſſiue parts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe foure goods or benefits that a child ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <note place="margin">2 <hi>The diuiſion of the office of parents.</hi>
                     </note> ſucceſſiuely from his parents, life, nouriſhment, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, communication.

                  <p>The firſt, which regardeth the generation, and fruit in the wombe is not accounted of and obſerued with ſuch diligence <note place="margin">3 <hi>The firſt part, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
                     </note> as it ought, although it haue as much part in the good or euill of a child (as well of their bodies as their ſoules) as their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and inſtruction after they are borne and come to ſome growth. This is that that giueth the ſubſiſtence, the temper and temperature, the nature; the other is artificiall and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and if there be a fault committed in this firſt part, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third can hardly repaire it, no more than a fault in the firſt concoction of the ſtomacke, cannot bee mended in the ſecond nor third. We men go vnaduiſedlie and headlong to this copulation, only prouoked thereunto by pleaſure, and a deſire to disburthen our ſelues of that which tickleth and
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:16995:255"/>
preſſeth vs thereunto: if a conception happen thereby, it is by chance, for no man goeth to it warily, and with ſuch deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration and diſpoſition of body as hee ought, and nature doth require. Since then men are made at aduenture, and by chance, it is no maruell if they ſeldome fall out to bee beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, good, ſound, wiſe and well compoſed. Behold then briefly, according to Philoſophy the particular aduiſements touching this firſt point, that is to ſay, the begetting of male children, ſound, wiſe, and iudicious: for that which ſerueth for the one of theſe qualities, ſerues for the other. 1. A man muſt not couple himſelfe with a woman that is of a vile, baſe and diſſolute condition, or of a naughty and vitious compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of body. 2. He muſt abſtaine from this action and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation ſeuen or eight daies. 3. During which time hee is to nouriſh himſelfe with wholſome victuals, more hot and drie than otherwiſe, and ſuch as may concoct well in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. 4. He muſt vſe a more than moderate exerciſe. All this tendeth to this end and purpoſe, that the ſeed may be wel concocted and ſeaſoned, hot and drie, fit and proper for a maſculine, ſound and wiſe temperature. Vagabounds, idle and lazie people, great drinkers, who haue commonly an ill concoction, euer beget effeminate, idle and diſſolute children (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> recounteth of the Scythians.) Againe a man muſt applie himſelfe to this encounter after one maner, a long time after his repaſt, that is to ſay, his bellie being empty, and he faſting (for a full panch performes nothing good either for the mind or for the body) and therefore <hi>Diogenes</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a licentious yong man, for that his father had begotten him being drunke. And the law of the Carthaginians is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Plato,</hi> which enioined a man to abſtaine from <note place="margin">L. 2. de leg.</note> wine that day that he lay with his wife. 6. And not neere the monthly tearmes of a woman, but ſix or ſeuen daies before, or as much after them. 7. And vpon the point of conception and retention of the ſeed, the woman turning and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hirſelfe together vpon the right ſide, let hir ſo reſt for a time. 8. This direction touching the viands and exerciſe muſt be continued during the time of hir burthen.</p>
                  <p>To come to the ſecond point of this office after the birth of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the infant, theſe foure points are to be obſerued. 1. The infant
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:16995:256"/>
muſt be waſhed in warme water, ſomewhat briniſh, to make <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The ſecond part of the office of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> Ezech. 16.</note> the members ſupple and firme, to cleanſe and drie the fleſh &amp; the braine, to ſtrengthen the ſinewes, a very good cuſtome in the Eaſterne parts &amp; among the Iewes. 2. The nurſe if ſhe be to be choſen, let hir be young, of a temperature or comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion the leaſt cold and moiſt that may be, brought vp in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, hard lodging, ſlender diet, hardned againſt cold and heate. I ſay if ſhe be to be choſen, becauſe according to reaſon, and the opinion of the wiſeſt, it ſhould be the mother; and therefore they crie out againſt hir, when ſhe refuſeth this charge, being inuited and as it were bound thereunto by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who to that end hath giuen hir milke and dugs, by the example of beaſts; and that loue and iealouſie that ſhe ought to haue of hir little ones, who receiue a very great hurt by the change of their aliment, now accuſtomed in a ſtranger, and perhaps a bad one too, of a conſtitution quite contrarie to the former, whereby they are not to be accounted mothers but by halfes. <hi>Quod eſt hoc contra naturam imperfectum, ac dimidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum matris genus peperiſſe, &amp; ſtaim ab ſe abieciſſe, aluiſſe in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero</hi>

The nouriſhment beſides the dugge ſhould be goates milke, or rather creame, the moſt ſubtile and aerie part of the milke, ſod with honie and a little ſalt. Theſe are things very fit for the bodie and the mind, by the aduice of all the wiſe and great Phyſitians, Greeks, and Hebrews. <note place="margin">Galen. multis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.

The infant muſt by little and little be accuſtomed and hardned to the aire, to heate and cold: and we are not to be fearefull thereof; for in the Northerne parts of the world they waſh their children ſo ſoone as they come out of the womb of their mothers in cold water, and are neuer the worſe.</p>
                  <p>The two firſt parts of the office of parents we haue ſoone diſpatched; whereby it appeareth, that they are not true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that haue not that care, affection and diligence in theſe
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:16995:256"/>
matters that is fit; for they are the cauſe and occaſion, either by careleſneſſe or otherwiſe, of the death and vntimely birth of their children; and when they are borne they care not for them, but expoſe them to their own fortunes, for which cauſe they are depriued by law of that fatherlie power ouer them that is due vnto them; and the children to the ſhame of their parents are made ſlaues by thoſe that haue nouriſhed them and brought them vp, who are farre from taking care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them from fire and water, and all other croſſes and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that may light vpon them.</p>
                  <p>The third part which concerneth the inſtruction of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">6 <hi>The third part of the office of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
                     </note> we are to handle more ſeriouſlie. So ſoone as this infant is able to goe and to ſpeake, and ſhall begin to employ his mind and his bodie, and that the faculties thereof ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened and ſhew themſelues, the memorie, imagination, reaſon, which begin at the fourth or fift yeare, there muſt be <note place="margin">An instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction very important.</note> a great care and diligence vſed in the well forming thereof: for this firſt tincture and liquor wherewith the mind muſt be ſeaſoned, hath a very great power. It cannot be expreſſed how much this firſt impreſſion and formation of youth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth, euen to the conquering of nature it ſelfe. Nourture, ſaith one, excelleth nature. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made it plaine to all the world, by two little dogs of one litter, but diuerſlie brought vp, to whom preſenting before them in an open place a pot of pottage and a hare, that which was brought vp tenderlie in the houſe fell to the pottage; the other that had beene euer trained vp in hunting, forſooke the pottage andranne after the hare. The force of this inſtruction proceeds from this, that it entreth eaſily, and departeth with difficultie: for being the firſt that entreth, it taketh ſuch place and winneth ſuch <note place="margin">Quint, Senec.</note> credit as a man will, there being no other precedent matter to conteſt with it, or to make head againſt it. This mind then wholly new and neat, ſoft and tender, doth eaſily receiue that impreſſion that a man will giue vnto it, and afterwards doth not eaſily loſe it.</p>
                  <p>Now this is not a thing of ſmall importance, but a man may rather ſay it is the moſt difficult and important that may be. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For who ſeeth not that in a ſtate all depends vpon this?

Almoſt the only ſtates that haue giuen to the lawes the diſcipline of children, were that of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon and Creet: But the moſt excellent diſcipline of the world for youth, was the Spartaine; and therefore <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> perſwaded <hi>Xenophon</hi> to ſend his children thither, for there, ſaith he, they may learne the moſt excellent ſcience of the world, and that is to commaund and to obey well, and there are formed good Lawyers, Emperours at armes, Magiſtrates, Citizens. This youth and their inſtruction they eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things; and therefore <hi>Antipater</hi> demaunding of them fiftie children for hoſtages, they anſwered him, that they had rather giue him twiſe as many men at their ripeſt yeares.</p>
                  <p>Now before we enter into this matter, I will heere giue an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> aduertiſement of ſome weight. There are ſome that take great paines to diſcouer the inclinations of children, and for what imployment they ſhall be moſt fit; but this is a thing ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and ſo vncertaine, that when a man hath beſtowed what coſt, and taken what paines he can, he is commonlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. And therefore not to tie our ſelues to theſe weake and light diuinations and prognoſtications drawne from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their infancie, let vs indeuor to giue them an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vniuerſallie good &amp; profitable, whereby they are made capable, readie, and diſpoſed to whatſoeuer. This is to goe vpon a ſure ground, and to do that which muſt alwaies be done. This ſhall be a good tincture, apt to receiue all others.</p>
                  <p>To make an entrance into this matter, we may referre it vnto three points, the forming of the ſpirit, the ordering of <note place="margin">9 <hi>The diuiſion of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                     </note> the bodie, the ruling of the maners. But before we giue any particular counſell touching theſe three, there are generall aduiſements that belong to the maner of proceeding in this buſineſſe, that ſhew vs how to carie our ſelues worthily and happilie therein, which muſt be firſt knowne as a preamble to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is carefullie to gard his ſoule, and to keepe it neate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

and free from the contagion and corruption of the world, <note place="margin">The firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall aduice touching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. To gard the eares.</note> that it receiue not any blot nor wicked attainture. And the better to do this, he muſt diligentlie keepe the gates, which are the eares eſpeciallie, and then the eies, that is to ſay, giue order, that not any, no not his owne father, come neere vnto him to buz into his eares any thing that is euill. There needs no more but a word, the leaſt diſcourſe that may be, to make an euill almoſt paſt reparation. Gard thine eares aboue all, and then thy eies. And for this cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> was of opinion, that it was not fit that ſeruants and baſe perſons ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine children with diſcourſe, becauſe their talke can be no better than fables, vaine ſpeeches and fooleries, if not worſe. This were to traine vp and to feede thoſe tender yeares with follies and fooleries.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond aduice concerneth not only the perſons that muſt haue charge of this child, but the diſcourſe and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">11 <hi>The ſecond generall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice touching the choice of inſtructors.

Their bookes and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt not be of ſmall, baſe, ſottiſh, friuolous matters, but great and ſerious, noble and generous; ſuch as may rule and inrich the vnderſtanding, opinions, maners; as they that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct a man in the knowledge of our humane condition, the motions and myſteries of our minds, to the end he may know himſelfe and others; ſuch, I ſay, as may teach him what to feare, to loue, to deſire; what paſſion is, what vertue, how he may iudge betwixt ambition and auarice, ſeruitude and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, libertie and licentiouſnes. He is deceiued that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that there is a greater proportion of ſpirit required to the vnderſtanding of thoſe excellent examples of <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> and all the Greeke and Romane hiſtories (which is the moſt beautifull ſcience and knowledge of the world) than to vnderſtand <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and other like vaine and friuolous diſcourſes. That child that can know how many

And therefore we do heere altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemne that cuſtome which is common in all places, to beat and to box, and with ſtrange words and outcries to hazen children, and to keepe them in feare &amp; ſubiection, as the maner is in free-ſchooles &amp; colle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dges. For it is a cuſtome too vniuſt, and as foule a fault, as when a Iudge or Phyſitian ſhall be moued to choler againſt an offender and patient: preiudiciall and quite contrarie to that purpoſe that a man hath, which is to ſtir vp a deſire in them, and to bring them in loue with vertue, wiſdome, ſcience, honeſty. Now this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and rude cariage breeds in children a hatred, horrour and deteſtation of that they ſhould loue; it prouoketh them, makes them head-ſtrong, abateth and taketh away their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in ſuch ſort that their mindes become ſeruile, baſe and ſlauiſh, like their vſage; <hi>Parentes ne prouocetis ad iracundiam ſilios veſtros ne deſpondeant animum.</hi> For ſeeing themſelues <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.</note> thus handled, they neuer performe any thing of woorth, but curſe their maſter and their apprentiſhippe. If they doe that which is required at their hands, it is becauſe the eie of the maſter is alwaies vpon them, it is for feare, and not cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and noblie, and therefore not honeſtly. If they faile and performe not their taske, to ſaue themſelues from the rigour of the puniſhment, they haue recourſe to baſe vnlawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, lies, falſe excuſes, teares of deſpite, flights, triuentings, all worſe than the fault they haue committed.</p>

                  <p>Blowes are for beaſts that vnderſtand not reaſon: iniuries and brawles are for ſlaues. He that is once accuſtomed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is mard for euer. But reaſon the beautie of action, the deſire of honeſty and honour, the approbation of all men, cheerefulneſſe and comfort of heart, and the deteſtation of their contraries, as brutiſhneſſe, baſeneſſe, diſhonour, reproch and the improbation of all men; theſe are the armes, the ſpurs and the bridles of children well borne, and ſuch as a man would make honeſtmen. This is that which a man ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſound in their eares; and if theſe means cannot preuaile, all other of rigour and roughneſſe ſhall neuer do good. That which cannot be done with reaſon, wiſdome, endeuour, ſhall neuer be done by force; and if happily it be done, yet it is to ſmall purpoſe.

We come now to the particular and more expreſſe aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this inſtruction. The firſt head of them is, as wee <note place="margin">13 <hi>Particular aduiſements touching the minde.</hi>
                     </note> haue ſaid, to exerciſe, ſharpen and forme the mind. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there are diuers precepts, but the firſt principall and fundamentall of all others, which reſpecteth the end of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and which I moſt deſire to inculcate, becauſe it is leaſt embraced and followed, and euery man runneth after the contrary, which is a common and ordinarie errour, is, to haue much more, and the chiefe and principall care to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to husband and manure, to vſe the proper good, and much leſſe to get and to endeuour the attainment of that which is ſtrange; to ſtriue and ſtudy more for wiſdome, than for ſcience and arte; rather well to forme the iudgement, and by conſequence the will, and the conſcience, than to fill the memorie, and to inflame the imagination. Theſe are the three miſtreſſe parts of a reaſonable ſoule: But the firſt is the iudgement, as before hath beene diſcourſed, to which place I reſend the Reader. Now the cuſtome of the world is quite contrarie, which runneth wholly after arte, ſcience, and what <note place="margin">L. 1. ca. 7.</note> is acquired. Parents to the end they may make their children wiſe, are at great charge, and their children take great paines, <hi>Vt omnium rerum ſic literarum intemperantiâ laboramus:</hi> and <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> many times all is loſt. But to make them wiſe, honeſt, apt and dexterious, which is a matter of ſmall charge or labour, they take no care at all. What greater folly can there be in the world, than more to admire ſcience, that which is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, memorie, than wiſdome, than nature? Now all commit not this fault with one and the ſame minde; ſome ſimplie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by cuſtome, thinke that wiſdome and ſcience are not things different, or at leaſtwiſe, that they march alwaier to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that it is neceſſarie a man haue the one to attaine the other; theſe kinde of men deſerue to be taught: others goe out of malice, and they thinke they know well enough what they doe, and at what price ſoeuer it be they will haue arte and ſcience: For this is a meane in theſe daies in the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall parts of Europe to get fame, reputation, riches. Theſe kinde of people make of ſcience an arte and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, ſcience mercenarie, pedanticall, baſe and mechanicall. They buie ſcience to ſell it againe. Let vs leaue theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:16995:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as vncureable. Contrariwiſe, I cannot heere but blame the opinion and faſhion of ſome of our gentlemen of Fraunce, (for in other nations this fault is not ſo apparent) who haue knowledge or arte in ſuch diſdaine &amp; contempt, that they do leſſe eſteeme of an honeſt man only for this, becauſe he hath ſtudied: they diſcarde it as a thing that ſeemeth in ſome ſort to impeach their nobilitie. Wherein they ſhew themſelues what they are, ill borne, woorſe aduiſed, and truely ignorant of vertue and honour; which they likewiſe bewray in their cariage, their idleneſſe, their impertinencies, their inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, in their inſolencies, vanities, and barbarities.</p>
                  <p>To teach others, and to diſcouer the fault of all this, we muſt make good two things; The one, that ſcience and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">14 <hi>A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſcience and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                     </note> are things verie different; and that wiſdome is more woorth than all the ſcience or arte of the world; as heauen exceedes the price of the earth, gold of iron: the other, that they are not onely different, but that they ſeldome or neuer goe together, that they commonly hinder one another; he that hath much knowledge or arte is ſeldome wiſe, and he that is wiſe hath not much knowledge. Some exceptions there are heerein, but they are verie rare, and of great, rich, and happie ſpirits. Some there haue beene in times paſt, but in theſe daies there are no more to be found.</p>
                  <p>The better to performe this, we muſt firſt know what ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and wiſdome is. Science is a great heape, or accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">15 <hi>The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and wiſdome.</hi>
                     </note> and prouiſion of the good of another; that is, a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all that a man hath ſeene, heard and read in bookes, that is to ſay, of the excellent ſayings and doings of great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that haue beene of all nations. Now the garner or ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe where this great prouiſion remaineth and is kept, the treaſurie of ſcience and all acquired good, is the memorie. He that hath a good memorie, the fault is his owne if he want knowledge, becauſe he hath the meane. Wiſdome is a ſweet and regular managing of the ſoule. He is wiſe that gouerneth himſelfe in his deſires, thoughts, opinions, ſpeeches, actions, with meaſure and proportion. To be briefe, and in a word, wiſdome is the rule of the ſoule: and that which manageth this rule is the iudgement, which ſeeth, iudgeth, eſteemeth all things: rangeth them as they ought, giuing to euery thing
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:16995:260"/>
that which belongs vnto it. Let vs now ſee their differences and how much wiſdome excels the other.</p>
                  <p>Science is a ſmall and barraine good in reſpect of wiſdome, for it is not only not neceſſarie (for of three parts of the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> two and more haue made little vſe thereof) but it brings with it ſmall profit, and ſerues to little purpoſe. 1. It is no way ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable to the life of a man: How many people rich and poore, great and ſmall, liue pleaſantlie and happilie, that haue neuer heard any ſpeech of ſcience? There are many other things more commodious and ſeruiceable to the life of man, and the maintenance of humane ſocietie, as honor, glorie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, dignitie, which neuertheleſſe are not neceſſarie. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſeruiceable to things naturall, which an ignorant ſot may as well performe, as he that hath beſt knowledge: Nature is a ſufficient miſtriſſe for that. 3. Nor to honeſtie, and to make vs better, <hi>paucis eſt opus literis ad bonam mentem,</hi> nay, it rather hindreth it. He that will marke it well ſhall find not only more honeſt people, but alſo more excellent in all kind of vertue amongſt thoſe that know little, than thoſe that know moſt; witneſſe <hi>Rome,</hi> which was more honeſt being young and ignorant, than when it was old, craftie, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Simplex illa &amp; aperta a virtus in obſcuram &amp; ſolertem ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam verſa eſt.</hi> Science ſerueth not for any thing, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent crafts &amp; ſubtleties, artificiall cunning, deuiſes, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is an enemie to innocencie, which willinglie lodgeth with ſimplicitie and ignorance. Atheiſme errours, ſects, and all the troubles of the world haue riſen from the order of theſe men of arte &amp; knowledge. The firſt temptation of the diuell, ſaith the ſcripture, and the beginning of all euill, and the ruine of mankind, was the opinion and the deſire of knowledge: <hi>Eritis ſicut dij ſcientes bonum &amp; malum.</hi> The Sirenes to deceiue and intrap <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> within their ſnares, offered vnto him the gift of ſcience; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> aduiſeth you all to take heed, <hi>ne quis vos ſeducat per philoſophiam.</hi> One of the ſufficients men of knowledge that euer was, ſpake of Science, as of a thing not <note place="margin">Salomon in his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſt.</note> only vaine, but hurtfull, painfull, and tedious. To be briefe, Science may make vs more humane and courteous, but not more honeſt. 4. Againe, it ſerueth nothing to the ſweetning of our life, or the quitting vs of thoſe euils that oppreſſe vs in
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:16995:260"/>
the world; but contrarily it increaſeth and ſharpneth them, witneſſe children and fooles, ſimple and ignorant perſons, who meaſuring euery thing by the preſent taſte, run thorow them with the leſſe griefe, beare them with better content, than men of greateſt learning and knowledge. Science antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth thoſe euils that come vpon vs, in ſuch ſort that they are ſooner in the ſoule of man by knowledge, than in nature. The wiſeman ſaid, that he that increaſeth knowledge, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes 1. 18.</note> ſorrow: Ignorance is a more fit remedie againſt all euils, <hi>iners malorum remedium ignorantia eſt.</hi> From whence proceed thoſe counſels of our friends, Thinke not of it, put it out of your head and memorie. Is not this to caſt vs into the armes of ignorance, as into the beſt and ſafeſt ſanctuarie that may be? But this is but a mockerie, for to remember and to forget is not in our power. But they would do as Chirurgions vſe to do, who not knowing how to heale a wound, yet ſet a good ſhew vpon it by allaying the paine and bringing it aſleepe. They that counſell men to kill themſelues in their extreame and remedileſſe euils, do they not ſend a man to ignorance, ſtupiditie, inſenſibilitie? Wiſdome is a neceſſarie good, and vniuerſallie commodious for all things: it gouerneth and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all: there is not any thing that can hide, or quit it ſelfe of the iuriſdiction or knowledge thereof: It beareth ſway euery where, in peace, in warre, in publick, in priuat: It ruleth and moderateth euen the inſolent behauiors of men, their ſports, their daunces, their banquets, and is as a bridle vnto them. To conclude, there is nothing that ought not to be done diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie and wiſely; and contrarily, without wiſdome all things fall into trouble and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Science is ſeruile, baſe, and mechanicall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of wiſdome, and a thing borowed with paine. A learned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> man is like a crow deckt with the feathers that he hath ſtollen from other birds. He maketh a great ſhew in the world, but at the charge of another, and he had need to vaile his bonnet often, as a teſtimonie of that honor he giues to thoſe from whom he hath borowed his arte. A wiſe man is like him that liues vpon his owne reuenewes; for wiſdome is properly a mans owne; it is a naturall good well tilled and laboured.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the conditions are diuers, the one more beautifull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>
                     <pb n="470" facs="tcp:16995:261"/>
and more noble than the other. Learning or Science is fierce, preſumptuous, arrogant, opinatiue, indiſcreet, querulous, <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia inflat.</hi> 2. Science is talkatiue, deſirous to ſhew it ſelfe, which neuertheleſſe knowes not how to do any thing, is not actiue, but only fit to ſpeake and to diſcourſe: wiſdom acteth and gouerneth all.</p>
                  <p>Learning then and wiſdome are things very different, and wiſdome of the two the more excellent, more to be eſteemed than ſcience. For it is neceſſarie, profitable to all, vniuerſall, actiue, noble, honeſt, gracious, cheerefull. Science is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, vnneceſſarie, ſeldome profitable, not actiue, ſeruile, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall, melancholicke, opinatiue, preſumptuous.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the other point, and that is, that they are not alwaies together, but contrarily almoſt alwaies ſeparated. <note place="margin">19 <hi>Learning and wiſdome meete not together.</hi>
                     </note> The naturall reaſon, as hath been ſaid, is, that their tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are contrarie. For that of ſcience and memorie is moiſt, and that of wiſdome and iudgement drie. This alſo is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto vs, in that which happened to our firſt parents, who as ſoone as they caſt their eies vpon knowledge, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie deſired it, and ſo were robbed of that wiſdome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they were indued from their beginning; whereof we euery day ſee the like in common experience. The moſt beautifull and floriſhing ſtates, Common-weales, Empires, ancient and moderne, haue beene and are gouerned very wiſely, both in peace and warre, without ſcience. <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt fiue hundred yeares, wherein it floriſhed in vertue and <note place="margin">Wiſdome without ſcience.</note> valour, was without knowledge; and ſo ſoone as it began to be learned, it began to corrupt, to trouble, and ruinate it ſelfe by ciuill warres. The moſt beautifull policie that euer was, the Lacedemonian built by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> from whence haue ſprung the greateſt perſonages of the world, made no profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of learning, and yet it was the ſchoole of vertue and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and was euer victorious ouer <hi>Athens,</hi> the moſt learned citie of the world, the ſchoole of all ſcience, the habitation of the Muſes, the ſtore-houſe of Philoſophers. All thoſe great and floriſhing realmes of the eaſt and weſt Indies, haue ſtood for many ages together without learning, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of bookes or writings. In theſe dayes they learne many things, by the good leaue and aſſiſtance of their new
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:16995:261"/>
maſters, at the expence of their owne libertie, yea their vices and their ſubtilties too, whereof in former times they neuer heard ſpeach. That great, and it may be the greateſt and moſt floriſhing ſtate and Empire which is at this day in the world, is that of that great Lord, who like the Lion of the whole earth, makes himſelfe to be feared of all the Princes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narks of the world; and euen in this ſtate, there is not any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſcience, nor ſchoole, nor permiſſion or allowance to reade, or teach publicklie, no not in matters of religion. What guideth &amp; gouerneth, and maketh this ſtate to proſper thus? It is wiſdome, it is prudence. But come wee to thoſe ſtates wherein learning and ſciences are in credit. Who do gouerne them? Doubtleſſe not the learned. Let vs take for example this our realme, wherein learning and knowledge haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honor than in all the world beſides, and which ſeemeth to haue ſucceeded Greece it ſelfe: The principall officers of this crowne the Conſtable, Marſhall, Admirall, the Secretaries of the ſtate, who diſpatch all affaires, are commonlie men alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether illiterate. And doubtleſſe, many great Lawyers, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Princes haue baniſhed ſcience as the poyſon and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence of a Common-wealth; <hi>Licinius, Valentinian, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, Lycurgus.</hi> And thus wee ſee what wiſdome is without ſcience. Let vs now ſee what ſcience is without wiſdome, which is not hard to doe. Let vs looke a little into thoſe that <note place="margin">Science without wiſdome.</note> make profeſſion of learning, that come from Schooles and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities, and haue their heads full of <hi>Aristotle, Cicero, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolus.</hi> Are there any people in the world more vntoward, more ſottiſh, more vnfit for all things? From hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that prouerb, that when a man would deſcribe a foole, or an vntowardlie perſon, hee calleth him Clerke, Pedante: And to expreſſe a thing ill done, it is the maner to ſay, It is Clearklike done. It ſhould ſeeme that learning doth intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and as it were hammer a mans braines, and makes him to turne ſotte and foole, as king <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaid to <hi>S. Paul, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae</hi>

                     <hi>boni deſunt.</hi> Come to the practiſe, chuſe me one of theſe learned ſchollers, bring him to the common counſell of a citie, or any publike aſſemblie, wherein the affaires of the ſtate are conſulted of, or matter of policie, or houſhold huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, you neuer ſaw a man more aſtoniſhed, he waxeth pale, bluſheth, cougheth, and at laſt knowes not what to ſay. And if he chance to ſpeake, he entreth into a long diſcourſe, of definitions, and diuiſions of <hi>Ariſtotle; ergo</hi> potlead. Marke in the ſelfe-ſame counſell a merchant, a burgeſſe, that neuer heard ſpeake of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he will yeeld a better reaſon, giue a ſounder iudgement and more to purpoſe than theſe ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall doctors.</p>
                  <p>Now it is not enough to haue ſaid, that wiſdome and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeldome concurre and meete together, vnleſſe we ſeeke <note place="margin">20 <hi>The reaſon of this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                     </note> the reaſon and cauſe thereof, not doubting thereby but ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to content and to ſatisfie thoſe, that miſlike what I haue ſaid, or thinke me perhaps an enemie to erudition and learning. The queſtion thereof is, from whence it commeth that learning and wiſdome doe ſeldome encounter and meete together in one and the ſame man: And there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould mooue this queſtion: for it is a ſtrange thing and againſt reaſon, that a man the more learned he is, ſhould not be the more wiſe, learning and knowledge being a proper meanes, and inſtrument vnto wiſdome Behold therefore two men, the one a ſtudent, the other none; he that hath ſtudied, is in ſome ſort bound to be farre the wiſer of the two, becauſe he hath all that the other hath, that is, nature, reaſon, iudgement, ſpirit; and beſides theſe the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, diſcourſes, iudgements of all the greateſt men of the world, by reading their books. Is there not then great reaſon, he ſhould be much more wiſe, more dexterious, more honeſt than the other, ſince that with theſe proper and naturall meanes, he attaineth ſo manie extraordinarie on euerie ſide? For as one ſaith well, the naturall good cohering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the accidentall frameth an excellent compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and yet neuertheleſſe, we ſee the contrarie, as hath beene ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now the true reaſon and anſwer to all this, is the euill and ſiniſter maner of ſtudie and ill inſtruction. They learne our <note place="margin">21 <hi>An anſwer</hi>

of bookes and ſchooles excellent knowledge, but with ill <note place="margin">to ill diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> meanes, and as bad ſucceſſe. Whereby it comes to paſſe, that all their ſtudie profiteth them nothing at all, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine indigent and poore, in the midſt of their plentie and riches, and like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> die for hunger in the midſt of their dainties: the reaſon is, becauſe whileſt they pore vpon their bookes, they reſpect nothing ſo much as to ſtuffe and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their memories with that which they read and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and preſently they thinke themſelues wiſe: like him that put his bread into his pocket and not into his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when his pocket was full, died for hunger. And ſo with a memory fully ſtuffed, they continue fooles; <hi>Student non ſibi &amp; vitae, ſed alijs &amp; ſcholae.</hi> They prepare themſelues to be reporters; <hi>Cicero</hi> hath ſaid it, <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato</hi> hath left it in writing, &amp;c. but they for their parts know nothing. Theſe men commit a double fault, the one in that they apply not that which they learne, to themſelues, that ſo they may forme themſelues vnto vertue, wiſdome, reſolution, by which meanes their knowledge is vnprofitable vnto them: the other is, that during all that time, which with great paines and charge they employ, to the heaping together and poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keting vp for another without any profit to themſelues, whatſoeuer they can robbe from other men, they ſuffer their owne proper good to fall to the ground, and neuer put it in practiſe. They on the other ſide that ſtudie not, hauing no recourſe vnto another, take a care to husband their naturall gifts, and ſo prooue many times the better, the more wiſe, and reſolute, though leſſe learned, leſſe gainers, leſſe glorious. One there is that hath ſaid as much, though otherwiſe and more briefly; That learning marreth weake wits and ſpirits, perfecteth the ſtrong and naturall.</p>
                  <p>Now hearken to that counſell that I giue heereupon; A man muſt not giue himſelfe to the gathering and keeping <note place="margin">22 <hi>Good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi>
                     </note> the opinions and knowledges of another, to the end he may afterwards make report of them, or vſe them for ſhew or oſtentation, or ſome baſe and mercenary profit; but he muſt vſe them ſo, as that he may make them his owne. He muſt not onely lodge them in his minde, but incorporate and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiate them into himſelfe. He muſt not onely water his
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:16995:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
minde with the deaw of knowledge, but he muſt make it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially better, wiſe, ſtrong, good, couragious; otherwiſe to what end ſerueth ſtudie? <hi>Non paranda nobis ſolùm, ſed fruenda ſapientia eſt.</hi> He muſt not doe as it is the maner of thoſe that make garlands, who picke heere and there whole flowers, and ſo carry them away to make noſe-gaies, and afterwards preſents, heape together out of that booke and out of this booke many good things, to make a faire and a goodly ſhew to others; but he muſt do as bees vſe to do, who carie not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the flowers, but ſettle themſelues vpon them, like a hen that couereth hir chicken, and draweth from them their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, force, vertue, quinteſſence, and nouriſhing themſelues, turne them into their owne ſubſtance, and afterwards make good and ſweet honie, which is all their owne; and it is no more either thyme or ſweet mariarom. So muſt a man gather from bookes the marrow and ſpirit (neuer enthrawling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much as to retaine the words by heart, as many vſe to do, much leſſe the place, the booke, the chapter; that is a ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and vaine ſuperſtition and vanitie, and makes him loſe the principall) and hauing ſucked and drawne the good, feed his mind therewith, informe his iudgement, inſtruct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his conſcience and his opinions, rectifie his will; and in a word, frame vnto himſelfe a worke wholly his owne, that is to ſay, an honeſt man, wiſe, aduiſed, reſolute. <hi>Non ad pompam nec ad ſpeciem, nec vt nomine magnifico ſequi otium velis, ſed quo</hi>

All the reſt are vaine and frothie, and we are not to dwell vpon them, but to take them as paſſing by.</p>
                  <p>This end of the inſtruction of youth and compariſon of learning and wiſdome, hath held me too long, by reaſon of <note place="margin">24 3 <hi>The means to learne.</hi>
                     </note> the conteſtation. Let vs now proceede to the other parts and aduiſements of this inſtruction. The meanes of inſtructions are diuers, eſpeciallie of two ſorts; the one by word, that is to <note place="margin">By word of mouth.</note>
                     <pb n="475" facs="tcp:16995:263"/>
ſay, by precepts, inſtructions, and lectures; or elſe by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with honeſt and able men, filing and refining our wits againſt theirs, as iron is cleanſed and beautified by the file; This meanes and maner is very pleaſing and agreeable to nature.</p>
                  <p>The other by action, that is, example, which is gotten not <note place="margin">25 <hi>By example.</hi>
                     </note> only from good men by imitation, and ſimilitude, but alſo wicked, by diſagreement in opinions; For ſome there are that learne better by the oppoſition and horror of that euill they ſee in another. It is a ſpeciall vſe of Iuſtice, to condemne one, that he may ſerue for an example vnto others. And old <hi>Cato</hi> was wont to ſay, That wiſe men may learne more of fooles, than fooles of wiſe men. The Lacedemonians the better to diſſwade their children from drunkenneſſe, made their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants drunken before their faces, to the end that ſeeing how horrible a ſpectacle a drunken man was, they ſhould the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deteſt it.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſecond meanes or maner by example, teacheth vs with more eaſe and more delight. To learne by precepts <note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe two.</note> is a long way, becauſe it is a painefull thing to vnderſtand well, and vnderſtanding to retaine well, and retaining to vſe and practiſe well. And hardlie can we promiſe our ſelues to reape that fruit which they promiſe vnto vs. But example and imitation teach vs aboue the worke or action it ſelfe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite vs with much more ardour, and promiſe vnto vs that glorie which we learne to imitate. The ſeed that is caſt into the earth draweth vnto it ſelfe in the end the qualitie of that earth whereunto it is tranſported, and becomes like vnto that which doth there naturallie grow: So the ſpirits and maners of men conforme themſelues to thoſe with whom they commonlie conuerſe.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe two maners of profiting by ſpeech and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <note place="margin">26 <hi>From the liuing.</hi>
                     </note> are likewiſe twofold, for they are drawne from excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſonages, either liuing, by their ſenſible and outward frequentation and conference; or dead, by the reading of their bookes. The firſt, that is the commerce with the liuing, is more liuely and more naturall, it is a fruitfull exerciſe of life, which was much in vſe amongſt the ancients, yea the Greeks themſelues, but it is caſuall depending on another, and rare:
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:16995:264"/>
It is a difficult matter to meete with ſuch people, and more difficult to make vſe of them. And this is practiſed either by keeping home, or by trauelling &amp; viſiting ſtrange countries, not to be fed with vanities as the moſt do, but to carie with them the knowledge and conſideration eſpeciallie of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and cuſtomes of thoſe nations. This is a profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, the bodie is neither idle, nor tyred with labour, for this moderate agitation keepes a man in breath, the mind is in continuall exerciſe, by marking things knowen and new. There is not a better ſchoole to forme the life of man, than to ſee the diuerſitie of ſo many other liues, and to taſte a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruall varietie of the formes of our nature.</p>
                  <p>The other commerce with the dead by the benefit of their bookes, is more ſure, and more neere vnto vs, more conſtant, <note place="margin">27 <hi>From the dead by bookes.</hi>
                     </note> and leſſe chargeable. He that knowes how to make vſe of them, receiueth thereby great pleaſure, great comfort. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth vs of the burthen of a tedious idleneſſe, it withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs from fond imaginations, and other outward things, that vex and trouble vs: It counſelleth vs, and comforteth vs in our griefes and afflictions: but yet it is only good for the mind, whereby the bodie remaineth without action, altereth and languiſheth.</p>
                  <p>We muſt now ſpeake of that order of proceeding and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie which a teacher of youth muſt keepe, that he may <note place="margin">28 4 <hi>To make the ſcholler to ſpeake and to reaſon.</hi>
                     </note> happilie ariue to his propoſed end. It hath many parts; we will touch ſome of them. Firſt, hee muſt often examin his ſcholler, aske his iudgement and opinion of whatſoeuer ſhall preſent it ſelfe vnto him. This is quite contrarie to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſtile, which is, that the maſter do alwaies ſpeake and teach his child with authoritie, and worke into his head as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veſſell, whatſoeuer he will, in ſo much that children are only auditours and receiuers, which maner of teaching I can not commend, <hi>obeſt plerun<expan>

                        </expan> ijs, qui diſcere volunt, authoritas eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum qui docent.</hi> Their ſpirits muſt be awakened and inflamed by demaunds, make them firſt to giue their opinions, and then giue them the ſame libertie, to aske others, to enquire and to open the way at their owne will. If without queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them a man ſpeake wholly vnto them, it is a labour in a maner loſt, the child is not profited thereby, becauſe he
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:16995:264"/>
thinks it belongs not vnto him, ſo long as he yeelds not an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof; he lends only his eares and thoſe coldly too; he ſets not forward with ſo good a paſe, as when he is a partie in the buſineſſe. Neither is it enough to make them giue their iudgement, but that they maintaine it, and be able to giue a reaſon of their ſaying, to the end that they ſpeake not by rote, but that they be attentiue, and carefull of that they ſpeake: and to giue them the better incouragement thereunto, a man muſt not ſeeme to neglect that they ſay, but commend at the leaſt their good eſſay and indeuor. This forme of teaching by queſtions and demaunds is excellentlie obſerued both by <hi>Socrates</hi> (the principall in this buſineſſe) as wee ſee euery where in <hi>Plato,</hi> where by a long connexion and enfolding of demaunds wittilie and dexteriouſlie made, he ſweetlie leadeth a man to the cloſet of veritie; and alſo by the Doctor of veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 22. Luk. 10. &amp; 24.</note> in his Goſpell. Now theſe queſtions muſt not be only of things touching ſcience and memorie, as hath been ſaid, but matter of iudgement. For to this exerciſe all things may ſerue, euen the leaſt that are, as the follies of a Laquey, the malice of a Page, a diſcourſe at table: for the worke of iudgement is not to handle and to vnderſtand great and high matters, but iuſtlie to weigh them, and conſider of them whatſoeuer they bee. Queſtions therefore muſt bee mooued touching the iudgement of men and their actions, and by reaſon determined, to the end that thereby men may frame their iudgement and their conſcience. The tutor or inſtructor of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> for a lecture propoſed this queſtion; A great youth hauing a little coat or caſſocke, gaue it to one of his companions of a leſſe ſtature, and tooke from him his caſſocke, which was the greater: vpon which fact he demanded his iudgement. <hi>Cyrus</hi> anſwered, that it was wel, becauſe both of them were thereby the better fitted. But his maſter reprehended him ſharpely for it, becauſe hee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered onely the fitneſſe and conueniencie thereof, and not the iuſtice, which ſhould firſt and eſpecially haue beene thought of, which was, that no man may be enforced in that which was his owne. And this no doubt is an excellent maner of inſtruction. And though a man may recite authorities out of books, the ſayings of <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> yet it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:16995:265"/>
to recite them, but to iudge of them, and ſo to frame and faſhion them to all vſes, and to apply them to diuers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. It is not enough to report as a hiſtorie, that <hi>Cato</hi> kilde himſelfe at <hi>Vtique,</hi> that he might not fall into the hands of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> were the authors of the death of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> for this is the leaſt: but I will that he proceed and iudge, whether they did well heerein or no; whether they deſerued well of the common-weale; whether they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelues therein according to wiſdome, iuſtice, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and wherein they did ill, wherein well. Finally and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, in all theſe diſcourſes, demands, anſwers, the conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie, order, veritie, muſt be inquired into, a worke of iudgement &amp; conſcience. Theſe things a man by any means muſt not diſſemble, but euer preſſe them, and hold him ſubiect vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he muſt accuſtome and frame him to an honeſt curioſity to know all things; whereby he muſt firſt haue his <note place="margin">29 5 <hi>An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſement touching ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</hi>
                     </note> eies vpon euery thing, the better to conſider all that may be ſaide, done or attempted concerning himſelfe, and nothing muſt paſſe his hands, before it paſſe and repaſſe his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then he muſt make an enquirie into other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well of right as of action. He that enquireth after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, knowes nothing, ſaith one; He that buſieth not his minde, ſuffereth it to ruſt, and becomes a foole; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt make profit of all, apply euery thing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, take aduice and counſell, as well of what is paſt, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee the errour he hath committed, as of that which is to come, the better to rule and to direct himſelfe. Children muſt not be ſuffered to be idle, to bring themſelues aſleepe, to entertaine themſelues with their owne prattle; for want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiencie to furniſh themſelues with good and worthy matter, they will feed vpon vanities; they muſt therefore be alwaies buſied in ſome imploiment, and kept in breath, and this curioſitie muſt be ingendred in them, the better to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, and to ſpurre them forward, which being ſuch as is ſaid, ſhall be neither vaine in it ſelfe, nor tedious to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>He muſt likewiſe faſhion and mould his ſpirit to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paterne and modell of the world and of nature, make it <note place="margin">30 6 <hi>Aduice.</hi>

vniuerſall, that is to ſay, repreſent vnto him in all things, the vniuerſall face of nature: that the whole world may be his booke: that of what ſubiect ſoeuer a man talke, he caſt his eie and his thought vpon the large immenſitie of the world, vpon ſo many different faſhions and opinions, which haue beene, and are in the world touching that ſubiect. The moſt excellent and noble mindes, are the more vniuerſall and more free; and by this meanes the minde is contented, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be aſtoniſhed at any thing, is formed to a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtedfaſt conſtancie. To be breefe, ſuch a man doth no more admire any thing, which is the higheſt and laſt point of wiſdome. For whatſoeuer doth happen, or a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto him, he eaſily findeth that there is nothing in the world either new or ſtrange; that the condition of man is capable of all things; that they haue come from others, and that elſewhere diuers things paſſe more ſtrange, more great. And in this ſenſe it was that wiſe <hi>Socrates</hi> called himſelfe a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of the world. And contrarily, there is not any thing that doth more depraue and enthraule the minde of man, than to make him taſte and vnderſtand but one certaine opinion, beleefe, and maner of life. What greater follie or weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can there be, than to thinke that all the world walketh, beleeueth, ſpeaketh, doth, liueth and dieth according to the maner of his countrey? like thoſe barde block-heads, who when they heare one recite the maners and opinions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countries, very different and contrarie to theirs, they tremble for feare, and beleeue them not; or elſe doe abſurdly condemne them as barbarous, ſo much are they enthralled and tied to their cradell, a kinde of people brought vp (as they ſay) in a bottle, that neuer ſaw any thing but through a hole. Now this vniuerſall ſpirit muſt be attained by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the maſter or teacher, afterwards by trauell, and communication with ſtrangers, and the reading of bookes and the hiſtories of all nations.</p>
                  <p>Finally, he muſt teach him to take nothing vpon credit and by authoritie: this is to make himſelfe a beaſt, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> ſuffer himſelfe to be ledde by the noſe like an oxe; but to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all things with reaſon, to propoſe all things, and then to giue him leaue to chuſe. And if he know not how to chuſe,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:16995:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but doubt, which perhaps is the better, ſounder, and ſurer courſe, to teach him likewiſe to reſolue of nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but rather to diſtruſt his owne iudgement.</p>
                  <p>After the minde comes the body, whereof there muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be a care taken, at one and the ſame inſtant with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <note place="margin">32 <hi>An aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body.</hi>
                     </note> not making two works thereof. Both of them make an entire man. Now a maſter muſt endeuour to keepe his childe free from delicacie and pride in apparrell, in ſleeping, eating, drinking; he muſt bring him vp hardly to labour and pains; accuſtome him to heat and cold, winde and weather, yea and vnto hazards too; harden his muſcles and his ſinewes, as well as his minde, to labour, and then to paine and griefe too; For the firſt diſpoſeth to the ſecond, <hi>Labor callum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducit dolori.</hi> To be briefe, he muſt endeuour to make him luſtie and vigorous, indifferent to all kinde of viands. All this ſerueth not onely for his health, but for publike affaires and ſeruices.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the third head which concerneth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, wherein both body and ſoule haue a part. This is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; <note place="margin">33 3 <hi>An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſement touching maners.</hi>

it is very neceſſarie that a childe neuer haue his will by ſuch froward meanes, and that he learne and finde that theſe qualities are altogether vnprofitable and bootleſſe, yea baſe and villanous; and for this cauſe he muſt neuer be flattered, for that marreth and corrupteth him, teacheth him to be ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and froward, if he haue not his will, and in the end ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him inſolent, that a man ſhall neuer worke any good vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>Nihil magis reddit iracundos, quàm educatio mollis &amp; blanda.</hi>
                  </p>

Hereof hath beene ſpoken elſe-where. And thus the three heads of the duties of parents towards their children are diſpatched.</p>
                  <p>The fourth concerneth their affection and communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, when they are great and capable of that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <note place="margin">36 <hi>The fourth part tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the dutie of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
                     </note> they were inſtructed. We know that affection is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall and naturall betwixt parents and their children, but that of parents towards their children is farre more ſtrong and more naturall, becauſe it is giuen by nature to loue thoſe things that are comming on to the maintenance and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <note place="margin">The loue of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the loue of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> of the world, eſpeciallie thoſe in whom a man doth liue when he is dead. That of children towards their parents is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde, and therefore it goeth not ſo ſtronglie, nor ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie; and it ſeemeth rather to be the paiment of a debt, and a thankfull acknowledgement of a benefit receiued, than a pure, free, ſimple, and naturall loue. Moreouer, he that giueth and doth good, loueth more than he that receiueth and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted: And therefore a father and euery agent that doth good to another, loueth more than he is beloued. The reaſons of this propoſition are many. All loue to be (which being is exerciſed and demonſtrated in motion and action.) Now he that giueth, and doth good to another, is after a ſort in him that receiueth. He that giueth and doth good to another, doth that which is honeſt and honorable; he that receiueth doth none of this: honeſtie is for the firſt, profit for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Now honeſtie is farre more worthie, firme, ſtable, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, than profit, which in a moment vaniſheth. Againe, thoſe things are moſt beloued that coſt vs moſt; that is dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt vnto vs, which we come more dearely by. Now to beget, to nouriſh, to bring vp, is a matter of greater charge than to receiue all theſe.</p>
                  <p>This loue of parents is two-fold, though alwaies naturall, yet after a diuers maner: the one is ſimplie and vniuerſallie <note place="margin">37 <hi>The loue of parents two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</hi>
                     </note> naturall, and as a ſimple inſtinct which is common with beaſts, according to which parents loue and cheriſh their children, though deformed, ſtammering, halting, milke-ſops, and vſe them like moppets, or little apes. This loue is not truly humane. Man indued with reaſon, muſt not ſeruilelie ſubiect himſelfe vnto nature as beaſts do, but follow it more
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:16995:267"/>
noblie with diſcourſe of reaſon. The other then is more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and reaſonable, whereby a man loueth his children more or leſſe, according to that meaſure wherein he ſeeth the ſeeds and ſparks of vertue, goodnes, and towardlineſſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and ſpring vp in them. Some there are who being beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and caried with the former kind of affection, haue but little of this, and neuer complaining of the charge ſo long as their children are but ſmall, complaine thereof when they come to their growth, &amp; begin to profit. It ſeemeth that they are in a ſort offended and vexed to ſee them to grow and ſet forward in honeſt courſes that they may become honeſt men: Theſe parents are brutiſh and inhumane.</p>
                  <p>Now according to this ſecond, true, and fatherlie loue in <note place="margin">38 <hi>Of the true fatherly loue in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with his children being come to yeares of diſcretion.</hi>
                     </note> the well gouerning thereof, parents ſhould receiue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if they be capable, into their ſocietie and partnerſhip in their goods, admit them to their counſell, intelligence, the knowledge and courſe of their domeſticall affaires, as alſo to the communication of their deſignements, opinions and thoughts; yea conſent and contribute to their honeſt recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſtimes, as the caſe ſhall require, alwaies reſeruing their ranke and authoritie. For wee condemne the auſtere, lordlike, and imperious countenance and cariage of thoſe that neuer looke vpon their children, nor ſpeake vnto them but with authoritie, will not be called fathers but lords, though God himſelfe refuſe not this name of father, neuer caring for the hartie loue of their children, ſo they may be feared, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, and adored. And for this cauſe they giue vnto them ſparinglie, keepe them in want, that they may the better keepe them in awe and obedience, euer threatning them ſome ſmall pittance by their laſt will, when they depart out of this life. Now this is a ſottiſh, vaine, and ridiculous foolerie; It is to diſtruſt their owne proper, true, and naturall authoritie, to get an artificiall; And it is the way to deceiue themſelues, and to grow into contempt, which is cleane contrarie to that they pretend. It cauſeth their children to carie themſelues cunninglie with them, and to conſpire and find meanes how to deceiue them. For parents ſhould in good time frame their minds to dutie, by reaſon, and not haue recourſe to theſe meanes more tyrannous than fatherlie.</p>

                  <p>In the laſt diſpoſition of our goods, the beſt and ſureſt way is to follow the lawes &amp; cuſtomes of the countrie. The lawes <note place="margin">39 <hi>The vſage of them in their laſt willes according to the lawes.</hi>
                     </note> haue better prouided for it than we, and it is a ſafer courſe to ſuffer them to faile in ſome thing, than to aduenture vpon our owne defects, in our owne proper choice. It is to abuſe that libertie we haue therein, to ſerue our fooliſh fantaſies and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat paſſions, like thoſe that ſuffer themſelues to be caried by the vnwonted officious actions and flatteries of thoſe that are preſent, who make vſe of their laſt willes and teſtaments, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by gratifying or chaſtiſing the actions of thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend intereſt therein. A man muſt conforme himſelfe to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and common cuſtome heerin, which is wiſer than we are, and the ſurer way.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the dutie of children towards their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <note place="margin">40 <hi>Of the dutie of children towards their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</hi>
                     </note> ſo naturall and ſo religious, and which ought to be done vnto them not as vnto pure and ſimple men, but demi-gods, earthlie, mortall, viſible gods. And this is the reaſon why <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew ſaid, that the commandement touching the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of children was written the one halfe in the firſt table, which conteined the commandements that concerne our dutie towards God; and the other halfe in the ſecond table, wherein are the commandements that concerne our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as being halfe diuine, and halfe humane. This dutie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is ſo certaine, ſo due and requiſite, that it may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed withall by any other dutie or loue whatſoeuer, be it neuer ſo great. For, if it ſhall happen that a man ſee his father and his ſonne ſo indangered at one and the ſame inſtant, as that he cannot reſcue and ſuccour them both, he muſt forſake his ſonne, and goe to his father, though his loue towards his ſonne be greater, as before hath beene ſaid. And the reaſon is, becauſe the dutie of a ſonne towards his father is more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and hath the greater priuiledge, and cannot be abrogated by any later dutie. <note place="margin">41 <hi>This dutie conſiſteth in fiue points.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this dutie conſiſteth in fiue points, comprehended in this word, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother.</hi> The firſt is reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not only in outward geſture and countenance, but alſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="485" facs="tcp:16995:268"/>
inward, which is that high and holy opinion and eſteeme, that a childe ought to haue of his parents, as the authors and originall cauſes of his being, and of his good, a qualitie that makes them reſemble God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is obedience, euen to the rougheſt and hardeſt <note place="margin">2 Ier. 35.</note> commands of a father, according to the example of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites,</hi> who to obey the command of their father, neuer dranke wine in all their liues: Nay more than that, <hi>Iſaac</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not to yeeld his necke to the ſword of his father.</p>
                  <p>The third is to ſuccour their parents in all their needs and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> neceſſities, to nouriſh them in their old age, their impotency, and want, to giue them their aſſiſtance in all their affaires. We haue an example and paterne heereof euen in beaſts. In the Storke, whoſe little ones (as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> affirmeth) feed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh <note place="margin">In examer.</note> their old dames, couer them with their feathers, when they fall from them, and couple themſelues together to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them vpon their backs. Loue furniſheth them with this arte. This example is ſo liuely and ſo ſignificant, that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of children towards their parents hath beene ſignified by the qualitie of this creature, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>reciconiare.</hi> And the Hebrewes call this bird for this cauſe, <hi>chaſida,</hi> that is to ſaie, <note place="margin">Leuit. 11.</note> the debonaire, the charitable bird. We haue likewiſe nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples heere amongſt men. <hi>Cymon</hi> the ſonne of great <hi>Miltiades,</hi> whoſe father dying in priſon, as ſome ſay for debt, and not hauing wherewithall to burie his bodie, much leſſe to redeeme it being areſted for the debt, whileſt it was caried to the buriall, according to the lawes of that country, <hi>Cymon</hi> ſold himſelfe and his libertie for money to prouide for his funerall. He with his plentie and goods relieued not his father, but with his libertie; which is deerer than all goods, yea and life too. He helped not his father liuing and in neceſſitie, but dead, and being no more a father nor a man. What had he done to ſuccour his father liuing, wanting, and requiring his helpe? This is an excellent preſident. We haue two the like examples, euen in the weake and feeble ſex of women, of two daughters which haue nouriſhed and giuen ſucke the one to the father, the other to hir mother, being priſoners and condemned to die by famine, the ordinarie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the ancients. It ſeemeth in ſome ſort a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:16995:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nature, that the mother ſhould be nouriſhed with the daughters milke; but this is truely according to nature, yea thoſe firſt lawes, that the daughter ſhould nouriſh her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, not to doe, to attempt, or enterpriſe any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thing of weight or importance, without the aduice, conſent, and approbation of parents, and eſpecially in mariage.</p>
                  <p>The fift is, mildly and gently to endure the vices, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and teſtie and impatient humors of parents, their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſeueritie and rigour. <hi>Manlius</hi> hath made good proofe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for the Tribune <hi>Pomponius</hi> hauing accuſed the father of this <hi>Manlius</hi> in the preſence of the people of many crimes, and amongſt others, that he ouer cruelly handled his ſonne, enforcing him to till the earth: the ſonne goeth to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune and finding him in his bedde, putting the point of his dagger to his throat, inforced him to ſweare, that he ſhould deſiſt from that purſuit he made againſt his father, deſiring rather to indure his fathers rigour, than to ſee him troubled for it.</p>
                  <p>A childe ſhall finde no difficultie in theſe fiue duties, if he conſider how chargeable he hath been to his parents, and with what care and affection he hath beene brought vp. But he ſhall neuer know it well, vntill he haue children of his owne, as hee that was found to ride vpon a hobbie-horſe playing with his children, entreated him that ſo tooke him to hold his peace vntill he were himſelfe a father, reputing him till then no indifferent iudge in this action.</p>

Touching which it is neceſſarie to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of ſeruants: for they are principally three ſorts. That is to ſay, of ſlaues, whereof all the world hath beene full in former time, and is at this preſent, except a part of Europe, and no place more free than heere about France; they haue no power neither in their bodies nor goods, but

are wholly their maſters, who may giue, lend, ſell, reſell, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and vſe them as beaſts of ſeruice. Of theſe hath beene ſpoken of at large. There are inferiour ſeruants, and ſeruants, free people, maſters of their perſons and goods, yea they cannot bargaine, or otherwiſe doe any thing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of their owne libertie. But they owe honour, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſerue vntill ſuch times, and vpon ſuch conditions, as they haue promiſed, and their maſters haue power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, correct, and chaſtiſe them with moderation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. There are alſo mercenaries, which are leſſe ſubiect, they owe no ſeruice nor obedience, but onely worke and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for money; and they haue no authoritie in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or correcting them.</p>
                  <p>The duties of maſters towards their ſeruants, as well of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſlaues as inferior ſeruants, are, not to handle them cruellie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring they are men, and of the ſame nature with vs, but onely fortune hath put a difference, which is euer variable and ſporteth it ſelfe in making great men little, and little great.

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>The dutie of Soueraignes and Subiects.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OF Princes and Soueraignes, their deſcriptions, notes, humours, markes, and diſcommodities hath beene diſcourſed in the firſt booke, chap. 49. Their dutie to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the common-wealth hath beene ſpoken at large in this preſent booke, chap. 2. and 3. which is of politike prudence: yet we will touch a little heere the heads and generall points of their dutie.</p>
                  <p>The Soueraigne as the meane betweene God and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">1 <hi>The dutie of Soueraignes.</hi>
                     </note> and debtour to theſe two, ought alwaies remember that he is the liuely image, the officer, and lieutenant generall of the great God his ſoueraigne; and to the people a perfect mirrour, a bright beame, a cleere looking glaſſe, an eleuated theater for euerie one to behold, a fountaine where all refreſh themſelues, a ſpurre to vertue, and who doth not any good; that is not famous, and put in the regiſter of perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. He ought then firſt of all to feare and honour God, to <note place="margin">To be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> be deuout, religious, to obſerue pietie not onely for himſelfe and for conſcience ſake, as euery other man, but for his ſtate, and as he is a ſoueraigne. The pietie which we heere require in a prince, is the care he ought to haue, and to ſhew for the conſeruation of religion and the ancient lawes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the countrey, prouiding by lawes penalties and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments that the religion be neither changed, troubled, nor innouated. This is a thing that highly redoundeth to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſecuritie (for all doe reuerence, and more willingly obey, and more ſlowly attempt or enterpriſe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him whom they ſee feareth God; and beleeue to be in his protection and ſafegard; <hi>vna cuſtodia pietas: pium virum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mercur. Triſm.</note> 
                     <hi>nec malus genius nec fatum deuincit. Deus enim eripit eum ab omni malo.)</hi> And alſo to the good of the ſtate, for as all the wiſeſt haue ſaid, Religion is the band and cement of humane ſocietie.</p>
                  <p>The Prince ought alſo to be ſubiect, and inuiolablie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue <note place="margin">2 <hi>To obſerue the lawes of ſuperiors.</hi>
                     </note> and cauſe to be obſerued the lawes of God, and nature,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:16995:270"/>
which are not to be diſpenſed with: and he that infringeth them is not only accounted a tyrant, but a monſter.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the people, he ought firſt to keepe his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <note place="margin">3 <hi>To keepe his promiſe.</hi>
                     </note> and promiſes, be it with ſubiects or others with whom he is intereſſed or hath to do. This equitie is both naturall and vniuerſall. God himſelfe keepeth his promiſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the prince is the pledge and formall warrant of the law and thoſe mutuall bargaines of his ſubiects. He ought then aboue all to keepe his faith, there being nothing more odious in a prince than breach of promiſe and periurie; and therefore it was well ſaid, that a man ought to put it among thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall caſes if the prince do abiure or reuoke his promiſe, and that the contrarie is not to be preſumed. Yea he ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thoſe promiſes and bargaines of his predeceſſors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie if he be their heire, or if they be for the benefit and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the common-wealth. Alſo he may relieue himſelfe of his vnreaſonable contracts and promiſes vnaduiſedlie made, euen as for the ſelfe-ſame cauſes priuat men are releeued by the benefit of the prince.</p>
                  <p>He ought alſo to remember, that although he be aboue the law (I meane the ciuill and humane) as the Creator is aboue <note place="margin">4 <hi>To obſerue the lawes.</hi>
                     </note> the creature (for the law is the worke of the prince, and which he may change and abrogate at his pleaſure, it is the proper right of the ſoueraigntie) neuertheleſſe though it be in force and authoritie, he ought to keepe it: to liue, to conuerſe and iudge according vnto it: and it would be a diſhonor and a very euill example to contradict it, and as it were falſifie it. Great <hi>Augustus</hi> hauing done ſomething againſt the law, by his owne proper acte would needs die for griefe: <hi>Lycurgus, Ageſilaus, Seleucus,</hi> haue left three notable examples in this point, and to their coſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the prince oweth iuſtice to all his ſubiects; and he ought to meaſure his puiſſance and power by the rule of <note place="margin">5 <hi>To do iuſtice.</hi>
                     </note> iuſtice. This is the proper vertue of a prince trulie royall and princelike, whereof it was rightlie ſaid, by an old man to king <hi>Philip</hi> that delayed him iuſtice, ſaying he had no leiſure, That he ſhould then deſiſt &amp; leaue off to be king. But <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triu</hi> ſped not ſo well, who was diſpoſſeſt of his realme by his ſubiects, for caſting from a bridge into the riuer many of
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:16995:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their petitions, without anſwere, or doing them iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the prince ought to loue, cheriſh, to be vigilant and carefull of his ſtate, as the husband of the wife, the father of <note place="margin">6 <hi>To take care and affect the common good.</hi>
                     </note> his children, the ſhepheard of his flock, hauing alwaies before his eies the profit and quiet of his ſubiects. The proſperitie and welfare of the ſtate is the end and contentment of a good prince, <hi>vt respub, opibus firma, copijs locuples, gloria ampla, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Senec.</note> 
                     <hi>honesta ſit.</hi> The prince that tieth himſelfe to himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth himſelfe: for he is not his owne man, neither is the ſtate his, but he is the ſtates. He is a Lord, not to domineere, but to defend. <hi>Cui non ciuium ſeruitus tradita, ſed tutela:</hi> to attend, to watch, to the end his vigilance may ſecure his ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſubiects, his trauell may giue them reſt, his prouidence may maintaine their proſperitie, his induſtrie may continue their delights, his buſineſſe their leiſure their vacation, and that all his ſubiects may vnderſtand and know that he is as much for them, as he is aboue them.</p>
                  <p>To be ſuch and to diſcharge his dutie well, he ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane and carie himſelfe as hath bin ſaid at large in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and third chapter of this booke, that is to ſay, to furniſh himſelfe of good counſell, of treaſure, and ſufficient ſtrength within his ſtate, to fortifie himſelfe with alliance, and forraine friends to be readie, and to command both in peace and war; by this meanes he may be both loued and feared.</p>
                  <p>And to conteine all in a few words, he muſt loue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, be aduiſed in his enterpriſes, valiant in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> faithfull and firme in his word, wiſe in counſell, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his ſubiects, helpfull to his friends, terrible to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, pitifull to the afflicted, gentle and curteous to good people, ſeuere to the wicked, and iuſt and vpright towards all.</p>
                  <p>The dutie of ſubiects conſiſteth in three points, to yeeld due honor to their princes, as to thoſe that carie the image of <note place="margin">9 <hi>The dutie of ſubiects.</hi>
                     </note> God, ordeined and eſtabliſhed by him; therfore they are moſt wicked, who detract or ſlaunder; ſuch were the ſeed of <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Chanaan.</hi> 2. To be obedient, vnder which is conteined <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> many duties, as to goe to the warres, to pay tributes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts impoſed vpon them by their authoritie. 3. To wiſh them all proſperitie and happineſſe, and to pray for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:16995:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But the queſtion is, Whether a man ought to yeeld theſe <note place="margin">10 <hi>Whether it be lawfull to lay viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hands vpon the perſon of a tyrant. A double tyrant. The entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi>
                     </note> three duties generallie to all princes, if they be wicked or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. This controuerſie cannot be decided in a word, and therefore wee muſt diſtinguiſh. The prince is a tyrant and wicked either in the entrance, or execution of his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If in the entrance, that is to ſay, that he treacherouſlie inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and by his owne force and powerfull authoritie gaines the ſoueraigntie without any right, be he otherwiſe good or euill (for this cauſe he ought to be accounted a tyrant) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt we ought to reſiſt him either by way of iuſtice, if there be opportunitie &amp; place, or by ſurpriſe: and the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> ordeined in former times rewards and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors for thoſe that deliuered the common-wealth from ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and oppreſſion. Neither can it be ſaid to be a reſiſting of the prince, either by iuſtice or ſurpriſe, ſince he is neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor acknowledged to be a prince.</p>
                  <p>If in the execution, that is to ſay, that his entrance be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">2 <hi>In the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution three waies.</hi>
                     </note> and iuſt, but that he carieth himſelfe imperiouſlie, cruellie, &amp; wickedlie, and, according to the common ſaying, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie, it is then alſo to be diſtinguiſhed; for it may be ſo three waies, and euery one requireth particular conſideration. The <note place="margin">Heerof ſee aboue Chap. 4. <hi>in Chap. of tyrannie and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
                     </note> one is in violating the lawes of God and nature, that is to ſay, againſt the religion of the countrie, the commaundement of God, inforcing and conſtraining their conſciences. In this caſe he ought not to yeeld any dutie or obedience, following thoſe diuine axiomes, That we ought rather obey God than men, and feare him more that commaundeth the intire man, than thoſe that haue power but ouer the leaſt part. Yet he ought not to oppoſe himſelfe againſt him by violence or ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter meanes, which is another extremitie, but to obſerue the middle way, which is either to flie or ſuffer, <hi>fugere, aut pati;</hi> theſe two remedies named by the doctrine of veritie in the like extremities. 2. The other leſſe euill, which concerneth not the conſciences, but only the bodies and the goods, is an abuſe to ſubiects, denying them iuſtice, impriſoning their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and depriuing them of their goods. In the which caſe he ought with patience and acknowledgement of the wrath of God yeeld theſe three duties following, honor, obedience, vowes and prayers; and to be mindfull of three things, that
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:16995:272"/>
all power and authoritie is from God, and whoſoeuer reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: <hi>principi ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum rorum indicium dij dederunt. Subditis obſequij gloria reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta eſt: bonos principes voto expetere, quale ſcunque tolerare.</hi> And <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> he ought not to obey a ſuperior, becauſe he is worthie and worthilie commaundeth, but becauſe he is a ſuperior; not for that he is good, but becauſe he is true and lawfull. There is great difference betweene true and good, euery one ought to obey the law, not becauſe it is good and iuſt, but ſimplie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the law. 2. That God cauſeth an hypocrite to raigne for the ſinnes of the people, though he reſerue him for a day of his furie; that the wicked prince is the inſtrument of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the which we ought to indure as other euils, which the heauens do ſend vs; <hi>quomodo ſterilitatem aut nimios imbres &amp; caetera naturae mala, ſic luxu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; auaritiam dominantium tolerare.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> 3. The examples of <hi>Saul, Nabuchodonoſer,</hi> of many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours before <hi>Constantine,</hi> and others ſince him as cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants as might be: towards whom neuertheleſſe theſe three duties haue been obſerued by good men, and enioined them by the Prophets and learned men of thoſe daies, according to the oracle of the great Doctour of truth, which inferreth an obedience to them which ſit in the ſeate of gouernment, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they oppreſſe vs with inſupportable burthens, and their gouernment be euill.</p>
                  <p>The third concerneth the whole ſtate, when he would change or ruinate it, ſeeking to make it electiue, hereditarie, or of an Ariſtocracie, or Democracie, a Monarchie, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: And in this caſe he ought to withſtand and hinder their proceedings, either by way of iuſtice or otherwiſe: for he is not maſter of the ſtate; but only a gardian and a ſuertie. But theſe affaires belong not to all, but to the tutours and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teiners of the ſtate, or thoſe that are intereſſed therein, as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of electiue ſtates; or Princes apparent in hereditarie ſtates; or ſtates generall, that haue fundamentall lawes. And this is the only caſe wherein it is lawfull to reſiſt a tyrant. And all this is ſaid of ſubiects, who are neuer permitted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing againſt a ſoueraigne Prince for what cauſe <note place="margin">L. Cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ff de poen. L. Si quis non dicam c. de ſacroſ. Eccleſ.</note> ſoeuer, and the lawes ſay that he deſerueth death, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth, or giueth counſell, and which intendeth, or only
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:16995:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinketh it. But it is honorable for a ſtranger, yea, it is moſt noble and heroicall in a prince by warlike means to defend a people vniuſtlie oppreſſed; and to free them from tyrannie, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did, and afterward <hi>Dion, Timoleon,</hi> and <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine</hi> prince of the Tartars, who ouercame <hi>Baiazeth</hi> the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Emperour, and beſieged <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the duties of ſubiects towards their liuing ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes: <note place="margin">12 <hi>Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes after their death.</hi>
                     </note> But it is a point of iuſtice to examine their life after they are dead. This is a cuſtome iuſt and very profitable, which benefiteth much thoſe nations where it is obſerued: and which all good Princes doe deſire, who haue cauſe to complaine, that a man handleth the memorie of the wicked as well as theirs. Soueraignes are companions if not maſters of the lawes; for ſeeing iuſtice cannot touch their liues, there is reaſon, it taketh hold of their reputation, and the goods of their ſucceſſours. We owe reuerence and dutie equallie to all kings, in reſpect of their dignitie and office, but inward eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and affection to their vertue. We patientlie indure them, though vnworthie as they are: We conceale their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for their authoritie and publike order where we liue hath neede of our common help: but after they are gone, there is no reaſon to reiect iuſtice, and the libertie of expreſſing our true thoughts; yea it is a very excellent and profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that we manifeſt to the poſteritie faithfullie to obey a Maſter or Lord, whoſe imperfections are well knowne. They who for ſome priuat dutie commit a wicked prince to memorie, do priuat iuſtice to the publike hurt. O excellent leſſon for a ſucceſſour if it were well obſerued!</p>

the iudgement ſeat is baſe and vile, and condemned by all good lawes, yea euen of the heathen, witneſſe the law <hi>Iulia de ambitu:</hi> vnworthie a perſon of honour, and a man cannot better expreſſe his inſufficiencie, than by ſeeking for it. But it is moſt baſe and vile by briberie or money to purchaſe them, and there is no merchandize more hatefull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible than it: for it neceſſarily followeth, that he which buieth in groſſe, ſelleth by retaile: Whereupon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſpeaking againſt the like inconuenience, ſaith, <note place="margin">Lamprid.</note> That a man can not iuſtly condemne him which ſelleth that he bought.</p>
                  <p>Euen as a man apparrelleth himſelfe, and putteth on his <note place="margin">2 <hi>How a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf before he take the charge.</hi>
                     </note> beſt habit before he departeth his houſe to appeare in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: ſo before a man vndertake publike charge, he ought priuately to examine himſelfe, to learne to rule his paſſions, and well to ſettle and eſtabliſh his minde. A man bringeth not to the turney a raw vnmanaged horſe, neither doth a man enter into affaires of importance, if he hath not beene inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and prepared for it before: ſo, before a man vndertakes theſe affaires, and enters vpon the ſtage and theater of this world, he ought to correct that imperfect and ſauage part in vs, to bridle and reſtraine the libertie of affections, to learne the lawes, the parts, and meaſures thereof, wherewith it ought to be handled in all occaſions. But contrarily it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very lamentable and abſurd thing, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no man vndertaketh the profeſſion of any myſterie or mechanicall arte, which formerly he hath not learned: yet in publike charges, in the skill to command and obey well, to gouerne the world, the deepeſt and difficulteſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of all, they are accepted, and vndertake it, that know nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>Magiſtrates are intermixed perſons, placed betweene the ſoueraigne and priuate men, and therefore it behooueth <note place="margin">3 <hi>A generall deſcription of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</hi>
                     </note> them to know how to command, and to obey, how to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their ſoueraigne, yeeld to the power of ſuperior magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, honour their equals, command their inferiors, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the weake, make head againſt the great, and be iuſt to all: and therefore it was well ſaid, That magiſtracie deſcrieth a man, being to play in publike ſo many parts.</p>

In regard of his ſoueraigne, the magiſtrate according to the diuerſitie of the commands, ought diuerſly to gouerne, <note place="margin">4 <hi>The dutie of magiſtrates as touching the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4 Touching thoſe which are repugnant to the law of God, and nature; he ought to diſmiſſe and acquit himſelfe of his office, yea to indure any thing, rather than obey or conſent: and he need not ſay that the former commands may haue ſome doubt in them: becauſe naturall Iuſtice is more cleere than the light of the Sunne.</p>

                  <p>The magiſtrate ought to be of eaſie acceſſe, ready to heare and vnderſtand all complaints and ſutes, hauing his gate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> open to all, and himſelfe alway at hand, conſidering he is not for himſelfe, but for all, and ſeruant of the common-wealth, <hi>Magna ſeruitus, magna fortuna.</hi> And for this cauſe the law of <hi>Moyſes</hi> prouided, that the Iudges and iudgement ſeats were <note place="margin">Deut. 16.</note> held at the gates of the cities, to the end euery man might haue eaſie acceſſe thereto.</p>
                  <p>He ought alſo indifferently to receiue and heare all, great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and little, rich and poore, being open to all; Therefore a wiſe man compareth him to an altar whereto a man repaireth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſed and afflicted, to receiue ſuccour and comfort.</p>
                  <p>But he ought not to conuerſe and be familiar with many, but with very few, and thoſe very wiſe and aduiſed, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſecretly: for it debaſeth authoritie, it diminiſheth and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the grace and reputation thereof. <hi>Cleon</hi> called to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the common-wealth, aſſembled all his friends, and there renounced and diſclaimed all intimation or inward amitie with them, as a thing incompatible with his charge, for <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, he depriueth himſelfe of the perſon of a friend, that vndertaketh that of a Iudge.</p>
                  <p>His office is eſpecially in two things, to vphold and defend the honor, the dignitie, and the right of his ſoueraigne, and <note place="margin">5 Cic. lib. 1.

                  <p>Then as a good and loyall interpreter and officer of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Prince, he ought exactly to ſee that his will be performed; that is to ſay the law, of which he is the miniſter, and it is his charge to ſee it diligently executed towards all, therefore he is called the liuing law, the ſpeaking law.</p>
                  <p>Although the magiſtrate ought wiſely to temper milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with rigour, yet it is better for a magiſtrate to be ſeuere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and cruell, than gentle, facill, and pitifull: and God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be pitifull in iudgement.

Prince, who made both. To be briefe, to diſcharge well his office, there is required two things, honeſty and courage. The firſt hath need of the ſecond. The firſt preſerueth the magiſtrate free from auarice, reſpect of perſons, of bribes, which is the plague, and ſmotherer of truth. <hi>(Acceptatio mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum praeuaricatio eſt veritatis)</hi> from the corruption of iuſtice which <hi>Plato</hi> calleth an hallowed virgin: Alſo from paſſions, of hatred, of loue, and others, all enemies to right and equity.

By this meanes <hi>Moyſes</hi> became the head of the Iewiſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vndertaking the defence of men iniured and vniuſtly <note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> troad vnder foot. <hi>Hercules</hi> was deified for deliuering the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed from the hands of tyrants. Thoſe that haue done the like, haue beene called Heroes and demi-gods, and to the like, all honours haue beene anciently ordeined, that is, to
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:16995:275"/>
ſuch as deſerued well of the common-wealth, and were the deliuerers of the oppreſſed. It is no greatneſſe for a man to make himſelfe to be feared, (except it be of his enemies) and to terrifie the world, as ſome haue done, which alſo haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them hate. <hi>Oderint dum metuant.</hi> It is better to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued than adored. This commeth of a naturall pride, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanitie, to contemne and diſdaine other men as the ordure and excrements of the world, and as if they were not men; and from thence they grow cruell, and abuſe both the bodies and goods of the weake, a thing wholly contrarie to true greatneſſe and honour, who ought to vndertake the defence thereof.</p>
                  <p>The dutie of inferiors towards their ſuperiors, conſiſteth in two points, in honoring and reuerencing them, not onely ceremoniouſly and in outward ſhew, which he muſt doe as well to the good as the euill, but with loue and affection, if they deſerue it, and are louers of the common-wealth. Theſe are two things, to honour, and to eſteeme, which are due to the good and truely great: to others to bend the knee, to bowe the body, not the heart, which is to eſteeme and loue. Moreouer to pleaſe them by humble and ſeruiceable duties, and to inſinuate into their fauour.</p>
                  <q>Principibus placuiſſe viris non vltima laus eſt.</q>
                  <p>And to make himſelfe capable of their protection, which if he cannot procure them to be his friends, yet at the leaſt not to make them his enemies, which muſt be done with meaſure and diſcretion. For ouer-greedilie to auoid their indignation, or to ſeeke their grace and fauour, beſides that it is a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of weakneſſe, it is ſilentlie to condemne them of iniuſtice and crueltie; <hi>Non ex profeſſo cauere aut fugere: nam quem quis fugit, damnat;</hi> Or to ſtirre vp in them a deſire to execute their furie, ſeeing ſo baſe and fearefull a ſubmiſſion.</p>

                        </note> more at large the nature and definition thereof, expell thoſe popular errours that are heere intruded. We will note then in this vertue foure conditions; the firſt is generallie and
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:16995:276"/>
indifferentlie againſt all ſorts of difficulties &amp; dangers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are deceiued that thinke there is no other valour than the militarie, which only they eſteeme, becauſe it may be it is moſt renowned and glorious, and carieth greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation <note place="margin">Military valour.</note> and honor, which is the tongue and trumpet of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie; for to ſay truth, there is more fame and glorie therein than paine and danger. Now this is but a ſmall part and a little raye or light of the true, entire, perfect, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, whereby a man is one and the ſame, in companie, in bed with his griefes, as in the field, as little fearing death in his houſe, as in the armie. This militarie valour is pure and naturall in beaſts, with whom it is as well in females as in males; in men it is often artificiall, gotten by feare and the apprehenſion of captiuitie, of death, of griefe, of pouertie; of which things beaſts haue no feare. Humane valour is a wiſe cowardlineſſe, a feare accompanied with foregſiht to auoid one euill by another; choler is the temper, and file thereof; beaſts haue it ſimplie. In men alſo it is attained by vſe, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, example, cuſtome, and it is found in baſe and ſlauiſh minds: of a ſeruant or ſlaue, or a factour, or fellow trained vp in merchandiſe, is made a good and valiant ſouldier, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without any tincture or inſtinct of vertue and true philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall valour.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond condition, it preſuppoſeth knowledge as well of the difficultie, paine, and danger, which there is in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">4 <hi>Temeritie or ſtupiditie.</hi>
                        </note> that is preſented, as of the beautie, honeſtie, iuſtice, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie required in the enterpriſe or ſupport thereof. Wherefore they are deceiued that make valour an inconſiderate temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or a ſenſeleſſe brutiſh ſtupiditie: <hi>Non eſt inconſulta teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, nec periculorum amor, nec formidabilium appetitio, diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſima</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                        <hi>in tutela ſui fortitudo eſt: &amp; eadem patientiſſima eorum quibus falſa ſpecies malorum eſt.</hi> Vertue cannot be without knowledge and apprehenſion, a man cannot trulie contemne the danger which he knoweth not; if a man will alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this vertue in beaſts. And indeed they that ordinarilie attempt without any foreſight or knowledge, when they come to the point of execution the ſent is their beſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                     <p>The third condition; this is a reſolution and ſtayednes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                        <pb n="501" facs="tcp:16995:276"/>
the mind grounded vpon the dutie, and the honeſtie, and <note place="margin">Bodily ſtrength.</note> iuſtice of the enterpriſe; which reſolution neuer ſlacketh, whatſoeuer hapneth, vntill he haue valiantlie ended the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, or his life. Many offend againſt this condition, firſt and more groſſely they that ſeeke this vertue in the body, and in the power and ſtrength of the limmes. Now valour is not a qualitie of the bodie, but of the mind; a ſetled ſtrength, not of the armes and legs, but of the courage. The eſtimation and valure of a man conſiſteth in his heart and will: heere lieth his true honor: and the only aduantage and the true victorie ouer his enemie, is to terrifie him, and to arme himſelfe againſt his conſtancie and vertue: all other helps are ſtrange and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed: ſtrength of armes and legs is the qualitie of a porter: to make an enemie to ſtoope, to dazell his eies at the light of the ſunne, is an accident of fortune. He whoſe courage faileth not for any feare of death, quelleth not in his conſtancie and reſolution: and though he fall, is not vanquiſhed of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, who perhaps may in effect be but a baſe fellow, but of fortune: and therefore he is to accuſe his owne vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not his negligence. The moſt valiant are oftentimes the moſt vnfortunate. Moreouer they are deceiued, which diſquiet themſelues, and make account of thoſe vaine Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonicall brags of ſuch ſwaggering Braggadochios, who by their loftielooks, and braue words, would win credit of thoſe that are valiant and hardie, if a man would do them ſo much fauour to beleeue them.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, they that attribute valour to ſubtiltie and craft, <note place="margin">6 <hi>Arte and industrie.</hi>
                        </note> or to arte or induſtrie, do much more prophane it, and make it play a baſe and abiect part. This is to diſguiſe things, and to place a falſe ſtone for a true. The Lacedemonians permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Fencers nor maſter-Wreſtlers in their cities: to the end their youth might attaine thereto by nature, and not by arte. We account it a bold and hardie thing to fight with a Lion, a Beare, a wilde Bore, which encounter a man onely according to nature: but not with Waſpes, for they vſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie. <hi>Alexander</hi> would not contend in the Olympique games, ſaying, there was no equalitie: becauſe a priuate man might ouercome, and a king be vanquiſhed. Moreouer it is not fitting for a man of honour, to trie and aduenture his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:16995:277"/>
in a thing, wherein a baſe fellow inſtructed by rule may gaine the priſe. For ſuch victory commeth not of vertue, nor of courage, but of certaine artificiall tricks and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: wherein the baſeſt will doe that, which a valiant man knoweth not, neither ſhould he regard to doe it. Fencing is a tricke of arte, which may be attained by baſe perſons, and men of no account. And although infamous and ruffinlike fellowes are apt to fight or doe any thing in cities or townes, with the dexteritie of the ſword; if they ſee an enemie, would they not runne away? Euen ſo is it in that, which is attained By long habit and cuſtome, as builders, tumblers, mariners, who vndertake dangerous things, and more difficult than the moſt valiant, being trained and inſtructed therein from their youth.</p>
                     <p>Finally, they which conſider not ſufficiently the motiue <note place="margin">7 <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
                        </note> and circumſtance of actions, wrongly attribute to valour and vertue, that which appertaineth and belongeth to ſome paſſion or particular intent. Eor as it is not properly vertue, nor iuſtice to be loyall and officious towards ſome, which a man particularly loueth; nor temperance, to abſtaine from the carnall pleaſure of his ſiſter, or of his daughter; nor libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie towards his wife and children: ſo is it not true valour to aduenture himſelfe to any danger, for his owne benefit and particular ſatisfaction. Wherefore if it be good for gaine, as ſpies, pioners, traitors, merchants on the ſea, mercenarie ſouldiers; if for ambition or reputation to be eſteemed and accounted valiant; as the moſt part of our men of warre, who ſay, being naturally caried thereunto, that if they thought they ſhould loſe their life, would not goe; if wearie of his life through paine and griefe, as the ſouldier of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who liuing in extreame torment by the meanes of a fiſtula he had, was hardie to attempt all dangers, being healed auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; if to preuent ſhame, captiuitie, or any other euill; if through furie and the heat of choler: to be brief, if by paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or particular conſideration, as <hi>Aiax, Catiline,</hi> it is neither valour nor vertue, <hi>Sicut non martyrem poena, ſic nec fortem pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſed cauſa fecit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth condition. It ought to bee in the execution <note place="margin">8 <hi>Indiſcretion.</hi>
                        </note> therof wiſe and diſcreet, whereby many falſe opinions are
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:16995:277"/>
reiected in this matter, which are not to hide themſelues from thoſe euils and in conueniences that threaten them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to feare leſt they ſurpriſe vs, nor to flie, yea not to feele the firſt blowes, as the noiſe of thunder or ſhot, or the fall of ſome great building. Now this is to vnderſtand amiſſe: for ſo that the minde remaine firme and entire in it owne place and diſcourſe, without alteration, hee may outwardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and make a ſtirre. He may lawfully, yea it is honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ouerthrow, to vndoe; and to reuenge himſelfe of euils, by all meanes and honeſt indeauors: and where there is no remedie, to carrie himſelfe with a ſetled reſolution. <hi>Mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mota manet: lachrymae voluuntur inanes. Socrates</hi> mocked thoſe that condemned flight: What, ſaith he, is it cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to beate and vanquiſh them by giuing them place? <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> commendeth in his <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> the skill to flie: the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians profeſſors of valour in the iourney of the Plateans, retired, the better to breake and diſſolue the Perſian troope; which otherwiſe they could not doe, and ouercame them. This hath beene practiſed by the moſt warlike people. In other places the Stoickes themſelues allowed to waxe pale; to tremble at the firſt ſudden encounter, ſo that it proceed no farther into the minde and courage. And this is valour in groſſe. There are things which are iuſtly to be feared and flied, as ſhipwracks, lightnings, and thoſe where there is no remedie, neither place of vertue, prudence, valour.</p>

                  <p>The cauſe of euill and hatefull accidents, which happen to vs all, are either common and generall, when at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant they concerne many, as peſtilence, famine, warre, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.

Now the common euils, that is to ſay, proceeding of a publike cauſe, though they concerne euery one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are in diuers kinds, more or leſſe grieuous, weightie, and dangerous, than the priuate, whoſe cauſes are knowne. More grieuous, for they come by flockes and troopes, they aſſaile more violently, with greater ſtirre of vehemencie and furie: they haue a greater concurſe and traine: they are more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous, they bring foorth greater diſorder and confuſion. Leſſe grieuous: becauſe generalitie and communitie ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to mitigate, and leſſen euery mans euill. It is a kinde of comfort not to be alone in miſerie: it is thought to be rather a common vnhappineſſe, where the courſe of the world, and the cauſe is naturall, than perſonall affliction. And indeed thoſe wrongs which a man doth vs, torment vs more, wound vs to the quicke, and much more alter vs. Both theſe two haue their remedies and comforts.</p>

Now to murmure, and to be grieued at the contrarie, is firſt of all ſuch impietie, as the like is not elſewhere found: for all things doe quietlie obey, man only torments himſelfe. And againe it is a folly, becauſe it is vaine and to no purpoſe. If a man will not follow this ſoueraigne and abſolute miſtris willinglie, it ſhall cary all by force: <hi>ad hoc ſacramentum adacti ſumus ferre mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, nec perturbari ijs, quae vitare nostrae potestatis non eſt: in regno nati ſumus, deo parere libertas eſt.</hi>

                     </note> diſtinguiſh them, leſt we miſtake them. There is diſpleaſure, there is offence. We often conceiue ill of another, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hath not offended vs neither in deed nor will,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:16995:279"/>
as when he hath either demaunded, or refuſed any thing with reaſon, but yet was then hurtfull vnto vs: for ſuch cauſes it is too great ſimplicitie to be offended, ſince that they are not offences. Now there are two ſorts of offences, the one croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our affaires againſt equitie; this is to wrong vs: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are applied to the perſon, who is contemned by it, and handled otherwiſe than it ought, be it in deed or in word. Theſe are more grieuous and harder to be indured, than any other kind of affliction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and generall aduice againſt all theſe ſorts of euils, is to be firme and reſolute, not to ſuffer himſelfe to be lead by <note place="margin">4 <hi>The aduice againſt them in generall.</hi>
                     </note> common opinion, but without paſſion to conſider of what weight and importance things are, according to veritie and reaſon. The world ſuffereth it ſelfe to be perſwaded and lead by impreſſion. How many are there that make leſſe account to receiue a great wound, than a little blow? more account of a word, than of death? To be briefe, all is meaſured by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and opinion offendeth more than the euill; and our impatience hurts vs more, than thoſe of whom wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.</p>
                  <p>The other more particular counſels and remedies are drawne firſt from our ſelues, (and this is that we muſt firſt <note place="margin">5 <hi>Particular aduiſements drawne from our ſelues.</hi>
                     </note> looke into.) Theſe pretended offences may ariſe of our owne defects and weakneſſe. This might be a follic grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome defect, in our owne perſon, which any one in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would counterfait. It is follie to greeue and vex himſelfe for that which proceedeth not from his owne fault. The way to preuent others in their ſcoffes, is firſt to ſpeake, and to let them know, that you know as much as they can tell you; if it be that the iniurie hath taken his beginning by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, and that we haue giuen the occaſion of this abuſe, why ſhould we be offended therewith? for it is not an offence, but a correction, which he ought to receiue, and make vſe of as a puniſhment. 3. But for the moſt part it proceedeth of our owne proper weakneſſe, which makes vs melancholie. Now he ought to quit himſelfe of all thoſe tender delicacies, which makes him liue vnquietlie, but with a manly courage, ſtrong and ſtoutlie to contemne, and tread vnder foote the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and follies of another. It is no ſigne that a man is ſound,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:16995:279"/>
if he complaine when one toucheth him. Neuer ſhalt thou be at reſt if thou frame thy ſelfe to all that is preſented.</p>
                  <p>They are alſo drawne from the perſon that offendeth. We <note place="margin">6 <hi>Of thoſe who offend.</hi>
                     </note> repreſent in generall the maners and humours of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with whom we are to liue in the world. The moſt part of men take no delight but to do euill, and meaſure their power by the diſdaine, and the iniurie of another. So few there are which take pleaſure to do well. He ought then to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that whether ſoeuer we turne vs, we ſhall finde thoſe that will harme, and offend vs. Whereſoeuer we ſhall finde men, we ſhall finde iniuries. This is ſo certaine and neceſſarie, that the lawyers themſelues, who rule the trafficke and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of this world, haue wincked at, and permitted in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butiue and commutatiue iuſtice many eſcapes in lawe. They haue permitted deceit and hinderances euen to the one halfe of the iuſt price. This neceſſitie to hurt and offend, commeth firſt of the contrarietie, and incompatibilitie of humours and willes, whereof it commeth that a man is offended without will to offend. Then from the concurrence and oppoſition of affaires, which inferreth that the pleaſure, profit, and good of one, is the diſpleaſure, dammage, and ill of others; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe, following this common &amp; generall picture of the world, if he who offendeth thee is inſolent, a foole, and raſh (as he is, for an honeſt man neuer wrongeth any) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complaineſt thou, ſince he is no more his owne man, than as a mad man? You can well indure a furious man without complaint, yea, you will pitie him; an innocent, an infant, a woman, yee will laugh at them: a foole, a drunken man, a cholericke, an indiſcreet man in like ſort. Wherefore when theſe people aſſaile vs with words, we ought not to anſwere them: we muſt hold our peace, and quit our ſelues of them. It is an excellent &amp; worthie reuenge, and greeuous to a foole, not to make any account of him, for it is to take away that pleaſure which he thinketh to haue in vexing vs, ſince our ſilence condemnes his ſimplicitie, and his owne temeritie, is ſmothered in his owne mouth: if a man anſwere him, he makes him his equall, and by eſteeming him too much, he wrongs himſelfe. <hi>Malè loquuntur, quia bene loqui neſciunt, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt quod ſolent &amp; ſciunt, malè quia mali, &amp; ſecundum ſe.</hi>

Behold then for concluſion the aduice and counſel of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: we muſt haue reſpect vnto ourſelues, and vnto him <note place="margin">7 The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe counſels &amp; with the rule of wiſdome.</note> that offendeth vs. As touching our ſelues, wee muſt take heed we do nothing vn woorthy and vnbefitting our ſelues, that may giue another aduantage againſt vs. An vnwiſe man that diſtruſteth himſelfe, growes into paſſion without cauſe, and thereby giues incouragement to another to contradict him. This is a weakeneſſe of the minde, not to know to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne offence: an honeſt man is not ſubiect to iniurie: he is inuiolable: an inuiolable thing is not onely this, that a man can not beate, but being beaten, neither receiueth wound nor hurt: This reſolution is a more ſtrong bulwarke againſt all accidents; that we can receiue no euill, but of our ſelues. If our iudgement be as it ought, we are inuulnerable. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we alwaies ſay with wiſe <hi>Socrates, Anitus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi> may well put me to death, but they ſhall neuer inforce me to doe that I ought not. Moreouen, an honeſt man, as he neuer giueth occaſion of iniurie to any man, ſo he cannot endure to receiue an iniurie. <hi>Laedere enim laedique coniunctum eſt.</hi> This is a wall of braſſe, which a man is not able to pierce; ſcoffes, and iniuries trouble him not. Touching him that hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs, if you hold him vaine and vnwiſe, handle him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and ſo leaue him: if he be otherwiſe, excuſe him; Imagine that he hath had occaſion, and that it is not for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but by miſconceit and negligence; he is vexation enough to himſelfe, and he wiſheth he had neuer done it. Moreouer, I ſay, that like good husbands we muſt make profit and commoditie of the iniuries that are offered vs. Which wee may doe at the leaſt two waies, which reſpect the offendor &amp; the offended. The one, that they giue vs occaſion to know thoſe that wrong vs, to the end we may the better flie them at another time. Such a man hath ſlandered thee, conclude preſently that he is malicious: and truſt him no more: The other, that they diſcouer vnto vs our infirmity, and the means whereby we are eaſilie beaten, to the end we ſhould amend and repaire our defects; leſt another take occaſion to ſaie as much or more. What better reuenge can a man take of his enemies, than to make profit of their iniuries, and thereby better and more ſecurely to manage our affaires?</p>

                        </note> thereof, where are alſo found true preſeruatiues and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.

                  <p>WE haue ſaid before that griefe is the greateſt, and, to ſay the truth, the onely eſſentiall euill, which is moſt felt, and hath leaſt remedies. Neuertheleſſe, behold ſome few that regard the reaſon, iuſtice, vtilitie, imitation and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with the greateſt and moſt excellent.</p>
                  <p>It is a common neceſſitie to indure; there is no reaſon that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for our ſakes a miracle ſhould be wrought; or that a man ſhould be offended if that happen vnto him, that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto euery man.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a naturall thing; we are borne thereunto, and to deſire to be exempted from it is iniuſtice, we muſt quietly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> endure the lawes of our owne condition. We are made to be old, to be weake, to grieue, to be ſicke, and therefore we muſt learne to ſuffer that which we cannot auoid.</p>
                  <p>If it be long, it is light and moderate, and therefore a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſhame to complaine of it; if it be violent it is ſhort, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ends either it ſelfe or the patient, which comes all to one end. <hi>Confide, ſummus non habet tempus dolor. Si grauis, breuis; Si longus, leuis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And againe, it is the body that endureth: it is not our ſelues that are offended, for the offence diminiſheth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and perfection of the thing, and ſickneſſe or griefe is ſo far from diminiſhing, that contrarily it ſerueth for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and an occaſion of a commendable patience, much more than health doth: And where there is more occaſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:16995:282"/>
there is not leſſe occaſion of good. If the body be the inſtrument of the ſpirit, who will complaine when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is imploied in the ſeruice of that whereunto it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated? The body is made to ſerue the ſoule: if the ſoule ſhould afflict it ſelfe for any thing that hapneth to the bodie, the ſoule ſhould ſerue the body. Were not that man ouer deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate &amp; curious, that would cry out and afflict himſelf, becauſe ſome one or other had ſpoiled his apparell, ſome thorne had taken hold of it, or ſome man paſſing by had torne it? Some baſe broker perhaps would be aggrieued therewith, that would willingly make a commoditie thereof: But a man of abilitie and reputation would rather laugh at it, and account it as nothing in reſpect of that ſtate and abundance that God hath beſtowed on him. Now this body is but a borrowed garment, to make our ſpirits for a time to appeare vpon this lowe and troubleſome ſtage, of which onely we ſhould make account, and procure the honour and peace thereof. For from whence commeth it that a man ſuffereth griefe with ſuch impatiencie? It is becauſe he accuſtometh not himſelfe to ſeeke his content in his ſoule; <hi>non aſſuerunt animo eſſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, nimium illis cum corpore fuit.</hi> Men haue too great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with their bodies; And it ſeemeth that griefe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth proud, ſeeing vs to tremble vnder the power thereof.</p>
                  <p>It teacheth vs to diſtaſte that which we muſt needs leaue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and to vnwinde our ſelues from the vanity and deceit of this world, an excellent peece of ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>The ioy and pleaſure we receiue by the recouerie of our health, after that our griefe or ſickneſſe hath taken his courſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is a ſtrange enlightning vnto vs, in ſuch ſort that it ſhould ſeeme that nature hath giuen ſickneſſe for the greater honor and ſeruice of our pleaſure and delight.</p>
                  <p>Now then if the griefe be indifferent, the patience ſhall be eaſie: if it be great, the glory ſhall be as great: if it ſeeme ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> let vs accuſe our delicacie and niceneſſe; and if there be but few that can indure it, let vs be of the number of thoſe few. Let vs not accuſe nature for hauing made vs too weake, for that is nothing, but we are rather too delicate. If we flie it, it will follow vs; if we cowardly yeeld vnto it, and ſuffer our ſelues to be vanquiſhed, it will handle vs the more roughlie,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:16995:282"/>
and the reproch will light vpon our ſelues. It would make vs afeard, and therefore it ſtandeth vs vpon to take heart, and that when it commeth it find vs more reſolute than was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Our yeelding makes that more eager and more fierce, <hi>ſtare fidenter, non quia difficilia non audemus: ſed quia non aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, difficilia ſunt.</hi>

For ſick folke are not without captiuitie in their beds, in their houſes, for the time they lye in, yea, they ingroſſe as it were affliction aboue captiuitie; neuertheleſſe, a word or two there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. There is nothing but the bodie, the couer, the priſon of the ſoule that is captiue, the ſoule it ſelfe remaineth alwaies free, and at libetie in deſpite of all; and therefore how ſhould that man know or perceiue that he is in priſon, who as freely, yea and more freely too, may walke and wander whither he will, than he that is abroad? The walls and dungeons of the priſon are not ſtrong enough to ſhut him vp, the body that toucheth him and is ioyned vnto him, cannot hold nor ſtay him. He that knoweth how to maintaine himſelfe in his libertie, and to vſe and hold his owne right, which is not to be ſhut vp, no not in this world, will but laugh at theſe fleight and childiſh embarments. <hi>Christianus etiam extra carcerem ſaeculo renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiauit: in carcere etiam carceri: nihil intereſt vbi ſit is in ſaeculo</hi>

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:16995:284"/>
to ſhew what it is, you muſt know that there is a two-fold po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, the one extreame, which is the want of things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Want of things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</hi>
                     </note> and requiſit vnto nature; This doth ſeldome or neuer happen to any man, nature being ſo iuſt, and hauing formed vs in ſuch a faſhion, that few things are neceſſarie, and thoſe few are not wanting, but are found euery where, <hi>parabile eſt quod natura defiderat, &amp; expoſitum,</hi> yea in ſuch a ſufficiencie as being moderatly vſed, may ſuffice the condition of euery one. <hi>Ad manum eſt, quod ſat eſt.</hi> If we will liue according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, the deſire and rule thereof, we ſhall alwaies find that which is ſufficient. If we will liue according to opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whileſt we liue we ſhall neuer find it. <hi>Si ad naturam viues nunquam eris pauper, ſi ad opinionem nunquam diues: exiguum natura deſiderat, opinio immenſum.</hi> And therefore a man that hath an arte or ſcience to ſtick vnto, yea, that hath but his armes at will, is it poſſible he ſhould either feare or complaine of pouertie?</p>
                  <p>The other is the want of things, that are more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, <note place="margin">2 2. <hi>Want of things ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</hi>
                     </note> required for pomp, pleaſure and delicacie. This is a kind of mediocritie and frugallitie: and to ſay the truth, it is that which we feare, to loſe our riches, our moueables, not to haue our bed ſoft enough, our diet well dreſt, to be depriued of theſe commodities, and in a word, it is delicateneſſe that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, this is our true maladie. Now this complaint is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt; for ſuch pouertie is rather to be deſired than feared: and therefore the wiſe man asked it of God, <hi>mendicitatem nec diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias,</hi>

The goods of this world, they are as the moueables of an Inne. We are not to be diſcontented ſo long as we are heere, that we haue need of them. More rich; It is a large ſegnorie, a kingdome, <hi>magnae diuitiae lege naturae compoſita paupertas: mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

<pb n="518" facs="tcp:16995:285"/>
ſafetie than a great, which lieth open vnto euery blow. It is neuer ſubiect to great loſſes, nor charges of great labour and burthen. And therefore they that are in ſuch an eſtate, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies more cheerfull and comfortable, for they neither haue ſo much care, nor feare ſuch tempeſts. Such kind of pouertie is free, cheerfull, aſſured, it maketh vs truly maſters of our owne liues; whereof the affaires, complaints, contentions that do neceſſarilie accompanie riches, cary away the better part. Alas what goods are thoſe, from whence proceed all our euils? That are the cauſe of all thoſe iniuries that we indure, that makes vs ſlaues, trouble the quiet of our ſoules, bring with them ſo many iealouſies, ſuſpicions, feares, frights, deſires? He that vexeth himſelfe for the loſſe of theſe goods is a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, for together with his goods he loſeth his ſpirit too. The life of poore men is like vnto thoſe that ſaile neere the ſhore; that of the rich like to thoſe that caſt themſelues into the maine Ocean. Theſe cannot attaine to land, though they deſire nothing more, but they muſt attend the wind and the tide; the other come aboord, paſſe and repaſſe as often as they will.</p>
                  <p>Finally, wee muſt endeuour to imitate thoſe great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous perſonages, that haue made themſelues merrie with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſuch kinde of loſſes, yea haue made aduantage of them, and thanked God for them, as <hi>Zenon,</hi> after his ſhipwracke, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius, Seranus, Curius.</hi> It ſhould ſeeme that pouertie is ſome excellent and diuine thing, ſince it agreeth with the gods who are imagined to be naked, ſince the wiſeſt haue embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, or at leaſt haue endured it with great contentment.

                  <p>THis affliction is of diuers kinds.

How many vnexpected aduentures may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that may defend a man from that blow we feare? Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is put by with the winde of a mans hatte, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the greateſt ſtates with accidents of ſmall moment. The turne of a wheele mounteth him that was of loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to the higheſt ſtep of honour; and many times it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out that wee are preſerued by that, which we thought would haue beene our ouerthrow. There is nothing ſo eaſily deceiued as humane foreſight. That which it hopeth, it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; that which it feareth, vaniſheth; that which it expecteth hapneth not. God hath his counſell by himſelfe; That which man determineth after one maner, he reſolueth after another. Let vs not therefore make our ſelues vnfortunate before our time, nay when perhaps we are neuer likely to be ſo. Time to come which deceiueth ſo many, will likewiſe deceiue vs as ſoone in our feares, as in our hopes. It is a maxime commonly receiued in Phyſicke, that in ſharp maladies the predictions are neuer certaine: and euen ſo is it in the moſt furious threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of fortune; ſo long as there is life, there is hope, for
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:16995:287"/>
hope continues as long in the body as the ſoule, <hi>quamdiu ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, ſpero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as this feare proceedeth not alwaies from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the diſpoſition of nature, but many times from an ouer deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate education (for by the want of exerciſe and continuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and labour, euen from our youth we many times appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things without reaſon) we muſt by a long practiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome our ſelues vnto that, which may moſt terrifie vs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto our ſelues the moſt fearefull dangers that may light vpon vs, and with cheerefulneſſe of heart attempt ſometimes caſuall aduentures, the better to trie our courage, to preuent euill occurrents, and to ſeaſe vpon the armes of fortune. It is a matter of leſſe difficultie to reſiſt fortune by aſſailing it, than by defending our ſelues againſt it. For then we haue leaſure to arme our ſelues, we take our aduantages, we prouide for a retrait; whereas when it aſſaulteth vs, it ſurpriſeth vs vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and handleth vs at her owne pleaſure. We muſt then whileſt we aſſaile fortune learne to defend our ſelues, giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues falſe alarums, by propoſing vnto vs the dangers that other great perſonages haue paſt, call to mind that ſome haue auoided the greateſt, becauſe they were not aſtoniſhed at them, others haue beene ouerthrowne by the leaſt, for want of reſolution.</p>

                  <p>THe remedies againſt ſorrow (ſet downe before as the moſt tedious, hurtfull, and vniuſt paſſion) are twofold: ſome are direct or ſtreight, others oblique. I call thoſe direct which Philoſophie teacheth, which concerne the confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and diſdaining of euils, accounting them not euils, or at leaſt wiſe very ſmall and light (though they be great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous) and that they are not woorthie the leaſt motion or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our mindes; and that to be ſorrie for them, or to complaine of them, is a thing very vniuſt and ill befitting a man, ſo teach the <hi>Stoicks, Peripateticks,</hi> and <hi>Plantoniſts.</hi> This maner of preſeruing a man from ſorrow and melancholike
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:16995:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paſſion, is as rare, as it is excellent, and belongs to ſpirits of the firſt ranke. There is likewiſe another kinde of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall remedy, although it be not of ſo good a ſtampe, which is eaſie and much more in vſe, and it is oblique, this is by diuerting a mans minde and thought to things pleaſant &amp; delightfull, or at leaſt indifferent from that that procureth our ſorrow: which is to deale cunningly, to decline and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid an euill, to change the obiect. It is a remedie very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and which is vſed almoſt in all euils, if a man marke it, as well of the body as of the minde. Phyſitians when they cannot purge a rheume, they turne it into ſome other part leſſe dangerous. Such as paſſe by ſteepe and precipitate deepes and downfals, that haue need of launcings, ſearing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irons, or fire, ſhut their eies, and turne their faces another way. Valiant men in warre doe neuer taſte nor conſider of death, their mindes being caried away by the deſire of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: In ſo much that diuers haue ſuffered death gladly, yea haue procured it, and beene their owne executioners, either for the future glorie of their name, as many Greekes and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; or for the hope of another life, as Martyrs, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Hegeſias,</hi> and others after the reading of <hi>Plato</hi> his booke to <hi>Antiochus, de morte contemnenda;</hi> or to auoid the miſeries of this life, and for other reaſons.

                  <p>THe remedies are many and diuers wherewith the minde muſt before hand be armed and defended, like thoſe that feare to be beſieged; for afterwards it is too late. They may be reduced to three heads; The firſt is to cut off the way, and to ſtop all the paſſages vnto choler. It is an eaſier matter to <note place="margin">1 <hi>The first head.</hi>
                     </note> withſtand it, and to ſtay the paſſage thereof in the beginning, than when it hath ſeaſed vpon a man to cary himſelfe well and orderly. He muſt therfore quit himſelfe from all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and occaſions of choler, which heertofore haue been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the deſcription thereof, that is to ſay, 1. weakneſſe and tenderneſſe; 2. maladie of the minde in hardning it ſelfe againſt whatſoeuer may happen; 3. too great delicateneſſe; the loue of certaine things do accuſtome a man to facilitie and ſimplicitie, the mother of peace and quietnes. <hi>Adomnia com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiti ſimus: quae bona &amp; paratiora ſint nobis meliora &amp; grauiora;</hi> it is the generall doctrine of the wiſe. King <hi>Cotys</hi> hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for a preſent many beautifull and rich veſſels, yet fraile and eaſie to be broken, brake them all, to the end he might not be ſtirred to choler and furie when they ſhould happen to be broken. This was a diſtruſt in himſelfe, and a baſe kinde of feare that prouoked him thereunto. 4. Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

For he that thinketh himſelfe to be contemned by another, is in ſome ſenſe his inferior, iudgeth himſelfe, or feares that in truth he is ſo, or is ſo reputed, and diſtruſteth himſelfe. <hi>Nemo non eo à quo ſe contemptum iudicat minor eſt.</hi> A man muſt therefore thinke that it proceedeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from any thing than contempt, that is, ſottiſhneſſe, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, want of good maners. If this ſuppoſed contempt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his friends, it is too great familiaritie. If from his ſubiects or ſeruants, knowing that their maſter hath power to chaſten them, it is not to be belieued that they had any ſuch thought.

Reaſon when it is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by paſſions, ſerueth vs no more than the wings of a bird being faſtned to his feet.

                     </note> in the conſideration of the actions and motions of thoſe that are in choler, which ſhould breed in vs a hatred thereof, ſo ill do they become a man. This was the maner of the wiſe, the better to diſſwade a man from this vice, to counſell him to behold himſelfe in a glaſſe. Secondly and contrarily, of the beautie which is in moderation; Let vs conſider how much grace there is in a ſweet kind of mildnes and clemencie, how pleaſing and acceptable they are vnto others, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our ſelues: It is the adamant that draweth vnto vs the hearts &amp; willes of men. This is principallie required in thoſe whom fortune hath placed in high degree of honor, who ought to haue their motions more remiſſe and temperate, for as their actions are of greateſt importance, ſo their faults are more hardly repaired. Finally, in the conſideration of that eſteeme and loue which we ſhould beare to that wiſdome which we heere ſtudie, which eſpeciallie ſheweth it ſelfe in retaining and commanding it ſelfe, in remaining conſtant and inuincible; a man muſt mount his mind from the earth, and frame it to a diſpoſition, like to the higheſt region of the aire, which is neuer ouer-ſhadowed with cloudes, nor troubled with thunders, but in a perpetuall ſerenitie; ſo our mind muſt not be darkned with ſorrow, nor moued with choler, but flie all precipitation, imitate the higheſt planets that of all others are caried moſt ſlowlie. Now all this is to be vnderſtood of inward choler and couered, which indureth being ioyned

But yet it muſt be with theſe conditions. Firſt, that it be not often, vpon all, or light occaſions. For being too common, it growes into contempt, and works no good effect. Secondly, not in the aire, murmuring and railing behind their backs, or vpon vncertainties, but be ſure that he feele the ſmart that hath committed the offence.

If then thou wilt be a king of kings themſelues, and doe an act that may become a king, pardon freely, be gracious towards him that hath offended thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is nothing ſo great and ſo victorious, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hardineſſe and a couragious inſenſibilitie in the ſuffering of iniuries, whereby they returne and rebound wholly vpon the wrongers, as heauie blowes vpon a hard and ſteeled anuill, which doe no other but wound and benum the hand and arme of the ſtriker: To meditate reuenge is to confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wounded: to complaine is to acknowledge himſelfe guiltie and inferiour. <hi>Vltio doloris confeſſio est: non est magnus animus quem incuruat iniurta: ingens animus &amp; verus aeſtimator ſui non vindicat iniuriam, quia non ſentit.</hi>

Againe, it is no reaſon that a man ſhould be iudge and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> partie too, as he that reuengeth is.

                  <p>We muſt therefore forme vnto our ſelues a moderation of the minde, this is the vertue of clemencie, which is a ſweete <note place="margin">5 <hi>Clemencie.</hi>

                  <p>THe only meane to auoid it, is for a man to make himſelfe worthie of that he deſireth, for iealouſie is nothing elſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but a diſtruſt of our ſelues, and a teſtimonie of our little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.

Imbecillitie only feareth the incounter, becauſe it thinketh that being compared to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the imperfection thereof will preſentlie appeare. Take away emulation, you take away the glorie and ſpurre of vertue.</p>
                  <p>My counſell to men againſt this maladie, when it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from their wiues, is, that they remember that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> part, and moſt gallant men of the world haue fallen into this misfortune, and haue beene content to beare it without ſtirring and moleſtation: <hi>Lucullus, Caeſar, Pompey, Cato, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, Antonius,</hi> and diuers others. But thou wilt ſay, the world knoweth it and ſpeakes of it: and of whom ſpeake they not in this ſenſe, from the greateſt to the leaſt? how many honeſt men do euery day fall into the ſame reproch? and if a man ſtirre therein, the women themſelues make a ieſt of it: the frequencie of this accident ſhould moderate the bitterneſſe thereof. Finally be thou ſuch that men may complaine of thy wrong, that thy vertue extinguiſh thy hard fortune, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men may account neuertheleſſe of thee, but rather curſe the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>As touching women, there is no counſell againſt this euill, for their nature is wholly compoſed of ſuſpition, vanitie, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It is true that they cure themſelues at the charge of their husbands, turning their euill vpon them, and healing it with a greater. But if they were capable of counſell, a man would aduiſe them not to care for it, not to ſeeme to perceiue it: which is a ſweet mediocritie betweene this fooliſh iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and that other oppoſite cuſtome practiſed in the Indies and other nations, where women labour to get friends, and women for their husbands ſeeke aboue all things their honor and pleaſure (for it is a teſtimonie of the vertue, valor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a man in thoſe countries to haue many wiues.)

                  <p>Proſperitie is very dangerous: whatſoeuer there is that is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vaine and light in the ſoule of man, is raiſed and caried with the firſt fauorable winde. There is nothing that makes a man ſo much to loſe and forget himſelfe, as great proſperitie, as corne lodgeth by too great abundance, and boughs ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with fruit breake aſunder, and therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that a man looke to himſelfe, and take heed, as if he went in a ſlipperie place, and eſpeciallie of inſolencie, pride, and preſumption. There be ſome that ſwimme in a ſhallow wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with the leaſt fauour of fortune are puffed vp, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themſelues, become inſupportable, which is the true pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of follie.</p>
                  <p>From thence it commeth that there is not any thing more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fraile, and that is of leſſe continuance than an ill aduiſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, which commonly changeth great and ioyfull occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

                  <p>Now the beſt counſell that I can giue to a man, to carrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> himſelfe heerein, is, not to eſteeme too much of all ſorts of proſperitie and good fortunes, and in any ſort not to deſire them: If they ſhall happen to come, out of their good grace and fauour, to receiue them willingly and cheerefully; but as things ſtrange and no way neceſſarie, but ſuch as without which a man may paſſe his life, and therefore there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſhould make account of them, or thinke himſelfe the woorſe or better man for them. <hi>Non est tuum, fortuna quod fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit tuum.

                  </head>
                  <p>PLeaſure is an apprehenſion and ſenſe of that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to nature, it is a pleaſant motion and tickling: <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of pleaſure.</note> as contrarilie, griefe or ſorrow is vnwelcome and vnpleaſing to the ſenſes; neuertheleſſe, they that place it in the higheſt degree, and make it the ſoueraigne good, as the Epicures, take it not ſo, but for a priuation of euill and diſpleaſure, in a word Indolence. According to their opinion, the not hauing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euill, is the happieſt eſtate that man can hope for in this life. <hi>Nimium boni eſt cui nihil eſt mali:</hi> This is as a mid-way or neutralitie betwixt pleaſure taken in the firſt and common ſenſe, and griefe; it is as ſometime the boſome of <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſaid to be, betwixt paradiſe and the hell of the damned. This is a ſweete and peaceable ſtate and ſetling, a true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſtaied pleaſure, which reſembleth in ſome ſort the tranquillitie of the ſoule, accounted by Philoſophers the chiefe and ſoueraigne good: the other firſt kinde of pleaſure is actiue and in motion. And ſo there ſhould be three eſtates, the two extreame oppoſites, Griefe and Pleaſure, which are not ſtable nor durable, and both of them ſickly: and that in the middle, ſtable, firme, ſound, wherunto the Epicures gaue the name of pleaſure (as indeed it is in regard of griefe and
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:16995:293"/>
ſorrow) making it the chiefe and ſoueraigne good. This is that which hath ſo much defamed their ſchoole, as <hi>Seneca</hi> hath ingenuouſly acknowledged and ſaid, that their euill was in the title and words, not in the ſubſtance, hauing neuer had either doctrine or life more ſober, temperate, and enemie to wickedneſſe and vice than theirs. And it is not altogether without reaſon that they called this Indolence and peaceable ſtate, Pleaſure: for that tickling delight which ſeemeth to mount vs aboue indolence, aimeth at nothing elſe but indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or want of griefe, as it proper butte; as for example; that appetite that rauiſheth vs with deſire of women, ſeeketh nothing elſe but to flie that paine that an ardent and furious deſire to ſatisfie our luſt bringeth with it, to quit our ſelues of this feuer, and to purchaſe our reſt.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſure hath diuerſly beene ſpoken of, and more briefly and ſparingly than was fit; ſome haue deified it, others dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <note place="margin">2 <hi>Againſt it.</hi>
                     </note> it as a monſter, and tremble at the very word, taking it alwaies in the worſer part. They that doe wholly condemne it ſay; Firſt, it is ſhort, a fire of ſtraw, eſpecially if it be liuely and actiue. Secondly, fraile and tender, eaſily and with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing corrupted and ended, an ounce of ſorrow marres a whole ſea of pleaſure: It is called a choaked peece of artillery. Thirdly, baſe, ſhamefull, exerciſing it ſelfe by vilde inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in hidden corners, at leaſt for the moſt part, for there likewiſe are magnificent and pompous pleaſures. Fourthly, quickly ſubiect to ſatietie. A man knowes not how to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in his pleaſures, he is impatient as wel in his delights as his griefes, and it is not long ere repentance follow, which many times yeelds pernicious effects, the ouerthrow of men, families, common-weales. Fiftly, and aboue all they alleadge againſt it, that when it is in his greateſt ſtrength, it maſtreth in ſuch a maner, that reaſon can haue no enterteinment.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, it is ſaid, to be naturall, created and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed of God in the world, for the preſeruation and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance <note place="margin">3 <hi>For it, See Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 6.</note> thereof, as well by retaile of the indiuiduall parts, as in groſſe of the ſpeciall kindes. Nature the mother of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in thoſe actions that are for our need and neceſſitie, hath likewiſe mingled pleaſure. Now to liue well is to conſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature. God, ſaith <hi>Moyſes,</hi> hath created pleaſure, <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerat</hi>
                     <pb n="536" facs="tcp:16995:294"/>
                     <hi>dominus paradiſum voluptatis,</hi> hath placed and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed man in a pleaſant eſtate, place and condition of life: and in the end, what is the laſt and higheſt felicitie, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and perpetuall pleaſure? <hi>Inebriabuntur ab vbertate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus tuae, &amp; torrente voluptatis tuae potabis eos. Suis contenta fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus res est diuina voluptas.</hi> And to ſay the truth, the moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Philoſophers, and the greateſt profeſſors of vertue, <hi>Zeno, Cato, Scipio, Epaminondas, Plato, Socrates</hi> himſelfe haue been in effect amorous, and drinkers, dancers, ſporters, and haue handled, ſpoken, written of loue and other pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>And therefore this matter is not decided in a word, but we muſt diſtinguiſh, for pleaſures are diuers. There are naturall, <note place="margin">4 <hi>The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi>
                     </note> and not naturall: This diſtinction as more important we will preſently better conſider of. There are ſome that are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, arrogant, difficult; others that are obſcure, milde, eaſie &amp; ready. Though to ſay the truth, Pleaſure is a qualitie not greatly ambitious; it is accounted rich enough of it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of any thing to the reputation thereof, and it is loued beſt in obſcuritie. They likewiſe that are ſo eaſie and ready are cold and frozen, if there be no difficultie in them: which is as an inducement, a baite, a ſpurre vnto them. The ceremonie, ſhame and difficultie that there is in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt exploits of loue, are the ſpurres, and matches that giue fire vnto it, and increaſe the price thereof. There are ſpirituall pleaſures &amp; corporall, not (to ſay the truth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſeparated: for they al belong to the entire man, and the whole compoſed ſubiect: and the one part of our ſelues hath not any ſo proper, but that the other hath a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, ſo long as the mariage and amorous band of the ſoul &amp; bodie continueth in this world. But yet there are ſome wherin the ſoule hath a better part than the body, &amp; therfore they better agree with men, than with beaſts, and are more durable, as thoſe that enter into vs by the ſenſe of ſeeing and hearing, which are the two gates of the ſoule, for hauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their paſſage by them, the ſoule receiueth them, concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and digeſteth them, feedeth and delighteth it ſelfe a long time; the body feeleth little. Others there are wherein the body hath the greater part, as thoſe which belong to the taſte and touch, more groſſe and material, wherein the beaſts beare
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:16995:294"/>
vs companie, ſuch pleaſures are handled, tried, vſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the bodie it ſelfe, the ſoule hath onely the aſſiſtance and companie, and they are but ſhort, like a fire of ſtraw, ſoone in, ſoone out.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe thing to be conſidered heerein, is to know how wee ſhould carrie and gouerne our ſelues in our pleaſures, <note place="margin">5 <hi>Aduiſements heereupon.</hi>
                     </note> which wiſdome will teach vs, and it is the office of the vertue of temperance. We muſt firſt make a great and notable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the naturall, and not naturall. By the not naturall we doe not onely vnderſtand thoſe that are againſt nature, and the true vſe approoued by the lawes; but alſo the naturall themſelues, if they degenerate into too great an exceſſe and ſuperfluitie, which is no part of nature, which contenteth it ſelfe with the ſupplie of neceſſitie; whereunto a man may likewiſe adde decencie and common honeſtie. It is naturall pleaſure to be couered with a houſe and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Which are naturall.</note> againſt the rigour of the elements, and the iniuries of wicked men; but that they ſhould be of gold or ſiluer, of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper or Porpherie, it is not naturall: Or if they come vnto a man by other meanes than naturall, as if they be ſought and procured by arte, by medicines, or other vnnaturall meanes: Or if they be firſt forged in the minde, ſtirred by paſſion, and afterwards from thence come vnto the body, which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous order: for the order of nature is, that pleaſures en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the bodie, and be deſired by it, and ſo from thence aſcend vnto the minde. And euen as that laughter that is procured by tickling the arme-holes, is neither naturall nor pleaſing, but rather a kinde of conuulſion; ſo that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that is either ſought or kindled by the ſoule, is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt rule of wiſdome concerning pleaſures is this, <note place="margin">6 <hi>The firſt and generall rule.</hi>
                     </note> to chaſe away, and altogether to condemne the vnnaturall, as vitious, baſtardly (for as they that come to a banquet vnbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, are to be refuſed; ſo thoſe pleaſures that without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitation of nature preſent themſelues, are to be reiected) to admit and receiue the naturall; but yet with rule and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and this is the office of temperancie in generall, to driue away the vnnaturall, to rule the naturall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="538" facs="tcp:16995:295"/>
The rule of naturall pleaſures conſiſteth in three points:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it be without the offence, ſcandall, dammage, and preiudice of another. <note place="margin">Rules for the naturall.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it be without the preiudice of himſelfe, his honor, his health, his leaſure, his dutie, his functions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that it be with moderation, that he take them no more to the heart, than againſt the heart, neither couet them, nor flie from them, but take and receiue them, as men doe honie with the tip of the finger, not with a full hand; not to engage himſelfe in them too farre, nor to make them his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall buſineſſe, and onely worke; much leſſe to enthrall himſelfe vnto them, and of recreations make them neceſſities, for that is the greateſt miſerie of all others. Pleaſure ſhould be but as an acceſſarie, a recreation for the time, that he may the better returne to his labour, as ſleepe which ſtrengthneth the bodie, and giueth vs breath to returne the more cheerfullie to our worke. To be ſhort, a man muſt vſe them, not inioy them. But aboue all, he muſt take heed of their treaſon: for ſome there are, that whileſt we giue our ſelues vnto them, and loue them ouer dearely, returne euill for good, and more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than delight: but this is treacherouſlie: for they goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to beſot and deceiue vs, and hiding from vs their taile, they tickle vs and embrace vs to ſtrangle vs. The pleaſure of drinking goes before the paine of the head: ſuch are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures of indiſcreet and firie youth, wherewith they are made drunken. We plunge our ſelues into them, but in our old age they forſake vs, as it were drowned and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, as the ſea in his reflux ouer-runneth the ſandie banks: That ſweetneſſe which we haue ſwallowed ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie, endeth with bitterneſſe and repentance, and filleth our ſoules with a venemous humor that infecteth and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it.</p>

                  <p>AMbition, the deſire of glory and honor (wherof we haue alreadie ſpoken) is not altogether and in all reſpects to be condemned. Firſt, it is very profitable to the weale-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as the world goeth, for it is it from whence the greateſt of our honorable actions doth ariſe, that hartneth men to dangerous attempts, as we may ſee by the greateſt part of our ancient heroicall men, who haue not all been lead by a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall ſpirit, as <hi>Socrates, Phocion, Aristides, Epaminondas, Cato,</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> by the only true and liuely image of vertue; for many, yea the greateſt number haue beene ſtirred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the ſpirit, of <hi>Themistocles, Alexander, Caeſar:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe honorable atchieuments and glorious exploits haue not beene with their authors and actors, true works of vertue but ambition; neuertheleſſe their effects haue beene very beneficiall to the publike ſtate. Beſides this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the opinion of the wiſeſt, it is excuſable and allowable in two caſes: the one in good and profitable things, but which are inferior vnto vertue, and common both to the good and to the euill, as artes and ſciences: <hi>Honos alit artes: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduntur omnes ad ſtudia gloria;</hi> inuentions, induſtrie, military valour. The other in continuing the good will and opinion of another. The wiſe doe teach, not to rule our actions by the opinion of another, except it be for the auoiding of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences as may happen by their contempt of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and iudgement of another.</p>
                  <p>But that a man ſhould be vertuous, and doe good for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as if that were the ſalarie and recompence thereof, is a falſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <pb n="546" facs="tcp:16995:299"/>
and vaine opinion. Much were the ſtate of vertue to be pitied, if ſhe ſhould fetch hir commendations and priſe from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of another, this coine were but counterfelt, and this pay too baſe for vertue; She is too noble to begge ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. A man muſt ſettle his ſoule, and in ſuch ſort compoſe his actions, that the brightneſſe of honor dazell not his reaſon, and ſtrengthen his minde with braue reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which ſerue him as barriers againſt the aſſaults of ambition.</p>
                  <p>Hee muſt therefore perſwade himſelfe, that vertue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a more ample and more rich theater to ſhew it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſelfe than hir owne conſcience: The higher the Sunne is, the leſſer ſhadowe doth it make: The greater the vertue is, the leſſe glorie doth it ſeeke. Glory is truely compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a ſhadowe, which followeth thoſe that flie it, and flieth thoſe that follow it. Againe, hee muſt neuer forget, that man commeth into this world as to a Comedy, where hee chooſeth not the part that he is to play, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks himſelfe how to play that part well that is giuen vnto him: or as a banquet, wherein a man feeds vpon that that is before him, not reaching to the farre ſide of the table, or ſnatching the diſhes from the maſter of the feaſt. If a man commit a charge vnto vs, which we are capable of, let vs accept of it modeſtlie, and exerciſe it ſincerelie; making account that God hath placed vs there to ſtand ſentinell, to the end that others may reſt in ſafetie vnder our care. Let vs ſeeke no other recompence of our trauell, than our owne conſcience to witneſſe our well doing, and deſire that the witneſſe be rather of credit in the court of our fellow-citizens, than in the front of our publike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To be ſhort, let vs hold it for a maxime, that the fruit of our honorable actions, is to haue acted them. Vertue cannot finde without it ſelfe a recompence worthie it ſelfe. To refuſe and contemne greatnes, is not ſo great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it is an attempt of no difficultie.

                  <p>The fourth, that it be ſerious and profitable, not vaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and vnprofitable.

                  <p>But aboue all, it muſt neuer be offenſiue, for ſpeech is the inſtrument and fore-runner of charitie, and therefore to vſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it againſt it, is to abuſe it, contrarie to the purpoſe of nature. All kind of foule ſpeech, detraction, mockerie, is vnworthie a man of wiſedome and honour.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt, to be gentle and pleaſing, not crabbed, harſh, and enuious; and therefore in common ſpeech acute and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſubtile queſtions muſt be auoided, which reſemble crafiſhes, where there is more picking worke than meate to eate, and their end is nothing elſe but brawles and contentions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that it be conſtant, ſtrong, and generous, not looſe, effeminate, languiſhing, whereby wee auoid the maner of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſpeech of Pedanties, pleaders, women.</p>

To this point of Temperancie belongeth ſecrecie (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">8 <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note> wee haue ſpoken in the Chapter of faith or fidelitie) not onely that which is committed vnto vs, and giuen vs to keepe, but that which wiſdome and diſcretion telleth vs ought to be ſuppreſſed.</p>

                     </note> ſo eloquence makes the profeſſours thereof more excellent then other men. For this is the profeſſion or arte of ſpeech, it is a more exquiſite communication of diſcourſe and of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the ſtearne or roother of our ſoules, which diſpoſeth the hearts and affections like certaine notes to make a melodious harmonie.</p>
                  <p>Eloquence is not onely a puritie and elegancie of ſpeech, <note place="margin">10 <hi>The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </note> a diſcret choice of words properly applied, ending in a true and a iuſt fall, but it muſt likewiſe be full of ornaments, graces, motions; the words muſt bee liuely, firſt, by a cleare and diſtinct voyce, rayſing it ſelfe, and falling by little and little; Afterwards by a graue and naturall action, wherein a man may ſee the viſage, hands, and members of the Orator to ſpeake with his mouth, follow with their motion that of the minde, and repreſent the affections: for an Orator muſt firſt put on thoſe paſſions which hee would ſtirre vp in others. <hi>As Bruſidus</hi> drew from his owne wound the dart wherewith he ſlew his enemie: So paſſion being conceiued in our heart, is incontinentlie formed into our ſpeech, and by it proceeding from vs, entreth into another, and there giueth the like impreſſion which wee our ſelues haue, by a ſubtle and liuely contagion. Heereby wee ſee that a ſweet and a mild nature is not ſo fit for eloquence, becauſe it cannot conceiue ſtrong and couragious paſſions, ſuch as it ought, to giue life vnto the Oration; in ſuch ſort, that when he ſhould diſplay the maſter-ſailes of eloquence in a great and vehement action, hee commeth farre ſhort thereof; as <hi>Cicero</hi> knew well how to reproch <hi>Callidius,</hi> who accuſed <hi>Gallus</hi> with a cold and ouermild voyce and action, <hi>in niſi fingeres, ſic ageres?</hi> But being likewiſe vigorous, and furniſhed as hath beene ſaid, it hath not leſſe force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

then the commaunds of tyrants, enuironed with their gards and halberds; It doth not only leade the hearer, but intangleth him, it reigneth ouer the people, and eſtabliſheth a violent empire ouer our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>A man may ſay againſt Eloquence that truth is ſufficiently <note place="margin">11 <hi>Obiections anſwored.</hi>
                     </note> maintained and defended by it ſelfe, and that there is nothing more eloquent then it ſelfe: which I confeſſe is true, where the minds of men are pure, and free from paſſions: but the greateſt part of the world, either by nature, or arte, and ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is preoccupated, and ill diſpoſed vnto vertue and veritie, whereby it is neceſſary that men be handled like iron, which a man muſt ſoften with fire before he temper it with water: So by the firie motions of eloquence, they muſt be made ſupple and manageable, apt to take the temper of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. This is that whereunto Eloquence eſpeciallie tendeth; and the true fruit thereof is to arme vertue againſt vice, truth againſt lying &amp; calumnies. The Orator, ſaith <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> is the true Phyſitian of the ſoule, to whom it belongeth to cure the biting of ſerpents by the muſicke of the pipe, that is, the calumnies of wicked men by the harmonie of reaſon. Now ſince no man can hinder, but that ſome there are that ſeaſe vpon eloquence, to the end they may execute their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſignments, how can a man do leſſe than defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the ſame armes; for if we preſent our ſelues naked to the combat, do we not betray vertue and veritie? But many haue abuſed eloquence to wicked purpoſes, and the ruine of their countrie: It is true, but that is no reaſon why eloquence ſhould be deſpiſed, for that is common to it with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things of the world, to be vſed or abuſed, well or ill applied, according to the good and bad diſpoſition of thoſe that poſſeſſe them. Moſt men abuſe their vnderſtanding, but yet we muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude that vnderſtanding is not neceſſarie.</p>
