         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>You that did laſt ſpeak, ſhew your ſelf to be an <hi>Arminian;</hi> for although you confeſſe many truths, yet indeed you differ no more from a <hi>Papiſt</hi> then <hi>Arminius,</hi> that wicked heretike did, and in your falſe doctrines of free will, and falling from grace, you agree with the ancient <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> alſo; for you all three are but one in theſe two errors.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, for your tenent of Freewill, that all men naturally have as great freedome and power of will to do good, as to do evill, this is a groſſe error, and directly oppoſite to the clear and plain Scriptures, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. And the truth ſpeaks thus, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 5. Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiencie is of God;</hi> and this is the faith and confeſſion of the whole Church of God: <hi>Iſa. 26. 12. Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou alſo haſt wrought all our works in us and for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The error of Free will, is a carnall opinion, and naturally men are inclined to it, and the holy Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>James,</hi> reproves it in his dayes, who writing to the ſcattered Tribes, ſaith, <hi>you ought to ſay, if the Lord will,</hi> and not to ſay as you have affirmed your faith to be, Wee will go, &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 2. 13. 15. So that it is plain, no man of himſelf hath freedome of will to do good; but there is no queſtion but every man hath freedome of will to do evill, as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4. 22.</p>
               <p>Secondly, your doctrine of the uncertainty of the Elects called and ſanctified eſtate in Chriſt by regeneration, ſhewes plainly you do not know what it is to be a Chriſtian indeed and truly, for if you did, you would know this truth undoubtedly, that <hi>they that truſt in the Lord, are as mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever;</hi> as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. 1. and the Apoſtle gives the reaſon of it, becauſe <hi>the chief corner ſtone thereof is Chriſt,</hi> that holy, choſen and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious One; and <hi>whoſoever he be that believeth on him, ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 6. And this doctrine is that which our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath taught us, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rock,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. Marke what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112932:11"/>
greater contrary power can there be, then the gates of hell, and yet that, even the ſtrength of all the powers of the Devill ſhall not be able to do that which you affirm they ſhall, and the reaſon thereof our Lord himſelf gives, <hi>Joh. 10. 27, 28, 29. My ſheep heare my voyce, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand; my father which gave them me, is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand: I and my Father are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that great experienced man of the love of God, even above the reſt of his fellowes, ſpeaking of the bleſſed eſtate of the regenerated Elect, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, 5. ſaith, <hi>They were elected according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, begotten again to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt from the dead, to a glorious undefiled inheritance, of which it is impoſſible we ſhould fail of, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation;</hi> and thoſe ſweet words of our Lord are of efficacy to gain the moſt contrary heart to the belief of this truth, <hi>Joh. 17. 11. Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, keep through thy holy name thoſe that thou haſt given mee, that they may be one as we are one.</hi>

               <p>And ſecondly, I anſwer, theſe Scriptures rightly underſtood, make nothing at all for the maintenance of your error, but in truth it teacheth us, that we ought heedfully to obſerve the diſtinction in one and the ſame terme, which muſt be generally and really obſerved throughout the Scriptures, which hereafter I ſhall more fully diſcover, when any of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſhall ſpeak; and in the mean while, I pray conſider of the terms in thoſe Scriptures you have alledged, as the term faith to believe the Word, the affection of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the knowledge of it, a reliſh and taſte of the ſweetneſſe and goodneſſe in it for the preſent, with ſome apprehenſion of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things of the world to come, and through the operations of its working in thoſe that received it, as that it is ſaid, they were waſhed and ſanctified, and yet afterwards never the better for all this, nay, worſe at laſt then at firſt; for it ſhall aggravate their condemnation: this ſhewes plainly, that the new and living way of life is ſet open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, by the generall and particular adminiſtration of the Goſpel, and that men by the common gifts of the Spirit, may attain to many excellent graces, even beginnings to the peculiar and ſpeciall gifts, to which whoſoever attaineth, ſhall never fall and periſh, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering effect of the Goſpel is cleerly ſet forth unto us in the foure grounds mentioned by our Lord; the Seeds-man was one and the ſame, and the ſeed it ſelf was ſo alſo, and yet took not the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all, although it was ſowne and caſt into them all.</p>

               <p>Sir, I perceive you are an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſpeedily make good my late promiſe, and indeed, ſome thirty yeers ſince, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Morton,</hi> a Teacher of a Church of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> then his confeſſion comprehended all the errors of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> which now of late, many that go under your name, in and about <hi>London</hi> diſſent from, as it ſeems you do.</p>
               <p>And therefore in Anſwer to you I ſay, that the terme baptiſme in Scriptures (as well as faith and Lord) hath divers ſignifications, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſignifie ſufferings, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. at other times outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as <hi>John</hi> baptizing our Saviour, a holy ſubject, <hi>Mat. 3. 16. and Simon alſo believed, and was baptized,</hi> Acts 8. 13. which was an evill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man, and yet admitted, and continued in the common fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Church with <hi>Philip;</hi> ſo alſo by baptiſme we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand inward baptiſme; ſometimes repentance, and ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, for ſo faith the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Matth. 3. 11. I baptize you with water unto repentance,</hi> by which indeed he wrought repentance in them, <hi>but he that comes after me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> that is, hee ſhould pardon the penitent; which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112932:13"/>
two ſpeciall adminiſtrations are the two parts of regeneration, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in <hi>Luke 24. 47. That repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in the name of Chriſt;</hi> ſo likewiſe by baptiſme we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand both the parts of regeneration together, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3. 27. and in this ſenſe it is called <hi>the laver of regeneration,</hi> or <hi>the waſhing of regeneration,</hi> Tit. 2. 5. Theſe differing ſignifications, being plain, I marvelled to find ſome of your company to maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of purpoſe, I ſuppoſe, to avoid the diſtinction, that ſo clearly diſcovers your error.</p>
               <p>You affirm you have found a rule in the Scriptures, plainly directing how the matter of the Church is made, and that is, ſay you, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baptizing, and yet you, not diſtinguiſhing of either, ſay nothing truly in neither or both; for a man may be taught and baptized, and thereby be made a Diſciple in the outward profeſſion of the truth, as the high-way, ſtony and thorny ground, as <hi>Simon Magus, Demas, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineus, Philetus, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> the inceſtuous perſon in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſuch, whoſe belly was their God, in the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> who notwithſtanding, they were all taught and baptized, yet not any one of them any part or portion of the Church of Chriſt, againſt which the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail, therefore the ground and foundation of your Church is ſand, and that will fail you, and it is very falſe and contrary to the matter of the true Church: for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Though Iſrael be as numerous as the ſand of the ſea, yet but a remnant ſhall repent and be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 9. 27. and yet they are called <hi>the people of God,</hi> Iſa. 10. 22, 23. and ſo all taught, and all circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and the ſame diſtinction the Scriptures make of baptiſme, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame is ſaid of circumciſion, for the ſelf-ſame operation that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion had in the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> outward carnally in the fleſh, and inward ſpiritually in the heart, of the ſame diſtinction and operation is baptiſme in the Chriſtian Church, the waſhing with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or dipping in water, is the doing away the filth of the fleſh, which ſaveth not; for this a man may have and periſh, as thoſe Diſciples that fell away from Chriſt, <hi>and walked no more with him,</hi> Joh. 6. 66. but the waſhing or baptiſme that ſaveth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. is <hi>the anſwer of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not the waſhing of the fleſh, but the purifying of the heart by faith; and this ſpirituall baptiſme <hi>or waſhing</hi> it is that works that full aſſurance of faith; <hi>having our hearts ſtrinkled from an evill conſcience by the blood of Chriſt, and our bodies waſhed</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:112932:13"/>
                  <hi>with pure water,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. that water that Chriſt giveth his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. and waſheth his Apoſtles with, <hi>John</hi> 13. and this is that which maketh the truly faithfull <hi>Jew</hi> by vertue of the circumciſion of the heart, and the truly faithfull <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by vertue of the baptiſme of the heart all one, as the holy Apoſtle ſaith, and that God did beare witneſſe with him alſo to the truth of it, that there is no difference between us and them, that is, us <hi>Jewes,</hi> and them <hi>Gentiles, purifying their hearts by faith,</hi> Acts 15. 8, 9. and the Scriptures ſhew, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> did well know, that when the Meſſiah ſhould come, that then baptiſme or waſhing ſhould be the diſtinction of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from others; as circumciſion by Gods own ordinance was the diſtinction the <hi>Jewes</hi> had from all the people of the whole world: and therefore it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that when the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſent Prieſts and Levites of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem to John the Baptiſt, to Bethabara beyond Jordan,</hi> where <hi>John</hi> was baptizing, the meſſengers askt him whether he were the Chriſt, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or the Prophet, and upon his anſwer, no, that he was not, they then asked him <hi>why hee did baptize then,</hi> hereby cleerly ſhewing, that they underſtood by the Scriptures, that when <hi>Elias,</hi> Meſſiah, and the Prophet foretold of ſhould come, that then baptiſme ſhould be in uſe in the Church, and accordingly it was ſo practiſed by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ever ſince continued, and of the very ſame uſe to Chriſtians, both outwardly and inwardly, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the Church of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> uſeth both the terms, baptiſme and circumciſion, to ſet forth and teach unto us, one and the ſame thing in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Col. 2. 10, 11, 12. You are compleat,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in Chriſt, which is the head of all principalities and power, in whom alſo you are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt, buried with him in baptiſme, wherein alſo you are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mark now friend, <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> the truth of this doctrine of the cleer diſtinction the Holy Ghoſt makes of baptiſme and circumciſion, and in both double and two-fold; as in circumciſion, the one outward, the other inward; ſo in baptiſme, both in the fleſh, and both in the heart, both made by hands, and both without hands; a man may partake of both in one diſtinction, and periſh, but whoſoever doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one or both, in the ſpeciall ſenſe, hee ſhall be ſaved: and as the terms in the meaning do agree, ſo they do both agree in their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; for as <hi>Abraham</hi> received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112932:14"/>
                  <hi>ſigne of the righteouſneſſe of the faith which he had before be was circumciſed in the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. ſo the regenerate and faithfull ſervants of God, <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> in whom was no guile, the Eunuch, <hi>Lydia,</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> of whom the Holy Ghoſt bears witneſſe that they were true worſhipers of God, theſe all, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> had the inward baptiſme of the blood of Chriſt through faith, in the promiſe, before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the outward baptiſme, the waſhing their bodies with water, a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentation of the waſhing their hearts by the blood of the Lamb Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And for the generall uſe of Baptiſme, as in the <hi>Jewes</hi> Church, all that believed the Law of God were to be circumciſed, and ſo admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Congregation and communion of all the holy ordinances of Gods worſhip and ſervice: ſo now, who ever believes that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and acknowledgeth the glad tidings of the Goſpel, the Miniſtery and Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles to be the truth, they upon this generall or hiſtoricall faith, ought to be baptized, and to be admitted to communion in the Word and Sacraments, as <hi>Simon Magus, Demas,</hi> the faulty Chriſtians in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and a thouſand more had, as the Scriptures ſhew; ſo that now you ſee Gods Word forces you to diſtinguiſh of baptiſme, and ſo alſo of the terme Faith, and the name Lord, and yet but one baptiſme, one faith, and one Lord to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Now the Scriptures plainly ſet forth unto us a three-fold faith, which may be truly diſtinguiſhed by theſe termes, hiſtoricall, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or juſtifying faith, and all theſe a full aſſurance, and are to be believed with all the heart; of the two firſt ſorts, wicked men, devils, may partake of them as well as the Saints, yea, ſometimes exceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: for <hi>Judas</hi> wrought miracles among the twelve, but <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt did no miracle, ſaith the Text; ſo many are called to believe the truth, to work in the Vineyard, but few are choſen unto ſalvation and rewarded with eternall life, that is the ſpeciall peculiar faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 38. that whoſoever believeth ſhall not periſh, but have eternall life. And there is a great deal of difference between him that by faith eateth Chriſts fleſh, and drinketh his blood to eternall life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 54. and their faith by which they are baptized, preach and communicate in the other ordinances, and boldly pray and call upon the name of Chriſt, and yet notwithſtanding are not acknowledged by him, but ſhut out and excluded from eternall life, and aſſign'd and ſentenced to everlaſting deſtruction, and to be rewarded as the workers of iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:112932:14"/>Now, conſidering how cleare the Scriptures are in diſtinguiſhing between faith and faith, I did admire (when I was in company with you) to ſee you all ſo earneſt, as in baptiſme, ſo in faith, to maintaine but one ſort under either term, wherefore I would here make the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall definitions of faith, thereby to make the diſtinctions the more clear, but that I ſhall do hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> miſtakes in theſe things alſo; and I much marvell at your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Scripture diſtinctions, for as much as you all profeſſe you read them much, in which, except you diſtinguiſh rightly, you can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no truth cleerly nor fully; for the letter of the Scriptures are but the body or corps, but it is the intention and meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, by the words of the Text, which is the ſpirit and life of them, therefore it doth behove us, and ſtands us in hand to take heed we do not miſtake the meaning of Gods Word, nor to give any other ſenſe or expoſition then that which is its own, leſt we be found ſuch as fight againſt the Scriptures, and by falſe and lying interpretations, violate Gods Law, and wage war to kill and ſlay the two witneſſes, the old and new Teſtaments, the lamps and light of truth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7, 8. let us take heed of this, brethren, for the judgement againſt this ſin is written and revealed already (to adde or diminiſh from the Word of God) to be a heavie, inevitable, diſmall, curſed ſentence, <hi>Deut. 4. 2. Prov. 30. 6. Rev.</hi> 22. 18.</p>
               <p>And if you had conſidered the Scriptures concerning the name of God, and Lord, you ſhould have found even the Apoſtle himſelfe to expound to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> what he meant by his ſpeaking or writing to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, One Lord,</hi> &amp;c. for hee ſaith, <hi>there be many Lords and many gods, ſo call'd, both in heaven and earth, but to us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and wee in him, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and wee by him,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6. there is but one ſuch a Father, and Lord, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, who is the giver, the purchaſer and worker of the grace by which we are called, in the ſame one hope of our holy calling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4. but in other reſpects, the Heathens Idols, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> gracious Lords are called God and Lord, for ſo did the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Herod,</hi> deifying him with a ſhout, ſaying, <hi>The voyce of God, and not of man;</hi> and Chriſtian Emperors, Kings, States, and Potentates, in regard of authority and juriſdiction, are called Lords, and Gods, in which they do repreſent God; <hi>I have ſaid you are gods,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>but you ſhall die like men.</hi>

               <p>But wee have a plain word for our teaching and baptizing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. but you baptize infants, for which you haue no word for, and therefore it will be ſaid at laſt, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> for indeed you do but continue the mark of the beaſt in all your babies baptizings.</p>

               <p>Whereas you ſay Chriſts words in the laſt of <hi>Matthew,</hi> proves your preaching and baptizing, you ſay more then you can make good, or that I can believe from that Scripture; and although there be no expreſſe words in the Scripture for the baptizing of Infants, yet there is as ſufficient warrant for it as for moſt things you practiſe your ſelves; for what plain word have you for the time of publike aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or generall meetings? what word have you for your people to ordain their Miniſter? what command doth authorize you your ſelf to baptize? what word have you when to receive the Lords Supper, when to adminiſter it, and where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who to provide the bread and wine, and what bread, and of what grain; and the wine of what grape? you have not a word for women to receive the Sacrament, and abundance other particulars practiſed by you?</p>
               <p>Will you therefore ſay, you do that which you ſin in doing; ſo as you ſay we do, I think not. The truth is, we need not a word, for there are generall rules in the Scriptures, that include particular practices, and divers things under the Goſpel, being of the ſame nature under the Law, the rules given under the Law, ſerve under the Goſpel; ſo the Apoſtle proves to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> from the Law of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 25. 4. That Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould have maintenance, <hi>that as they which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple, and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers of the Altar, even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 1. So we may truly ſay, it is ordained, that as the children of believers before Chriſt, both <hi>Jewes</hi> and Proſelytes, were to be circumciſed, <hi>Gen. 17. 11, 12. Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49. ſo believers and their children, ſince Chriſt, are to be Baptized, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>the promiſe is to you and to your children, and to all that are a far of, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beſeech you obſerve this place, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſpake to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the men of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Yee men of Iſrael,</hi> hear theſe words, ſaith he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. ſo preacheth to them, that Jeſus was the Saviour of the world, <hi>whom yee have taken by wicked hands, and have killed, and being dead, was buried, who was raiſed again, and now ſits at the right</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:112932:15"/>
                  <hi>hand of the Father, and is made the Lord and Chriſt, the alone Saviour of the world,</hi> and they that gladly receive this doctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt were baptized, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. who before had been circumciſed. Now, as the promiſe did onely belong to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Seed, and yet all his naturall children, and the children of believing ſtrangers, were to communicate of circumciſion, which was the outward ſigne of the Covenant of the righteouſneſſe by faith, as before is proved: So likewiſe under the Goſpel, the ſame covenant of life and ſalvation is made only to Gods choſen faithfull regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſervants, and their ſpirituall ſeed; yet the naturall children of theſe faithfull Chriſtians, may partake of the outward baptiſme, which is the outward ſignification of the baptiſme of the heart, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the fleſh was a ſigne of the circumciſion of the heart, and according to this rule, the place before mentioned, and divers other Scriptures ſpeak, as <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 15. that <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; ſo the Jailor was baptized, and all his, that is, his houſhold; and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> baptized the <hi>houſhold of Stephanus,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 16. And our Lord Jeſus laid his hands on little children, and bleſſed them, and rebuked his Diſciples for forbidding them to come, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16. and the Apoſtle is cleer in the reſolution of this queſtion to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. ſaith he, <hi>the unbelieving husband is ſanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife by the believing husband, elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy,</hi> that is, in reſpect they have right unto the outward covenant, being born of one that believeth. But ſome of you <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> would have theſe words, <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> to mean baſtards, or unlawfully born, which is ſuch an expoſition, as was never heard nor read of before; and this expoſition admits of much abſurdity, for it nullifies the law of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage amongſt the Heathens, who have as certain rules for marriage, according to their manner and cuſtome, as Chriſtians have, for the Scripture preſcribes no form. Secondly, this expoſition makes <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf, and moſt of the Patriarchs wives to be baſtards; for they were the children of Heathens by father and mother, as holy <hi>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel,</hi> and <hi>Joſephs</hi> wife the mother of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> a baſtard, and that holy and great Prophet, <hi>Moſes,</hi> took a baſtard to his wife; for <hi>Zipporah</hi> was an Idolaters daughter, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being a Prieſt of <hi>Midian,</hi> Exod. 2. 16. but this conceit is ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, that it ſtrangles it ſelf in the birth.</p>
               <p>And to return to our argument, the Apoſtle doth underſtand theſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112932:16"/>
terms not of baſtardy, but of fellowſhip and communion in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Gods worſhip, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 28. Wherefore I demand upon theſe premiſſes, what ground you have to deny believers children baptiſme under the Goſpel, ſeeing it is proved to be the ſame thing, that by Gods command believers children were to partake of under the law. Take heed you do not deny them that which Gods Word allowes. And for the mark of the beaſt, when you can ſhew mee by Scripture what it is, then I will prove to you, that it is not the baptizing of the Infants of believing parents. And for you to make outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and common or hiſtoricall faith to be the matter of your Church, you do no leſſe then tell me plainly, you do not know what the Church of Chriſt is; wherefore repent and turn from your errors.</p>

               <p>Your poſition is fram'd like theirs that are commonly known by the name of <hi>Browniſts,</hi> or <hi>Separatiſts;</hi> and it conſiſts of two parts: firſt, that you are in Church-covenant, and walk in Church-fellowſhip, in the injoyment of Chriſts Ordinances, as you ſay; and ſecondly, that you ſeparate your ſelves from all other congregations: this is the ſumme of your ſpeech, by which you do manifeſt to mee ſuch a ſtrange voyce, as doth not agree with the expreſſion of Gods Word; for your words are in terms of your own acts and doings, favouring carnally of humanity, whereas holy Writ ſpeaks of the Church of Chriſt in a ſpirituall ſenſe, that is, a ſpirituall building, a houſe, a Temple not gathered, joyned and builded by men, but by God himſelf, the whole matter of his Church, every ſtone thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made living ſtones by regeneration; as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2, 4.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112932:16"/>
matter of Gods Church alwayes: for when the Prophets came to build and plant Gods Church, they call to the people, <hi>to repent and turn to God,</hi> Jer. 1. to Chap. 4. 1. which is the firſt part of our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; And thus they cry for it, <hi>Break up the fallow ground of your hearts, circumciſe your ſelves to the Lord, waſh you, make you clean,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 1. 16. Jer. 4. 4. <hi>The place of Gods reſt and habitation, is a poore and contrite ſpirit;</hi> in vain are all the houſes that are built for God, but this that hee builds himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 1, 2. And as this was the Prophets way to build Gods Church, ſo even after the ſame manner did <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>He came in the power and ſpirit of Elias, to turn men to God, the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the wiſdome of the juſt,</hi> Luk. 1. 17. ſo prepared he the Lords way by the miniſtery of water or repentance, the preparation or firſt principle humbling the lofty, bending the crooked ſtreight, and breaking the hard hearted; and our Lord himſelf, he works and builds his Church after the ſame manner, and with the ſame matter, <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for the kingdome of heaven is at hand,</hi> Mat. 4. 17. <hi>And except a man be born again, hee cannot ſee the kingdome of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 3. and <hi>except yee repent, yee ſhall all periſh;</hi> and accordingly is his command to all that hee ſends into this work, that they ſhould preach in his Name, <hi>repentance, and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Luke 24. 47. the one miniſtration bruiſes &amp; breaks, the other binds up and heals; the one baptiſme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares, the other ſanctifies; the one makes poor, the other enriches; the one makes naked, the other cloaths; the one diſcovers our folly, the other indues us with wiſdome; through the one wee are made mourners, through the other we are comforted and made to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory; and by this laver of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. wee are waſhed clean, and made of ſinners Saints; of naturall dead men, living men; and this is Gods building, whoſe matter is gold, and ſilver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones.</p>
               <p>Now as the true builders build Gods Church, ſo there are falſe builders likewiſe, which build too, and they call their workmanſhip a Church alſo, but the materials of their building is but hay, wood and ſtubble, the morter they daub withall is untempered morter, <hi>They ſeduce my people,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13, 10, 11, &amp;c. the falſe Prophets mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with which they build, is compounded of vanity, and lying viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 28. they have brick made of earth and ſtraw in ſtead of ſtone, and ſlime in ſtead of morter, and ſo they build the tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> the Synagogue of confuſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 3.

upon them to heal the wounds and breaches like Gods builders, but it is to no purpoſe; for they heal the bruiſe or breach of my people, ſaith the Lord, ſleightly, ſaying, <hi>Peace when there is no peace,</hi> Jer. 6. 14. and yet ſuch a high eſteem and opinion have they of their ſpirituall building, as they call it, that they contemn the truly ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Chriſt and the Apoſtles build with; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>The builders refuſed</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, which is the very foundation that the true builders work with, and build upon, <hi>yea, the falſe builders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him,</hi> Pſal. 118. 22. <hi>they ſet him at nought, and diſallow of him,</hi> Mat. 21. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts 4. 11. 1 Pet. 2. 7. and if they do thus deſpiſe and ſo baſely account of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the chief corner ſtone of his own Church, what a kinde or manner of Church is that which theſe builders build of themſelves, as they ſay? And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lord and foundation, my rock and preſervation be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of ſuch carnall builders, yet hee is choſen of God and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and hee himſelf makes all his faithfull Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers, wiſe maſter-workmen, or builders <hi>for the gathering and perfecting his Saints for the work of the Miniſtery, for the building or edifying the body of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 3. 10. for as the Spirit of God by the miniſtery of his ſervants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares and ſanctifies them, ſo he unites and cements them to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another in ſpirituall fellowſhip: and this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in the Lord, is called in Gods Word, <hi>the Church of Chriſt, his Houſe, his Tabernacle, his Body, his Spouſe, his Temple, the pillar and ground of truth, the place of his dwelling, purchaſed, cleanſed, purified and ſanctified by his own precious blood, called and gathered by the power of his Word, made to live by the ſpirit of his mouth, having communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip by the Holy Ghoſt, growing up together in holineſſe, as branches in one ſtock or root,</hi> being members of one and the ſame body, of which Chriſt is head, as truly and really in a ſpirituall ſenſe, as the head of a man is naturally the head of the whole body, confiſting of many members.</p>
               <p>Now notwithſtanding all this that hath been ſaid of the true Church, and ten times more that might be ſpoke, yet theſe falſe-igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, carnall and fleſhly builders, thoſe dirt-daubers, have at all times taken upon them with all boldneſſe, without any bluſhing, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their wooden, dirty, filthy building, to be Gods Houſe, and their rotten ſtraw and ſtubble to be the work and building of Chriſt, boaſting and crying out of themſelves, by way of ſelf-juſtifying, <hi>The</hi>

in and by Chriſt from all eternity; ſo that the elect cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid at any time to be unrighteous, ungodly, or unholy: for they are juſtified before they beleeve, even before the foundations of the world, even then when God elected them.</p>

               <p>Free grace rightly underſtood, as the Scriptures declare it, is a heavenly and comfortable Doctrine; but me thinkes by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion you ſhould be an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> who ſpeake very much of free grace, but doe not at all underſtand it: for they ſay, the free grace of God towards his elect that are juſtified before the world was, is like unto the Sun-beames in the morning when ſhe riſes, that enlightens the dark earth, in which there is no preparation to the enlightning; ſo the Lord ſhines into the hearts of his elected juſtified ones in the very time of their wickedeſt workes of darkneſſe: And then in the midſt of their ſinnes, as in the very acts of adultery and murther, even then God lifts up the light of his countenance upon them, and gives them peace, the effect of their juſtification with God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Theſe ſlight and contemne repentance, and call it a worke of the Law; and the preparation to juſtifying faith, they call a munkiſh Popiſh doctrine: and their own fancie, or preſumptuous conceit they call that juſtifying faith, or free grace, by which, ſay they, the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, come to underſtand and know their juſtification from all eternity.</p>
               <p>Oh what a groſſe ſeducement and deluſion is this, even a generall miſtake of the whole Goſpel in every part of it! Therefore now I will firſt ſhew you what free grace is, which the Scripture ſets forth to us; And then ſhew you how clearly and fully Gods word declares the juſtifying the elect by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now this is a written and a certain truth, that God loves his Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, his choſen, freely, <hi>Hoſea 14. 4, 5, 6. I will heale their back-ſlidings, ſaith the Lord, I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from him. I will be as the dew unto Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his root as Lebanon.</hi> Alſo it is written, <hi>Ezek. 16. 6. When I ſaw thee pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in thy own blood, I ſaid unto thee, Live; when thou waſt in thy blood, Live: yea, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, Live, and have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee to multiply as the bud of the field.</hi> Obſerve how abundantly the free grace of God is manifeſted to his elect, that of themſelves are quite contrary to deſerving: for they are polluted with the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable pollution, and that is with blood, and not a little, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in the third degree, blood three times repeated by the holy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112932:19"/>
Ghoſt. And that this threefold uncleanneſſe ſhould bee waſhed and made pure, and that this exceeding deadneſſe ſhould be made to live, and ſo to live as the bud of the field, to multiply and increaſe, and bring forth fruit unto God and man, even holy grapes to refreſh the hearts of both; this ſhewes the wonderfull freeneſſe of Gods grace, ſo to love as there is none like it, nor to be compared to it.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe you have ſpoken of this free grace in a fancy, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to ſhew it you in reality. And that we may know the things that are freely given us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. that is, of his own will, free grace, and goodneſſe, and eternall love; Let us conſider it in theſe foure particulars, which onely and alone are peculiar to the Saints and Church of God, that is, their election and predeſtination before all times, their effectuall calling and juſtification in time, and their eternal glorification for ever in the world to come; which world ſhall be endleſſe, deathleſſe, and ſinleſſe for evermore. And all theſe in all the cauſes, the free grace of God: And therefore it is ſaid by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that the Saints and Church of God, are <hi>elect according to the foreknowledg of God the Father, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. And the Apoſtle to the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> teſtifies, that God had from the beginning choſen them to ſalvation, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. ſo then it is cleare, that the electare choſen in Chriſt to ſalvation: Which ſecret purpoſe and foreknowledge of God towards his elect before all time, is made good and effected in and upon his elect in all times, being <hi>called thereunto by the Goſpel,</hi> verſ. 15. Now the Goſpel, as I touched before, conſiſts of two parts, repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. which comprehends the two next particulars, our effectuall calling by the work of repentance, and whoſe ſinnes whoſoever is remitted, that ſoule is juſtified in the Apoſtles meaning, and both theſe effected by the Goſpel and covenant of life, and therefore called in Scripture, <hi>the grace of God, the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Goſpel of the grace of God,</hi> Acts 20. 24. <hi>the word of his grace,</hi> verſe 32. <hi>the word ſpeaking peace by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 1. <hi>the word of the Goſpel,</hi> Acts 15. 7. And theſe two effects which the Spirit of God works by his word in his elect to life and ſalvation, are called in Scripture, regeneration, converſion, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing, a birth from above, a new making, and ſuch like, not in a naturall but a ſpirituall ſenſe; not as the firſt birth of our parents, which procreated and produced us out of their bowels, but by way of ſimilitude and likeneſſe, that as by nature we are born carnall, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112932:20"/>
and children of wrath; ſo by this ſpirituall birth we are born of God from above, holy, ſpirituall, free, even the ſons of God, as the Scripture ſaith; for, <hi>as that which is of the fleſh is fleſh, ſo that which is of the ſpirit is ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, as by <hi>Adam</hi> came the offence, and by <hi>Moſes</hi> came the Law, through which the offence abounded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19, 20. to mans grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſery; ſo <hi>grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. <hi>Adam</hi> was the authour of ſin to his poſteritie; <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Miniſter of the Law that condemned that ſin; but the grace and mercy of God, the means of ſalvation, both from ſin and death, that is only by Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſed for ever. Now the manner and order the Holy Ghoſt taketh in working this grace in the hearts of Gods elect, is plainly laid down in Scripture, <hi>for him,</hi> that is, Chriſt, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> with the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſins,</hi> Act. 5. 31. And theſe two parts of the Goſpel, which is the free grace of God to man-kinde, are plainly and generally obſerved and preached by all the Prophets and Apoſtles, and our Lord himſelf; <hi>I will take from you, ſaith the Lord, your ſtony heart, and give you a heart of fleſh;</hi> there's the firſt part, and in that new heart that I ſhall give you, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will write my Law,</hi> that is, his Statute, and love, mercy, and forgiveneſſe, even a new and holy Spirit, and that's the ſecond part of the Goſpel, <hi>Ezek. 11. 19. Chap.</hi> 26. 36. The baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> that's the firſt, and the baptiſme of Chriſt, that's the ſecond part, and both parts our Lord joynes together, <hi>Joh. 3. 3. Except a man be born again of water and the Spirit, hee cannot ſee the Kingdome of God,</hi> neither to mourn with the Bridegrooms friends, nor rejoyce with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom himſelf; and for as much as theſe making parts of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian are not of our ſelves, but both the gifts of God, it doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſet forth unto us this excellent doctrine of Gods free Grace, as the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>who of his own will begat us with the word of trub,</hi> Jam. 1. 18. <hi>And the grace of God,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>Titus, that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men, and teacheth us to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly lnſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Yea, it is Gods free Grace and abundant compaſſionate goodneſſe, to finde out this new and living way to happineſſe through Chriſt Jeſus; for hee himſelf <hi>is the way, the truth and the life, and God ſo loved the world, that hee gave his Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. and none can ſo believe, but hee that is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112932:20"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. And the Lord is the ſpirituall bread, that every one muſt eat of that ſhall be ſaved, but none can ſo eat his fleſh, and drink his blood, but by faith; and none can believe, but to whom it is given, and it is given to comfort none, but to the broken hearted, and none are made penitent and humble, thirſting and deſiring Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but to ſuch as God gives repentance; for this is the nature and method of this free Grace of God, which the Scriptures ſet forth to us, even that free Grace that Chriſt gives to him that is <hi>athirſt, freely to drink of,</hi> Rev. 21. 7. hee gives the thirſt, and hee freely gives the water of life, that ſo quenches, that <hi>whoſoever drinketh, ſhall never thirſt again,</hi> Joh. 7. 37, 38. And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Come and drink;</hi> but this coming is by repentance, and this drinking is by faith, <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>believeth in mee,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of the water of life;</hi> yea, to ſet forth the excellency of this doctrine of free Grace, the Spirit of God takes upon him the office of a cryer in a court of Records, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come yee to the waters, come yee, buy and eat,</hi> yea, the third time he cries, <hi>come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price,</hi> Iſa. 55. 1. Heare now you <hi>Antinomians,</hi> if any of you have an eare to heare the wiſdome of God in the truth of the free Grace purchaſed and preached by Jeſus Chriſt, that it is not phantaſticall, as you have expreſt it, but that reall and ſubſtantiall grace that gives being to the new and ſpirituall man, the very regeneration of the elect of God; and as they are born of the Spirit, ſo they are taught, led and guided, anointed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Holy Ghoſt, who dwelleth in none of the bodies of the elected ones, but where he hath wrought this heavenly work of grace there he dwells, there he witneſſeth; there is but three that bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for God to the truth in the whole world; and the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 8. it is <hi>the Spirit,</hi> that's the Spirit of God; <hi>water,</hi> that's his firſt work and beginning of regeneration; and <hi>blood,</hi> that's the finiſhing and accompliſhing the new birth; the ſanctifying, the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the broken heart by faith: wherefore bluſh and be aſhamed of your blaſphemy againſt the truth, in calling repentance a work of the Law, and the preparation to faith a Popiſh doctrine, and for ever hereafter take notice, that the way of Chriſts free Grace is by water and blood, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 6. And <hi>that repentance is the beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Mark. 1. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhould have ſpoke of the fourth particular of free Grace which is glorification, but of that hereafter.</p>

               <p>I beare you witneſſe you have a zeale, but it is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge: for if you did underſtand that excellent doctrine of juſtification before beleeving, you would not ſpeak ſo much of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preparation to juſtifying faith: for by Chriſts ſtripes we are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the beginning of the world: And to prove this truth, I argue thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, all the elect of God are juſtified before God: but ſome of the elect of God doe not yet beleeve: therefore ſome that doe not beleeve, are juſtified before God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he that is in Chriſt, is juſtified: But we muſt be in Chriſt before we can beleeve, therefore we muſt be juſtified before we can beleeve.</p>

               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, the due obſervation of terms is the true preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proprieties; and except you juſtly diſtinguiſh of the terms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God himſelfe, and Gods grace by which he doth juſtifie his elect, you cannot underſtand truly, but you muſt confound heaven and earth together, and make God Man, and Man God, concluding ſuch blaſphemies as the Familiſts doe, to whom hundreds of you are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len within this two yeares; who affirme of the Trinity, that God the Father is the Minde, the Sonne is the Word, and the Spirit is the Word made knowne: And under theſe termes, miſtaking the verity of the myſtery of the Trinity, conclude ſuch groſs blaſphemies as theſe concluſions hereafter ſpecified, making God the Father the Mind, God the Son the Word of that Minde, God the holy Spirit the effect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Word. And as theſe are three, ſo they are one, as you ſay, ſo it is and was at firſt in the creation, God the Father was the Mind of God, God the Son was the Word of that Mind, and God the Spirit was the working, meaning, or manifeſtation of that Word; ſo that in that which God ſaid, Let us make man; and, he ſpake and the Heavens and the Earth was made, the Firmament, the Sun, Moon, and Starres, the Sea and the Fiſh therein, the Aire and the Fowls therein, the Earth and the Beaſts, Herbs, and Trees therein, as God ſpake the word, and all theſe were created; ſo that as they were made by the Word, ſo they are the Word, and as the Word and the Father are one, and as the Father, the Word, and the revelation of it are one, ſo whatſoever the Word made, is one with the Father, the Sonne, and the Spirit. And then the concluſion muſt be this, The whole creation is God himſelfe. Now to avoid ſuch blaſphemous conſequences, we will diſtinguiſh of the terms, and therein ſhew the fallacy of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112932:21"/>
and then I will diſcover and eſtabliſh the truth againſt your doctrine, which by this means will eaſily appeare to be falſe. Firſt, for the terme that concernes God, (juſtified before God, you ſay) which if you meane as it concernes God in his infiniteneſſe, it is ſo farre above our line, or the capacity of the elect in point of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, as the higheſt heavens are above the center of the earth: for with God himſelfe there is nothing before nor after: For the Scripture ſpeaks thus of God in this reſpect, that he calleth thoſe things that be not, as though they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. And again, one day is with the Lord as a thouſand yeares, and a thouſand yeares as one day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. Thus you ſee, <hi>Gods thoughts are not our thoughts, nor his wayes as our wayes, ſaith the Lord; but as the heavens are higher then the earth, ſo are his wayes and his thoughts higher then ours,</hi> Iſai. 55. 8, 9. But when the Prophet comes to ſpeak of Gods work in the creature to ſalvation, then he ſpeakes in the creatures language and capacitie; ſo that except man obey the voyce of God, he is left without excuſe in theſe words: <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call yee upon him while he is neere, let the wicked forſake his was, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord God, and he will have mercy upon him, and abundantly pardon,</hi> verſe 6, 7. Thus as the Prophet, we muſt diſtinguiſh between Gods eternall purpoſe and decree, which is a ſecret, &amp; known to himſelf only towards his elect before all times, and his calling and juſtifying of them in time, which is the effect of his foreknowledge and predeſtination, and that which makes known to the elect, Gods ſecret purpoſe. And although it be ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> the Apoſtle there doth not underſtand the juſtification of the elect before time, as you doe, but the juſtification of his elect in time called and juſtified. And although there can be nothing laid (to ſuch an elect juſtified) to his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet many things may be laid to his charge in regard of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and frailty, <hi>If any brother be fallen through weakneſſe, you that are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuch a one by the ſpirit of meekneſſe.</hi> Thus <hi>Nathan</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> chargeth himſelfe, <hi>Againſt thee onely have I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> So our Lord chargeth his faithfull ſervant <hi>Peter;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him to his face, and ſaith, <hi>He was to be blamed.</hi> And ſo that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle blameth himſelfe alſo: <hi>Oh wretched man that I am,</hi> ſaith he. And the Scripture ſaith, <hi>There is not a righteous man that liveth, and doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> And again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>If any man ſay he hath no ſinne, he deceiveth himſelfe, and the truth is not in him.</hi> And the elect of God are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112932:22"/>
renued again (after ſinning) by repentance, as the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is admoniſhed by Chriſt <hi>to repent and do her firſt works,</hi> Rev. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>And however the Saints do daily ſin after juſtification, yet through Gods grace they are recovered again daily by repentance, and maugre the malice and temptation of Satan, the ſnares of the world, and the concupiſcence of their own natures; yet the Lord that loved them once, doth ſtill love them for ever, and doth waſh off their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ownes them ſo for his own, that neither their ſins, nor any power, or any creature whatſoever, ſhall, or can condemn them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you ſay, ſome of the elect of God do not believe, and therefore they are juſtified before they believe. I pray where did you finde or learn this Logick, which is ſo contrary to the wiſdome of God, which teacheth thus, <hi>by Chriſt all that believe are juſtified from all things,</hi> Act. 13. 39. And again, <hi>thoſe that he calleth hee juſtifieth;</hi> but your doctrine ſaith they are juſtified before they are called; ſee in a word, how directly your preaching is againſt truths doctrine. And of the ſame nature with your former is your ſecond Argument, which runs thus: he that is in Chriſt is juſtified, but wee muſt be in Chriſt before we can believe, therefore we muſt be juſtified before we believe: which in the very terms is another doctrine then S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, who ſaith plainly, <hi>wee are juſtified by faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 28. And he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly; but I queſtion your knowledge of juſtifying faith, which if you did truly know, you durſt not teach, that men are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before they believe; it is true, hee that is ingraffed into Chriſt, is juſtified, but it doth not follow therefore a man is juſtified before hee believes: I will aſſwage the hardneſſe of the queſtion by the mildneſs of a compariſon; that which acquits and frees a malefactor, is the ſealed pardon of the King; ſo likewiſe that which comforts and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the penitent heart of mercy and forgiveneſs, is the ſealing witneſs which Gods Spirit beareth to, or aſſureth the humble heart of the free Grace and love of God through Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that juſtifying faith to the ſorrowfull ſinner, is as the ſealed pardon to the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor: and to this agrees the Scriptures, <hi>Acts 10. 43. To him</hi> (that is, to Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins;</hi> thus ſpeaks Gods Word, and not as you ſpeak; ſo that it cannot truly be ſaid, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any dare ſo to preach that a man is juſtified before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, nor that he believes before he be juſtified, but that it is the ſame gift of Gods Spirit at one and the ſame time, even then to believe our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112932:22"/>
juſtification when he accepts us juſt in him that juſtifieth the ungodly; and as it is given by the Holy Ghoſt to believe, ſo it is continued, maintained and increaſed by the ſame Spirit as the other ſpirituall gifts, as hope, love, joy and patience are; and whoſoever doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit of adoption, he hath with it the teſtimony of it, which is juſtifying faith; let us take heed wee do not ſeparate that which God hath joyned together, for that is directly againſt the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matth. 9. 6. Let no man put aſunder that which God hath joyned together:</hi> and in vain doth that man argue to prove which is firſt in the Sun, the heat or the light, ſo vain it is in you to argue, whether juſtification or faith be firſt; for when, or to whomſover God gives one, he gives them both, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. wherefore I retort your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thus:</p>
               <p>If God give remiſſion of ſins to the penitent elect, then the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent elect are not juſtified; but hee gives remiſſion of ſins to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent elect, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. therefore none of Gods elect are juſtified before they are called, and their ſins remitted; wherefore never hereafter teach your diſciples that the elect of God are juſtified before they believe, but learn to teach them <hi>to repent, that their ſins may be done away,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth, to life and ſalvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. and ſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Jewes, they did not repent that they might believe;</hi> and conſider our Lords doctrine to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> hee tells him not of his election, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord knew well that ſecret, but hee preaches to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; <hi>Except a man be borne again, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God,</hi> Joh. 3. Regeneration muſt be ſought for by the elect, and by theſe effects and operations of the Holy Ghoſt, to make ſure to themſelves their election; this is Gods way preſcribed in his Word: And leſt I fall into your error, as I have briefly diſproved your doctrine, and diſcoverered the falſhood and miſtie ſophiſtrie of your arguments; ſo now, by the help of God, I will lay down and confirm the truth it ſelf, how the Scriptures do ſpeak of juſtifying and believing, that ſo you may come to know that which hitherto I perceive you are very ignorant of. Wherefore thus ſaith the Scriptures concerning juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>We are juſtified freely by his grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. Titus</hi> 3. 11. likewiſe, that <hi>wee are juſtified by his blood,</hi> that is, by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. and alſo, <hi>that wee are juſtified by ſaith, Rom.</hi> 3. 28. ſo then theſe three terms are to be conſidered in our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the blood of Chriſt purchaſing the grace and favour of God, and an aſſurance of it given to the loſt, the dead, the broken, penitent,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112932:23"/>
mourning heart, whereby, though it be dead, yet it is made to live, the broken is healed, the emptineſſe is filled, the thirſtineſſe is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, comforted and refreſhed with the favour and love of God, in and through Jeſus Chriſt; juſtification then is the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, aſſured and made known to the elect by faith; and this doctrine is cleared by the Apoſtle beyond the leaſt exception, ſpeaking of holy <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification, <hi>and being fully aſſured,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Rom. 4. 21, 24. that what God had promiſed, hee was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, therefore it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe; Now it was not imputed for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if wee believe.</hi> Obſerve, firſt, that the Apoſtle affirmeth juſtifying faith a full aſſurance, for wee ſhall have occaſion by and by to make uſe of this: and ſecondly, that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is our juſtification, is not given to us but by faith, in theſe words, <hi>to whom it ſhall be imputed, if wee believe,</hi> ſo that juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and juſtifying faith, can no more be ſevered, parted or divided, then the light and the heat from the fire; and to this purpoſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Chriſt <hi>the juſt one, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 3. 26. ſo that it is proved againſt all the <hi>Antinomians</hi> in the world, that then, and not before, when God juſtifies his elect, then, and at that time he gives juſtifying faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 38, 39. And as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before, ſo I will here briefly ſhew the divers acceptations and diſtinctions of faith, and three particulars do comprehend all other ſorts and diſtinctions whatſoever; Hiſtoricall faith, to believe Gods Word; the faith of miracles, by which it is given to a Saint, or a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to work this or that miracle; ſo alſo in the third place, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak of juſtifying faith, of which it is ſaid wee live by, wee are comforted by, through which wee are purified and juſtified, and this ſort of faith is called in Scriptures, <hi>the faith of God, the faith of Jeſus, the faith of Abraham, the faith of Gods elect, the faith that worketh by love, the faith in the blood of Chriſt, the faith accounted for righteouſneſſe, the faith of the operation of God the moſt holy faith,</hi> and may be thus defined, that it is a full, firm, and certain truſt or confidence, written by the power and Spirit of God in the low, humble, penitent, and broken-heart, whereby it is given aſſuredly to believe, that all his ſins are forgiven; and thus he is made one with God by reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and atonement in and through the eternall and everlaſting love of Jeſus Chriſt; the materiall cauſe of this juſtifying faith thus defined is a full, ſure, and undoubted truſt or confidence; the formall cauſe is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112932:23"/>
the free grace and favour of God the Father, and of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt; the efficient cauſe is the alone work of the holy Ghoſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by imprinting in and aſſuring of the hearts of the elect of this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this grace and mercie; the principall and finall cauſe is the glory of God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the end ſubordinate is the ſalvation of the Saints, the choſen ones of God from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world: And this is the faith that juſtifieth, that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that overcommeth, that excelleth, whoſe dignity and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie every where ſhineth throughout the Scriptures; the ignorance of which this very age, yea, I ſay it again, this very age of ours deſerves all theſe preſent judgements, and more alſo then lie upon us at this time; we having had from God afforded us ſo great meanes to come to the knowledge of it: which ſort of faith whoſoever hath, ſhall never periſh, but men may partake of both the other ſorts to their condemnation.</p>
               <p>Other acceptations the terme Faith hath in the Scriptures alſo, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reference ſometimes to God himſelfe, and therein importing the ſtedfaſtneſſe and unchangeable truth of his decree and promiſe. And in other places it is to be underſtood of the doctrine of the Goſpel; and ſo alſo of their faithfull diſcharge of their office that are gifted to declare and preach the glad tidings of peace and ſalvation: Of which office it is hard for an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> holding ſuch principles as he doth, to come to underſtand; wherefore repent in time, leſt at laſt you turn all Familiſts, which you cannot avoid, if you continue in your principles.</p>

               <p>But what ſay you to us? We have the doctrine of the Goſpel pure and cleare, we hold faith and repentance to be the firſt works to life and ſalvation; and that the Church of God are a company of holy beleevers, and that now the time is come, that the Church ſhall bee delivered from all her ſufferings, according to the teſtimony of the Prophets and Apoſtles; the purity of Chriſts Ordinances ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, Chriſt ſhall bee ſet up upon his Throne, and his Church ſhall have the rule and preheminence in the world in greater power, dignity, and externall authority, then all the Monarchs that ever have been in the world before.

               <p>You ſpeak like thoſe that maintaine that the Church of Chriſt ſhall now ſo flouriſh and proſper, as that it ſhall extend its bounds and borders all Chriſtendome over, and moſt part of the world beſides, into a Monarchy; and as formerly the temporall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Chriſtianity hath had the rule and greatneſſe, ſo now the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power ſhall take place, and the Scepter of Chriſt in the cenſure of the Church, ſhall be advanced and bear rule above all other government. And that now already it is begun that God makes the kingdomes of this world our Lords, and his Chriſts, and that now it is come to paſſe, that the godly ſhall rule over the wicked: for now they are given to be captives to Gods people, whoſe captives Gods people were before this time. Wherefore I anſwer, Great are the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and prerogatives that the Scriptures ſpeak of Gods Church and people in the world to come after the reſurrection, is plain and evident in holy Writ; but to apply thoſe propheſies and promiſes to the Church in this preſent evill world, it is not well conſidered of you: for the Lord by his ſervants, ſpeaks of his Church in a double conſideration, as oppreſſed, afflected, and ſuffering here in this life, and as delivered, perfected and ſaved in the life to come; then to rule, but here to ſuffer; then to bee advanced into Chriſts Throne, but now, and here, to ſubmit to the Croſſe; now his houſe is a houſe of mourning, but then it ſhall be a palace of glory, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Citie of the great King ſhall be ſet up the praiſe of the whole earth. And in regard of his Churches preſent ſuffering, her Lord himſelfe thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to her, <hi>Feare not little flocke;</hi> and comforts her with the grace and favour of God for the time to come in theſe words: <hi>For it is your Fathers pleaſure to give you a Kingdom.</hi> And it is a truth concluded of by all, if we follow Chriſt in the eſtate of regeneration, we ſhall be made partakers of his glorification; if wee ſuffer with him, we ſhall reigne with him; the one condition is here, the other hereafter; the one in this world, the other in the world to come. This is the teſtimony of our Lord and all his ſervants, <hi>Matth. 19. 28. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 12. And that ſhort time, or while of ſuffering Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, is this preſent life; and the time of making ſuch ſufferers perfect, is the life to come, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. agreeing with his brother <hi>Paul,</hi> who according to the wiſdome of God given to him, had caſt up his accounts in theſe words, <hi>I reckon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:112932:24"/>
                  <hi>worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> Even then, ſaith S. <hi>John, when Chriſt which is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we appear with him;</hi> then ſhall we be like him in his dignity, as in this life we are like him in his ignominy, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. And (friend) looke into the Scriptures, and you ſhall find the Church, the bleſſed aſſembly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed now to ſuffer, to mourn, to bee hated, to weep, to be perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, and the contrary eſtate to be none of Gods Church or inheritance; Woe be to yee that laugh and rejoyce, that are full, and enjoy greatneſſe and proſperity; thoſe that are rich here, have received their conſolation; thoſe that are full in this life, ſhall hunger in the life to come; thoſe that are merry, laugh and want not here, ſhall weep and waile when the day of redemption comes: then ſhall be fulfilled to him that ſuffers not here, theſe words, Thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things: and to him that ſuffered here, theſe words, He his evill things; therefore thou that ſufferedſt not, art tormented: but thou that didſt ſuffer, thou art comforted, <hi>Matth. 5. Luke</hi> 6. and <hi>Luke</hi> 16. When Gods ſuffering people ſhall bee rewarded, then ſuch as have enjoyed their proſperity here, ſhall be condemned. I beſeech you, as you love the truth, decline this doctrine of yours: for by it you doe revive againe that old tenent of Popery. For what ever you affirme in your confeſſion, they have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it with fire and ſword, execration and excommunication: for they would prove, that their Church by Chriſts appointment, was to have ſupreme authority, power, and juriſdiction over all, they place themſelves above the ſtarres of God. And as in power, ſo in title, he muſt be called and ſtiled, the Lord God the Pope. And ſo he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged worſhip alſo, that Kings and Emperours muſt kiſſe his ſtinking feet and toes, in token of their ſlaviſh ſubjection in honouring him with the power of heaven and earth, to kill &amp; make alive, to pardon and retain ſins, falſly proving this his abomination and whoriſh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from Gods divine Oracles in theſe words, <hi>To execute vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heathen, and puniſhment upon the people, to bind their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of iron. This honour have all the Saints, Pſa.</hi> 149, 8, 9. avouching this Scripture to be fulfilled in the holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they were the Saints which by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie were foretold of to depoſe and diſthrone Kings: and to cloak &amp; colour their covetouſneſſe, which ſet all their trickes awork, as Bulls and Pardons, at all rates and prices, whereby their coffers were filled with gold and ſilver from all countries and people.

And indeed this conceit that the Church of God ſhould enjoy temporall peace, and outward glory and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, hath been alwayes the opinion of carnall Chriſtians, and the Jewes to this day cannot ſee otherwiſe then when their ſtill lookt-for Meſſiah ſhould come, that then they ſhall bee gathered to be a great people againe, and made a worldly Monarchy to rule over all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as now all Nations rule over them: But their groundleſſe hope will prove but as the Spiders web, and ſo it will be with all others of their mind: for ſee how the Scripture reſolves the queſtion, that the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Church of God, ſhall ſtill ſuffer to the worlds end, the queſtion is made with a loud voyce, ſaying, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth?</hi> And the anſwer from heaven ſaith, that <hi>they ſhould reſt yet a little ſeaſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their fellow ſervants alſo, and their brethren that ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould be fulfilled, Rev.</hi> 6. 10.

Finally, of this doctrine we have a double witneſſe, two brethren and Apoſtles, whoſe praiſe is in all the Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. who both as one man conclude this truth as a Decree for ever, <hi>That ſuch as continue in the faith, muſt through many tribulations enter into the Kingdome of God:</hi> which King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is that which all the Prophets and Apoſtles in all times have ſpoken of, which in its due place I ſhall briefly unfold.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:112932:25"/>
as it hath been ancient, ſo of late, as of many other errors, there is a reviving of this amongſt the reſt. And as you ſay, the ſumme of it is, that now, or they know not when, Chriſt ſhall deſcend perſonally from heaven, and then cauſe all the bodies of the Saints that have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered martyrdome from the beginning of the world, to be raiſed, and Chriſt and his Saints to live in this curſed earth, and corruptible world, in the enioyment of riches, wealth, power and authority, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Emporality, as no heathen nor Chriſtian Monarchy ever had in this world before; and you ground your miſtake on <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Now I anſwer, that the whole poſition is directly againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you alledge, rightly underſtood: for the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth it plainly, that <hi>the heavens muſt containe and receive Chriſt perſonally, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began,</hi> Acts 2. 21. Here are ſuch witneſſes as cannot be excepted againſt, even all his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and then, and not ſooner, <hi>ſhall the Lord Jeſus come, which before was preached unto you,</hi> verſe 20.</p>
               <p>And the place you inſtance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. proves no more the Millenary fancie, as you deſcribe it, then it proves a new world in the Moon; or that men may plow the floods of the Sea to ſow and plant on them. And becauſe the true underſtanding of that Scripture will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this error at once, wee will ſhew you that the reſurrection there ſpoken of, is the ſpirituall and firſt reſurrection which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt clearly layes down both in nature and order, <hi>John</hi> 5. 25. And becauſe it is a myſtery, therefore his expreſſion is more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> (twice affirming it) <hi>I ſay unto you, the houre is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and now is, when the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it ſhall live.</hi> This is the ſpirituall reſurrection from ſin, through the grace of regeneration: and theſe are they only that live and reigne with Chriſt, having ſought and gained the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, Matth.</hi> 6. 33. And thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that are riſen with Chriſt through regeneration, are born of God, and thoſe that are born of God through faith, are victors, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all oppoſition, even the whole world, and the Prince and King thereof, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. and in this ſenſe they reigne with Chriſt in their eſtate of temptation and regeneration, who in their teares and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are happy in the enjoyment of their Comforter, who anointeth them with the unction of truth, and teacheth and inſtructeth them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112932:26"/>
ſo ſufficiently, that all the powers and thrones of Antichriſt, the ſubtilties, crafts and deceits of him and all his learned Clerks, who have endevoured and uſed all means poſſible to couzen and cheat the people of God, for almoſt the ſpace of this thouſand two hundred and fourty yeares here expreſſed by the Millenary number onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall not exceed more thouſands then one; in which cloudy and dark day the holy Ghoſt hath ſo led and guided the ſonnes of truth, that all the Jugglers at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> could not make them to miſtake the mark of the Beaſt for the mark of the Lamb, nor to worſhip the Beaſt and his image in ſtead of the Lord and his Chriſt; yea, rather then they would defile themſelves with the adultery of the Whore, they would die a thouſand deaths: for ſo ſaith the Text, they loſt their lives and their heads for the witneſſe of Jeſus, &amp; for the pure worſhip of God contained in his word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. and in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe they lived and reigned with Chriſt the whole time meant by the thouſand yeares.</p>
               <p>And leſt the inconſiderate Reader ſhould miſtake this ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection for a corporall, as the Millenarians doe, the holy Ghoſt gives marks and bounds to his Diſciples, as evident diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other, in theſe words, <hi>Marvell not at this, John 5. 28. for the houre is coming,</hi> (hee doth not ſay as before, <hi>and now is) in which all that are in the graves, ſhall heare his voyce;</hi> which <hi>all</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains every one good and bad at the general reſurrection: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your doctrine is contrary to the truth the Scriptures hold out to us: for the Thrones, and they that ſate upon them, which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to be Chriſt and his Saints, the holy Ghoſt diſcovers the quite contrary, even to bee the power and authority of Antichriſt himſelfe, who had a Charter granted him of God, and under his own hand, for the whole time limited to deſolate and conſume the Saints, who for their ſinnes ſake the Lord doth often give them up to the pleaſure and rage of ſuch heatheniſh murtherers and perſecuters for a ſeaſon, to enter into the Sanctuary, and ſpoyle the heritage of the Lord, <hi>Jerem. 9. 16.

teares, and wipe them with the love of the truth, and look upon the Text once again, and compare the 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chapter verſe 2. with the 12. chapter verſe 3. and you ſhall ſee the ſame Dragon in the one place in the Ethnick Heatheniſh power of the Roman Emperour, with all fierceneſſe and unbridled cruelty, to havock, deſtroy, and kill the Saints and children of God exerciſed in a tenfold perſecution, to obliterate &amp; wipe out of the earth the name of Chriſt, the woman his Spouſe, and her firſt and primitive fruit, which was born to reign with Chriſt for ever; which power and authority the Devill inſtigated, and ſtirred up with all their malice and hatred, as with a flood, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as it were by the breach of the Sea, ſo that the wife of the Lord had no way to eſcape drowning and devouring, but to flie into the wilderneſſe, there to preſerve her ſelfe, and ſo many of her children as ſhe had preſerved from death, where ſhe was aſſigned to ſtay an houre, a month, a day, and a yeare, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
               <p>The ſame Dragon in the 20. Chapter you find to be bound; and yet in all and every day of his religation, to kill and deſtroy the Saints juſt as he did before, onely differing in the manner: for now it is with a reſtraint, ſecretly and cunningly, by guile and craft, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſtianity, and taking on him the name of a Chriſtian, and never the leſſe Devill then hee was before, onely a pretence makes the difference: for ever ſince the great battell that he fought, and loſt the field; for <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels prevailed then againſt the Drágon and his Angels; ſo that ever ſince all along Popery, the Devill hath turned Chriſtian; and herein by a bounded and reſtrained way, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his enmity to the full, as he did before in the Heathens, in an open profeſſed oppoſition to Chriſt and Chriſtianity. And it is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that when the Devill turned to be a Chriſtian, then hee put on <hi>Jupiters</hi> coat upon Chriſts back, and made the modell and plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of Chriſtian Religion, juſt after the faſhion of the Idoll Gods of the Heathen; and like a Juggler and deceiver, playes the ſame game divers and ſeveral wayes, ſometimes amongſt men, ſometimes amongſt the Angels of light, ſometimes on horſeback, ſometimes on foot; he rides on a red horſe with a great ſword among the Heathens in the Imperiall perſecution, and took outward peace from the primitive Chriſtians, as well as from the earth it ſelfe. In the time of Papacie, among carnall Chriſtians, he rides on a pale horſe; where the Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Dragon his rider, is called death it ſelfe, and hell followed with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 4. 8.

Now there is one thing more in the Text, and when I have ſpoke a word or two of the meaning thereof, I hope then you will ſee this Scripture proves not your error. And thus it followes, <hi>After that he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon.</hi> And in the ſeventh verſe, <hi>And when the thouſand years are expired, Satan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon;</hi> which words ſound as if the Devill ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the great red Dragon again after the reigne of Antichriſt, and fall to act his firſt part the ſecond time, to deny the Lord Jeſus whom all this while he hath confeſſed, and to ſet himſelfe to doe the utmoſt he can to oppoſe the very name of Chriſt and Chriſtians; and in this ſenſe doth the holy Ghoſt clearly expound theſe words in other Scriptures, as our Lord himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. doth clearly deſcribe and diſcover the whole time of Antichriſts abomination and perſecution, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did propheſie of it, which is the whole and every part and ſeaſon of the bound and reſtrained condition of the Dragon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. <hi>And immediatly,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>after the tribulation of thoſe dayes ſhall the Sunne be darkned, the Moon ſhall not give her light, and the Starres ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken,</hi> verſ. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In all which termes our Lord ſpeakes figuratively, and that another power after the end of Antichriſts tyranny, ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and fulfill theſe ſayings of his, which things were propheſied of before, by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 38. 2. &amp; 39. 1. and afterwards ſo underſtood by the Apoſtle <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 20. 8, 9, 10. which <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> underſtands to bee the Kings of the Eaſt, and the whole world. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12, 13, 14. where in a viſion he ſaw the Devill come out of the mouth of the Dragon, that is, he left the Ethnick Imperiall power, and alſo the power of the Beaſt, and beaſtly Clergy, he will deceive by that falſe Prophet no longer; but as he left all his old inſtruments, ſo he goes on to make uſe of a new one, theſe ſpirits of Devils goe forth unto the Kings of the earth, that is, they goe unto them that are of the greateſt power at this time, even the Kings of the whole world, to gather them to the battell of the great day of God Almighty; which Kings of the Eaſt, and of the Earth, and of the whole World, cannot be underſtood of any but of him that writes himſelfe God of Gods, and King of Kings, and Emperour of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe, the whole world, who giveth for his Enſigne the Moon, the very Embleme of the world.

is a wil-worſhip, and therefore Idolatrous, and aggravated, becauſe it is againſt the lawfull demands of Chriſtian authority. Here I would not be miſtaken, by what I have ſaid, to oppoſe the private ſpirituall communion of the Saints, according to the Apoſtles practice, and the Holy Ghoſts direction, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 25. But you ſay, this Text proves your Church-way, <hi>Hebrews</hi> Chap. 3. Verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which Scripture is this, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithfull in all his houſe, as a ſervant, ſo Chriſt as a ſon, is faithfull over his houſe; you making <hi>Moſes</hi> his faithfulneſſe to conſiſt in thoſe preſcripts and rules he gave for the Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Tabernacle in the form and ſtructure, for Prieſts and their habits, for the time of incenſe, ſacrifices, divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Oracles and Ordinances of God, even all the externall form and manner of Gods publike worſhip: and you ſay, that Chriſts faithfulneſſe in his houſe under the Goſpel is not inferiour to <hi>Moſes</hi> under the Law in all externall lawes, rules and directions in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for as much as Chriſt is the Son of his own houſe, and as <hi>Moſes</hi> had a word for every thing, ſo Chriſt hath left a word for every thing.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to be faithfull to make and do every thing according to the plat-form and pattern which he ſaw that was ſhewed him in the Mount, and his work was to make a temporall reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the eternall Tabernacle, which in a viſion was ſhewed him, and therefore he made the Tabernacle or moving Temple, and every particular that concerned the materiall things, both for ſubſtance and circumſtance, which were all figures and ſhadowes of that to come; and will you make that to come the Apoſtle ſpeaks of outward mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall externall things and circumſtances, and the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel, anſwerable in outward materiall externall things and circumſtances preſcribed to the <hi>Jewes</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> then you muſt have a word for the form and matter of Churches or houſes of meeting, a word to direct us, who, and how ſhall be Miniſters, who for what ſort of men, and how they ſhalbe ordained, and a word for the bels for calling the congregation together; a word for the Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the adminiſtration of all holy ſervices; a rule for diſmiſſing the aſſembly with a bleſſing; a word for childrens baptiſme, as for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; a word for the time &amp; matter of the Lords Supper, as which of all grapes for wine, and which of all grains for bread; and for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and geſture for communication, as for the Paſſeover, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall other circumſtances about Gods publike worſhip, which <hi>Moſes</hi> by a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:112932:30"/>
plain word preſcribed to the people. Now, if Chriſt by himſelf, or his Apoſtles, have left no ſuch particular word or direction for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall manner of his Churches, publique ſervices and order, as before are expreſt, then by your argument, Chriſt the Lord is not ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant, which is blaſphemy in any one ſo to ſpeak. Wherefore it appeares plainly you do not underſtand the Apoſtles meaning; And that you may conſider the Text, look again, and it will teach you, which ſaith, <hi>this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moſes, in as much as he who hath builded the houſe, hath more honour then the houſe;</hi> and again, Chriſt is faithfull, as a ſon over his own houſe, to purchaſe and redeem, to call, to make, to bleſſe, to ſanctifie and ſave it eternally; and this ſpirituall houſe, this heavenly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle is that which the Apoſtle proves Chriſt to exceed <hi>Moſes</hi> in even in the ſubſtance it ſelf, which all <hi>Moſes</hi> work did but witneſſe to, and figure forth, and therefore the Apoſtle makes the Sons houſe to be the Saints, the called and juſtified of God, whoſe houſe are wee, &amp;c. that is, all Gods elect regenerated ones; wherefore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>To day,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if you will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts,</hi> that is, repent, that your ſins may be done away, this is Chriſts way and method to build his Houſe, his Church, to make them ſpirituall by regeneration, and of theſe ſpirituall ſons to build his everlaſting Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; and thus Chriſt the Lord, the Son, the great Maſter-builder, is the high Prieſt and Miniſter of the <hi>holy ſanctuary, the true Tabernacle which God doth build or pitch, and not man,</hi> Heb. 8. 2. and in this ſenſe every where doth the Holy Ghoſt underſtand the Sons Houſe, or Church of Chriſt; <hi>the Temple of God is holy,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>which Temple yee are,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 17. and again, <hi>Yee are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you,</hi> which you have of God and not of man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. and in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>that it is the purchaſe of Chriſts blood,</hi> and the faithfulneſſe of the ſon of the Houſe; and again, ſaith hee, <hi>Chriſt loveth the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that hee might waſh it and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25, 26. this is the body, that is of Chriſt, which the whole ceremoniall law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were but ſhadowes of; and the faithfulneſſe of Chriſt in his houſe conſiſting of ſuch ſpirituall ſubſtances, as hath been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, take heed how you affect outward externall forms, rules and order; for we find in Scripture, that ſuch as have been of your mind, to promote and advance, reſting and glorying in the outward obſervation and common things of the Church, that they have been

               <p>You that talk ſo much of Gods Word, and underſtand ſo little of it, I pray you tell me where the name that moſt of you call your ſelves by is to be found in the Scriptures; I am ſure the term <hi>Independency</hi> is not once mentioned in all the Churches of the Saints; yea, of and by them the quite contrary is affirmed: For, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee,</hi> nor again, <hi>the head to the feet, I have no need of you: for as the body is one, and hath in my members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo is Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 21. and again, <hi>by one Spirit wee are baptized into one body,</hi>

verſ. 12, 13. that is, the whole Church, whether we be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> So then to follow the Apoſtles argument, if there can be no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency</hi> of the members of, or in one body, then no particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or Church can be <hi>independent</hi> from the reſt; and the reaſon is beyond anſwering, becauſe all particular Churches make but one, which is the body of Chriſt; and this is the Apoſtles inference, <hi>and ſo alſo is Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>ſo we being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one members one of another;</hi> ſo then ſee the memberſhip and Church-way of Gods Church in a ſpirituall and ſupernaturall reſpect, and not in a humane voluntary covenant, of which the Scripture ſaith, <hi>they confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, but not by me, ſaith the Lord, therefore acknowledge not a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy to all them, to whom this people</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall ſay a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,</hi> Iſa. 8. 12.

               <p>Indeed this is the doctrine you all teach and cry out for with one voyce or conſent, for which cauſe I term'd you all at firſt, all one enemy bound together wich the new-found common <hi>With</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,</hi> which under a fair pretence, as under the pleaſant object of green graſſe lies the Snake or Serpent, to deſtroy the very truth of God; and how ever you endeavour to bind <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the holy childe of God, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> the Harlot did, yet the <hi>With</hi> of your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which you call <hi>Independency,</hi> can the child and mother of Truth break in ſunder like a ſtraw of Rye, and graſſe of the field, to be burned with fire, never again to be reckoned amongſt the matter of Gods building; and that we may diſcover this ſtraw and ſtubble more cleerly, let us conſider what you ſay, in that you all agree in the freedome and liberty of conſcience, &amp;c. whereby the term Conſcience without due diſtinction, you put upon us moſt groſſe and abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions: For what do you ſay? in the generall you all ſay as much

for <hi>Popery, Familiſme, Arrianiſme, Arminianiſme,</hi> and all the reſt of the Hereſies in particular as for your ſelves; Wherefore to cleere the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by the rule of truth, note and obſerve, that the Scripture ſpeaks of the term conſcience in a manifold diſtinction: firſt, generally of two ſorts, good and bad: ſecondly, apart, and of both particularly; and</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the good, which is to be conſidered in a double reſpect; a ſtrong conſcience and a weak conſcience, ſo diſtinguiſhed, becauſe ſome are ſtrong through experience of the truth, and a great meaſure of knowledge, others through want thereof are weak, which weak conſcience ought not to be forc'd, but born withall and ſupported, as 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 7, 9, 10. 11. and <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 22. both which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences the Scripture calls <hi>good, pure, waſhed</hi> and <hi>purged,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 5. 1 Pet. 3. 21. 2 Tim. 1. 3. Heb. 9. 14. and 13. 18. Again, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſenſe, the bad or evill conſcience, that ought not to be born with and ſupported, in no reſpect whatſoever, which conſcience hath a twofold diſtinction alſo: for every man by nature, the elect as well as the reprobate, hath an evill conſcience; and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking in the perſon of the regenerate elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. ſaith thus; <hi>Having our hearts ſprinckled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water,</hi> cleerly ſhewing hereby, that the conſciences of the elect themſelves are wicked and evill by nature, before regeneration.</p>
               <p>And in the ſecond place, the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> ſpeaks of a higher degree of an evill conſcience, even of ſuch as had known the truth, and yet had not received the love of the truth; for which cauſe <hi>God ſends ſuch ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe lies,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. And as ſuch do not love the truth, ſo they depart from the true faith, and in ſtead thereof, give <hi>heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and doctrines of Devils, ſpeaking and preaching lies in hypocriſie; having their conſciences ſeared with a hot iron,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1, 2. And the Spirit of God ſpeaks expreſly of the latter times, in which laſt dayes of the world wee now live in, which dayes and times wee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence find to be perillous and dangerous, and by reaſon of the crafty, cunning, devilliſh doctrines that are invented and ſown amongſt us, that wee find our Lords words true, <hi>If it were poſſible they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very elect;</hi> for under fair ſpeeches and religious pretences, they broach and ſow dangerous doctrines: one cries out for <hi>Popery,</hi> and all the abominations thereof; another with his pretended new light, doth even darken the true light of men; others ſay the Spirit of adoption is in all men, a ſhining and burning light in the regenerate,

and in the naturall obſcured and covered over with corruptions, as the fire is rak'd up in aſhes; others ſay, a man hath no more ſoule then a horſe, and that the reſurrection ſhall be alike between men and beaſts; others ſay there is neither Angel nor Spirit, neither hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor hell, neither reſurrection nor perfection; others ſay they are Chriſt, the propheſied Meſſiah; others affirm of themſelves they are the two Witneſſes, the two Olive-trees, the two Prophets, and the two Candleſticks; others blaſphemouſly ſay, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was a deceiver, and ſo was the Apoſtles; they alſo ſpeak ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Scriptures, and ſay of themſelves, that they can write as good ſcripture as any of thoſe wee have; others are meere <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and ſay all things come by nature, and that they know not, nor hope for any better condition then the preſent, and will ſay theſe words, and ſuch like; Let us eat and drink, and be merry, for to morrow wee ſhall die: theſe, and a thouſand ſuch blaſphemies are maintained amongſt us, and will every one of them plead, it is their conſcience ſo to believe, which by your doctrine, ſhould all be ſuffered without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and puniſhment; for ſhame never plead any longer for <hi>Baal,</hi> but ſearch the Scriptures, the Word of God, and it will teach you, that the mouths of ſuch Heretiques and blaſphemers <hi>muſt be ſtopped,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 11. and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> is as expreſſe in this point, <hi>I would they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> Gal. 5. 12.

none of Chriſts Church, nor the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt; therefore, that ſhe may more apparently appear to your underſtanding, I ſhall indevour to make a brief deſcription of her &amp; her children. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of her ſometimes by the name of a man, and ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name and appellation of a woman: and at other times, in the Neuter gender, either he or ſhe, in theſe words, <hi>They overcame him with the blood of the Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They loved not their lives unto the death;</hi> hee ſaid unto them on his right hand, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. and abundance the like Scriptures, by which terms, either ſex is to be underſtood: now where the Scriptures ſet forth unto us the Saints and Church of Chriſt in the Feminine gender, under the name and title of a woman, then it notes unto us her fruitfulneſſe, in bringing forth unto God, as well as unto men. <hi>Jeruſalem from above is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us all,</hi> Gal. 4. 26. <hi>Of us all,</hi> that is, of all thoſe that are born of God, which birth is ſpirituall and heavenly, as before hath been ſhewed; and in this ſenſe ſhe brings forth fruit unto God alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4.

                  <hi>of Chriſt, who unfoldeth and maketh known to the world the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Eph. 3. 10. which woman ſometimes, according to the grace given her, is called <hi>a holy woman, a pure, undefiled, chaſt virgin;</hi> behold, <hi>theſe are my mother,</hi> ſaith the Lord himſelf: and ſometimes gloriouſly deſcribed; there appeared in heaven, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John, a great wonder, a woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve ſtars, great with child, travelling in birth with pain ready to be delivered,</hi> Rev. 12. 1, 2. Obſerve, this woman is continually fruitfull, ſtill increaſing, ſtill big, travelling and bringing forth unto God; and as ſhe is thus glorious in regard of her graces, ſo in regard of her ſorrows and ſufferings, ſhe is called <hi>a barren woman,</hi> by ſuch har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots as call themſelves the wife of Chriſt, who not knowing the low, the ſpirituall, the humble penitent poor condition of the true Spouſe, deſpiſe her, hate and contemn her, as <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>id did her Miſtreſs <hi>Sarah,</hi> the free-woman, and report of her that is the Lords love and delight, as deſolate and forſaken of her husband, even a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable and forlorn widow, and ſhall ſo be accounted of all that are filthy, till her ſufferings are ended, even as the off-ſcouring of the earth. This holy Church of Chriſt, is alſo deſcribed unto us in the Scripture, under the Maſculine appellation, <hi>a man, the firſt-born, a man-child; Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſaith the Lord by the Prophet, <hi>is my firſt-born,</hi> Deut. 4. 23. <hi>Let my ſon go,</hi> ſaith the Lord; <hi>for Iſrael is my ſon, my firſt-born,</hi> verſ. 22. <hi>I am a father to Iſrael,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and Ephraim is my firſt-born,</hi> Jer. 31. 9. where by <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> God means his faithfull choſen people, his Church: ſo the firſt and primitive fruit of the Church, under the Goſpel, is called <hi>a man-child,</hi> Rev. 12. 5. <hi>And ſhee brought forth a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron.</hi> Now this name or appellation of the Church, notes out unto us two things: Firſt, the honour and dignity of the Church, that although now in this life they ſuffer, and go by the worſt of all carnall and outward Chriſtians, yet in the time to come, they ſhall receive the ſelf-ſame honour which to their Lord alone, and in chief belongeth: And as they ſhall have the ſame honour with their Lord, <hi>Mat. 19.

Rev.</hi> 2. 27. with him in his throne; yea, in his owne throne. In the ſecond place, this Maſculine title notes out unto us the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:112932:33"/>
birth-right and inheritance that by right belongs unto the Church of God; that as the firſt-born man-child is the heir apparent, both by Scripture and nature, ſo the Lords firſt-born is the apparent heir of the purchaſed inheritance: and to this truth doth the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in theſe words, <hi>Rom. 8. 17.

Oh how ſweet and comfortable are the words! I could alwayes be mindfull of them; yea, of this word, <hi>heirs of the kingdome which hee hath promiſed,</hi> &amp;c. which now calls me to mind of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe at firſt, to deſcribe in its due place, the ſtone that was cut out without hands, which ſmote the Image upon his feet, which became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This term <hi>Mountain,</hi> in the Scriptures, ſets forth unto us, often lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, the hils, or higheſt parts of the earth, but figuratively the greateſt powers that are in this world, or that to come; and ſometimes by <hi>mountain</hi> we are to underſtand, ſuch carnall and naturall men as have high thoughts, and great eſteem of themſelves; and therefore as it is propheſied of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 3, 4. ſo it was fulfilled by him, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 4. who by the great gifts given him of God to work repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereby he prepared the Lords way, and turned the diſobedient <hi>to the wiſdome of the juſt;</hi> and of the operation of his Miniſterie, it is ſaid, <hi>Every mountain and hill was brought low,</hi> &amp;c. meaning, that the hearts of diſobedient naturall men were made penitent, and their high thoughts humbled.

Lord ſhortly go <hi>forth as a mighty man, he ſhall ſtir up jealouſie like a man of war, hee ſhall cry, yea roare; hee ſhall prevail againſt his enemies mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and although he have been long ſilent and held his peace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained himſelf all this world long, and hath ſuffered his own wife and little children to be afflicted with judgement from all the powers and authorities that have ruled in the earth, yet now it is neer at hand, that <hi>he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry,</hi> but will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and devour at once all the mountains and hils that have deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his own little holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> Iſa. 42. 13, 14, 15.

Now the holy Scribe <hi>Ezra,</hi> is ſhewed what the mountain cut out without hands is, 2 <hi>Ezr.</hi> 13. 35. that it is <hi>Sion,</hi> the Church of God, and her King, the Son of God, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the top of this mount <hi>Sion</hi> (a poſture of Majeſty, belonging only to a King,) and that this King ſhould without ſword, or lifting up his hand, or any inſtrument of war, deſtroy the multitudes that came out to fight againſt him with a blaſt of fire, ſent out of his mouth, and out of his lips a flaming breath and ſparkles, and tempeſt caſt out with his tongue, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. and the torments are like to a flame, and their deſtruction ſhall be with the law, that is, like unto fire, <hi>v.</hi> 38. And the peaceable multitude are the ten Tribes, carried away by <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneſer,</hi> king of <hi>Aſsyria;</hi> now both their carrying into captivity paſt long ago, and their return, which is not yet brought to paſſe, are a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly type of the Saints captivity, both of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the Churches preſſures and ſufferings, and of their deliverance and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo; as likewiſe the ſet-time to be in the day of the Lord Jeſus his coming and revealing, <hi>v.</hi> 28. to the 50. compared with 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. And farther, it filled the whole earth, ſaith the Text, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Prophets expreſſion, that the holy mountain of the Lord at the firſt was ſeen to be a ſtone cut out without hands, which cleerly deciphereth unto us, the true nature of the Church of Chriſt in her firſt and ſuffering condition, the ten Tribes captivity in their eſtate of regeneration, by which ſhee is made a holy, living, ſpirituall ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and ſo made or faſhioned, not by mans hands, or any humane power, as all the fleſhly Synagogues of this world are, but cut out and made without hands, as that Tabernacle which God doth build, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:112932:34"/>
not man, which is the <hi>true Church</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> Heb. 8. 2. And as I have often touched before, continually all this life long ſuffers under thoſe that are evill and malignant, truly ſo called: wherefore the Lord by the Prophet comforts this holy Church and mother of truth; <hi>for a moment have I forſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee; in a little wrath have I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting kindneſſe will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer;</hi> And again, <hi>Oh thou afflicted and toſſed with tempeſt; I will ſpeak it again, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſſed with tempeſt;</hi> here's a word that ſets out the ſuffering of truth with her children to the full, even ſo toſſed with the ſtorme and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of affliction, as a ſhip is toſſed with the roaring and raging waves of the ſeas; or as a ball is toſſed and beaten up and down, both by hand and foot, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. Now as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> by the dreame of the King did underſtand the day of ſmall things concerning the Churches condition in her eſtate of regeneration; ſo alſo he ſaw the great and glorious power and ſoveraignty, its dominion and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in its deliverance and perfection: and <hi>the ſtone that ſmote the Image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth;</hi> this is the mountain of Gods holineſſe, even the greateſt power and ſoveraigne authority that ever was in the world before it. And the Text notes out unto us three things, the time when it ſhall be, the place where it ſhall be, and the manner how it ſhall be; the manner hath a double conſideration, firſt, the beginning and weakneſſe of this powerfull kingdome, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as before I have declared in her ſpirituall eſtate of renovation or regeneration, in theſe words, <hi>a ſtone was cut out without hands;</hi> and in this firſt eſtate and condition of the Church, it is ſaid to live and reign, to attain victory, and overcome, <hi>Rev. chap.</hi> 20. &amp; 12. but this victory is by faith, this overcoming is by ſuffering, <hi>they overcame him,</hi> that is, the Dragons pagancy, <hi>by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and they loved not their lives unto death,</hi> and at this battell the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were great on both ſides, and the victory glorious on the Saints ſide, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7. 11. In the ſecond conſideration, wee are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Church in her glory and perfection, and to as far exceed all the Monarchies, Kingdoms and Powers that were before it, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy exceeds the ſhadow, the perſon the picture, the circumference the center. The <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, the head of gold, was a great power, <hi>Thou, O King,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>art a King of kings, for the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath given thee a kingdome, ſtrength, power and glory, and whereſoever the children of men dwell, beaſts of the field, and fowles of the heaven hath</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:112932:35"/>
                  <hi>hee given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all,</hi> yet all theſe bounds and dominations are but by way of compariſon, to the univerſe, the heavens, earth and ſea, which are the bounds of Chriſts and his Church, rule and Lordſhip: Secondly, the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the kingdomes of this world, and the power and greatneſſe of Majeſty that Chriſts Kingdome ſhall have in the world to come, differs beyond all compariſon: For the kingdomes of this world are finfull kingdomes, powers and authorities; yea, this preſent evill world is corrupted, and lies under the curſed condition by reaſon of ſin, and <hi>as long as this face of the covering is caſt over all people,</hi> and <hi>this evill is ſpread over all nations,</hi> Iſa. 25. 7. even ſo long death the King of feares the wages of that ſin ſhall raign in it, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Gen. 3. 17. Rom. 5. 17, 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. but when the Lord ſhall ſet up his Kingdome, <hi>hee will create new heavens, and a new earth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will do it, and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind: but be you glad and rejoyce for ever in that which I create; For, behold, I create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and her people a joy,</hi> Iſa. 65. 17, 18. And the Apoſtle by the ſame Spirit of Prophecy, ſaith, <hi>that the heavens and the earth that are now, with all theſe things, ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> And according to Gods promiſe, wee look (that is, all Gods Saints) <hi>for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. what this new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and new earth is, even the holy Church of God, <hi>the new Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband;</hi> and a voyce out of heaven expounds it to him, <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and hee will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more paine; for the former things are paſſed away: And again, ſaith the Lord, Behold, I make all things new, write, for theſe things are true and faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once again obſerve the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a great mountain,</hi> of which our Saviour gives the meaning in theſe words, <hi>The kingdome of heaven is like unto a grain of muſtard ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds, but when it is grown</hi> (juſt as the Prophet [<hi>it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi>] ſo our Lord) <hi>it is the greateſt among herbs, and became a tree,</hi> &amp;c. both which places as one ſhews, that although the Church be now ſo little, that no man heeds or regards her, yet her increaſe ſhall be from the leaſt of all ſeeds to a tree with branches, and from a ſmall ſtone to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112932:35"/>
a huge great mountain, even ſo big, as to fill the whole earth.</p>
               <p>Which magnitude, excellent glory, greatneſſe, and ſoveraignty of the Church and Kingdome of God, I ſhall in part diſcover, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering theſe eight particulars: the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> the <hi>Throne,</hi> the <hi>Scepter,</hi> the <hi>Lawes,</hi> the <hi>Priviledges,</hi> the <hi>Officers,</hi> and the <hi>Subjects:</hi> And for the <hi>King</hi> thereof, thus ſaith the Prophet, notwithſtanding all the rage and oppoſition of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and the vain imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 1. 5. and the title of his Crown is the title of his Croſs, <hi>This is the King of the Jewes,</hi> Luke 23. 38. and himſelf teſtifying a good confeſſion before <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſaiſt I am a King: to this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world,</hi> Joh. 18. 37. Secondly, the Scriptures ſpeake of the <hi>Kingdome of</hi> Chriſt above all compariſon, and calls it, <hi>the kingdome of the Son of God,</hi> and, <hi>that there was given him dominion, and glory, and a Kingdome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13, 14. Now the conſideration of theſe four things will briefly diſcover to us, how this Church and Kingdome of Chriſt exceeds all other powers or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes whatſoever: Firſt, in the Majeſty of it: Secondly, in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency: Thirdly, in its univerſality; and Fourthly, in its eternity: The Majeſty ſets forth the magnitude and greatneſſe of this kingdom, the King is great, and the Kingdom is great, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Angel to the Virgin, <hi>he ſhall be great, and he ſhall raign over the houſe of Jacob for ever,</hi> Luke 1. 32. 33. And the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> deſcribes this greatneſſe, and what this houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> is, in theſe words, <hi>and the kingdome, and dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdome under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High, whoſe kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdome, and all dominions, rulers and powers, ſhall ſerve and obey him,</hi> Dan. 7. 27. The excellency is ſet forth by the glory, ſplendor and purity of it; and in this reſpect it is in Scripture called <hi>the kingdome of God, the kingdome of Chriſt, a kingdome of Prieſts, a kingdome of Saints, the kingdome of our God, the kingdome of glory, heavenly countrey, city, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, poſſeſſion, reward,</hi> all heavenly, all glorious, all holy, there ſhall be nothing <hi>to hurt nor deſtroy in my holy mountaine,</hi> ſaith the Lord: the glory is expreſt beyond the light of Sun and Moon in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or gold or precious jewels in the earth, <hi>there ſhall in no wiſe be any thing there that defileth,</hi> Rev. 21. 27. Thirdly, its univerſality ſets forth the largeneſs of the dominion and unbounded limits of it; the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Its dominion is from ſea to ſea, from the river to the ends of the earth, I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion,</hi> there's the dominion; and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:112932:36"/>
in the next words, ſee the greatneſſe of the power and authority, <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, and daſh them to pieces like a Potters veſſell,</hi> Pſal. 2. 8, 9. <hi>They that dwell in the wilderneſſe ſhall how before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt; yea, all kings ſhall fall down before him, all nations ſhall ſerve him,</hi> Pſal. 72. 8, 9, 10. And therefore hee is called <hi>the King of nations, for his univerſall juriſdiction; Who would not feare thee, O King of nations? for greatneſſe and power pertain to thee,</hi> Jer. 10. 6, 7. And <hi>Daniels</hi> witneſſe is, <hi>that all people, nations and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages ſhall feare him, his dominion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſſe away, and his Kingdome that which ſhall not be deſtroyed,</hi> Dan. 7. 14. which in the laſt place ſhewes the eternity or perpetuity of the Kingdome; and therefore the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>The everlaſting Kingdome of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 11. <hi>He ſhall raign,</hi> ſaith the Angell, <hi>over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdome there ſhall be no end,</hi> Luke 1. 33. And this glorious kingdome of Chriſt is often in Scripture term'd <hi>a world without end:</hi> under theſe terms, <hi>everlaſting life, everlaſting kingdome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The people of God,</hi> that formerly were, and now are refuſed, contemned, and caſt off from the thoughts and eſtimations of others, <hi>ſhall then in that day be made a ſtrong nation, and the Lord himſelf ſhall raign over them in mount Sion, from henceforth even for ever,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>The next and third particular to be conſidered, is the throne of the Kingdome of Chriſt; And for that wee have the Angels teſtimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; <hi>And the Lord God ſhall give unto him the throne of his father David,</hi> Luk. 1. 32. And againe, <hi>Thy throne, O God, is a throne of righteouſneſſe, eſtabliſhed for ever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 45. 6. And againe, <hi>Thy ſeed will I eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.</hi> And againe, <hi>His ſeede will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the dayes of heaven,</hi> Pſal. 89. 4. ver. 29. And againe the third time, <hi>His ſeed ſhall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sun before me,</hi> ver. 36.</p>
               <p>What moves the holy Prophet thus three times to make mention of the King, the throne, and thy ſeed, that is, Gods children by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, thus to ſing and rejoyce in the remembrance of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for to ſhew us this holy truth, that the Saints ſhall reigne with their King, that <hi>the Saints ſhall judge the world?</hi> for this bleſſed comfort the Lord preaches to his children himſelf by his own mouth, <hi>Rev. 2. 26, 27. He that evercometh and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron, &amp;c. And I will grant to him to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my father in his Throne,</hi> Chap. 3. 21.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:112932:36"/>
And thus taught he his bleſſed Apoſtles that followed him, in the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, and had participated and continued with him in his ſufferings and <hi>temptations,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>I appoint unto you a kingdome,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>as my Father hath appointed unto me, that yee may eat and drink at my table, in my Kingdome, and ſit on thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 19. 28. Luke 22. 29, 30. yea, <hi>this honour have all the Saints, with the King in the Kings Throne; Oh yee Saints, praiſe yee the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 149. 9.</p>
               <p>The fourth particular is the Scepter of this kingdome, and that the Holy Ghoſt calls <hi>a Scepter of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Heb. 1. 8. <hi>a Scepter of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſſes,</hi> that is, righteous in the purity and excellency of it, <hi>is the Scepter of thy Kingdome;</hi> this is properly <hi>Shilohs,</hi> the <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> Scepter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. Yet ſuch is the Kings grace to his ſervants, his ſeed, Church and people, that of this which in particular belongs to himſelf alone, even of this alſo doth hee communicate to his little ones, his firſt-born, the heirs of ſalvation, not only to ſit with him in his Throne, but alſo to rule with his Scepter: The womans childe which are the Saints, ſaith the Text, are to rule even as their Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth, <hi>all nations with a rod of iron,</hi> that is, <hi>with the Scepter of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> Rev. 12. 5. And the Lord hath decreed for ever, that it ſhall be ſo, whoſoever he be that overcometh, hee will give him power and authority to ſit with him in his Throne, to rule over all nations, <hi>with a rod of iron, and to break them as an earthen veſſell</hi> is daſht to pieces with a bar of iron, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26, 27. And as the King of glory doth place the Saints in his own throne, and gives them in particular the ſway and rule of his own Scepter, ſo he honours them with his own crown alſo, called <hi>a Crown of life, a Crown of glory, a Crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> and the like, they are all crowned, <hi>Rev. 4. 10. The crown is laid up for all that love the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the King of Saints,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8.</p>
               <p>The fifth particular in diſcovering the greatneſs of Chriſts glorious kingdome, are the laws and rules of this kingdom, for as the kingdom it ſelf is new, and all things new in it, ſo are the laws alſo, <hi>A new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment give I unto you,</hi> ſaith the King himſelf, <hi>that you love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I have loved you, that you love one another,</hi> Joh. 13. 34. Here's both the <hi>Precept</hi> and the <hi>Preſident;</hi> this holy commandment was given unto them in their eſtate of regeneration, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. and continues in them world without end, in glory and perfection, <hi>it is the law of the endleſs life;</hi> this law of love, <hi>it abideth for ever, charity never faileth,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 8. moſt or all things elſe ſhall fail, Prophecy ſhall fail, tongues ſhall ceaſe,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:112932:37"/>
knowledge it ſhall vaniſh away; all imperfect things ſhall terminate and come to an end, but this new commandement <hi>Love, endures for ever;</hi> Death is ſtrong, for it hath and will kill all men made and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the grave, the iſſue of death is mightie, but <hi>love</hi> ſurmounts them all in the better ſenſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6. The ſea of waters cannot quench it, nor all the flouds, or <hi>overflowings of the Ocean cannot drowne it;</hi> for the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame, and it contemns all manner of ſubſtance to purchaſe it, it is no way to be attained, but by the gift of God. <hi>I will put my lawes in their inward parts, and write them in their hearts, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. 33. This glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kingdome are all ſuch as are made of God Kings and Prieſts; theſe are the Levits to whom God hath given the Law and Covenant of life to, this commandement of peace and ſalvation, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. which hath comforted his people here, and for ever doth guide and regulate them in the perfection, the glorious and everlaſting kingdome of Chriſt hereafter. Which Law of Gods kingdome is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a <hi>holy law,</hi> a <hi>royall law,</hi> a <hi>law of life,</hi> a <hi>law of libertie,</hi> a <hi>perfect law,</hi> and ſuch like, <hi>James</hi> 1. 25. Chap. 2. 8. 12.</p>
               <p>The ſixt thing conſiderable, is the priviledges of this kingdome of glory, which are ſo great and many, that I ſhall rather obſcure then diſcover them, their priviledge of power and Authoritie is exceeding much, and abundantly ſet forth in the Scriptures; for when the Lord ſhall exalt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this his own kingdome, then <hi>ſhall the Lord breake the ſtaffe of the wicked, and the ſcepter of the rulers,</hi> Iſa. 14. 5. <hi>Behold, ſaith the Lord, I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan, which ſay they are Jewes and are not, but doe lye. Behold,</hi> (ſaith he the ſecond time againe to his Church) <hi>I will make them come to worſhip before thy feete, and to know that I have loved thee,</hi> Rev. 3. 9. This is ſuch a dignitie and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as the Lord himſelfe with a twofold word of audience affirmeth <hi>to take them captives, whoſe captives they were, and to rule over their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors,</hi> Iſa. 14. 2. with the praiſes of God in their mouths, and a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſword in their hands, to execute vengeance &amp; puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heatheniſh people, to binde their Kings with chaines, &amp; their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with fetters of iron; this <hi>honour or priviledge have all the Saints,</hi> Pſal. 149. And ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The ſonnes of them that afflicted thee, ſhall come bending unto thee, and all that deſpiſed thee, ſhall how them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves downe at the ſoles of thy feete, and they ſhall call thee the Citie of the Lord, the Sion of the holy One of Iſrael; whereas thou haſt been forſaken and hated, ſo that no man went through thee, or delighted in thy company; I</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:112932:37"/>
                  <hi>will make thee an eternall excellency, a joy of many generations,</hi> Iſa. 60. 14, 15. So alſo their priviledge of freedome and libertie, doth ſet forth their glory; <hi>Jeruſalem which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all, Gal.</hi> 4. 26. They are all free-borne, ſo begotten and born by the Word it ſelfe; for all the whole Kingdome are children of the truth, and the truth it was that which made them free, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 32. Now the Word and the truth are the Sonne, and <hi>thoſe that the Sonne makes free, are free indeed,</hi> ver. 36. and from all manner of bondage; free from ſinne, free from death, free from ſorrow, free from the grave, free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, free from oppreſſion, free from ſuffering, inlarged and ſet at libertie for ever to injoy immortalitie, theſe are the people that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe and injoy the <hi>glorious libertie</hi> or freedome <hi>of the ſonnes</hi> or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 21.</p>
               <p>Alſo the company and aſſociates that are in this heavenly kingdome doe exceedingly declare the glory of it, to have and injoy the preſence of God, of Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt, the company of all the holy Angels, the company and ſocietie of all the holy Patriarks, Prophets, and Saints, with the comfortable delight and excellency of the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and perfection of all creatures, both in the heavens, the earth, and the ſea, and all that is within them, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter, in the point of univerſall ſubjection. <hi>In Gods preſence,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>is fulneſſe of joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16. 11. <hi>You,</hi> ſaith the Lord, ſpeaking to his Saints, <hi>I appoint unto you a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yee ſhall eate and drinke with mee at my table in my kingdome, Luk.</hi> 22. 30. And as the Angels are miniſtring ſpirits here in the Saints ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. ſo in the world to come with the preſence of God wee ſhall have the company &amp; preſence of the Angels <hi>about the throne,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 11. And there ſhall wee ſee <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the <hi>holy Prophets</hi> in the <hi>kingdome of God,</hi> and have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſweet ſocietie and company with them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 28. Now as the priviledges of the kingdome excell, ſo alſo its Officers exceed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>make thy Officers peace, and thine exactors righteouſneſſe; violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land, waſting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction within thy borders; but thou ſhalt call thy walls ſalvation, and thy gates praiſe,</hi> Iſa. 60. 18, 19. Then <hi>ſhall mercy and truth meet together, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and peace ſhall kiſſe each other,</hi> Pſal. 85. 10. And this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth conſideration; the eight followeth, which are the ſubjects of this great King and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle is ſo generall and univerſall in theſe, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:112932:38"/>
none, neither in heaven, nor in earth, not ſea, nor under the earth, even none that can be named, but God the Father onely, that ſubdued all under his Sons feet, which is the King of this Kingdom; for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 27. For he hath put all things under his feete; for when he ſaith, all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted who did put all things under him:</hi> ſo then it is cleare, that Angels and men, and all other creatures, are the ſubjects of this great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>He hath put all things in ſubjection under his feete,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. And this is the Prophets witneſſe; <hi>I have ſworne by my ſelfe, ſaith the Lord, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſſe, and ſhall not returne,</hi> that <hi>unto me every knee ſhall how, every tongue ſhall ſweare,</hi> Iſa. 45. 23. And againe, <hi>The nations and kingdomes that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh, yea thoſe nations ſhall be utterly waſted,</hi> Chap. 60. 12. And of the Angels ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1. 6. And the <hi>Apoſtle expounds the Oath</hi> of the Lord for this univerſall ſubjection, and ſaith, <hi>It is written, as I live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall how to mee, and every tongue ſhall confeſſe to God,</hi> Rom. 14. 11. And againe he ſaith, <hi>At the name of Jeſus every knee ſhall how, of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue ſhall confeſſe that Jeſus is Lord and King, to the glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2. 10, 11. And yet the holy Ghoſt is more particular, to prove that all things in all places are ſubject to Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 13. And <hi>every creature,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them,</hi> ſaith <hi>John, heard I ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bleſſing, honour, glory and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lambe for ever and ever.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> he foretold of this univerſall ſubjection of all creatures in the kingdome of Chriſt in the world to come, ſaith the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and underſtood it in theſe words, admiring at it, <hi>What is man that thou art ſo mindfull of him, or the ſonne of man that thou viſiteſt him? thou haſt made him a little lower then Angels;</hi> and the Apoſtle gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that, <hi>Thou haſt crown'd him with glory and honour, thou haſt made him to have dominion over the work of thy hands, thou haſt put all things under his feete, all ſheep and oxen, yea and the beaſts of the feild; the fowles of the aire, and the fiſhes of the ſea:</hi> which makes the Prophet fall into a wonderment; <hi>Oh God our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</hi> Pſal. 8. 4. Heb. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>Now I am come to the two laſt particulars, the time when this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be ſet up, and the place where it ſhall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:112932:38"/>
be continued for ever: the time was thus foreſhewed to the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> that the time of Chriſts Churches perſecution, ſhould not be till his ſecond Appearing, in theſe words, <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Sion, he ſhall appeare in his glory,</hi> Pſal. 102. 16. And this time our Lord himſelfe plainly teacheth us to be at the end of this world, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which truth the Saints and people of God do fully and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, although a thouſand falſe Prophets ſhould ariſe and preach the contrary, under what ſhew or pretence of learning and religion ſoever they make.</p>
               <p>The cleare and plaine Doctrine of our Lord is this, <hi>Mat. 13. 39, 40, 41. The harveſt is the end of the world, and the reapers are the Angels, as therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire, ſo ſhall it be in the end of this world, the Sonne of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdome,</hi> all ſcandalous things, and all ſuch as do offend them, or <hi>which doe or worke iniquitie.</hi> And when the queſtion <hi>is made</hi> by the <hi>ſervants to the houſholder, Whether the tares the envious man ſowed among the good ſeede ſhould be pluckt up?</hi> The <hi>Maſter</hi> anſwers, <hi>Nay, let them both grow together till the harveſt;</hi> and alſo giveth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſheweth farther what ſhall be done then, and not before, both with the tares &amp; wheat alſo, although many unwarily do affirm at this time amongſt us the contrary, yet thus ſaith the Lord, (and therefore I would wiſh all the contrary minded to take notice of it) that at his glorious coming ſhall be the Kingdomes deliverance, reigne, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and not before; therefore ſaith her Lord and King, <hi>When the Sonne of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall be ſit upon the throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, is a ſhepheard divideth his ſheep from the goats, and then he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left,</hi> and aſſigne and put in poſſeſſion the one to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bliſſe, but the other to a perditious eternall wofull curſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even binding them into bundles to be burned; but the bleſſed to poſſeſſe the Lords own houſe and habitation for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31, 32. Chap. 13. 30.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this truth hath exceedingly ſuffered of late, by the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral learn'd of this generation, who have befoul'd the beauty and purity of it, with their dark ſmokie &amp; miſty miſtakes, under pretence of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the Lamb and his wife; I ſhall therefore briefly diſcover the ſpirituall learning of the Apoſtles and Prophets myſterious expreſſions of this holy truth: the holy Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> ſpeaks with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:112932:39"/>
the ſame wiſdome, aid and guidance of the Spirit, as the Angel taught <hi>Daniel</hi> in the ſame myſteries, and their very expreſſions in many things are alike, but more opened and revealed by the Apoſtle, then by the Prophet; they both agree in the computation of the time, though one writ long before the other, and each differing in the rule of reckoning, as the manners of the countries in which they lived; the one living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the other among the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> the one computing their times and yeeres according to the courſe of the Sun, the other by the courſe of the Moon: the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> their reckoning is certain thirty dayes to a moneth, and twelve moneths to a yeer; the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> they reckon and compute according to the courſe and rule of the Moon, which cauſes this ſeeming difference: for <hi>Johns</hi> whole time for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts</hi> raign is <hi>twelve hundred and ſixty yeers,</hi> in which the two witneſſes <hi>ſhall propheſie in ſackcloth,</hi> which as it notes out unto us their ſpirituall low and humble condition, ſo alſo their perſecuted and ſuffering eſtate and condition, <hi>Rev:</hi> 11. 3. Now <hi>Daniel</hi> makes the ſame very time of the <hi>abomination of deſolation,</hi> to be <hi>twelve hundred and ninety yeers,</hi> Dan. 12. 11. reckoning both of them dayes for yeers, according as the Prophets did reckon and accompt, as I have proved before: now I ſhall make it appear unto you, that theſe two holy men of God, that were moved and led by the ſame Spirit, both ſpake one and the ſame thing, both for the power and myſtery of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and for the full and compleat time of one and the ſelf-ſame number of yeers, for the continuance of it. And I prove it thus: as thirteen moons are thirteen moneths, and theſe thirteen moneths make but one yeere of twelve moneths, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirty dayes to a moneth, and twelve moneths to a yeere, by the ſame rule, <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ninety yeers</hi> by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, amount but to <hi>one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore yeers,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reckoning of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And as they agree in this ſeeming difference, ſo they do moſt ſweetly conſent and agree in the point in hand, concerning the time of the beginning of the glorious kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, one and the ſame Angel teacheth them one and the ſame truth; and although there were neer 500. yeers diſtance between the times of their propheſying, yet the Angels majeſty both of doctrine and geſture is one and the ſame to both, all which ſhewes this doctrine of the time of the Lords coming to reſtore all things, to exalt his Church and Saints, to be a moſt admirable and ſingular ſecret and myſtery, for the continuall comfort and ſupportation of all his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring members in all their afflictions; and this made the Apoſtle, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:112932:39"/>
to the Saints of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> of the day of the Lords coming, his deſcending from heaven at the laſt trump, and the reſurrection of ſuch as are dead in Chriſt; wherefore ſaith he, <hi>comfort one another with theſe words,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 18. Bleſſed and holy is he, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John,</hi> that hath part in the firſt reſurrection, for hee alone is the man that lookes for his coming, and hath comfort in his appearing; the very ſame ſaith <hi>Daniel, Bleſſed is he that waiteth and cometh to the 1335. dayes, but go thou thy way till the end be, for thou ſhalt reſt and ſtand in the Lot at the end of the dayes,</hi> Dan. 12. 12, 13. which number exceeds the former, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the whole time of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> raign and perſecution, 45. yeers, thereby diſcovering a deep myſtery of high underſtanding, which none but the wiſe can poſſibly apprehend, as the Prophet declareth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. which additionall number notes out unto us, that little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſhall be between the totall deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and the finall conſummation of this world, which our Lord himſelf ſignifieth by the word <hi>immediately,</hi> thereby to ſet forth all the time between the dayes of tribulation, and his own glorious appearing; and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John</hi> uſes the word <hi>quickely,</hi> to ſet forth all the time likewiſe between the wofull raign of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the wofull ruine of all ungodly men in theſe words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. The ſecond wo is paſt, and behold the third wo cometh <hi>quickely;</hi> and as it is ſhewed to <hi>John,</hi> that after the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers ſhould be finiſhed, expired, and fulfilled, which is the whole time of <hi>Poperies</hi> cruelty and myſterie of <hi>Iniquity;</hi> and the Dragon, the Devils liberty, which is expreſt for the time to be a little ſeaſon, in which Satan ſhall move and ſtir up the nations of the four quarters of the earth, even <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> thoſe great and innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to deſolate the Saints, the Church, even the beloved city of God, as before I have touched, till the very inſtant of time of the Sonne of mans coming in his white and glorious throne to judgement, before whoſe face the earth and the heavens fled away, and there was found no place for them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. and likewiſe the 45. addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall yeers of <hi>Daniels Chaldee</hi> reckoning, to be the whole time in which God will accompliſh the ſcattering of the powers of his holy people, and between the ending of the time, times and half a time, and the generall reſurrection to have all theſe things fulfilled; and this is cleerly, though briefly intimated, wherefore I demand of all you learned <hi>Monarchiſts, Judaiſts</hi> and <hi>Millenariſts,</hi> where in Gods Word you will find any time for the glory of the Churches proſperity in this

world? Well, let a word be enough to the wiſe, and therefore never preach nor print ſuch doctrines hereafter.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing is the place, where the Scriptures ſpeak that Chriſt and his kingdome ſhall be in for evermore, and that is the earth, ſaith the truth, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherite the earth,</hi> Mat. 5. 5. <hi>The kingdomes of this world are become the kingdomes of our Lord and his Chriſt, and he ſhall raign for ever and ever,</hi> Rev. 11. 15. even then, when <hi>the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
