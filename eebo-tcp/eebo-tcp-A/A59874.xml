            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>WHen the Lord turned again the</hi>
               <note place="margin">126 Psal. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.</hi> Which the Psalmist spoke of the deliverance of the Jews from the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Captivity; but is very easily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally applied to the Occasion of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Solemnity. For I hope we have not so soon forgot with what surprizing Joy we beheld our banished Prince return again to his Throne, who brought back with him our Laws; our Liberties, and our Religion; that is, brought <hi>England</hi> into <hi>England</hi> again, which was banished with its Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing its Place and Climate. And though that beloved and admired Prince,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63398:3"/>
who gave the first lustre and glory to this day, now sleeps with his Fathers, and has onely left us the memory of his Princely Vertues to adorn the Records of Time, and the Succession of English Kings, yet this day ought not to be forgot, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to us not onely a Mortal Prince, whom we could not expect should live for ever, but the Royal Family, which we hope and pray may be Immortal. Though the Great <hi>CHARLES</hi> be dead, the King lives still in his Royal Brother, who was the Rightful Heir of his Crown, and the Partner of all his Joys and Sorrows, who was banished with him, and who returned with him, and augmented the brightness of this day by his united Beams; a Prince who equals the greatest Examples of former Kings, and, as we have reason to hope, will leave a greater to those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>It was not the Throngs and Crowds of People, which met their returning Prince, nor those loud and joyful Acclamations wherewith they welcomed him to his Country and Throne; it was not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63398:3"/>
Pomp and Splendour of the Show, though as magnificent as Art and Nature could make it; nay, it was not meerly the transporting sight of a Prince, who was now endeared by long Absence, and by the Oppressions and Injuries of Usurpers, who after ten thousand Indignities return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Expressions of a Princely Goodness and Indemnity: I say, though these were all very affecting Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and added much to raise and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a present Passion, yet they were not the true Glory of this day, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in restoring the English Monarchy in the Royal Line: for this we bless God, and for the continuance of this we pray this day; and if we believe King <hi>Solomon,</hi> there is great reason for both; for it is as great a Blessing as any Nation can enjoy: <hi>Blessed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words are so plain, that I cannot think of any plainer to express their sence by; and therefore not to loose time in a needless Explication, there are three things observable in them. 1. That Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63398:4"/>
is a great Blessing: for it cannot be a Blessing to have our King the Son of Nobles, if it be not a Blessing to have a King. 2. That the noble Descent and Extraction of a King is a great Blessing to a Nation, as my Text expresly says, <hi>Blessed art thou, O Land,</hi> &amp;c. And the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from this is, 3. That an Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Monarchy is a great Blessing: for we are secure, that our Kings are the Sons of Nobles, when the Son inherits the Fathers Crown.</p>
            <p>1. That Kingly Government is a great Blessing. As for that Dispute, Whether Kingly Government be by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> if by <hi>Divine Right</hi> we mean a positive Law and Institution of God, that all Nations shall be governed by Kings, I find no such thing in Scripture, which is the onely Revelation of the Divine Will; but if by Divine Right, we mean onely such an intimation of the Will of God, as we can learn from the appearances of Nature and Providence, I dare boldly affirm, that Kingly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by Divine Right; that is, is most
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63398:4"/>
agreeable to all those notices we have of the Will of God from the original frame and constitution of Nature, and from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations of Providence; which though it be not sufficient to condemn all other Governments as unlawful, yet it advances Monarchy above all other Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when it appears, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has at least given the preference to it.</p>
            <p>The History of the Creation is a plain proof of this; for God made but one Man, to whom he gave the Dominion and Empire of the World, who was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Lord as well as Father of all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; which is as good an argument for the natural institution of Monarchy, as Gods creating but one Man and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is against Divorce, which yet is our Saviours Argument, 10 <hi>Mark</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Thus it was at the new peopling of the World after the Floud; God left but one Independent Head of a Family, <hi>Noah,</hi> who had a Paternal and Regal Authority over his Sons and their Posterity: So that Mankind were born under a Monarchical
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63398:5"/>Government, which therefore is the first and the most natural Government, instituted by God by the very Laws of our Creation; for when God made but one Man, who by the Law of Nature has a right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his own Children, (who then were all Mankind) he made him a natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
            <p>We have no Histories of those Times to acquaint us how the Government descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but we have all the reason in the world to believe, that as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by a Paternal Right, so when Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind increased, and grew too numerous to dwell together, they were formed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Kingdoms, under the Government of the Heads and Princes of their several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; for in those days they knew no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right of Government but what was Natural and Paternal.</p>
            <p>I urge this onely to prove that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is the original form of Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by God himself; not that every Monarch must have the same right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> had; for then there is no Prince in the world can
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63398:5"/>
make good his Title to the Crown: But these are very distinct questions, what is that form of Government which God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed? and by what right a particular Prince can challenge this Authority? In the first Ages of the World, while the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal descent of Families was known, there could be no dispute about the Succession; but when the numbers of men increased, and Families were divided and sub-divided, and intermixt with each other, when these little Independent Princes invaded their Neighbours, and enlarged their Dominions by force and power, the right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment altered, but the Form of Government was the same still. And though a Prince now governs not by a Paternal Right as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> did, but by the Election of the People, or by the Right of Conquest, or by a Succession from ancient Kings, who have been long possest of the Throne, the Monarchy is the same, though the claim to Soveraign Power varies. Gods original institution of Monarchy in a Paternal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment justifies the Form, whatever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute there may be about the Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63398:6"/>And therefore we find, when this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Title of Paternal Authority failed either by force and usurpation, or for want of knowing the true Heir, yet Monarchy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and all the World was governed by Kings, and knew no other Government, till <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> set the example, who changed the Regal Power into Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>And to satisfie us, that God still appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Kingly Government, even after the distinction made between Paternal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Authority, we may observe, that by a positive institution God erected a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, but never set up a Common-wealth. The Jewish Government was properly a Theocracy, God was their King in a more peculiar manner than he was the King of other Nations: he dwelt among them in the Tabernacle or Temple, gave them a body of Laws, appointed Officers under him to administer the Affairs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in all emergent difficulties gave immediate Orders and Directions what to do; but yet he appointed a single person to be his Vice-roy, and invested him with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63398:6"/>
the Soveraign Power. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> while he lived was King of <hi>Ieshurun,</hi> and after him <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the Judges succeeded him, whom God raised up in an extraordinary manner, as occasion required, to fight their Battels, and to rescue them out of the hands of their Enemies; and when there was no extraordinary Judge, the High Priest was their ordinary Ruler, who governed with a Soveraign Authority. And when in time they grew weary of this, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the external pomp and splendor of a Court, and a visible Soveraign Prince like their Neighbour-Nations; though God was angry with them for rejecting his Government, yet he himself chose them a King; and after <hi>Saul,</hi> invested <hi>David</hi> with the Regal Power, and entailed it on his Family. All this was done by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate order and appointment of God, which cannot be said of any other form of Government. Aristocracies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracies were a defection from Regal Power occasioned by the ill government of Princes, or by the giddiness and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour of the People, who are fond
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63398:7"/>
of Liberty, Power, and Innovations: But though God by his Providence permitted such changes of Government, he never by a visible Authority and Direction formed and modelled a Commonwealth as he did the Jewish Monarchy.</p>
            <p>But whatever be determined as to the original of Monarchy, that which I am at present concerned for are the advantages of it, That it is the most happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we can live under.</p>
            <p>Supposing our Prince to be Wise and Vertuous, there can be no competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Government of one and of many. Soveraign Power in one hand lies more ready for Action, because it has but one Will, and needs not num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber votes, nor wait the Consent of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Inclinations and Interests, which many times lets slip the proper seasons of Action, and defeats the best De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
            <p>A Soveraign Prince may have what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he pleases, and follow what he likes best without delay: he may have a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Counsellours without danger of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63398:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Faction, while he judges for himself. But in popular Governments, where there is no one Soveraign Will and Reason, but all have equal Authority, how unequal soever their Skill and their Honesty be, when Power is thus parcelled out into several hands, it is usually divided against it self too, and grows weak by intestine Factions.</p>
            <p>Though there is great safety in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Counsellours, when there is one Commanding and Soveraign Will, yet there is no great likelihood of Agreement between a multitude of petty Soveraigns, where every man has an equal Power, and every man judges his own Reason the best, or at least as good as his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. This is just as if the same Body should be animated by several Souls, which have all of them distinct Wills and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and do not always consent in the same thing.</p>
            <p>There is not a greater plague to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies than State-Factions, and it is hardly possible that a popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be freed from them. The
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63398:8"/>
ambition of some, the jealousies and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of others, private quarrels, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interests, perfidiousness and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or an affection of popularity, some or all of which are the natural and almost necessary effects of a popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the very seeds of Faction and Sedition, and though the major vote de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines all, yet the quarrel does not end there, especially if the prevailing Counsels want success. The people must be made Judges of what the Senators do, and the Nation is presently divided into as many Parties and Factions as the Senate is. The Roman Commonwealth it self, though the most flourishing that we read of in any Story, has too many examples of this, witness <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla, Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi> There is seldom any Peace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der long preserved in such Governments, but when some one or a few great men have got the Ascendant, and by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Authority give Laws to all the rest; that is, where there is a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power under the name and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63398:8"/>As for the Publick Good, I cannot but think it more secure in one hand than in many. A Soveraign Prince is the Father of his Country, and can reasonably have no distinct interest from the Publick: for his Kingdom is his Inheritance, and his Glory and Power consists in the happy and flourishing State of his People. When his Kingdom is well govern'd, his Subjects pleased and easie, this makes him beloved at home, and feared abroad. The Glory is intirely his own, as the Shame and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of a Misgovernment is; which are very powerful Passions in great Minds, but lose their effect in Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where the Glory and the Shame is divided among so many, that it is despised by all.</p>
            <p>We may expect a more impartial admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Justice from a Soveraign Prince, who is equally concerned in all his Subjects, than when the Power is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among a great many, who have their several Friends, Relations, and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to serve, and whose Fortune does
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63398:9"/>
not set them above the Temptations of Bribery and Injustice. There is more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger of Oppression, when there are so many to raise their Fortunes by the Government, who have private Interests and Designes, and must be paid well for their publick Service. Whereas no Prince ought to think himself poor, while his Subjects are rich; and nothing can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably tempt an Hereditary Monarch to drain his Subjects to fill his own Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, but their Factious or Sparing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; then indeed it concerns a Prince to get and to keep Money by him, when he finds so much Occasion for it, and sees it so hard to come by. But this is the fault of the Subject, not of the Prince: for were Subjects dutiful and obedient, quiet and peaceable, and ready at all times to grant Supplies, as the support of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment needed, without difficulty or dishonourable Terms, he must be a strange Prince, who would oppress his Subjects, when he knows he may have what he can reasonably desire, without oppression;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63398:9"/>
when his Subjects pockets are as open, and a more increasing Exchequer than his own.</p>
            <p>But the most fatal Cheat in Popular Governments, is the name of Liberty, though the Power be as absolute and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potical, as can be exercised by any Prince; and the onely pretence of Liberty is this, that they are Slaves to their Equals, and enslave one another by turns. But I shall say nothing to this, since our late dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought Experience has taught us the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the new-modelled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our fellow-Subjects, and of a natural Prince.</p>
            <p>So that though we can have no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical certainty in these cases, yet all the fair appearances of Reason give the advantages for a happy Government on the side of Monarchy; the onely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is, if our Prince should happen to prove a Tyrant, and then he may do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as much mischief as a Tyrannical Commonwealth: for it is probable, that five hundred Tyrants would do more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63398:10"/>
mischief than one. But that which may equally happen under all Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is an Argument against none. The Divine Providence will rectifie such Miscarriages, as cannot be prevented by any humane care. And yet this, which is the onely possible Objection against Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, is in a great measure prevented by the Noble Extraction, and the generous Education of Princes; which is the second thing observable in my Text.</p>
            <p>2. That the Noble Descent and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of a King, is a great Blessing to a Nation. <hi>Blessed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles.</hi> And there are two things, wherein this Blessedness consists.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Sons of Nobles are usually better qualified for government than mean Persons.</item>
               <item>2. That Nobility of Birth gives Lustre and Authority to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63398:10"/>1. That the Sons of Nobles (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Sons of Kings, not to meddle at present with other Nobles) are usually better qualified for Government than meaner Persons: I say <hi>usually;</hi> for in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Causes, and Free Agents there can be no Rule without exception. Persons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly descended may degenerate from the Vertues of their Ancestors, and men of mean Birth and Fortune may have great and generous Minds, as if they had been made for Rule and Empire: but usually the fortune of mens Birth and Education fashions their Minds, and fits them for a peculiar state of life, above or below which they are out of their natural Sphere, and cannot observe a just Decorum in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Part, which does not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them.</p>
            <p>There are some Princely Vertues, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63398:11"/>
are necessary to a Happy Government, which cannot be easily learnt by mean Persons; A certain inbred Greatness and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity of Mind, a Sense of Honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pride or Insolence, a Love of Justice without Cruelty or Revenge, a just Esteem for Riches without Covetousness, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Care of the publick Good, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleasure in generous actions, a steadiness of mind, which does not grow giddy with its own height; courage and boldness in danger, prudence in Council, dexterity in Business, and a peculiar art and skill in knowing, and governing men. These are God-like dispositions of Mind, which (in that perfection, which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Government) seem to be original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to Nature, though they may be cultivated by the happy circumstances of a Noble Birth and Education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63398:11"/>It has been often observed both of Men and Beasts, That they beget their like, not only as to their Kind and Species, but as to their peculiar Qualities and natural Vertues. A Child very often resembles his Father as much in the natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and perfections of Mind, as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal shape; which is so certainly true, (what ever the Philosophy of it be) That upon this account, the Sons of Nobles have the advantage of meaner Births. A great and generous Prince begets Princes quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to sway the Scepter, and born with a kind of natural instinct of Government.</p>
            <p>And besides this, the glory of their Birth does early inspire them with great Thoughts, and they are trained up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Arts of Government. Those universal Courtships and Addresses they receive, teach them greatness of Mind,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63398:12"/>
mixt with affability, and a decent respect to Inferiors; for those who have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accustomed to be treated with Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and awful Regards, have a due sense of Honour, but are not proud. For Honour seldom swells mens minds, but when it is new. A plentiful Fortune, to which they are born without their care and industry, is the best preservative against Covetousness, which is an ignoble Vice, and seldom possesses any Man, but him who has known, what it is to want, and what it is to get an estate.</p>
            <p>And those who stand almost upon an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Level with the Throne (as the Sons of Kings do) have so easie an ascent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That it does not turn their Heads with an unusual height, which is the Common Effect, that a great and sudden advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has upon mean men, that they forget
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63398:12"/>
themselves and their just Respects to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which makes them proud and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Tyrants when they are possest of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power; which shows us, what a Happiness it is to live under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Prince, who is Nobly descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for such Persons, whatever other faults they may have; have such Royal Vertues, as qualify them for excellent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>2. Nobility of Birth gives a Luster and Authority to such a Prince's Government. Men do not love to submit to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals or Inferiors; when such ascend the Throne, they are despised and envied, and nothing but Force and Power can keep them there. But a High-born Prince is the Pride and the desire of a Nation: he inherits the Glory of his Ancestors; and the World presages great things of him, who
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63398:13"/>
descends from a race of Kings; no man thinks much to submit to him, who was born to govern, but those, who are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of any Government, or ambitious of Government themselves. We are contented to yield to those, whose Glory we cannot rival, for Competition is only among e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals; and since the Government must be in some hand, it is most reasonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in him, who by Birth and Fortune is advanced above all; and that must make any Government happy, which makes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects willing to obey; and nothing can so universally dispose people to a chearful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as this.</p>
            <p>3. And this shows us the advantages of an Hereditary Monarchy. For the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family is certainly the most Noble: a King, who is the Son of Kings, to be sure is the Son of Nobles. And it is the highest
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63398:13"/>
and greatest Nobility of which <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks; to be sure, what he says must be eminently true of the most Noble Bloud. A King's Son, especially if he descend from an Ancient race of Kings, has as much the advantage of Inferiour Nobles, as they have of the Gentry, or the Gentry of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner People. It is Royal Bloud, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires a Princely Mind, which is more Noble still the further it is removed from its Original.</p>
            <p>I cannot now discourse to you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right of Succession; it seems most Natural for a Son to be Heir to his Father, and therefore to succeed to the Crown of which he dyed possessed: for Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends as well as an Estate, as the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Family was the Birth-right of the Eldest Son, as his Fathers Heir. But however that be, if it be so great a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63398:14"/>
to a Nation to have a King the Son of Nobles, there is no such way to secure this as by a Succession of Kings of the same Royal Stock and Family, whose Glory and Nobility increases with every Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and gives a New Greatness and Authority to its Government.</p>
            <p>But to hasten to a Conclusion, the proper use of this discourse consists of two parts. 1. To bless God for the Mercy of this Day. 2. To be Loyal to our King.</p>
            <p>1. To bless God for the Mercy of this Day. It would be too melancholy a Thought at this time to reflect on the sad face of things in these Kingdoms, when an Excellent Prince was murdered by his own Subjects; the Natural Heir of the Crown, and the whole Royal Family forced into Banishment; the Ancient and Loyal
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63398:14"/>
Nobility and Gentry under Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sequestrations; the Church of <hi>England</hi> robbed of its Bishops and Clergy, its Worship and Revenues, while some mean and ignoble persons trampled upon Crowns and Mitres, enriched themselves with the Spoils of Church and State, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped the Royal Power, but governed like Slaves. But this blessed Day put an end to all these Miseries and Confusions; God by a wonderful Providence restored to us our King and Royal Family in Peace and Triumph, without the noise and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms of War, without drawing the Sword, or shedding English Blood. He was driven out by Victorious Rebels, at the expence of a vast Treasure, and more Blood; but was invited home again by a wearied and distracted People, who now felt the difference between the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63398:15"/>
of mean Usurpers, and of a natural and High-born Prince.</p>
            <p>And thus the Nation recovered its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Glory, and every Subject their Just Rights; and which is more valuable than all Civil Rights, the free Profession and Exercise of their Religion, according to the Doctrine and Worship of the Apostolick Church of <hi>England,</hi> though some possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may think it too late to glory in this now; and it would be too late indeed, and would lessen the Glory of this day, were the most Holy Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in any danger. But next to having our King of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we can desire no more, than to have a King, who will defend it; which I am sure the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> would have thought a great Blessing; and therefore this is a joyful day still, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63398:15"/>
brought back one Prince to restore the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and another to protect it; for far be it from me, and from all Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects to distrust those solemn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated assurances, which our King has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us of this Matter. A Prince, whose Mind is as Great and Noble as his Birth, who abhors all mean Arts and Equivocal Reserves, and scorns either to dissemble what he believes himself, or to speak what be does not think.</p>
            <p>2. As for Loyalty, were it decent to conclude a discourse of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without an Exhortation to Loyalty and Obedience, it might be very well spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at this time, in such a Presence, whose Example preaches Loyalty to the whole Nation. And therefore I shall not run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Topicks of Obedience, but only urge some few things, which are proper
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63398:16"/>
to this argument, and to this present solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>It is a great Happiness to a Nation to have a King, who is the Son of Nobles. This Happiness we at this day enjoy; we live under the Government of a King, who has Royal Bloud in his Veins, and discovers a Great and Princely Mind in all his Actions, and this secures us of as much Happiness as we can expect under any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but it is not meerly the wise Conduct of a Prince, but the governable temper of Subjects too, which is necessary to make a Nation happy. No Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neither of God nor men can make those happy, who will not be governed. Discontents and Jealousies, and Seditions turn the Court into a Camp, and exchange the Civil Government for Military Force and Power; and the best Prince in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63398:16"/>
World can never govern to so great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, who is forced to govern by the Sword. But when Subjects love and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their King, and always believe well of him; when they obey his Laws, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with all reasonable Intimations of his will, that is, when they may be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like Subjects, not like Slaves, then a King has a fair occasion to exercise all the Princely Vertues and peaceful arts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to make his Reign prosperous, and his Subjects happy.</p>
            <p>I know no Prince in any age, under whom an Obedient and Governable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have lived more happily, than our late Martyred Sovereign; and yet, what miseries and confusions did a Factious and Turbulent Zeal create, which ended in as doleful a Tragedy as ever the Sun saw? And when we remember those times,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63398:17"/>
and consider how little a Nation gains by Seditions and Rebellions; unless men love Rebellion for Rebellions Sake, there can be no great temptation in it though it were no Sin.</p>
            <p>Nay we may observe, that as an ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable temper will disturb the best and Wisest Governments; so Loyalty and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is a powerful Obligation on Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to rule well; for Princes must value Obedience and Subjection as they do their Crowns. To this we owe the present Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Protection of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for if there were nothing else to be liked in it, yet a generous Prince can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but like and reward its Loyalty; and it would seem very harsh for any Prince to desire that Religion should be turned out of the Church, which secures him in a quiet possession of his Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:63398:17"/>And therefore to conclude, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to observe, that it is a Church of <hi>England</hi>-Loyalty I perswade you to: This our King approves, commends, relies on, as a tried and experienced Loyalty, which has suffered with its Prince, but never yet rebelled against him; a Loyalty upon firm and steady Principles, and without reserve. And therefore to keep us true to our Prince, we must be true to our Church and to our Religion. It is no Act of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to accommodate or complement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our Religion and its legal Securities; for if we change our Religion, we must change the Principles of our Loyalty too, and I am sure the King and the Crown will gain nothing by that; for there is no such lasting and immoveable Loyalty, as that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I deny not, but some, who are Papists, in some
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63398:18"/>
Junctures of Affairs may and have been very Loyal; but I am sure the Popish Religion is not; the English man may be Loyal, but not the Papist; and yet there can be no security of those mens Loyalty, whose Religion in any case teaches them to rebel.</p>
            <p>God grant the whole Nation may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Example of this Honourable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to be Loyal to their Prince, Zealous for the Service of the Crown, and true to the Religion of the Church of <hi>England, as dearer to them than their Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>To God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, three Persons, and one Eternal God, be Honour, Glory, and Power, now and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
