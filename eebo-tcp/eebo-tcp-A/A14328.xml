         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>Whether a temperate aire be the best and wholsomest for the preseruation of life?</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing that, for the continuance of life and health, there is so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to be had of the ayre (for without it we can scarcely liue a moment of time) and place of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, as of the meats we eat; I therefore thought it meete to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, by way of Introduction, the knowledge of those things that demonstrate the salubritie of habitable places, which is expended cheifely in three things; in purnesse of the aire, qualitie of the soyle and situation, and wholsomnes of the water: from which euery man may easily gather and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the healthfulnes of his habitation. And first as concerning the ayre, that is the best and wholsomest to preserue life, which is subtile, bright, and cleare, not mixt with any grosse moisture, or corrupted with filthy or noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vapors, which also with calme &amp; pleasant winds (for great &amp; boisterous winds are to the lungs, eyes, and eares
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1906:4"/>
hurtfull) is gently moued: for such aire is in substance pure, in qualities temperate, and therefore most wholsome. But the aire that is infected with corrupt &amp; filthy vapors, eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating or breathing out of standing pooles, channels, or other impure places, or which is so shut vp with hills or mountaines, that it cannot be freely perflated and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the winds, is not fit for preferuing of health; like as neither that, which is affected with too much heat or cold, or suffereth often and suddaine mutations. For as a pure, cleare and temperate aire is good for euery age and constitution: euen so impure, grosse, cloudie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate aire is to euery age and constitution hurtfull. Therefore touching the knowledge of the goodnes of the aire, it must be considered that it be not vaporous, moi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, or putride, not too hot or too cold, not ouer-moist, or dry: for a vaporous, cloudy, grosse or putride aire doth cause theumes, annoy the lungs, corrupt the humors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">Aire vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, grosse, or putride,</note> the heart, deiect the spirits, and subuert the habit of the whole bodie.</p>
               <p>Aire too hot doth relaxe the ioints, resolue the humors, and spirits, cast downe the strength, greatly weaken the <note place="margin">Aire too hot.</note> concoction, with all other functions of the vegetall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because it dissolueth and draweth out the naturall heat. Moreouer it maketh the colour yellow, because it corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the bloud which rubifieth the colour, and causeth choler to exceede other humors. Last of all, it heateth the heart with an vnnaturall heat, it dissolueth, wasteth, and consumeth the humors, and causeth them to putrifie, and flow to the concauities and weake parts of the bodie; and therefore it is not agreeable to healthy bodies: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it is auaileable for ouer cold, moist, hydropicke, and paraliticke bodies, and such as are affected with the crampe proceeding of too much cold and moistu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But aire temperately hot doth maintaine the naturall heat, confirme the strength, and maketh all the operations <note place="margin">Temperate aire.</note> of the bodie more liuely: it is very comfortable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to euery constitution.</p>

It is lesse hurtfull, nay sometimes profitable to bodies that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hot: and to sound bodies it is more conuenient and agreable then aire that is ouer hot.</p>
               <p>But aire meanely cold is healthfull, because it impelleth the naturall heate into the inner parts, and so causeth a strong digestion, prouoketh the appetite and maketh all the hidden operations of nature more effectuall: For such a coldnesse is proportionably contrary to the naturall heate, by reason whereof, the naturall and genuine heate is by an Antiperistasis fortified, and the digestion, which is the roote of life, confirmed.</p>
               <p>Aire too moist, such as is commonly in marish &amp; low <note place="margin">Aire too moist.</note> places, is to all bodies most hurtfull, because it too much lenifieth and moistneth the bodie, and filleth it with excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall humors, and causeth distillations, the very roote almost of all diseases of the braine and sinewes, as cramps, palsies &amp;c. with paines in the ioints; and to speake all in a word, a generall torpiditie both of minde and bodie.</p>
               <p>But that aire which is meanely moist, especially in the <note place="margin">Aire indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently moist.</note> summer time, is agreable to most complexions; for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a good colour, softneth the skin, and openeth the pores, whereby is caused the better difflation, and discussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vaporous superfluities; but yet it somewhat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the humors prone to putrefaction. This aire verily is very agreable to bodies of a dry constitution, but vnto other, by reason that it soone causeth putrefaction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, it is far lesse conuenient.</p>
               <p>A dry aire is contrary vnto this, and it is most agreable to moist constitutions. <note place="margin">A dry Aire.</note>

               <p>Now these things, which I haue hitherto declared, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the election of aire, being considered, it doth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1906:5"/>
plainely appeare, that of the same a temperate mediocritie in caliditie, frigiditie, humiditie, and siccitie, as much as possibly may be; besides the lucide and cleare substance of it, is for the preseruation of health to be desired, because such aire doth cause and conserue the health of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. For nothing verily causeth the bodie more liuely and iocunde, and lesse dull and vnapt about the voluntarie and animall motions, then to liue in a pure, cleare, and temperate aire, which hath in it no mixture of any filthy or offensiue vapour. And there are two things that doe plainely manifest the wholsomnes of such aire, as first, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">What things declare the wholsomnes of the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But seeing that it is not euery mans lot to liue in a pure and healthy aire, and such is the necessitie of the aire, that euen for a moment of time it cannot be eschewed, it must needs follow, that from it our bodies receiue very great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations: Wherefore the euillnesse of the aire being knowne, and the alteration which it maketh in our bodies considered, it may be easie in our meat, drinke, exercise &amp;c. to obiect the contray, which may much hinder, infringe, and attemper the action and power of the aire; but yet I counsell all such as are truly generous, that they make their habitations, so much as may be, remote from low, fennie, and moorish places; for the health of the bodie ought to be preferred before any pecuniarie profits.</p>

               <head>Whether the habitation that is somewhat eminent, be for health the best approued?</head>
               <p>WIth good reason did our Auncestors build their houses towards the South and the North, because through the northerne windowes, the north winde might in the summer passe in to coole the bloomie aire in them, and that the sunne, which rectifieth the aire, might through the southerne windowes in the winter enter into euery roome. For otherwise they cannot haue the benigne and sweet aspect of the sunne and the pleasant and healthfull blasts of the North winde at those distinct times of the yeare.

But in mine opinion those houses and habitations are best, which are somewhat eminently situated on pure &amp; firme <note place="margin">What place for habitation is best.</note> ground, far off from low, marish, or other filthy places, (for there the aire is for the most part temperate, subtile and pure, seldome infected with vaporous blasts) hauing springs or brookes of pure water neere adioyning, lying open to the South and East, with hills (which may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hinder and keepe backe the vaporous West winde, and the sharpe North winde in the winter) a little remote on the West and North side, hauing windowes looking not onely towards the South and North for the reasons aforesaid, but also, so much as may be, towards the East, because the sunne in the beginning of the day, arising vpon them, doth excellently clarifie, and purge the aire of them, and is all the day after better exposed to the most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some blasts of the East winde. But here aduertisement must be giuen, that the Easterne windowes or casements,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1906:6"/>
be not set open, before the Sunne hath somewhat purged the aire, and dissipated the clowds, especially in moyst sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: for the morning aire, by reason of the coldnesse and moysture of the night, is grosse and impure, very hurtfull to them that haue weake braines, &amp; subiect vnto rheumes, vntill it be illustrated by the presence of the Sunne, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by his heat and splendor.</p>
               <p>And heere I would not, that the Reader should so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me, as that I iudge the West-winde, to be at no time wholsome: verily, I thinke nothing lesse, for it is somtimes wholsome enough, as if in the time of its blowing, the aire be bright and cleere, especially if it blow in the declining of the day, and the beginning of the night: for then it is the purer and lesse grosse, by reason of the presence of the Sunne in the west part, which attenuateth the blasts of it. Wherefore I doe conclude, that in an house, to the end it may be perflable, it is expedient to haue windowes on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry side, which may, <hi>ad placitum,</hi> bee opened and shut vp againe.</p>

               <head>Why are those that inhabit eminent places in a free and open aire, of a more long and healthy life, and also of a more acute, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and magnificent minde, then those that inhabit croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, low, and marish places?</head>
               <p>THis question consisteth of two parts: the reason of the first is, because the aire in eminent and open places, both by reason of the continuall motion of it, as also of the firme solidity of the earth, is more subtill and pure, whereby it commeth to passe, that the inhabitants, are euen to extreme old age, seene to enioy very good and perfect health.</p>
               <p>But in crooked, low, and marish places, for such verily are the spirits, as is the aire which is inspirated: the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are sickly, and haue turbid and obfuscated spirits, by reason of the grosnesse and impurity of the aire. For, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, grosse, and intemperate aire doth corrupt the spirits
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1906:6"/>
and humours: from whence proceede infinite diseases, and vntimely old age. Therefore eminent Regions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are with pure windes freely perflated, are more healthy, then low and marish places, and in them men liue not onely more healthfully, but also longer, and from hence it was, that <hi>Plato</hi> wrote, that hee euer found the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest liuers in high and temperate Regions.</p>
               <p>Therefore hee that desireth to liue a long and healthy life, must dwell in an eminent and champion countrey, or at least, in a place that is free from muddie and waterish impurities: for it is impossible, that a man should liue long and healthily in a place, where the spirits are with impure aire daily affected. Wherefore I counsell them, that wish to enjoy true health, and a firme state of body, to take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care that they liue not in waterish places, or in a grosse, corrupt, and filthy aire, or otherwise subiect to vaporous blasts, which annoy the spirits, breede rheumes, and are very pernicious to the lungs.</p>
               <p>Now the reason of the second is euident, by that which hath beene shewed concerning the former: for those that liue in eminent and champion countries, by reason of the tenuitie, puritie, and wholsomnesse of the aire in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, haue cleare, pure, and subtill spirits, from whence it commeth, that they are witty, nimble, magnanimous, &amp; <hi>alta petentes.</hi> But the contrary is seene in low and marish places, for there, the Inhabitants, by reason of the euilnesse of the aire, haue grosse and earthy spirits, whereof it is, that they are for the most <note n="*" place="margin">For some haue their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures rectified by education.</note> part men, <hi>humum tantum sapientes,</hi> dull, sluggish, sordid, sensuall, plainely irreligious, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some of them, which is a little worse, religious in shew, externall honest men, deceiptfull, malicious, disdainefull. Wherefore, seeing that the diuersity of spirits, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of wits and manners, doe so much proceede from the condition and nature of the aire, I doe here againe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise all such as are ingenious, generous, and desirous of perfection, both in minde and body, that they endeauour by all meanes, to liue in a pure and healthy aire, and so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domly

               <head>Whether fountaine water, in goodnesse and wholsomnesse, excell other waters?</head>
               <p>THat water is esteemed to bee the best and wholsomest, which is most cleare and thin, pure in taste and smell, altogether clean from any impure, terrene, or other dreggy mixture. And such is, before all other, fountaine water, if it rise in a pure, high, and open place, and that against the East, for then it is the better depurated with the morning Sunne, and pure orientall windes. Of fountaine waters, those that rise against the North, because they haue not the radiant aspect of the Sunne, which purifieth the waters, are least commendable, for they are not easily concocted, they weaken the stomacke, and cause fluctuations, and flatuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the body. But there are some fountaine waters, not to be allowed for alimentary vses, and such are those, which rise from sulphurous, bituminous, or metalline places, or which are carried thorow like veines of the earth, because they receiue an vnpleasant sauor and smell, and also an euill quality from those things that they issue from, or runne thorow.</p>
               <p>Next vnto fountaine water in goodnesse, is raine-water, so it fall not in a boysterous or troublesome aire; for the Sunne, from all waters and humid places, draweth vp the thinner and purer portion resolued into vapours, which is the matter of raine to come. Notwithstanding, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse therof doth alter according to the diuers parts of the yeere; for that is the best, which falleth from the middle <note place="margin">Raine water alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>reth in goodnesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the times of the yeere.</note> of the Spring, to the middle of Autumne, because in those seasons, the aire is for the most part pure, seldomly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with noysome vapours, which defile the raine-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And there are some, to whose opinion a man may easily, without errour subscribe, which thinke, that such raine-water is not inferiour in goodnesse to fountaine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1906:7"/>
But the waters which fall with great tempests of winds, haile, thunder, and lightnings, are, by reason of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused vapors and exhalations collected in the aire, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and therfore not so well to be approoued for the health of mans body.</p>
               <p>Riuer water hath the third place of goodnes, both by <note place="margin">Riuer-water.</note> reason the action of the Sunne vpon it, as also because that by motion, it becommeth thinner, except it bee polluted by the mixture of other things, as it commeth to passe in riuers, that runne thorow marish places, or neere vnto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Townes or Cities: for then, by reason of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of filth running, or cast into them, they become very corrupt and vnwholsome. Therefore where the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants through the want of most wholsome fountaines, are constrained to make vse of riuer water, let them take espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care, lest insteede of that which is wholsome, they take that which is corrupt and very offensiue to the health of their bodies: Wherfore let them make choyse of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer water, which is not subiect to the aforesayd hurts; but runneth with a full streame vpon grauell, pebble-stones, rockes, or pure earth: for that water, by reason of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the place, motion, and radiant splendor of the Sun, is thinner, sweeter, and therefore more pure, and wholso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in my opinion, it is doubtfull, whether fountaine waters surpasse in goodnesse such riuer waters. But if the riuer waters shall not be cleere, but slimie and muddie, and the same, for want of better waters, necessarily vsed, as in many low and marish places, then let them be kept so long in some vessell, till that the grosse part rest and settle in the bottome, for by this meanes, the thin and purer part of the water may be taken and vsed, and the grosser cast away.</p>
               <p>Well-water is iudged inferiour to the former, in purity and wholsomnesse, not onely because it is voyd of motion, <note place="margin">Well-water.</note> but also because it is not illustrated of the Sun; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, if the Well bee digged in pure earth, and the mouth open to the aire, not shut vp in a darke obscure place, not beset with a filthy bottome, but a pure, grauely,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1906:8"/>
or rocky, then the water, especially if it be often drawen, is very good and wholsome.</p>
               <p>And heere vnderstand, that the waters that are drawen <note place="margin">Pump and Cisterne waters.</note> thorow pumps, because they are shut vp from the aire, are worse then other Well-waters, for they more quickly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie, and acquire an ill quality. The like may bee said of <note place="margin">Waters car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thorow pipes of lead.</note> Cisternewaters. Neither are the waters which are carried throw pipes of lead, so wholsome as they are supposed to be, not onely because they are shut vp from the aire, but also because they are thought to acquire an vnwholsome quality from the lead: they are troublesome to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and ponderous to all the bowels; but these hurts in their boyling, are well remooued.</p>
               <p>All standing waters, as of pooles, motes, and of pits, <note place="margin">Standing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> which in low and marish places, are very vsuall, are most vnwholsome, and altogether (as pestiferous) to bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and eschewed, for in that they are standing, or cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with a very slow pace, the parching heat of the Sunne often working vpon them, doth more mightily pierce to the bottome, and so leauing the grosser part, draweth vp the thinner, whereby it commeth to passe, that the waters appeare muddy, and of a leadish colour, corrupted both in smell and taste. Waters that are taken neere vnto the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shores, <note place="margin">Waters neere the sea-shores.</note> or armes of the same, are for the most part corrupt, and of a stinking smell, and vnpleasant sauour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore naught and vnwholsome for mans body.</p>

               <head>Whether Snow waters be in goodnesse matchable to riuer water?</head>
               <p>NO, and the reason is, because that while the snow is ingendred, the thinner part of the matter, is (as it were) pressed forth of the cold, and conuerted into clowds, the grosser part remaineth, and is turned into snow: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it commeth, that snow-waters are grosse and ouer cold, and therfore hurtful to mans bodie; for they cause rheumes, and greatly hurt the sinewes. Moreouer, they breed sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticke

               <head>Whether in waters that are naturally warme, which wee call hot Bathes, it be healthfull for healthy men to bathe?</head>
               <p>WAters naturally hot, and of a medicinable faculty, such as are our famous bathes of <hi>Bathe,</hi> are of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular force, not onely against diseases gotten by cold, or proceeding from a cold and moyst cause, but also bring in time of health, exceeding comfort and profit, to all cold, moyst, and corpulent bodies: for they open the pores, resolue, attenuate, digest, consume, and draw forth super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, and withall, strongly heat and dry the whole habit of the body. They are of excellent efficacie against all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of the head and sinewes, proceeding of a cold and moyst cause, or of a cold only, or moyst only, as rheumes, palsies, epilepsies, lethargies, apoplexies, cramps, deafnesse, forgetfulnesse, trembling, or weaknesse of any member, aches and swellings of the ioynts, &amp;c. They also great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit windie and hydropicke bodies, the paine and swelling of any part of the bodie, so that it proceede not from an hot cause, the sluggish &amp; lumpish heauinesse of the bodie, numnesse of any member, paine in the loynes, the gout, especially the Sciatica, cold tumors of the milt and liuer, the yellow Iaundice in a bodie plethoricke or phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They are also very profitable for them that haue their lungs annoyed with much moisture, because they consume and drie vp that moisture: and to make slender such bodies as are too grosse, there is nothing more effectuall then the often vse of these waters. Wherefore let those that feare obesitie, that is, would not waxe grosse, be carefull to come often to our Bathes: for by the often vse of them, according as the learned Physition shall direct, they may not onely preserue their health, but also keepe their bodies from being vnseemingly corpulent. They are also singularly profitable to women, for they helpe them of barrennesse, and of all diseases and imperfections of the matrice, proceeding of a cold and moyst cause. They also cure all diseases of the skin, as scabs, itch, old sores &amp;c. All which to be true, we daily finde with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the exceeding great comfort of many, who with deplored diseases, and most miserable bodies resort to our baths in Bathe, and are there, by the helpe of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some physicke and vertue of the Baths, through the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Almighty God, recouered to their former health. But hot bathes, to bodies naturally hot and dry, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hurtfull, and so much the more, as the bodie is drier <note place="margin">Hot Bathes hurtfull to hot and dry bodies.</note> and the bathe hotter, because it distempereth and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the very habit of the bodie, and maketh it carraine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like leane. Wherefore seeing that naturall bathes are not indifferently agreable to euery constitution, I doe aduise that not any one goe into them rashly, or vpon an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous iudgement, but that he be first aduised by some faithfull, iudicious and expert Physition, and to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the state of his bodie, whereby he may vnderstand, whether or no it may be expedient for him to attempt the same. And whereas in Bathe there are diuers bathes, and they differing in their heate, he must also from the learned Physition be directed in which to bathe; neither must he onely vnderstand which Bathe to vse, as most conuenient for his present state of bodie, but also when and how often to vse the same. Besides this, he must (according as his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1906:9"/>
state of bodie shall require) be purged before he enter into the bathe, and be also directed in other things how to order himselfe, before he goe into the bathe, while he is in the bathe, and after that he is come out of the bathe, and when he leaueth the bathe. And must also, in the intermitting times of bathing and sweating, take such physicke, as his disease and present state of bodie shall require. The neglect of all these, or of some of them, either through ignorance or voluntarie wilfulnes, may be the cause that some that take great paines to come to the bathes, are not by them healed of their infirmities, but oftentimes neuer returne to their homes againe; or if they doe; it is most commonly with new diseases, and the olde worse then euer they were: Whereas many of a generous and religious vnderstanding, vsing the true helpes of physicke with the bathes, are of their diseases perfectly cured. And here I exhort the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, in regard that the Bathes, which proceed from Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or from it, take their chiefest vertue and strength (as our Bathes in <hi>Bathe</hi> doe) doe weaken and subuert the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, especially of some bodies, that they haue an honest care to corroborate the same by such meanes as shall be best fitting for the present estate of the bodie. Here also I aduertise such as in the declining or fall of the yeare, which we call the Autumne, shall for the health of their bodies repaire to our Bathes, that they deferre not their comming till the middle of September or after, as many ignorantly doe; but that they rather be there by the end of August, that they may haue the commoditie of the Bathes before the aire grow to be too cold for bathing in hot Bathes, as commonly it is in October, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end thereof: for if they shall make vse of the Bathes when the aire is cold and moist, or very inclinable thereunto, they shall receiue (the pores of the bodie being open by reason of the efficacie of the Bathe) farre greater hurt then commoditie. But perhaps some out of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant timorousnes will obiect, that to come to the Bathes at the end of August is too soone vpon the Dogge-dayes.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1906:10"/>
Herein they are more scrupulous, then iudicious; but to yeeld them satisfaction, I answer, besides the alteration of seasons from their ancient temperature, in this decrepit age of the world, that though the middle part of the day, about the beginning of September, shall be hot; yet the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and euenings, which are the times for bathing, are rather cold or declining to a temperature, and the heat of the day following vpon bathing, is that which we specially respect for the health of our Patients, for whom we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the vse of the Bathes. And verily, whosoeuer shall but consider the great variablenes, and inconstant disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spring, from its ancient temperature, especially of later yeares, must (in my opinion) confesse, that the moneth of September is most commonly, in regard of the disposition of the aire, so fit for bathing in hot Bathes, as any in the Spring. Wherefore such as for the health of their bodies repaire to our Bathes, shall, if they be there by the end of August, receiue a double commoditie: For first, they shall haue the whole moneth of September very conuenient for bathing, and physicke also, as shall be occasion, yea and part of October, as the disposition of the aire shall permit: next, sufficient time for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their homes, before the aire grow too cold, or the weather distempered: for to expose their bodies to trauell in foule and intemperate weather, vpon the vse of the Bathes, induceth, (the pores being open) besides feue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous distemperatures and ventosities, oftentimes very great and dolorous affects of the braine, breast, sinewes, and ioynts. Thus much I thought fitting to aduise concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the vse of our Bathes, and the rather that such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterously vse them, may not erroniously detract from the admirable vertues of them.</p>
               <p>Now I will in one thing giue my aduise to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the place, in which I shall nothing doubt of their vnanimous assent, as also of the approbation of all truly generous and religious Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, that shall for the health of their bodies resort thither,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1906:10"/>
which is, that the immodest custome of men and women promiscuously at one time going into the Bathes, may be reformed, which (in my iudgement) may with no lesse fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then decencie easily be effected. For whereas there are foure publique Bathes for strangers to bathe in, (of which the Kings Bathe is the hottest, and it is for largenes and efficacie a kingly Bathe indeed: next vnto it for effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of heat is the hot Bathe, and the Bathe that is adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Kings Bathe now called the Queenes Bathe: these two Bathes are neere of one temperature. The Crosse Bathe is for heat the mildest; it is very temperately warme: the vse of this Bathe may, by the aduise of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Physition, sometimes be very profitably admitted euen to hot and drie bodies) I would; that men onely vse the Kings Bathe one day, and women another, that all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of offence might thereby be remoued: and because the Crosse Bathe, and Hot Bathe are neere togither, I would that the day that men vse the Crosse Bathe, women vse the Hot Bathe, and the day that women vse the Crosse Bathe, men vse the Hot Bathe: which order may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obserued in the vse of the Kings Bathe, and of the other adioyning to it. For by this meanes such as please, or rather shall be so aduised by their Physition, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all offence, vse one Bathe or another euery day.</p>
               <p>But perhaps some will obiect against me, that they came far, and with great expense to seeke their health at the Bathes, and therefore that I doe them great wrong to seeke to barthem of the vse of the Kings Bath euery second day.</p>
               <p>To whom I answer; that not the immoderate and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous vse of the Bathes, (for that is pernicious) but the tempestiue and moderate vse of them doth acquire their health: for to vse the Kings Bathe oftner then euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, and to sweat 2, or 3 houres vpon the bathing, as shall by the aduise of the learned Physition be thought meete, for the particular state and constitution of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, besides other fitting courses of physicke, is more, if you rightly weigh the great heat and efficacie of the Bathe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1906:11"/>
then in any state or constitution of bodie can be well allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except perhaps in a few, that shall be of a very cold and moist temperature, for whom there may be a toleration. Now by that which I haue written of our Bathes of <hi>Bathe,</hi> it may plainely vnto all men appeare, of what excellent efficacie they are, if they be rightly and iudiciously vsed: and seeing that in the true vse of them, there are many things, as I haue partly before touched, to be considered; I doe therefore againe aduise all such as are respectiue of their health, that they enterprise not the vse of them without the counsell of some honest and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Physition; which if they doe, the <hi>incommodum</hi> may be <hi>maius commodo.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1906:12"/>
but after a few dayes it waxeth dry and vnsauoury: it is a bread of light nourishment, and (in my opinion) not agreable for men, especially for such as haue not bin from their youth accustomed thereunto. But these and the like sorts of bread, I separate from this Treatise, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in regard of our great plenty of Wheat, Rie, and Barley, it is lawfull euen for our poore people to make of them, or of the mingling of them, bread abundantly; as also, because that other sorts of bread are with vs growne out of vse, wherefore of these onely will I entreat. Of these three, the bread which is made of Wheat is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its moderate temperature, the best and worthiest of praise, for it is easily digested, and very strongly nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the bodie; but it is purer or impurer, according to the finenes or coursenes of the flower whereof it is made. For of the meale there are foure parts: <hi>Pollen, Simila, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarium,</hi> and <hi>Furfures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pollen</hi> is the purest part of the meale, that is, the finest part of the flower; of this is made the whitest and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest bread, very profitable for thin, weake, loose, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated bodies; but not so commendable for those that are healthy and strong, and therefore if any such vse it, they are more curious then iudicious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simila</hi> is that part of the meale, which is the meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the finest part of the flower and the coursest, which is called <hi>Secundarium</hi> of this togither. With the finest part of the flower is made the wholsomest and best nourishing bread, and it is in greatest vse among the better sort of people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundarium</hi> is that part of the meale, whereof yeoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread is made, which some call second bread. This bread <note place="margin">Second Bread.</note> because it hath in it the finer part of the bran, doth not giue to the bodie so great nor so good nourishment as the former; but it quickly descendeth from the stomacke, and maketh the bodie soluble, and therefore sometimes good for such as are wont to be costiue; and if a quantitie of Rie flower be added to it, there will be made of them both
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1906:12"/>
an yeoman-bread, for strong and healthy bodies very conuenient.</p>
               <p>Bread made onely of the brannie part of the meale, <note place="margin">Browne Bread.</note> which the poorest sort of people vse, especially in time of dearth and necessitie, giueth a very bad and excrementall nourishment to the bodie: it is well called <hi>panis ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>icarius,</hi> because it is more fit for dogs then for men. But if the grossest part of the bran be separated by a Searce, and Rie flower, or else Barley flower and Rie flower togither be added to that which is sifted from the grossest bran, there will be made a browne houshold bread agreable enough <note place="margin">On<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sometimes onely the grosser part of the bran is by a Searse separated from the meale, and a bread made of that which is sifted, called in some places, <hi>One way bread,</hi> wholsome enough, and with some in very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vse: it nourisheth lesse then that which is made of purer flower; but by reason of some part of the bran which is conteined in it, it doth sooner descend and moue the belly, for there is a kinde of abstersiue facultie in the braine: wherefore, for those that are healthy, and yet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to costiuenesse, and also for such as would not waxe grosse, it is most profitable.</p>
               <p>In time of scarsitie of corne, bread is also wont to be made of the whole meale, from which the bran is not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and it is well called <hi>panis confusaneus,</hi> because all <note place="margin">Panis confusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus.</note> the meale, no part thereof being by sifting taken away, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the making of the bread: this bread speedily descendeth and yet it is troublesome to the stomack, and filleth the belly with excrements.</p>
               <p>Bread made of Rie is in wholesomnes much inferiour <note place="margin">Rie Bread.</note> to that which is made of wheat: it is cold, heauy, and hard to digest, and by reason of the massiuenes thereof, very burdensome to the stomacke. It breedeth a clammie, tough, and melancholicke iuyce; it is most meete for ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke labourers, for such by reason of their great trauaile, haue commonly very strong stomacks. Rie in diuers places is mixed with wheat, and a kinde of bread made

            <div type="subsection">
               <head>How many properties ought there to be in the best and wholsomest Bread?</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">I.</note> SEuen: The first is that it be made of the best wheat; for according to the difference of the wheat, is tho goodnes or badnes of the bread. That wheat is best which is of yellow colour, of a close and compacted substance, cleane, weighty, and so hard, that it will not easily be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken betweene the teeth: contrary to this is that which is of a laxe and open substance, such as is commonly growen in low and vliginous places. And if wheat that hath all the aforesaid properties cannot conueniently be had, yet let it be such as is of an hard compacted substance, and weighty: for it is generally to be obserued in euery kinde of wheat, that the better and wholsomer bread is alwaies made of the weightier and more compacted wheat, and the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ser of that which is more light and open.</p>
               <p>The second propertie is, that it be fitly leauened; for the leauen causeth the bread to be of thin parts, by reason <note place="margin">2.</note> whereof, it is more easily digested, and breedeth better
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1906:13"/>
humors. But the leauen must be fitly proportioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause common experience proueth in mens stomacks, that bread much leauened is of heauy digestion, and of no commendable nourishment. All the ancient Physitions deemed vnleauened bread to be very vnwholesome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of hard digestion and breedeth obstructiue hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. Howbeit we daily proue that no bread is lighter of digestion, or giueth better nourishment to the bodie, then our manchet, which is made of fine flower of wheat, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in it no leauen, but in steede thereof a little barme. But by this I reiect not the vse of leauen, to the making either of manchet bread or of greater loaues, as a thing very profitable and good; but I leaue it as a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and euery good housewife to her owne custome herein: onely I aduertise, that the leauen and barme be fitly proportioned. And by the former rule of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Physitions, all sorts of cakes, simnels, wafers, frit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, pancakes, and such like, are to be reiected, if they bee not well corrected with some other good ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences.</p>
               <p>The third propertie is, that it be temperately seasoned <note place="margin">3.</note> with salt, for bread ouer sweat is of hard digestion, and breedeth obstructiue humors, and bread ouer salt is a dryer, and breedeth aduste and melancholicke humors. But that which consisteth in a meane betweene both, is pleasant to the taste and more acceptable to the stomacke.</p>
               <p>The fourth propertie is, that it be light, and somewhat <note place="margin">4.</note> open, and such, although it be great in shew, yet it is of small weight, and therefore easily digested, and easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed from the stomacke.</p>
               <p>The fift propertie is, that it be very well wrought and <note place="margin">5.</note> laboured with the hands and brake, and not ouer-liquored, as many negligent and slothfull seruants oftentimes doe, to saue that labour; for then it is heauy to the stomacke, and breedeth clammie and naughty iuyce.</p>
               <p>The sixth propertie is, that it be well baked; for bread <note place="margin">6.</note> that is ill baked, whether too much or too litle, is of ill
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1906:14"/>
digestion, of ill distribution, and therefore very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the stomacke.</p>
               <p>The last propertie is, that it be not eaten ouer new, as while it is hot, nor when it is stale and growne dry. It must <note place="margin">7.</note> not be eaten hot, because it will fluctuate in the stomacke, slowly descend, oppilate, and abundantly breede winde in the bowels, by reason of a vaporous humiditie that is in it while it is hot, which in cooling euaporateth: and because it furneth vpward, it causeth drowsinesse, confoundeth the senses, and very greatly hurteth the braine it selfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bread while it is hot, although it be to some mens pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats very pleasant and acceptable, yet it is to the bodie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, because it breedeth flatulent and obstructiue humors. In like manner, bread that is stale and growne dry, because it hath lost his naturall temperature, is vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; for it is hardly digested, and yeeldeth litle nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the same not good, but melancholick. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that the bread ought not to be too olde, nor too new: and to auoide all the aforesaid discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, I hold; that the bread ought to be kept the space of 24 houres, or at least one night in some cold place after the baking, before it be eaten; and also that it be not aboue two or three dayes olde in the summer, especially if it be made in the forme of manchet or smaller loaues; nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue foure or fiue dayes olde in the winter; for by how much more it is dryed and indurated, by so much the worse it nourisneth, and is of harder concoction.</p>

               <p>BIsket bread is onely profitable for the phlegmaticke, and them that haue crude and moist stomacks, and that desire to grow leane, because it is a very great dryer; and therefore let such as are cholericke and melancholicke

               <p>MAnie and singular are the commodities of wine: for it is of it selfe, the most pleasant liquour of all other, and was made from the beginning to exhilarate the heart of man. It is a great encreaser of the vitall spirits, and a wonderfull restorer of all powers and actions of the bodie: it verie greatly helpeth concoction, distribution, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1906:15"/>
mightily strengtheneth the naturall heat, openeth obstructions, discusseth windinesse, taketh away sadnesse, and other hurts of melancholy, induceth boldnesse and pleasant behauiour, sharpeneth the wit, abundantly reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth feeble spirits, excellently amendeth the coldnesse of old age, and correcteth the tetrick qualities which that age is subiect vnto; and to speake all in a word, it maketh a man more couragious and liuely, both in minde and body. These are in generall the commodities of wine, which are so to be vnderstood, as that a meane and frugality bee had in the vse of it, notintemperancie and drunkennesse; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise what can be more hurtfull then wine, seeing that the same immoderately taken, destroyeth the life and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <note place="margin">The discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of wine immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly taken.</note> health, disturbeth the reason, dulleth the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, confoundeth the memorie, causeth the lethargie, palsie, trembling of the hands, and a generall weaknesse of the sinewes. Wherefore let wine bee moderately vsed, that neither distillation, nor inflammation, nor exiccation, or drunkennesse follow; for if it be taken beyond measure, it will not be a remedie and confort for the strength, but rather a poyson and vtter ouerthrow. But seeing that there are diuers sorts of wine, and the same not indifferently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to euerie age and constitution, I will therefore (that euery man may make choyse of those wines that are best agreeable for him) speake of the particular differences of them, according to their seuerall qualities, especially of such wines, as with vs are most vsuall.</p>

They moysten the bodie, and canse sleepe, mitigate the paines of the head, proceeding from a great heat of the stomacke, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Rhenish wine.

But it is very hurtfull to drinke White-wine or Rhenish-wine with meat, or at the meales, or presently after meale; except for such as are affected with too much astriction of the stomacke, because they deturbe the meats from the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, <note place="margin">White and Rhenish wines, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good to be taken with meat, or after meale?</note> before they are concocted, and so cause them to passe crude and indigested, whereby it commeth to passe, that the whole bodie doth greatly abound with flateous crudities.</p>

But for them that are free from such obstructions, and feare lest that the drinking of Sacke, by reason of the penetratiue faculty of it, might distemper the liuer, it is best to drink it with sugar, and so I leaue euerie man that vnderstandeth his owne state of bodie, to bee his owne director heerein.</p>

It is best agreeable to cold constitutions, &amp; for old bodies, so that they bee not too impensiuely cholericke, for it is a wine that will quickly inflame, and therefore very hurtfull vnto hot and cholerick bodies, especially if they be young.</p>

               <p>Wine of Orleance is stronger then any other French wine, and very pleasant withall in taste: it is for goodnesse <note place="margin">Wine of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance.</note> scarsely, or not at all, inferiour to Muskadell: It is hurtfull to the cholericke, and all such as haue hot liuers and weak braines, for it doth quickly ouer heat the liuer, and assault the head. But for other bodies, especially if they encline to a cold constitution, and for cold and weake stomackes, there is not a better wine, if there be so good. For it doth not onely comfort the stomacke, help the concoction, and viuifie the spirits, by reason of a generous heat in it, but also furthereth the distribution of the meats, and consequently a good nutrition through the mediocrity of its substance. It is very hurtfull to them that are young, and that are of an hot and cholericke temperature; but to the aged and phlegmaticke very profitable.</p>
               <p>There are also other French wines (would to God they <note place="margin">

There are also other sorts of wines, altering according to the diuers nature of the vine, soyle and aire, whose differences may by their colour, taste and consistence, easily bee discerned. And heere I would haue you generally to obserue in the vse of wines, that those wines, which are more milde, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and least assaulting the head, are more wholsome for the body: and those more hurtfull, that are strong, acute and vaporous, especially if there bee not a meane in the vse of them, and a respect also of the age, complexion, and time of the yeere.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is to be vnderstood, that wines differ very <note place="margin">Wines differ in goodnesse according to their age.</note> much, according to their age: for wines that are new, are vnwholsome, and the more new, the more vnwholsome, for they haue in them little heat, and consist of a grosse and excrementall substance; wherefore they doe not help, but much hinder the concoction and distribution, cause fluctuations in the body, and cholick-torments, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly breede obstructions of the liuer, milt and reines. But their superfluous and excrementall moysture is, in processe of time, concocted and ouercome of the heat, and then they become more hot, more pure, and much more wholsome.</p>

But the stronger sorts of wines, as Sacke, Muskadell, Malmesey, &amp;c. are best, when they are two are three yeares old: for these, by reason of their strong heat, doe a long time reserue their perfect vigor. And as these wines, being too new, are vnwholsome, so bee they also, if they be too old, as when they haue passed foure or fiue yeeres, because they heat beyond measure; for the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they grow, the more heat they acquire, and in processe of time, the siccitie of them is correspondent to their heat. Wherefore such wines, are rather meerely to bee reputed among medicaments, then aliments, because they haue a farre greater faculty of altering the bodie vnto heat and siccity, then they haue of nourishing. The vse of them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially <note place="margin">Wines too old are very hurtfull.</note> if it be often, is hurtfull to the sinewes, and an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to procreation, because they dry vp the geniture, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe the vnderstanding, and by reason of their tart and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement fumes, affect the membranes of the braine with a cruell pungitiue paine. They are only, in the way of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, good for weake and moyst bodies, that are decayed of their naturall heat. Wherefore wines that are ouer old, or too new, are to bee eschewed; for those doe too much heat, and these doe nothing at all, so long as they bee new, and are so farre away from helping the concoction, as that euen themselues are with difficulty digested.

               <head>How many precepts ought there to be obserued in the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting of pure wine in respect of the age.</head>
               <p>FIue: The first is, that it be not giuen vnto children, for this will be as if you should adde fire vnto fire: for they being of hot and moist temperature, would thereby become ouer hot, and their heads also filled with vapors, whereof ensue many euills, and sometimes the falling sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The second is, that it be not giuen to youths, as from 14 yeares of age vnto 25; for wine is vnto them most repugnant; because it doth aboue measure heate their hastie, hot, and agitating nature, and extimulate them (like madde men) vnto enormious and outragious actions. The third is, that it be very moderately giuen, and that not too often vnto young men, as from 25 yeares of age vnto 35, and that it be also of the smaller sorts of wines, as Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret &amp;c: especially if they are of hot constitution: for otherwise it will make them prone vnto wrath and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full desires, dull the wit, and confound the memorie. The
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1906:19"/>
uforth is, that it be more liberally giuen vnto them that are in their manhood and constant age, as from 35 yeares vnto 50: and let such, when they are past forty yeares of age, begin to make much of the vse of wine; and yet if they be of hot constitutions, let them abstaine from the stronger sorts of wines, especially from the often vse of them, because they will be offensiue vnto the head and sinewes. The fifth is, that it be giuen with a liberall hand vnto olde men, and that also of the stronger sorts of wines, especially when they are in the latter part of old age, as from 60 yeares vpward vnto the end of their life. For vnto old men there come foure excellent commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by the vse of pure wine. The first and greatest <note place="margin">Foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities come vnto the aged by the vse of pure wine.</note> commoditie, seeing that they are cold, and for the most part almost without good alimentall bloud, is because it greatly correcteth the coldnes of their age, and bringeth them vnto a better temperature of heat, with increase of bloud. The second, because it expelleth sadnes and melancholy, whereunto that age is most subiect. The third is, because it maketh them to sleepe well, which by reason of the siccitie of the braine, and paucitie of vapors, many olde men oftentimes want. The fourth and last commoditie is, because it remoueth obstructions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are very subiect.

               <head>Whether the vse of Wine mixed with water be fit for all times and profitable for all bodies?</head>
               <p>IT hath beene a very ancient and profitable custome to mixe wine with water in the hot seasons of the yeare; for the wine by reason of the subtilitie of it, doth facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the penetration of the water, and carrieth the same, which otherwise is of an obtuse operation, vnto all the parts, at what time as they shall neede to be cooled and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1906:20"/>
moistned. And from hence it is that wine much alayed with water doth better quench thirst then water alone. But it is not profitable for all times; for in the winter, by reason of the cold and moist constitution of that season, pure wine is rather to be vsed. Neither is it conuenient for all bodies; for to olde men, to the phlegmaticke, and such as are of a cold temperature, or haue weake stomacks, the vse thereof is hurtfull, as may be gathered, by that which I haue before spoken of the vse of water.</p>
               <p>But wine diluted is good for young men, for such as are cholericke, and are of an hot constitution, for hot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <note place="margin">Wine alayed with water, for whom profitable.</note> and the hot seasons of the yeare, especially in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for then by reason of the parching heat, wine alayed, that is to say, thin small waterish, and in no wise strong, is to be drunken. By all which, it is apparant, that foure things are to be considered in the vse of wine mixed with <note place="margin">Foure things to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the vse of wines dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> water: the country, the time of the yeare, the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bodie, and the age: for it is more or lesse to be alayed, according as the country, the season of the yeare, the age, and temperature of the bodie shall be hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or colder. Wherevnto you may also adde, that the nature of the wine is also to be respected, because it is more or lesse to be diluted according to the efficacie &amp; strength of it. But that the vnlearned may not be deceiued in the manner of mixing wine with water, I will set downe some particular formes thereof, which I would haue to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the smaller wines, of wihch sort are the White, the Rhenish, and the Claret, because they more auaile for quenching the thirst, and cooling of the bodie. For bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies therefore of an hot and dry temperature in cold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and in the summer season, let three parts of water be <note place="margin">The manner of mixing wine with water for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of body.</note> mingled with one of wine; or if the time be very hot, &amp; the thirst molestious, and the bodie also youthfull, and strong, foure parts of water may be mingled with one of wine. But for such hot and drie bodies in hot countries, and in the hot seasons of the yeare, the wine is so to be diluted, that onely a very litle smacke of the wine be perceiued.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1906:20"/>
For such a mixture taketh away the hurts of the water, and sufficiently helpeth the distribution of it into the bodie, for quenching the thirst and moistning the dryed parts. But verily for them that inhabit cold countries, and are of a meane temperature, it is best in the summer season to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle an equall portion of water and wine; or if the time be very hot, and the age youthfull and strong, they may take two parts of water to one of wine: for that which is ouer-much alayed or mixed with water, except it be for necessities sake, as in a feuerous distemperature, is to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne people hurtfull, because it doth too much diminish their naturall heat, hinder the digestion, and breede infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and collicke torments. Wherefore wine not much, but meanely diluted, is to our Country men, for the most part, in time of health and heat agreable, because it doth best temper their humors, penetrate and coole the parts of the bodie, and assist the naturall heat, against the ambient heat of the aire: I say, in time of health, because the bowels burning with a feuerous distemperature, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yea very expedient, to mingle 6, 7, or 8 parts of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with one of wine, especially if the bodie shall bee youthfull, and of an hot temperature, that the vehement heat, which otherwise will quickly subuert the state of the bodie, may be extinguished. But for them that are cold by temperature, or well stricken in yeares, pure wine is in time of health more conuenient, as I haue before shewed. And in any feuerous distemperature, they may not in the mingling togither of water and wine, to alay their thirst, take aboue foure, or at the most fiue parts of water to one of wine, least that the hurts which water is likely to bring to such bodies, should be greater then the commoditie of cooling and quenching the thirst, as may be gathered by that which I haue afore declared of the vse of water.

But to young men, that haue hot constitutions, and aboue all others to the cholericke, in whom the liuer is ouer hot, and in the hot seasons of the yeare, it is very hurtfull, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be strong. And it is also hurtfull to them that haue weake braines, and feeble sinewes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all such must either forbeare wine, or vse it very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and well tempered with water in hot seasons.</p>

Verily, it hath bin written and affirmed by some of the ancient Physitions, and approued as a thing wholsome: because drunkennesse obserued in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforesaid (for often drunkennesse they did condemne) doth (as they say) by inducing sleepe, alleuiate and make quiet the animall powers, prouoke vomiting, vrine, and sweat: whereby it commeth to passe, that the weake and troubled spirits, through immoderate cares and perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are reviued, and pacified, and the euill humors not onely eiected from the stomacke, but also expelled from all parts of the bodie. But this their assertion, as it is most vngodly, so it is vnto the health of the bodie most pernicious: for drunkennesse spoyleth the stomacke, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the bloud waterish, hurteth the braine, dulleth the senses, destroyeth the vnderstanding, debilitateth the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and su buerteth the powers of all the bodie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing that all drunkennesse is euill, and hurtfull to the true health of the bodie, and that the disease is perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, which doth cheifly distemper the place of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1906:21"/>
they erred very grossely, that thought drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse profitable once or twise a moneth. Neither are their reasons of such validitie, as that they should perswade any to a custome no lesse hurtfull to the minde then to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For the animall powers defatigated, or otherwise disturbed, may be holpen with a safer, better, and a more godly remedie, then by an vnquiet and turbulent sleepe, caused by meanes of drunkennesse: for drunkards verily doe not enioy sweet and quiet sleepe, whereby the animall powers are truly refreshed. In like manner, to procure vomiting, vrine, and sweat, by meanes of drunkennesse, as it is wicked, so it is also beastly. Moreouer by a remedie of this kinde, the hurt is farre greater then the helpe; for drunkennesse, besides that it doth extinguish the light of the vnderstanding, causeth the Apoplexie, and such other like diseases of the braine, and oftentimes a sudden suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. In a word, it doth by much more hurt all the parts and faculties of the bodie, then any way helpe by euacuation of superfluities, as the barbarous Authors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their assertion: for infinite are the hurts that drunkennesse bringeth vnto mans bodie.

               <p>BEere that is too bitter of the hop (as many to saue malt are wont to make it) is of a fuming nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it engendreth rheumes and distillations, hurteth the sinewes, offendeth the sight, and causeth the head-ach, by filling the ventricles of the braine with troublesome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors: whereof not onely the internall, but also the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall senses, are very much disturbed and hurted: and therefore such Beere is worse then Ale, notwithstanding the obstructiue facultie of it. But if Beere be not made too bitter, but that it haue in the making of it a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable quantitie of hops, and that it be not drunke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bitter force of the hop be throughly spent and consumed, it is farre more wholesome then Ale: because the manifold force and efficacie of hops, doe manisest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare the wholsomnes and excellencie of Beere; for hopps doe not onely remoue obstructions of the liuer, spleene, and kidneies, and cleanseth the bloud from all corrupt humors, causing the same to come forth with the vrine, which it prouoketh; but also, maketh the bodie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, by excreting forth of yellow cholericke humors. Wherefore seeing that hops doe as well make Beere a kinde of medicinable drinke, to preserue the powers and faculties of the bodie, and to purge and cleanse the bloud, as a common and daily drinke to extinguish thirst, I may very well conclude, that it is much better and wholsomer then Ale, especially for such as be cholericke, and haue <note place="margin">For whom Beere is better then Ale.</note> hot stomacks, and that are subiect to obstructions of the melt, liuer, and kidneies. But Ale is in the winter season in greatest vse, because it cooleth lesse then Beere, as most men thinke; but it doth not by any other reason lesse coole, (there being an equall proportion of malt in them both) but because it hath not such a penetratiue power as <note place="margin">Whether Beere be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then Ale?</note> Beere hath: I know that many are of opinion, that Beere (in regard of the hot and dry qualitie of the hop) is in

The second is, that it be cleare and thin: for that which is not cleare and well defecated, aboundantly increaseth grosse, flateous, and pituitous humors, and so consequently impinguateth the bodie to the vtter subuersion of it: for it obstructeth the bowels, causeth the stone and strangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by filling the passages of the vrine with grosse, faeculent, &amp; slimie humors, breedeth winde, and maketh the breath short and painefull. The third is, that it be very well boyled: for that which is not well boyled is fulsome to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1906:23"/>
the stomacke, and puffeth vp the bodie with windie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. The fourth is, that it be olde and purged from his dregs; for such is of a penetrating nature, of good iuyce, not windie, and acceptable to the stomack, both for concoction and distribution. But that which is new, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the same hurts, which the grosse and not well conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted doth. And verily this propertic is in Beere much to be regarded; for if it be not drunke till the bitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nesse of the hop be well consumed, it doth nothing lesse then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the braine and sinewes with vaporous fumes; but it doth the better penetrate and quench the thirst: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stale Beere is chiefly to be desired in the summer, and it is a drinke (beleeue me) for all constitutions, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">Stale Beere most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in the summer sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> for the cholericke and melancholicke most wholsome. But here by the way it is to be considered, that as Beere very new is vnwholesome, so is that also which is too olde, as when it is growne soure, for it very much hurteth the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, the liuer, and the braine. Therefore they greatly erre, that keepe Beere till it be two, three, or foure yeares olde: for it is most hurtfull to the bodie, and pernicious to the vnderstanding. But Beere of a middle age, as from one or two moneths olde, vnto fiue or six, according to the strength of it, is the best and wholsomest. And if in that space, it shall onely chance to acquire somewhat a sowre smacke, it is not therefore of all men to be refused: for vnto cholericke bodies because it represseth the acrimonie of choler, and also to all them (by reason of the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting force which it obteyneth) that are subiect to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the stomack, mesaraicke veines, spleene, liuer, lungs and reines it is most profitable. And if such as haue the stone, or are subiect to the obstructions of the reines, doe daily vse such Beere, it will be impossible, so that they erre not in other things, that they should euer be vexed with the stone, or any other great and painfull obstruction of the reines. The fift is, that it be of an indifferent strength, not too strong nor too small, because each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse is hurtfull. For that Beere which is of a middle
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1906:23"/>
strength, doth heat that state of bodie which is ouer cold, refrigerateth that which is too hot, and preserueth the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. But that which is stronger then a meane, is more meete for cold and moist bodies, especially in the cold seasons of the yeare: and that which is weaker, for hot and and drie bodies, especially in the spring and summer: for such bodies require much cooling and moistning, which small Beere, because that it litle differeth from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of water, doth best effect; but it is rheumaticke, and impensiuely hurtfull to cold constitutions: For you must vnderstand, that Beere by how much the stronger it is, by so much the neerer it commeth vnto the nature of wine, and by how much the smaller, by so much the neerer it approcheth vnto the nature of water. Wherefore seeing that there is great difference to be found in Beere, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the strength and smalnes of it, it becommeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to haue speciall respect of his owne state and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of bodie, that thereby he may make vse of that which shall be best agreeing vnto his nature. And here I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise all such as respect their owne good, that they drinke not Beere that is very strong, but in steed of wine; (for if it be stale, well depurated from dregs, and throughly boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it is in operation most like vnto wine) because the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vse of it, is very greatly hurtfull to the integritie both of minde and bodie. And here I admonish our common ale-pot drunkards, that it is worse to be drunke with Ale or <note place="margin">Drunkennesse with Ale or Beere worse then with wine.</note> Beere, then with Wine; for the drunkennesse endureth longer, to the vtter ruine of the braine and vnderstanding, by reason that the fumes and vapors of the Ale or Beere that ascend to the head, are more grosse, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so soone resolued, as those that rise vp of wine: and by the same reason I conclude, that it is worst of all to be drunke of Ale. The sixt and last propertie is, that the malte whereof the Beere is made, be full of pure corne, as of Barly or Oates, for then the drinke made thereof must needs be the better. And here it may be demanded, whether Beere made onely of barly malte, be better and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1906:24"/>
wholesomer, then that which is made of barly and oaten <note place="margin">Whether Beere made onely of barly malt be better and wholeso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then that which is made of barly and oaten malte mingled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that whereas the end of the vse of drinkeis fourefold: 1. To quench the thirst. 2. To temper the natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To help the concoction and distribution of the meats, that Beere made of barly and oaten maltemixed togither, doth more effectually accomplish the first three without any manner of hinderance vnto the fourth, and is also of a more liuely taste, if it be kept vntouched, till that it hath gotten a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient stalenes: whereupon I may well affirme, that Beere made of barly and oaten malt mingled togither is better, then that which is made of barly malte alone, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the hot seasons of the yeare: and verily for hot and dry bodies, it is at all times much more conuenient, because it receiueth a singular cooling qualitie from the Oate.</p>

Onely those that are <hi>atrabilary,</hi> which abound with choler adust, because their stomacks are very dry, where-from, for the most part the meats doe very slowly, and that not without some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie descend, may very profitably drinke a draught or two thereof at their meales.

               <p>MEtheglin is a very strong kinde of drinke, made of two parts of water, and one of hony, boyled together and scummed very cleane, and if Rosemary, Hyssop, Time, Orgaine, and Sage, be first well boyled in the water, wherof you make the Metheglin, it will bee the better.

For besides the singular facultie that it hath, of heating the bodie, it hath also a very speciall abstersorie propertie, for the remoouing of fleame, residing and stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the stomack, braine and sinewie parts: It is best in the mornings fasting. But it is not good for such as are hot by constitution, nor in the hot seasons of the yeere, because it ouermuch heateth the bodie, and is very quickly turned into red choler, and therefore let such as are cholericke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how they vse it. If in their old age, cold fleame shall somewhat abound in their stomacks, then sometimes mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings fasting, a small draught thereof may bee profitable for them. It must not bee drunke while it is new, for then, because it is not fined from the dregs, nor the crudities

But after that it hath well purged it selfe, and setled in the vessell three or fowre moneths, and made as afore described, there is not for very cold, old and phlegmaticke bodies, especially in the cold seasons of the yeere a better drinke, as by the properties thereof aboue shewed, may be collected.</p>
               <p>Meath or Mead, is like to Metheglin, the cheefest diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that it is not so hot in operation; for Meath is <note place="margin">Meath.</note> made of one part of hony, and foure times so much of pure water, or more, and boyled till no scum doth remaine.

If hyssop, time, pellitory of the wall, parsley-roots and fennell roots be first well boyled in the water, wherof you make the Meath, and ginger also boyled, or hanged in the barrell, as I haue afore shewed in the making of Metheglin, it will bee of a more effectuall operation, for the purposes aforesayd, and a drinke beleeue me, beyond all other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them that are subiect to the obstructions of the breast, and reines of the back.

               <p>
                  <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> hath his denomination, in that it recouereth and maintaineth life: The common manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, is to distill it out of the lees of wine, or of the lees of strong ale and wine together, by adding thereto licorise, Annis-seeds and graines; but this common vendible <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> both in regard of the grosse substances, from whence it ariseth, as also of the rude manner of preparing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling it, may more rightly bee named <hi>Aqua mortis,</hi> the water of death; for it causeth more hurt, then commodity to them that vse it: wherefore I will here describe an easie manner for the making of an <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> yet very effectuall for them that neede such a comfortable drinke.</p>
               <p>Take of the tops of Rosemarie, of Sage, of Marioram, of Orgaine, of Time, of Wormewood, of Speremints, of Balme, of each one handfull, of Ginger scraped cleane one ounce, of Nutmegs and Cynamon of each halfe an ounce, of Cloues, Mace, Pepper and Graines, of each a quarter of an ounce, of Galingale roots sliced one ounce, of Raisins of the Sun cut thorow the middle one pound, of Fennell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seedes and Annis-seedes of each two ounces, of Liquorice scraped clean and cut into thin slices, halfe a pound: bruize the Spices and Seedes a little, and breake the hearbes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your hands, then put all together into a gallon or two of Muskadell, Sacke, or such like strong wine, and so let them infuse in an Lymbeck-pot close stopped, fowre and twenty howres vpon hot embers, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning distill them with a very temperate fire, and take espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care, that the head of your Lymbecke be kept cold continually with fresh water, and that the bottome therof be fast luted, that none of the vapours breath forth. Out of a gallon of liquor, you may draw a quart of excellent <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> And if then to the feces in the pot, you will adde a gallon of strong ale, or lees of wine, or of them both,

               <p>Now to the question I answer, that for the most part there is not any water in vse, which can better fortifie life, and hinder the comming on of old age, then the aforesayd <hi>Aqua vitae:</hi> for it very greatly comforteth a weak stomack, expelleth winde, putteth off all melancholike passions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth the humors from corruption, and excellently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth against swounding; for by reason of a notable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable power that it hath, it quickly goeth vnto the heart, and wonderfully raiseth vp faint and feeble spirits.

Wherefore the moderate vse thereof is to hee permitted vnto cold and phlegmaticke bodies, especially in cold and moyst seasons, to wit, vpon the taking of much meat, or when the stomack shall be vexed and distended with wind, the quantity of a spoonefull or two at a time, well sweetned with sugar, that it may the lesse affect the braine and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils, or cause any hurt to the liuer, through its feruent and penetrating heat.

               <p>Now to the question, I answer negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for those beasts or fowles, that haue by nature moyst flesh, are for goodnesse of meat more wholsom, when they are growen to fuller age, then when they are sucking, or very young, because that then they are ouer moyst, and of an excrementall, slimie, and phlegmaticke iuyce, which as they encrease in age, is much wasted and dried away: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hoggrels, and young Weathers, are for goodnesse of meat better &amp; more wholsome, then sucking Lambs: &amp; it is the like also of Porke; notwithstanding, that rosting Pigs are of mostmen greatly desired, and for some certaine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies very profitable. For verily, these kindes of beasts, that are naturally moyst, are when they are young, wholsome enough, yea, very profitable in the summer-season, for cholerick and dry bodies, because they yeeld a moyst nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, which doth well temper and amend the dry tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, or rather, the vntemperate drinesse of such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. To all other bodies, especially such as are cold and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1906:28"/>
moyst, they are exceedingly hurtfull, because a very moyst kinde of food, doth in them increase a very moyst di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature, and quickly maketh the same altogether sickly. But those Beasts or Fowles, whose flesh is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dry, are best when they are young and sucking, for then their drinesse is attempered, with the moysture of their youngnesse. And by how much the younger they are, by so much the moyster they are, and consequently of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier concoction, and also of better iuyce, after that they haue once attained vnto perfection of flesh. Wherefore Kids and Calues are, for goodnesse of meat, better then Goats and Oxen, and the like is also to be sayd of Pigeons, Fawnes, &amp;c. And those verily, that are of a meane temper and consistence of flesh, are for good nourishment the best, and not onely in their young, but also in their full and middle age, very wholsome and agreeable for all bodies. Such are Capons, Turkies, Phesants, &amp;c. But generally, all beasts and birds, that are of the fourth age before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether they bee naturally dry or moyst, are naught and vnwholsome; for they are tough, of a very hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and breed an euill and melancholike iuyce; yet they are good enough for robustious and rusticke bodies.</p>

               <p>I Answer, that flesh which is poudred, or seasoned with salt, for the space of one, two, three, foure, or fiuedaies, according as the nature of the flesh, the complexion of the eater, and the time of the yeere shall require, is farre more wholsome then that which is fresh and vnsalted: because, the salt doth purifie the flesh, and make it the more sauoury by drying vp and consuming the watery and excrementall moysture of it. And this is not to bee vnderstood of all sorts of flesh, but of the grosser kindes, as of beefe, porke, &amp;c: for such are wont, and onely ought to bee sprinkled, seasoned, and conserued with salt.

good reasen before limited the time for seasoning of flesh with salt, according as the nature of the flesh, the complexion of the eater, and the time of yeare shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, because the flesh which is very grosse and moist, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a longer salting, that the superfluous moisture thereof may be the better exsiccated. A complexion hot and dry doth require moister meats; but a cold and moist constitution requireth dryer: to the one therefore a shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the other a longer time of salting the meats is best agreable. And in respect of the time of the yeare, it is sufficient in the Spring and Summer to haue it powdred a day or two; in the Autumne for the space of two or three dayes; and in the Winter foure or fiue dayes at most, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause mans bodie at that time, by reason of the cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the season, doth more abound with superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But the flesh which is longer preserued in salt, or brine, or after that it is salted, hanged vp to dry neere the fire, which we commonly call, Martimasse beefe, doth loose his puritie, and is of very hard digestion: it breedeth cholericke and melancholicke humors, very apt for adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, especially that which is hauged vp to dry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to such as be cholericke and melancholick, though for the most part well pleasing to their pallats, most hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

               <p>THe Arabian Physitions preferre Kids flesh before all other flesh; because (as they say) it is of a more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate nature, and breedeth pure bloud, which is in a meane betweene hot and cold, subtile and grosse. <hi>Ysaac</hi> saith, that sucking Kids are for taste, nourishment, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion better then other; whose opinion I approue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the milke giueth and maintaineth in them an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent moisture: wherefore their flesh is singularly good for hot, dry, and extenuated bodies, and for them that haue weake stomacks, and are from some long sicknes vpon a recouerie to health, so they eat it rosted. But by reason that it somewhat aboundeth with an excrementall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, it is hurtfull for the aged, and such as are phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and that haue cold and moist stomacks. For although Kids flesh be deemed to be temperately hot and moist in the first degree; yet it is more moist then hot, and withall somewhat slimie: wherefore to their opinion concerning the goodnes of Kids flesh aboue all other, I see no reason why I should yeeld my subscription; for I thinke Veale to be for goodnes and wholsomnes of meat, rather superiour, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But howsoeuer it be to an Arabian stomacke, or whether the Kids of Arabia be in substance lesse moist and slimie, then ours, as it is very likely, I suppose Kids flesh to be somewhat better then Lambe: for Lambe by reason of much viscous humiditie in it, increaseth crude and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke humors. Wherefore it is not so wholsome in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1906:29"/>
winter, and former part of the spring, as it is from the latter end of the spring vnto the beginning of Autumne, in which space (by reason that the aire is commonly hot and dry) such moist flesh is best agreable vnto mans bodie. It is most profitable for them that are by constitution hot and dry, and that abound with adust and cholericke humors; but it is not conuenient for olde men, or for them that are phlegmaticke, especially the much vse of it; for by reason of the much moisture which it hath, it repleteth their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks with crude and phlegmatick humors. Lambe of two or three moneths old is the best; for the younger it is, the moreit aboundeth with a crude superfluous moisture; and if it be well rosted, it giueth the better nourishment, because the most part of the crude superfluities in it, are by the force and esficacie of the fire, well wasted and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. Lambes that are weaned, and afterwards fatted, are wholsomer for meat then when they were sucking, because their flesh doth lesse abound with superfluous moisture; and if they haue their feeding in hilly pastures, they yeeld the purer nourishment, and are a very good meat, for those that haue weake stomacks, or liue a studious kinde of life. The flesh of Hogrells and young Weathers is a right whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and temperate meat, it breedeth very good bloud, and is easily digested: it is better then Lambe, for it yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a more pure and substantiall nourishment, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for euery season, age, and temperature.

I confesse that porke is to most peoples pallats very pleasing, and that it, so it be well digested, yeeldeth vnto the bodie much and firme nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it is with difficultie digested, and the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof is too moist, grosse, glutinous, and obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue. Wherefore I will here aduertise all pallat-pleasers, that they shall sooner surfet, and that more dangerously, with porke, then with any other flesh: &amp; that pork is good and wholsome for bodies that be young, strong, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in great labour, and not disposed to oppilations, for the cholericke, and them that desire to be fat. And of such, must <hi>Galen</hi> and other Physitions, that haue so greatly written in the commendation of Porke be vnderstood. And in very deede, hot, healthy, and strong bodies, that vndergoe great labours, require (for the conseruation of their strengths) much firme and durable nourishment, such as Porke, in regard of the grosse substance of it, doth very effectually suppeditate. But seeing that Porke is of hard digestion, and in substance more grosse then conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it is not good for them that be aged, that are grosse, that haue weake stomacks, or that lead a sitting or studious kinde of life. For in such bodies it causeth obstructions of the mesaraicke veines, liuer, and reines, the gowte and dropsie, especially if they shall be cold and moist by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: for vnto such, is Porke very greatly hurtfull, because in them it is wholy conuerted into crude and phlegmatick humors. Wherefore let such as are phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, aged, or subiect vnto obstructions, or haue weake stomacks, altogither absteine from the vse of Porke. There is great difference in Porke according to the age of it: the best is that which is of the age from six moneths vnto a yeare, and not ouer fat: for then it aboundeth more with superfluous moisture, nourisheth lesse, and is more fulsome to the stomacke.</p>

               <p>VEnison, whether it be of Fallow Deere, or of Red, is of hard digestion, and of ill iuyce; for it engendreth grosse melancholicke bloud, which quickly causeth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the liuer and milt. Wherefore let such as haue weake stomacks, and those also that are by constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion melancholicke, or subiect to obstructions eschew the vse of it. It was verily a good inuention for amending of the noisomnesse of Venison, to drinke Claret wine plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with it, because that wine causeth it to be the better digested, and is also of a contrary nature to the humor that Venison most of all breedeth. Both kindes of flesh are of a dry temperature, and therefore the fatter the flesh is, the better it is (especially to eat it cold, because that then the fatnes of it, is not so fulsome to the stomacke as when it is hot) for the siccitie of it being amended by the fat, is reduced vnto a certaine mediocritie in such flesh. And if they be well hunted before they be killed, their flesh is the wholsomer, for by often and long coursing of them, their bloud becommeth more thin and subtill, and the euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors dissipated, by reason whereof, the flesh is more easily digested, and yeeldeth better nourishment. The younger and the fatter Deere are to be chosen, because they are of a moister temperature, and consequently of a softer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, of easier concoction, and of wholsomer nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if they be olde, or Jeane, they are of a very hard concoction, troublesome to the stomacke, and vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for the bodie, because they breed an earthie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke bloud.

               <head>Whether the much and often use and eating of Fish be unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and hurtfull to the health of the bodie?</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, because fish increaseth much grosse slimio and superfluous flegme, which residing and corrupting in the bodie, causeth difficultie of breathing, the goute, the stone, the leprie, the scuruie, and other foule and troublesome affects of the skin. Wherefore I aduise those men that are much deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the vse of fish, that they be very carefull in the <note place="margin">The choise of fish.</note> choise of it, as that it be not of a clammie, slimie, neither of a very grosse or hard substance, nor oppleted with much fat (for all fat is of it selfe ill and noysome to the slomack; but of fish it is worst) neither of ill smell, and vnpleasant sauour. Wherefore of Sea-fish, that is best which swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in a pure sea, and is tossed and hoysed with windes, and surges: for by reason of continuall agitation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth of a purer, and lesse slimie substance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of easier concoction, and of purer iuyce. And for the same cause, the fish that is taken neere to a shore that is neither earthy nor slimie, but rockie and stonie, is also best: for the fish that abides in a slimie shore, is of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der digestion, and of a more slimie and excrementall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The fish also that betaketh it selfe from the Sea into the mouthes or entries of great riuers, and so swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth towards the fresh waters, doth quickly become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1906:42"/>
or worse: for if they be caried in slimie and muddie riuers, they forthwith loose much of their goodnes; but if in pure, grauely, and stonie riuers, then the farther off they be remoued from the Sea, the better they are: for by reason that the water is contrary to their course, they are the better clensed from their slimie superfluities. Of fresh water fish also that is best, which is bred in pure, stonie, or grauely riuers running swiftly. For that which is taken in muddie waters, in standing pooles, in fennes, motes and ditches, by reason of the impuritie of the place, and water, is vnwholesome; for it breedeth a very slimie and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall nourishment, very greatly hurtfull vnto them that are subiect to the goute, and stone, and obstructions of the breast. Thus much in generall concerning the choise of fish. Now I will breifely speake of the particular kindes of fish that are most common and in greatest vse, and first of Sea-fish.</p>
               <p>The Sole is somewhat of an hard substance, and yet of <note place="margin">Sole.</note> easie concoction, and free from excrement, in respect of other fish. For whitenes and puritie of substance, pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of taste, and goodnes of iuyce, it far excelleth all other Sea fish; and therefore may well be termed the Sea-Capon. The Sole verily is to be reckoned among the meats of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest note; and for such as are infirme and sicke, <hi>Non magis expetitus quam salutaris cibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Plaice is pleasant to the pallate, easily digested, and <note place="margin">Plaice.</note> in the iudgement of some men a good fish; but in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it giueth a watrish and excrementall nourishment, especially if it be not well growne to a substantiall thickne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. It is best agreable to them that are by constitution chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke; but to the phlegmaticke it is very hurtfull, because it aboundeth with a phlegmaticke iuyce. The Dabbe <note place="margin">Dabbe.</note> or little Plaice is of the same nature, but more excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall. <note place="margin">Flounder or Flooke.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Flounder is in taste, digestion, and nourishment like vnto the Plaice, especially if he be young. <note n="*" place="margin">That are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender mouthed.</note> Some deeme this fish not so pleasant in taste, nor so good in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1906:43"/>
nourishment, as the Plaise, but by their leaue, if it be growne to a good thicknes <hi>(nam quo grandior eò melior)</hi> by reason of a firmer substance which it acquireth) I rather thinke that it giueth a better then a worse nourishment, because it lesse aboundeth with a slimie superfluitie.</p>
               <p>The Gurnard is of harder digestion, then any of the former: some are red, and some grey: in respect of the <note place="margin">Gurnard.</note> colour, there is litle difference, if there be any, the red is the better: both giue a good nourishment, and nothing slimie: and therefore they are much better for them that are phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmatick, then the Plaice, or Flounder.</p>
               <p>The Whiting, notwithstanding that it is vnsauourie, and nourisheth very litle, is of some greatly desired, and <note place="margin">Whiting.</note> commended: verily it is easily digested, and the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which it maketh, although it be litle, yet it is good, and very litle excrementall.</p>
               <p>The Breame is somewhat acceptable to the pallate, of <note place="margin">Breame.</note> easie digestion, and of meetly good nourishment, somwhat excrementall. It is best agreable for cholericke bodies, and worst for phlegmaticke. Some loue to eat the eyes of the Breame; but they are very excrementitiall; and so also are the eyes of any other fish.</p>
               <p>Shad and Mackrell are both sweet in taste, and soft in substance; yet not very wholsome, for they quickly induce <note place="margin">Shad and Mackrell.</note> a loathing noy somnes to the stomacke, and breed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementall nourishment. They are conuenient for labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men, and for them that haue strong stomacks.</p>
               <p>Dogge fish and Hake are neere of a nature, not of hard <note place="margin">Dogge-fish and Hake.</note> concoction; but yet scarcely of laudable nourishment, for they increase somewhat crude and watrish humors.</p>
               <p>Codfish for whitenes of colour, and moderate hardnes, and friabilitie of substance is commended: it is easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, <note place="margin">Cod-fish,</note> and yeeldeth a meetly strong nourishment, and not very excrementall.</p>
               <p>The Haddocke is pleasant to the taste: it is in nature <note place="margin">Haddock.</note> somewhat like vnto the Cod; but it is of lighter conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not of so firme and durable nourishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1906:43"/>
Mullet is a fish somewhat of an hard substance; yet if <note place="margin">Mullet.</note> it be taken in a grauelly and stonie shore, is not of hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, is of pleasant taste, and of meetly nourishment. But if it bee taken in a muddie or slimie water, it is not so easily digested, is hurtfull to the stomacke, and breedeth grosse and excrementall humours. Of Mullets, the lesser are best, for they are of easier concoction, and of better iuyce.</p>
               <p>The Base is in goodnesse of iuyce inferiour to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, for it is of harder concoction, and breedeth a more <note place="margin">Base.</note> grosse and slimie nourishment. Both Mullet and Base are agreeable for them that are of hot temperature, and haue strong stomacks.</p>
               <p>Sammon is ranked with the best sort of fish, it is very <note place="margin">Sammon.</note> pleasant to the taste, and not very hard to bee digested, it maketh a good nourishment, in consistence, neither clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie nor grosse; but yet it quickly oppresseth a weake sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: wherefore let such as are infirme, or haue weake stomacks, so carefully moderate their appetites, as that the iucunditie of it, entice them not to a perilous and nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seatiue fulnesse. The belly is to be chosen before any other part, because it is tenderer, and of a more sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer taste. The eyes of a Sammon are farre wholsomer then the eyes of any other fish.</p>
               <p>The young Sammon, or Sammon. Peale, is farre better <note place="margin">Sammon-Peale.</note> then that which is greater, or fuller growen: for it is of a softer and whiter substance, of a pleasanter relish, of easier concoction, more acceptable and agreeable to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and of very good and wholsome nourishment. The salted Sammon loseth much of his goodnesse and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of taste, and is therefore for wholsomnesse of meat, very much inferiour to the fresh.</p>
               <p>Turbut or Birt is meetly pleasant to the taste, and if it <note place="margin">Turbut.</note> be well digested, it maketh a good and firme nourishment: it is somewhat of an hard substance, and therefore not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily digested. It is a verie good meat for such as are healthy and haue strong stomacks; but for the aged, for them that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1906:44"/>
be phlegmaticke, and that haue weake stomacks, it is verie in conuenient and hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Sturgion is a verie acceptable dish, and best welcome at <note place="margin">Sturgion.</note> tables. It may be much doubted, whether it be so greatly esteemed for the rarenesse of it, or for the goodnesse of meat, or for that it is pleasant to the pallat, and induceth withall a smoothing delectation to the gullet. I will plainly deliuer my opinion, whatsoeuer the sensuall Pallatist shall deeme. The flesh of the Sturgion, is of it selfe, of a whitish, and meetly pure substance, and consequently of laudable nourishment, if it were not intermixed with a grosse and nauseatiue fat, by reason whereof it is not easily digested, and is quickly offensiue to the stomacke, and maketh a grosse and clammie nourishment. Wherefore let such as are aged, and that haue cold and weake stomacks, carefully refraine the vse of it. It is most accommodate for the hot season of the yeere. The little or young Sturgion, is farre wholsomer then the greater, for he is of tenderer substance, of pleasanter taste, of easier concoction, and of good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, if you separate most of the fat, which subuerteth the stomacke, and breedeth a grosse and clammie humor. The belly of the Sturgion is, euen as of the Sammon, to be preferred before the other parts. The Sturgion, not onely which is great and full growen, but that also which is little, and somewhat tender by age, is verie hurtfull vnto them, that are troubled with rheumes, and articular greefes.</p>
               <p>The Hallibut is a big fish, and of great accompt: it is of <note place="margin">Hallibut.</note> a white, and somewhat of an hard substance, and therfore not easily digested; but it is very pleasant to the taste, and for goodnesse of meat not inferiour to the Sturgion. The belly part, euen as of the Sturgion, is the best. It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient meat for young men, and for hot cholericke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but for old men, for the phlegmatick, and them that haue weake stomacks it is very hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Dorie is for substance of flesh almost of a meane consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, <note place="margin">Dorie.</note> yet not very delectable to the pallat It giueth a meetly good nourishment; but it is not good, especially
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1906:44"/>
the much eating of it, for them that bee phlegmaticke, or haue weake stomackes, or that are subiect to the gout and stone, because it breedeth somewhat a grosse and plegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke iuyce.</p>
               <p>The Allowes is taken in the same places that Sammon <note place="margin">Allowes.</note> is, it is meetly pleasant to the taste, yeeldeth much, and somewhat a thicke nourishment, yet not ill, so it bee well concocted in the stomacke; but it is of hard concoction, wherefore it is hurtfull to them that haue weake stomacks, and that are by constitution phlegmaticke and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. The Allowes that tarrieth, and is taken in sweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is wholsomer then that of the sea, for it is fatter, of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer substance, of easier concoction, and of better sauour.</p>
               <p>The Guilthead or Goldine is whiter, and not altogether <note place="margin">Guilthead.</note> of so hard a substance as the Allowes, and therefore it is of easier concoction, and also of better nourishment. The Guilthead is not in season, but in the winter, for then he is sweeter in taste, then at any other time, and is conuenient for euery age and temperature of body.</p>
               <p>The Calaminarie, the Cuttle-fish, and Poure-Cuttle, <note place="margin">Calaminarie, or Sea Cut, Cuttle-fish, Poure-Cuttle</note> are euen of one and the same nature, they are of hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and fill the bodie with crude and grosse humors. They may in want of better meat, serue for Mariners, and rusticall bodies, who through the strength of their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes and great labour, are able to conuert any grosse meat into good nourishment. The small ones excell the great, because they are of a more tender flesh, and are with lesse disficulty digested, They are all hurtful to them that haue weake sinewes, and subject to the palsie.</p>
               <p>The Wolfe-fish is of a cold and moyst temperature, of <note place="margin">The Wolse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish.</note> pleasant taste, and of easie concoction. It breedeth a cold, thin, and waterish iuyce, and therefore let such as are phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke and rheumaticke, perpetually shun the vse of it.</p>
               <p>The Lumpe or Lompe, is a fish so named from his shape <note place="margin">Lompe-fish.</note> and likenesse, and is in taste agreeable to the name; it is of hard concoction, and of grosse and excrementall iuyce.</p>
               <p>The Conger is a long round fish, in shape like vnto a <note place="margin">Conger.</note>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1906:45"/>
great Eele, and is therefore called the Conger-Eele: It yeeldeth a grosse and excrementall nourishment, as the common Eele doth. It is a meat, notwithstanding that it is to most mens pallats well pleasing, conuenient only for such as haue strong stomacks, and that are of a firme state of bodie. To the phlegmaticke, to them that haue weake stomacks, or subiect to the dropsie, gout, and stone, it is verie hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Lampreyes are of some greatly esteemed, but very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, for they are partly of the nature of Eeles; yet <note place="margin">Lamprey.</note> somewhat wholsomer, because they are not of so clammie and so grosse a substance. They are pleasant to the taste, but not easily concocted. They giue much nourishment; but the same somewhat clammie and tough: wherefore they are not fit for them that haue weake stomackes, or are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to obstructions. They also encrease melancholy, and are verie hurtfull to such as are troubled with the gout, and that haue weake sinewes. The small Lampreyes are better then the great, for they are not of so tough substance, and therefore of easier concoction, and of wholsomer nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment.</p>
               <p>Thornbacke is a fish of moyst substance, of grosse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementall, <note place="margin">Thornback,</note> and putrid iuyce: whereby it commeth to passe, that it is a meat of ill smell, vnpleasant sauour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome nourishment, noysome to the stomacke. The vse thereof breedeth cold diseases, and the Epilepsie verie speedily, if it bee eaten hot: which noysome quality doth (as I thinke) in cooling, somewhat euaporate, and sooner arise being eaten hot, for that it is so moyst a fish, and full of superfluitie. It is a meat onely fit for hard labouring men.</p>
               <p>The Tuine, Porpuise, and such like great and bestiall <note place="margin">Tuine, Porpuise, &amp;c.</note> fishes, are of verie hard digestion, noysome to the stomack, and of a verie grosse, excrementall and naughty iuyce.</p>

The salt or pickled Herring, is of harder concoction, and giueth a saltish and vnprofitable nourishment. They are good for them that want better meat.</p>

Wherefore they may be conuenient for the phlegmaticke; but in my opinion, the speciall good propertie that they haue, if it be good, is to commend a cup of wine to the pallat, and are therefore chiefly profitable for Vintners.</p>
               <p>In shell-fish it is to be obserued, that some are of soft sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <note place="margin">Shell-fish.</note> and are easily digested, some of hard substance, and with more difficulty concocted; but are of firmer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nourishment.</p>

Wherefore they are not commendable for any age, or temperature; but they are most hurtfull to them that be aged, phlegmatick, or subiect to obstructions.

               <head>Whether Milke doe giue vnto all bodies a good and healthy nourishment.</head>
               <p>MIlke is moiste in the second degree, and more encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto cold then vnto heat; it is of easie digestion, of much and good nourishment: it impinguateth and causeth the bodie to waxe grosse, and for amending of a dry constitution, and for them that are extenuated by long sicknes, or are in a consumption, it is by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent moistning, cooling and nourishing facultie of it, of singular efficacie. But notwithstanding that milke is of light digestion, and of much and wholesome nutriture: yet it is not good for all bodies; not for them that are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect <note place="margin">Milke not profitable for all bodies.</note> to windinesse of the stomacke and belly, or that haue impure, weake, and ill-affected stomacks, because it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth winde, and is by reason of the differing nature of the parts thereof (for it consisteth of a threefold substance, as shall be hereafter shewed) in a weake, or ill-affected sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, soone corrupted and coagulated: nor for them that are phlegmatick, grosse, and full of moyst humors, or subiect to obstructions, because it maketh them more to abound with crude, grosse, and phlegmatick humors. But being boyled and eaten with sugar, pepper, and other spice, it is lesse windie and more agreable for such bodies. Now by this which I haue breifely shewed, concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of milke, it may plainely appeare, that the vse of it, is best agreable for the hot seasons of the yeare, for young men, and especially for hot and dry cholericke bodies:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1906:49"/>
because it doth much refresh them with an excellent coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and moystning nourishment: and that it is most hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the aged, to them that be phlegmaticke, and that are subiect to cold diseases, by reason of the abundance of grosse and phlegmatick humors, which it breedeth in such bodies. Wherefore the vse of milke is very hurtfull vnto them that are subiect to winde, to rheumes, to cold diseases of the head and sinewes, to the Gout, and dropsie in generall, the stone or any obstruction of the reines and bladder, obstructions of the breast, liuer, melt, stomacke, and mesaraicke veines. And therefore not so much as the drinking ofa draught of milke in the morning fasting, as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth warme from the Cow is to be approued vnto them that are of acold constitution, or any way subiect to obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; whereas for them that are hot and dry by consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, a large draught is very good and profitable, for it sweetly cooleth, moystneth, and refresheth the dry and thirstie parts of the bodie, and also expurgeth the sharpe and cholericke humors by stoole. Wherefore the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of milke not onely in the morning fasting, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the Cow, but also at any other time of the day, so that it be taken in an empty stomacke, is to hot, leane, and dry bodies greatly profitable. But because that milke is apt to corrupt and coagulate in the stomacke, you must take with it a little sugar; or if you desire to haue it more soluble, pure honie: but sugar is better for them that are by constitution cholericke; for by this meanes it will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt, nor coagulate in the stomacke. And if you also cause a few Speremints to be put into the vessell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into <note place="margin">Sugar &amp; Mints preuent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation of milke in the stomacke,</note> the Cow is milked, or otherwise steeped one houre or two in the milke that you purpose to drinke, the milke will be much the more agreeing with the stomack, and not so apt to coagulate.</p>
               <p>Milke that is kept till it waxe somewhat sowre is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all bodies hurtfull: for the drinking of it is, in the hot seasons of the yeare profitable for them that haue hot, dry and cholerick stomacks, especially if the head thereof be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1906:50"/>
taken away, because it greatly cooleth and extinguisheth the raging heat and acrimonie of choler. But you must <note place="margin">Cautions to be obserued vpon the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of milke.</note> absteine after the drinking of milke, from other meats or drinks, or any violent stirring of the bodie (all which will cause it quickly to corrupt or coagulate in the stomacke) vntill it shall be digested in the stomacke, which in an houres space may be well effected, Neither may you sleep within an houre after the taking of it, because it will make the head heauy by repleating it with vapors. And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shall vse to drinke milke, because that it is hurtfull to the gummes and teeth; for the one it maketh flaccide, and the other subiect to putrefaction; must haue speciall regard to wash his mouth presently after the drinking of it, with wine, or strong beere, and also to rub the teeth and gums with a dry cloth, for the clensing away the sliminesse of the milke, and for strengthning the gummes and teeth.</p>
               <p>But of milke, there is great difference according to the kindes of it. Cowes milke for sound and healthfull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of milke according to the kinds of it.</note> is best, for it is fattest and thickest, and consequently. of most nourishment: next vnto it, for grossenes, is sheeps milke. But for bodies that are with long sicknes extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or are in a consumption, womans milke is best, because it is most familiar vnto mans bodie, and euen of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And next vnto it is Goates milke, because it is of meane consistence, for it is not so fat and thicke as Cowes milke, and therefore breedeth not obstructions in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals as that doth; nor so thin as Asses milke, which also in consumptions is much commended: wherefore the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment which it maketh is of a middle nature betweene them both. But Asses milke appertaineth rather vnto physicke then vnto meat, for it is of a thin and watrish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, of a penetrating, cooling and detersiue facultie, by reason whereof, it is of singular efficacie in consumptions. of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Milke, notwithstanding that it seemeth to be wholy of one substance, yet it is compact of three seuerall parts, of <note place="margin">Milke consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of three seuerall parts, Creame.</note> Creame, Curds, and Whey, The first is the very head or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1906:50"/>
flower of the milke: it is of a temperate qualitie, hot and moyst in the first degree; it is pleasant to the pallate, and very good for the asperitie and siccitie of the stomacke; but it is somewhat of a grosse nourishment, and by reason of the vnctuositie of it, quickly cloyeth the stomacke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxeth and weakneth the retentiue facultie thereof, and is easily conuerteted into phlegme, and vaporous fumes. Wherefore it is hurtfull to them that be phlegmaticke, that haue weake stomacks, to olde men, and such as are subiect vnto rheumes, especially in the cold and moyst sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the yeare; but vnto hot cholericke bodies, and young men that haue strong stomacks, it is (especially in the hot seasons of the yeare) no lesse conuenient then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome: and verily with strawberries and sugar, it is for them, for whom it is conuenient, a very delicate and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some dish. And whosoeuer he be that delighteth to eat a dish of creame, let him not be parsimonious of sugar, for that is the best correctorie for it.</p>
               <p>Butter that is made thereof is of like temperature, it is <note place="margin">Butter,</note> of a moystning, mollifying, maturatiue, and resolutiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie: if it be fresh and new, and well tasted, it is very wholesome, especially in the mornings fasting, for hot and dry bodies: it giueth a light and dissipable nourishment; it is good for the asperitie and siccitie of the throat, and for a dry cough. But the too much vse thereof weakneth the stomacke, and causeth the same to abound with a crude phlegmaticall humor. Wherefore the much vse of it, is not good for them that be phlegmaticke; but for such, salt butter is more conuenient, because it is lesse phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke.</p>
               <p>The cruddie part of the milke is of an heauy, grosse, and phlegmaticke substance, and of the like nature is Cheese; <note place="margin">Cheese,</note> for it is of hard digestion, and ingendreth ill humors and oppilations. And although it be the propertie of all Cheese to breed grosse and oppilating humors; yet it altereth much according to the newnes or oldnes of it. For that which is new, is of a cold, moyst, grosse, and flateous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1906:51"/>
wherefore for an hot and cholericke stomacke it is somewhat profitable; but for them that be phlegmatick or haue cold stomacks, it is greatly hurtfull. Olde hard Cheese is altogither vnwholesome, for it is of very hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, troublesome to the stomacke, breedeth choler ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult, maketh the belly costiue, and is infinitely hurtfull vnto hot and dry bodies. Both sorts doe very greatly breed the collicke, yliacke, and nephriticke passions. But that which is a meane betwixt both, so that it haue also all the other properties of good Cheese, and especially that it be not tart of the rennet, is far wholsomer; for it is more pleasant to the pallate, more acceptable to the stomack, and maketh a durable and meetly good nourishment; yet the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and too much vse of it, breedeth obstructions, and is offensiue to a weake stomacke. Wherefore it behooueth him that loueth Cheese and his health too, to be mindfull of that prouerbiall versicle: <hi>Caseus est sanus, quem dat auara manus.</hi> Cheese is best for them that lead a studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or generous course of life, to be eaten after other meat, and that in litle quantitie; for being thus vsed, it bringeth two commodities. First, it taketh away satietie, &amp; strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the stomacke, by shutting vp the orifice thereof. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">Two commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Cheese after mest.</note> it preuenteth the floting of the meat, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindereth and disturbeth the concoction, by depressing it into the bottome of the stomacke, which is the cheife place of digestion. Rosted cheese is more meete to entise a mouse, or rat into a trap, then to be receiued into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; for it corrupteth the meats in the stomack, breedeth adust cholericke humors, and sendeth vp from the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke putrid vapors, and noysome fumes, which greatly offend the head and corrupt the breath. To conclude, the much eating of Cheese is onely conuenient for rustick people, and such as haue very strong stomacks, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vse great exercise.</p>

and euacuateth choler &amp; melancholie by stoole: &amp; therfore the liberall vse of it, especially well clarified, is very profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in feuers proceeding of choler. The drinking of a large draught of whey mornings fasting, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of May vnto the end of August, is for all cholericke and melancholike bodies most wholsome, for it qualifieth the heat of the stomacke and liuer, bringeth the bodie to a good temperature, abstergeth obstructiue humours in the stomacke and mesaraicke veines, mundisieth the bowels, and maketh the belly soluble: white whey, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by pressing of the curds together, is not so thin and waterish as the former, and therefore not so laxatiue: it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a cold and moyst nourishment, very profitable vnto cholericke and dry bodies; but hurtfull to the phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke. The like may be sayd of the whey that commeth in the making of butter, commonly called butter-milke, which if it bee vsed when itis growen a little sowre, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently represseth the sharpnesse of choler, and is very good for cholericke fluxes. Of milke there are also diuers sorts of meats made, which in a common appellation are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med white-meats: they are all, more or lesse, of a crude, grosse, and obstructiue faculty, breeding winde, fleame, <note place="margin">White-meats.</note> and obstructions, especially of the breast: they are conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for young men, for them that are by constitution cholericke, and that haue hot and strong stomacks; but to old men, to them that be phlegmaticke and subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rheumes, they are very hurtfull: they are more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and lesse offensiue, if they bee well seasoned with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and spice; &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But of all the sorts of white-meats, that which is made <note place="margin">Frumentie.</note> of wheat decorticaced, and boyled in milke, commonly called Frumentie, giueth the most and strongest nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it is somewhat hard of concoction, and of very slow distribution, by reason whereof it causeth windinesse and obstructions. Wherefore it is not a conuenient meat for them that haue weake stomacks, and such as liue at rest, or are subiect to obstructions, either of the bowels or reins.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1906:52"/>
But for those that vse great labours, and that haue strong stomacks, it is very profitable. And being strained, and spiced with cynamon, it is a very good medicinable meat, for such as are too laxatiue, and subiect to fluxes and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of the bellie, proceeding of choller: for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth the acrimonie of the cholericke humour, and through the slow descension of it, abateth the flux.</p>
               <p>There is also the like kinde of pottage, and much like-likewise <note place="margin">Rice-milke.</note> of the same nature, made of Rice accurately <note n="*" place="margin">For there is in the pill or barke of Rice, a causticke or burning qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the body.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilated and boyled in milk; but it is of easier concoction, lesse obstructiue, and of better nourishment. Being well made and spiced with sugar and cynamon, it is a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate meat, very pleasant, easie of digestion, and restoratiue.</p>
               <p>There are also other kindes of food made with Rice, all which are somewhat of hard concoction, and of an astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent facultie.

But in them that are past their constant age (except they shall be impensiuely cholericke) and that haue cold stomacks, it breedeth winde, phlegme, rheumes, and obstructions, especially of the breast: and therefore in no wise to be allowed to the aged or phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke.

               <p>The best and most common of all sauces is salt, which is so necessarie for seasoning and preseruing of meats, that we cannot well liue without it, and therefore it hath beene a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1906:53"/>
good obserued custome, to set it first on the table with bread, and with the same to take it last away. Salt is hot in the second degree, and dry in the third: it is of a clensing, digesting, attenuating, drying, consuming, and somewhat also of an astringent faculty. Well therefore may salt haue the first and cheefest place among sauces, for beside that, it maketh the meat sauoury and acceptable to the stomacke, and exciteth the appetite, by corrugating the mouth of the stomacke, and titillating the pallate, it also cutteth and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuateth grosse and clammy humours, preuenteteth and correcteth putrefaction, by drying and consuming all crude and moyst superfluities, confirmeth weake and loose parts, and helpeth the concoction, especially in a cold and moyst stomacke. But the too much vse of salt, <note place="margin">The discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the too much vse of salt.</note> by reason that it is hot and dry, of a sharp biting taste, and drieth vp and consumeth all the humours of the bodie, is very hurtfull, especially vnto dry and leane bodies: for it annoyeth the stomacke, exiccateth the liuer, adureth the bloud, dimmeth the sight, diminisheth the geniture and spirits, causeth itch and scabbinesse, and in a word, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and spoyleth the habit of the whole bodie, making it soone old, riueled, and deformed.</p>
               <p>Vinegar is the second sort of sauce, which is in common <note place="margin">Vinegar.</note> vse: it is iudged with a generall consent, to bee dry in the second degree; but concerning the other qualities, there is great variance: for some attribute vnto it a cold quality, because it cooleth and represseth heat, and some an hot, which may also be easily prooued; but in my iudgement, it is more cold then hot, and so much the colder, as it is made of the smaller wine. It prouoketh appetite, as salt doth, it vehemently penetrateth, cutteth, and attenuateth grosse humours, by reason of the sharp tenuitie of it, it strongly preserueth the humours from putrefaction, by reason of the cooling and drying qualitie of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vse of it, in time of pestilence, is very profitable. It also helpeth the soft and rheumaticke swellings of the gums. It agreeth best with the cholericke, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1906:53"/>
their choler, and worst with the melancholike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it encreaseth their distemperature. The much vse <note place="margin">The discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much vse of vinegar.</note> thereofis, by reason of the cooling, drying, and also mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant qualitie of it, which it hath, by reason of some heat, which it still reserueth of the wine, very hurtfull to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, liuer, lungs, intestines, matrice, and sinewes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aduise women, and them that are leane, that haue cold stomacks, weake lungs, and feeble sinewes, carefully to eschew the much and often vse of it. And aboue all, I with Maydens to forbeare the drinking of vinegar, or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sops or tosts dipped therein, to make them leane and low-coloured, lest that by ouer-pearcing, cooling, and drying their liuer, they acquire a big belly (I meane a drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) with a leane &amp; ill-fauoured face. Vinegar that is made of White wine is more opening, and that which is made of Claret more binding: wherefore White wine Vinegar is generally to be preferred, and it is also much the better for the stomacke and spirits, if it bee rubefied, by maccrating the leaues of red roses in it; but for them that haue loose <note place="margin">Rose-vinegar.</note> stomacks, Claret-wine-vinegar is most accommodate. The often or much vse of vinegar is greatly hurtfull to them that are of a melancholike temperature, and to all such as are subiect to the Gout, the Palsie, or other affects of the sinewes.</p>
               <p>Verjuce which is made of soure or vnripe grapes, or of <note place="margin">Verjuce.</note> crabs, or other vnripe soure apples, is like to vinegar in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, sauing that it is of a more cooling nature, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more agreeable for hot and cholericke bodies. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth an hot stomack and liuer, represseth cholericke fumes, and raiseth vp the appetite, deiected through much heat, labour, or exercise: wherefore it is very profitable for hot and cholericke bodies to be vsed in way of sauce, and for hot and cholericke diseases, in way of medicine; but it is hurtfull to the aged, and to all cold and phlegmaticke bodies. Eisell, or the vinegar which is made of Cyder, is also a good sauce: it is of a very penetrating nature, and is like to Verjuce in operation; but it is not so astringent, nor altogether so cold.</p>

Mustard is a sauce in common vse with sundry meats, <note place="margin">Mustard.</note> both flesh and fish, especially those of the grosser sort. It is hot in the fourth degree, and is of a dissoluing, attracting, extenuating, and dissipating faculty. It very strongly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the stomacke, cutteth, extenuateth, and scattereth grosse and phlegmaticke humours, openeth the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the breast, helpeth the concoction and distribution of meats of grosse substance, comforteth the stomack, and drieth vp and consumeth the superfluous moysture in it. Moreouer, it vehemently pearceth the braine, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully purgeth it from superfluities: and therefore the vse of it is very profitable for them that bee subiect vnto cold diseases of the head and sinewes, as the Epilepsie, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie and Palsie: for it openeth the passages, and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth and consumeth the humours oppilating the nerues: wherefore, as it is a good sauce, so is it also very medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is a most wholsome sauce for them that bee phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, and that haue cold and moyst stomacks, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a cold and moyst season; but the often and much vse thereof is hurtfull vnto cholericke and dry bodies.</p>
               <p>Orenges differ in their temperature, according to the <note place="margin">Orenges.</note> sweetnesse or sourenesse of their iuyce: for the sourer the iuyce is, the colder it is, and the more penetrating; but yet with the greater astriction following: and the sweeter it is, the more hot and lesse penetrating, without any or little astriction concurring. The sweet Orenges are not fit for sauce, because they subuert the appetite, and cause loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse in the stomacke; yet to such as are of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike temperature, they are, by reason of their tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat and sweetnesse, somewhat profitable. The soure Orenges are cold and dry in the second degree: they quench thirst, excite the appetite, and represse cholericke vomitings: they coarctate the breast, and astringe the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which are two pernicious properties: wherefore they are greatly hurtfull to the phlegmatick and melancholike, and them that are straight chested. But sugar correcteth their aciditie, and bringeth them to a better temperament.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1906:55"/>
They are conuenient for hot &amp; dry bodies, so they be not affected with coarctation of the breast, or astriction of the belly. Those that are of a meanetaste betweene both, that is neither too sowre, nor too sweet, are cold in the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and temperately dry: they are best for sauce, because they are more acceptable to the taste, and more profitable to the stomacke. They are profitable in feuers, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish thirst, and inhibit the putrefaction of the humors. Orenges sliced and sopped in Rose-water and sugar, are very good to coole and refresh the stomacke in feuers, and so they are also at other times, for an hot and cholericke stomacke; the pulpe, or medullary substance of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge is not good to bee eaten, except of them that haue very hot and cholericke stomacks, but the iuyce onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it breedeth a crude and ill iuyce, and is not easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested. Therindes of Orenges are hot in the first degree, and dry in the second, being preserued in sugar, and taken in small quantity after meat, they very greatly comfort a weake stomacke.</p>
               <p>Limmons are like in nature vnto Orenges, sauing that as <note place="margin">Limmons.</note> they are sourer, so are they colder &amp; ore pearcing: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iuyce of them hath an admirable force, of cutting, penetrating, extenuating, and cooling: it stirrtth vp the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, comforteth the stomacke, restraineth vomiting, and is therefore very good for them that haue nauseatiue sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks. It mightily cutteth and attenuateth grosse humors, asswageth thirst, mitigateth the sharpnesse of choler, and inhibiteth the encrease of it. It also excellently cooleth and refresheth an hot liuer, corroborateth the heart, and is of singular efficacie against acute and malignant feuers, for it defendeth the humours from putrefaction, and correcteth those that are putrified. There is not so pleasant a sauce to be found as this of the Limmon, and it giueth a grace to all other sauces: it is sourer then vinegar, more cooling and more pearcing, free from any acrimonious or mordicant quality, and therefore more delectable, and more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some then it. It is for hot and cholerick stomacks, the best
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1906:56"/>
sauce, and against the vehemencie of choler there is not a better medicine; for it mightily represseth, and extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the feruent heat of it. It is hurtfull to them that be phlegmatick, and also to the aged, except choler shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to domineire in their stomacks.</p>
               <p>The Citron is like in nature to the Limmon; but it is thought to haue a more speciall propertie, against malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <note place="margin">Citrons.</note> and pestilentiall feuers, and to comfort the heart. The rindes, and also the white pulpe of Citrons, and Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preserued, doe comfort the stomacke, helpe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, corroborate the heart, and are very good against melancholy.</p>
               <p>Oliues, if they be ripe, are temperately hot, they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with salt, of the inhabitants where they grow; but they <note place="margin">Oliues.</note> are neither good for sawce, nor for meate, for they weaken the stomacke, and breed a putrible and vnwholsome nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment. But the greene and vnripe Oliues are cold and dry, of an astringent facultie, and these are the Oliues, which are vsually eaten with meate to excite the appetite. They are gathered while they be greene, preserued in pickle, and so transported. They excite the appetite, clense phlegme from the stomacke, corroborate the mouth of it, and stay vomiting; but they are hardly digested, excite thirst, breed grosse and melancholicke humors, and being abundantly eaten, they cause headach and make the belly cosliue, especially those that are preserued onely in salt: wherefore they are not so wholsome a sawce as they are esleemed. They are preserued onely in salt or in a pickle of salt and vinegar. Those that are preserued in salt, are hotter then the other, for they are hot in the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and of greater force in clensing of phlegme from the stomacke: and therefore they are best for them that be phlegmaticke; and worst for the cholericke. But those that are preserued in a pickle of vinegar and salt are of a more temperate nature; they represse choler, and stay vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting more then the other doe, and are conuenient for euery age and constitution, especially for the cholericke,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1906:56"/>
and therefore they are to be preferred before them. But which way socuer they are preserued, the greene or gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Oliues are to be chosen, and the yellowish or blackish rejected as abhominable for sawce or meate: for the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ones were too ripe before they were gathered, and the blackish are putrified. The salt liquor or pickle, wherein they are preserued, is an excellent remedie against sof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Capers are very necessarie for the preseruation of health: they are preserued in vinegar, or in salt, or in a pickle or <note place="margin">Capers.</note> brine made of them both, which is the best way: Being thus preserued, they are hot in the first degree, and dry in the second: they are of an abstersiue and opening facultie, they giuevery litle nourishment; but they excite the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, notably clense away phlegme adhering to the stomack and guts, kill wormes of the belly, and open the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the liuer, but especially of the melt: wherefore the often vse of them with meat is very profitable to phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke and melancholicke bodies, to such as haue moyst and waterish stomacks, that are short breathed, that haue hard and ill spleenes, and subiect vnto quartaine feuers. Before they be vsed, the salt must be washed off cleane from them, and they a litle while steeped in cleane water, and after that eaten (as other sallads be) with vinegar, and oyle also if it shall like the eater; or if they be eaten with Oximell, they will not onely be the more acceptable to the taste, but more effectuall also for the purposes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>The young tender buds of Broome are in the spring <note place="margin">Buds of Broome.</note> time gathered and preserued in pickle, in the same manner as Capersare: they excite the appetite, and open the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the melt and liuer no lesse then Capers doe, and are also very profitable in obstructions of the kidneys: wherefore they may well be vsed with meate as Capers are.</p>

eaten with meats: it is a very pleasant and familiar sauce, well agreeing with mans bodie. It is hot and dry, of an abstersiue and diureticke facultie: it exciteth the appetite, comforteth the stomacke, openeth the obstructions of the liuer, melt, and especially of the kidneys and bladder, by prouoking vrine: wherefore it is a necessarie sauce, for them that are subiect to the stone, and conuenient for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age and constitution of bodie.</p>
               <p>Radish is also vsed as sauce with meats, but it is a very hard one, and vnwholsome: it is hot and dry, and of an <note place="margin">Radish.</note> extenuating facultie. Those that are very tart in taste, are hot in the third degree, and dry in the second. They are accounted the best, that are cleare, tender, and tart in taste, and so they are, because they are of easier concoction, and doe more delight the pallate. Some Physitions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the eating of Radishes before meat, because they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the appetite; and some after meate, because (as they say) they helpe the concoction by depressing the meats; <note place="margin">Radish neither good before meat, nor after meat, nor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with meat.</note> but I constantly affirme, howsoeuer they oblectate the pallate, depresse the meats, or excite the appetite, that they are neither good before meat, nor after meat, nor togither with meat. They are not good to be eaten before meate, for because that they are with much difficultie digested, and make long stay in the stomacke, they hinder both the descension and concoction of the meat that is taken after them, and are also the cause of stinking belchings, which are far greater hurts, then the exciting of the appetite is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. Neither are they good to be eaten after meate, for by reason of the hardnes of their substance, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppresse the stomacke, then any way helpe the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, breed windinesse, and cause noysome belchings, yea though they be taken (euen as we doe cheese) in small quantitie. But our vsuall manner in England is to eat them togither with meat as a sawce, which is the worst way of all; for being in such manner taken, they greatly oppresse the stomacke, ingender raw humors, &amp; aboundance of winde, cause loathsomnes, disturbe and hinder the concoction
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1906:57"/>
of the meate that is taken with them, raise vp noysome fumes and most offensiue belchings, which are very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the eyes and head. Wherefore I conclude, that they are vnwholesome any way to be eaten (especially for them that haue weake stomacks) except for them that be pallate-pleasers, and that they are onely good to be vsed in the way of physicke: for they heat, cut, and attenuate grosse humors, prouoke vrine, and procure vomiting. And verily this their heating, cutting, attenuating and vomitorie <note place="margin">Why Radishes breed much windinesse &amp; belchings.</note> facultie, is the principall cause, by working vpon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and meate in the stomacke, that they breake, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breed and raise vp so much winde, and auoide it by belchings.</p>

It is very profitable for such as be asthmaticke or short breathed, and that are subiect vnto rheumes, so that they be not of a cholericke consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, because it doth notably clense and mundifie the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1906:58"/>
breast, and lungs, of phlegmaticke and rheumaticke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. Wherefore I wish all such as are of a phlegmatick <note place="margin">The eating of Honie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings fasting very profitable for phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick bodies,</note> constitution, to accustome the eating of honie mornings fasting, and to walke an houre after it; but it must not be immoderately taken, for, not withstanding that it is of a clensing and opening facultie; yet for all that, if it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in too large a quantitie, it will obstruct and cloy the stomacke, because it consisteth of a grosse substance. But the vse of honie is hurtfull to them that are of hot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, because it inflameth the bloud, and is quickly (by <note place="margin">Honie for whom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome.</note> reason of the acrimonie of it) conuerted into choler; it is also hurtfull to such as abound with winde, especially the crude and vnclarified honie, because there is in it a windie and excrementall moysture. The way to clarifie it, is to put vnto it a litle water, and so to boyle it and scum it so <note place="margin">Clarified Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note> long as any froth ariseth: for by this meanes the tartnesse and flatulent moysture of it, is for the most part taken away, and consequently becommeth a more wholesome medicinable nourishment. That is the best honie, which is hard in the vessell and curded like sugar, and which is <note place="margin">Notes of the best Honie.</note> also of a true and delectable sweetnes, of good smell, and of a cleare yellowish colour; or if it shall be of a whitish colour, so that none of the said notes of goodnesse be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in it, it is neuer the worse.

And here it may be demanded whether Sugar or Honie be the better? Wherevnto I answer, that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <note place="margin">Whether Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar be whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer then Honie.</note> is generally more wholsome then Honie: for it is of a better temperature, of pleasanter taste, not so fulsome as Honie, and therefore more acceptable to the stomack, and consequently farre better for sauce, and nourishment. It may be giuen in feuers, because it doth not inflame the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1906:58"/>
bodie, nor so soone turne into choler as honie doth; and to conclude all in a word, Sugar agreeth with all ages, and all complexions; but contrariwise Honie anoyeth many, especially those that are cholerick, or full of winde in their bodies. Onely Honie is better for them that haue very cold and moyst stomacks, and that haue their breasts stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with phlegme. Water and fine Sugar onely brewed togither, is very good for hot, cholericke, and dry bodies, that are affected with phlegme in their breast: for through the coldnes and moysture of it, it excellently tempereth the heate and siccitie of the breast and stomack, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them of phlegme. Sugar by how much the whiter it is, by so much the purer and wholsomer it is, which is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the making and refining of it. It is made much after the same manner and forme as white salt is. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is nothing else but the iuyce of certaine Canes or Reedes, which is extracted by boyling them in water, euen after the same manner and fashion as they doe Salt. This first extracted Sugar is grosse, and of red colour: it is hot and dry, somewhat tart in taste, and of a detersiue facultie: by longer boyling, it becommeth hard, which we call Red Sugar Candie, which is only good in glysters, for to clense and irritate the expulsiue facultie. This grosse reddish <note place="margin">Red Sugar Candie.</note> Sugar is againe mixed with water, and boyled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be of an whitish colour, lesse hot, more moyst, and more acceptable to the taste and stomacke. This kinde of second Sugar, we call common or kitchin Sugar. This being the third time diluted, and decocted, is of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temperament, most white, and of a singular pleasant taste: this is the best, purest, and wholsomest Sugar, which giueth a grace vnto whatsoeuer it be mixed. And this by <note place="margin">The best Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</note> rather boyling becommeth hard, and of a resplendent white colour, which we commonly call White Sugar Candie: this is the best Sugar for diseases of the breast, <note place="margin">White Sugar Candie.</note> for it is not altogither so hot as the other Sugar, and is also somewhat of a more pure and subtile moysture. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it excellently asswageth and moystneth the asperitie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1906:59"/>
and siccitie of the tongue, mouth, throat, and winde-pipe; and is very good for a dry cough, and other infirmities of the lungs: it is most accommodate for all hot and dry constitutions.</p>
               <p>There are diuers kinds of mixt sauces deuised &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">Compound sauces.</note> by the skill of Cookes, to oblectate the pallate and throat, to excite the appetite, and to adde a grace vnto bad meats, which of ingurgitating belly-gods are greatly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

By reason of the tenuitie of its substance, it must be but grossely beaten, that the heat thereof may longer continue and operate in the stomacke: for being smally beaten, it will make lesser stay in the stomacke, and mesaraick veines, and by reason of the penetrating force of it, sooner ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat and dry the liuer, prouoke vrine, in flame the bloud, and the reines.

But to the phlegmatick, and such as haue crude stomacks, all raw fruits, especially those that abound with moysture, are greatly hurtfull, as heereafter shall bee particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>
               <p>And here, before I begin to discourse of alimentary sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I will aduertise the Reader somwhat, for his better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, concerning the fouredegrees of qualities, that <note place="margin">Foure degrees in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> Physicians constitute and define to be in Simples: as those are sayd to be hot or cold, &amp;c. in the first degree, that alter a temperate bodie; yet if they be hot or cold, &amp;c. but in the beginning of the degree (for euery degree hath so ample a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1906:62"/>
latitude, that in euery one we constitute three stations, and therefore of those things that are in the first degree, some are sayd to be in the beginning of the degree, some in the middle, and some in the end) they doe not so euidently alter, but that some consideratiue examination is needfull for discerning of the alteration. In the second degree are those that doe so manifestly alter, as that there is no more neede of examination, or coniecture, for vnderstanding of the alteration: &amp; of this sort are hony &amp; figs for heat, and lettuce for coldnesse and moystnesse, &amp;c. Of the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are those that doe strongly alter, as Hyssop, Time, Cloues, Sacke, if it bee not new: and in the same degree you shall finde Time to exceede Hyssop in heat. Of the fourth degree are those, that doe very greatly and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently alter, such as in heating, are of a burning force, and in cooling of a stupefying. Wherefore that may bee sayd to be hot or cold, &amp;c. in the first degree, which is but slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly perceiued of the gustatiue sense: that in the second, which is very manifestly perceiued: that in the third, which is so strongly perceiued, as that it somewhat offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the sense: and that in the fourth, which very greatly affecteth and annoyeth both the sence and bodie. And thus much concerning the vnderstanding of the foure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the primary qualities of Simples. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that all fruits, roots, and hearbes, haue for the most part some medicinable facultie, and are also oftentimes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue vnto man, because they engender crude, grosse, and flatulent humours, I will particularly write of such as be in vse among vs in <hi>England,</hi> declaring their hurtfull qualities with their good, and how they may be rightly vsed, and of whom, with most profit, and least hurt: And first of all of Apples, because of all fruits they are most plentifull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs.</p>
               <p>Apples are of a cold and moyst temperature, abounding <note place="margin">Apples.</note> with a superfluous, crude, and windie moysture: yet more, or lesse, according to the different kindes of them: for there are many and sundry sorts of Apples, whose diuers
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1906:62"/>
natures and faculties, may by the difference of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and taste bee best knowne and described. For those apples that are of a solid substance, giue a more plentifull and durable nourishment; but they are more hardly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and more slowly distributed. Those that are of a soft substance, are easily digested, and distributed; but they giue a thin, waterish, and excrementall nourishment. But those that are of a mixt substance, that is, neither too hard, nor too soft, are both for concoction, and also for nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the best. Now, as concerning the taste: some apples are sweet, some soure, some of a middle taste, both sweet and soure. The sweet apples are not so cold as the other be, but are rather hot in the first degree: wherfore they yeeld more nourishment then other apples doe, and the same not so moyst; but they are not so pleasant to the taste, nor so acceptable to the stomacke. The soure apples are cooling, and therefore they yeeld little nourishment, and the same cold and crude; but the raw iuyce of them, by reason that it is of a cooling, cutting, and penetrating faculty, with some small astriction also adioyning, is good for an hot cholericke stomacke, because it mightily represseth the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent acrimonie of choler. But those apples that bee of a middle taste, that is, such as are both sweet and soure, are for pleasantnesse of taste, acceptablenesse to the stomacke, goodnesse of iuyce, and wholsomnesse of nourishment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side their medicinable quality against melancholie, and melancholike affects, the best and wholsomest: for they attemper the siccity of that humour, and corroborate the heart by their comfortable sauour, and the stomacke, by their light astrictory faculty. Such are our Queene-apples and Russelings, as the principallest, and next our Rosiars, Pearemaines and Pippins, Deusans, &amp;c. There are also some Apples that are insipid, or without taste: they are of a waterish substance, altogether vnpleasant to the stomack, and vnprofitable for meat. All apples generally are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome in the regiment of health, to bee eaten raw, or before they be full ripe, or soone after they be gathered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1906:63"/>
of them that haue hot cholericke stomacks, because they engender crude, waterish, and flatulent humors; but if they bee baked, or rosted, by reason that their flatuous cruditie is by the heat consumed, they become more dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, more wholsome, more pleasant to the taste, and more acceptable to the stomacke. Apples may bee eaten raw with least detriment in the winter, and all the yeere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, according to the durablenesse of them (for they doe soonest rot, that are of soft substance, by reason that <note place="margin">Why some apples putrifie sooner then other?</note> they haue greatest store of moysture, and those are longer kept which are of harder substance, because there is in them lesse store of moysture: for the aboundance of excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall moysture is the cause why they putrifie) because by that time they lose much of their waterish and excrementall moysture. And they are best to bee eaten last after meat, because they confirme the stomacke, make good digestion, especially in a cholericke stomacke. And they are also good to bee eaten at going to bed, of them that haue hot and cholericke stomacks, or that are distempered by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much wine, or other strong drinke, because they coole the stomacke, and represse the vapours that ascend to the head. Wherefore I conclude, that apples are most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for young men, for them that be cholericke, and that haue hot strong stomacks; but to old men, to them that be phlegmaticke, that haue cold and weake stomacks, and that are subiect to aches of the sinewes and ioynts, they are very hurtfull, especially if they be eaten raw.</p>
               <p>Peares are much of the nature of Apples, and of the <note place="margin">Peares.</note> same temperature; but they are somewhat of a binding qualitv, especially those that be of an harsh and soure taste. The difference of them must be discerned by their taste and substance, euen as of Apples. Those are the best, which are of a pleasánt soure sweet taste: for they comfort the heart, the stomacke, and asswage thirst. Peares make a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish and corrupt bloud, and engender the windie collick: wherefore they are very hurtfull to the aged, to them that be phlegmatick, that haue colst stomacks, and that are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the windie collick; but they are wholsome enough,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1906:63"/>
or at leastwise lesse hurtfull for hot, dry and cholericke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, especially if they eat them not immoderately. They are most hurtfull to bee eaten before meat, because they binde the belly, especially those that bee somewhat soure, and fill the stomacke with crude and flatulent humours. They are best to bee eaten after meat, because they fortifie the digestion, represse the ascending of superfluous vapors to the head, by strengthning and shutting vp the mouth of the stomacke, and by reason of their compressiue faculty, being eaten after meat, they make the belly soluble, and helpe the subduction of excrements. Baked Peares are much wholsomer then raw, and more agreeable to euery age and constitution, especially to the phlegmaticke: they are acceptable to the taste and stomacke, easily digested, and giue a good and wholsome nutriment.</p>

Some Pomegranets are sweet, some soure, and some of a middle sauour, both sweet and soure. The sweet ones are not cold as the rest, but rather hot in the first degree, and temperately moyst: they clense the mouth of the stomacke, moysten the breast and spirituall parts, and make the belly soluble; but they breede winde, and in a cholerick stomacke, they are quickly conuerted into cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.

By reason of their acerbitie, they are soone offen siue to the sinewes, teeth, and gummes; but the sourenes of them is well mitigated with sugar, or the soure may be eaten togither with the sweet, for so the one doth correct the hurts of the other.

The sweet Plums doe giue more nourishment then the rest, and doe more loose the belly; but by reason of their ouer-much moysture (for they are completely moyst in the third degree) they relaxe and weaken the stomacke, and for the same reason also the nourishment which they yeeld is nothing good at all, but excrementall. They are most hurtfull to them that be phlegmatick, and are only conuenient for those that would moysten and keepe their bodies soluble; for by their excessiue moysture and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinesse, they doe moysten the bodie, and mollifie the belly. But they must be eaten before meales, or when the stomacke is empty; for if they be eaten after meales, as our manner is to eat them, or before that the meat is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the stomacke, they spoyle the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fill vp the stomacke with crude and corruptible humors.</p>

The iuyce of them, especially of Sloes boyled with a small quantitie of Sugar, and so kept, is of excellent efficacie for stopping of the laske and bloudy flixe, and all other issues of bloud whatsoeuer. The Plums that are of a middle rellish, such as are our Damsons &amp;c. are the best <note place="margin">Damsons.</note> and wholsomest: they are cold and moyst in the second degree, they are more acceptable to the taste and stomack, and yeeld (although little, yet) better nourishment then the rest: they excite the appetite, quench thirst, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse choler, and somewhat also loose the belly: they must also be eaten before meales, or when the stomacke is empty. These, as also all other sorts of Plums, are best for them that are young, that are by constitution cholerick, and that haue hot and strong stomacks; but to them that are olde, that are phlegmaticke, that haue weake and cold stomacks, and that are subiect to the winde collicke, they are very hurtfull, because they breede waterish and flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humors.

As they are diuers in taste, so are they also in qualitie: for sweet Grapes are hot in the first degree, and moyst in the second: they nourish most, and most of all make the bodie soluble; but the nourishment which commeth of them is ouer-moyst and windie, which troubleth the belly, and puffeth vp the whole bodie. Soure Grapes are cold and moyst, they quench thirst, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily extinguish the ouer much heate of the stomacke and liuer, represse the sharpnesse of choler, and cholericke vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, excite the appetite, and strengthen the stomacke that is weakned through the distemperance of choler. They are hurtfull to euery age and constitution, except to them that are young, and of an hot and cholericke temperature. The Grapes that are harsh in taste, either by nature, or (as all Grapes are of what sort soeuer) before they be ripe, are very cold and astringent: the iuyce of them is onely profitable in the way of physicke to coole, and to represse cholericke vomitings and egestions. Those Grapes that are of a soure sweet taste, are for temperature and facultie in a meane betweene the soure and the sweet: they excite the appetite, coole the heat of the stomack and liuer, quench thirst, represse the heat of choler, and excrete it thorow the belly. But all Grapes that are newly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and eaten raw, doe yeeld vnto the bodie an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyst and excrementall nourishment, they trouble the belly, fill the stomacke with winde, and inflate the melt, especially if they be immoderately eaten. But of all the sorts of Grapes, the soure and austere in taste are for meat the worst: for such kinde of Grapes doe very much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the concoction of the stomacke, and engender a cold and raw iuyce, which is seldome or neuer conuerted into good bloud. The sweet Grapes, and such also as are a little soure, being thorow ripe, are lesse hurtfull: for their iuyce is hotter, and is easilier dispersed through the liuer, and veines. And if they be kept two or three dayes after they be gathered, and then eaten, they doe nourish the

better, and are the lesse windie, and troublesome to the belly, by reason that some part of their superfluous moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture is in that space consumed. But in the eating of Grapes this Caution must be obserued, that neither the skins, nor the kernels or stones in them be swallowed <note place="margin">A caution concerning the eating of Grapes.</note> downe, but onely the succulent pulpe, because they are vnprofitable to the bodie: for by reason of their duritie and siccitie of substance, they offend the stomack, receiue no alteration in the bodie at all, or very litle, and also hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the concoction and distribution of the medulline part of the Grape thorow the bodie, which is only nourishing. It is best earing of them when the stomacke is empty, and not after meat; for if they be eaten vpon a full stomacke, they spoyle the concoction, abundantly breedewinde, and fill vp the stomacke with crude and corruptible humors. They are, so they be moderately eaten, conuenient for euery constitution and age, except for the phlegmaticke, and them that are olde; for in these they excessiuely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease cold, crude, and flatulent humors, which vitiate the bloud, cause rheumes, inflate the melt, and disturbe the belly. But Grapes boyled in butter, and sops of bread added thereto, and Sugar also, if they be somewhat soure, are a very pleasant meat, and agreable for euery age and constitution: for they are lesse windie, more acceptable to the stomacke, and yeeld more and better nourishment to the bodie.</p>

But some are farre more wholsome then other: the best principallest are those that are of a red colour, and and of a soure sweet taste, for they delight the pallate, excite the appetite, and are more acceptable to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: they doe moderately coole, quench thirst, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper the heat of the stomacke and liuer, represse choler, and giue to the body a more commendable iuyce. Being preserued, they are a most choyce medicinable nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and being boyled with butter, slices of bread and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar betweene two dishes, they delight the pallate, excite the appetite, and yeeld a good and wholsome nourishment, especially for hot and dry bodies. The distilled water of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1906:69"/>
these, and also of the soure ones, is very good in feuers and inward inflammations. The Cherries that bee very sweet, doe deiect the appetite, relax the stomacke, and engender grosse and phlegmaticke humours. Those that are soure, doe giue vnto the body no nourishment at all; but they excite the appetite, cut grosse and clammie humours in the stomacke, represse the heat of choler, and are onely good for an hot cholericke stomacke. Cherries must bee eaten fresh and newly gathered, because they quickly corrupt, and that not insteed of meat, but for quenching of thirst, and attempering the heat of the stomacke and liuer; and for the same purposes they must not be eaten after meales, as our common preposterous vse is to eat them; but when the stomacke is emptie, as an houre or two before meales, because they prowoke appetite, quickly descend from the stomacke, and make the belly soluble. They are conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them that are young, and for such as are of a chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick temperature; but hurtfull to the aged, and them that abound with phlegme.</p>
               <p>The greene and vnripe Goose berries are cold and dry <note place="margin">Goose-beries.</note> in the second degree, and of an astringent faculty: the iuyce of them is vsed in diuers sauces for meat, insteed of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juce, which maketh them not onely pleasant to the taste, but also very profitable to such as abound with choler, and are afflicted with hot, burning, and malignant feuers: for it extinguisheth the vehement heat of choler, verie greatly resisteth the corruption of humours, and labefaction of the vitall and naturall parts. The Goose-berries that are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently ripe, are cold in the first degree, and moyst in the second, &amp; are lesse binding, then when they are altogether greene and vnripe. They are of a pleasant soure taste, and therefore being boyled betweene two dishes, with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sops of bread and sugar, or as those that are skilfull in Cookerie can best tell, they make a most excellent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome sauce for most kindes of meats, which yeeldeth to the bodie somewhat a cold and small nourishment; but it exciteth the appetite, quencheth thirst, represseth choler,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1906:70"/>
and addeth a singular grace vnto the meats, and a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie relish also vnto such as are hot and dry, or fulsome in taste. Being eaten raw, they are very hurtfull to a cold and weake stomacke, and for them that are aged, because they encrease cold and crude humours: contrariwise they are profitable to an hot stomacke, because they excite the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite deiected by ouermuch heat, and greatly coole the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations both of the stomacke and liuer: they are also verie good for women with childe, because they helpe their picarie affections, and notably preserue them from abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if they are immoderately eaten, they exasperate and lode the stomacke, binde the belly, and inhibit all fluxes, except they happen to be taken into a cold stomack, for then they oftentimes rather oppresse and trouble the same by some manner of flux. To conclude, they are so much profitable to the cholericke and sanguine, as they are hurtfull to the melancholike and phlegmaticke. The Goose-berries that be throughly or ouer-ripe, are not, by reason of their fulsome sweetnesse, vsed in sauces, neither are they any way good to bee eaten, for they fill the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke and whole bodie with grosse, crude, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humours.</p>
               <p>Ribes, which with vs are commonly knowen by the name of Red Currants, are deemed to bee of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Ribes.</note> that Goose-berries are. Indeede there is a great parity of nature betweeene the ripe Ribes, and the Goose-berries that are a little ripe; but betweene the ripe Goose-berries, and the ripe Ribes, there is no comparison to bee made at all: for whereas the ripe Goose-berries consist of a very grosse and fulsome substance, the Ribes are of a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and profitable iuyce. They are cold in the first degree, and moyst in the second, with a little siccity also concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: they delight the pallate, excite the appetite, quench thirst, coole the inflammations of the stomacke and liuer, and wonderfully refresh and strengthen the stomacke, that is debilitated with heat: they also stay cholericke vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, helpe the Cardialgicke paines of the stomacke, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1906:70"/>
excellently represse all cholericke excretions and exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherefore they are very profitable for them that are young, and that are of an hot and cholericke temperature; but they are greatly hurtfull to the aged, to all cold consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and to such as are subiect to obstructions of the breast. The Rob, that is, the iuyce of the berries boyled with a third part, or somewhat more of sugar added vnto it, <note place="margin">The Rob of Ribes.</note> till it become thicke, and so preserued, is for all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd purposes preferred before the raw berries themselues, except for such as are of a very cholericke and ardent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</p>
               <p>Barberies are of the same nature and force that the Ribes are, and so is also the Conserue, or rather the Rob that is <note place="margin">Barberies.</note> made of them, which is in very common vse against hot, burning and cholericke distemperatures.</p>
               <p>Raspis or Framboise being ripe, are cold in the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <note place="margin">Raspis, or Framboise.</note> and temperately moyst with a small astriction adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, especially if they be not ouer-ripe: they are of good and laudable iuyce, they comfort a weake and queasie sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke; but not so well as the Strawberie doth, for they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes corrupt in the stomacke: they also quench thirst, asswage the inflammations of the throte, stomacke, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and coole the heat of vrine. They may bee eaten by themselues, or with White-wine, Claret, or Sacke; or if there be neede of cooling with Rose, or Violet-water and Sugar. They are good for them that are young, and for hot and dry bodies; but hurtfull to the phlegmaticke and aged, and all such as haue cold and weake stomacks.</p>
               <p>Stawberies are for pleasantnesse of taste, acceptablenesse <note place="margin">Strawberies.</note> to the stomacke, and goodnesse of iuyce, to bee preferred before the Framboise: being full ripe, they are cold and moyst in the first degree, with a little siccitie also adioyned. The great red garden Strawberies are the best and wholso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest: the nourishment which they yeeld, is little and thin, yet commendable and good. They are very delightsome to the taste, and acceptable to the stomacke: they excite the appetite, quench thirst, represse the ebullient acrimonie
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1906:71"/>
and fluxions of bloud and choler, and excellently coole the inflammations of the stomacke and liuer. Being eaten before they be full ripe, they are, by reason of their earthie substance, quickly offensiue to the stomacke. In case of cooling, they may be well eaten with Rose, Violet, or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage-water and sugar: otherwise, with White-wine, Claret, or Sacke and Sugar, as the temperature and disposition of the body shall require. The distilled water of them drunk with sugar, is very good for such as haue cholericke sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, or inflamed liuers, to be taken when the stomacke is empty: it is also good against the cardiacall passions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it reuiueth the spirits, and maketh the heart merry, and likewise against the obstructions of the kidneyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it prouoketh vrine, &amp; tempers the heat of the reines. These, as also the Framboise, are with vs very vsually eaten, with the fattest and best part of milke, and sugar, which way of eating them, is very fit and commendable for hot and cholericke bodies; but abundantly hurtfull for such as haue cold stomacks, and all that are by constitution phlegmaticke. There may also be made of Strawberies, a Conserue, or rather a Rob, as I haue aforeshewed of Ribes, very profitable to all the purposes aforesayd.</p>
               <p>The wilde or voluntary Srawberies, that I may so terme them, are not so good as those that are manured in gardens, because they consist of a more terrene nature, by reason whereof, as also of their stipticke asperity, they soone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the stomacke; yet vnto such as abound with sharpe choler in their stomacks, they are very medicinable and good: for they wonderfully asswage and represse the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious heat of choler. To conclude, Strawberies are in all respects conuenient and good for them that are young, that are of a cholericke and sanguine temperature; but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtfull to the phlegmaticke, to them that haue cold stomacks, and that are subiect to the palsey, and other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the sinewes.</p>
               <p>Whorts, or Whortle-beries, are cold in the latter end of <note place="margin">Whorts.</note> the second degree, and dry also, with a manifest astriction,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1906:71"/>
or binding quality. They may with vs very well supply the vse of Myrtils, especially if they bee not too ripe, or when they are but beginning to be ripe: they are conuenient for an hot stomack, they quench thirst, bind the belly, stay vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, cure the bloudy flix proceeding of choler, help the cholericke passion, which is a vehement purging of choler vpwards and downewards, and in a word, they are of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable force against the great heat and feruent ebullition of choler. But they are greatly offensiue to them that haue weake, cold, and phlegmatick stomacks: for in such, they are so farre from binding the belly, or staying of fluxes, as that they rather trouble the same, through their colde and crude quality. In some places, the people vse to eat the Wortles in creame and milke, which way of eating them is most hurtfull, except for such as are young, and that haue hot and cholericke stomacks. The iuyce of the berries, boyle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The common Hedge, or Hasell nut, especially if they <note place="margin">Hasell-nuts.</note> be dry, are of an earthy and vnprofitable substance: they are hard of concoction, and because they very slowly passe thorow the belly, they are troublesome, and hurtfull to the stomacke: they also breede the cough, and are very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the lungs: they are onely conuenient for rusticall bodies. Those that are newly gathered, are wholsomer then the dry: for by reason that they are of more moyst and softer substance, they are more easily concocted, &amp; do not altogether so much oppresse the stomack. But I wish such as haue weak stomacks, &amp; that are studious of their health, seldom or neuer to eat them, because they breed phlegme, violate the lungs, and soone offend the stomack and belly, by their windie and cloying substance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1906:72"/>
Filberds are wholsomer then the common Hasell Nuts, <note place="margin">Filberds.</note> for they consist of a better substance, and although they are also hardly digested, yet they are profitable for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, especially if they be eaten with Raysons: the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vse of them induceth the self same hurts, that the common Hasell Nuts doe. Those that haue their skins red, are the right Ponticke Nuts, and are both for pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of iuyce, and facilitie of concoction, the best Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds. The greene ones, that are but lately gathered, are by reason of some moysture in their substance, much wholso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then the drie: for the drie Nuts are hot and drie in the first degree, and in the same, more drie then hot; and beside that they are with greater digested; they also breed very much choler.</p>
               <p>The dry Walnuts, or Walsh nuts, are hot and dry in the second degree: they are of hard digestion, and of an <note place="margin">Walnuts.</note> astringent facultie: they increase choler, offend the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, hurt the breast, and cause the cough. Those that in keeping become oylie and rancke in taste, are to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as vtterly naught and vnwholsome; for they are of an hot exulcerating facultie: they altogither breed choler, and very greatly anoy the breast, stomacke, head, throat, tongue, and pallate. The dry Walnuts are onely good for robustious bodies, and for such as respect not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they fill themselues. Those that are newly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red are farre wholsomer then the dry; for they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a moyst temperature, and of a more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble substance; by reason whereof they are more pleasant to the taste, more acceptable to the stomacke, and of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer iuyce. But they are also hurtfull to them that are streit chested, and that are subiect to the cough, or other affects of the lungs. The great Royall Walnut doth for wholsomnes, in all respects far exceed the rest.</p>
               <p>Chestnuts are hot in the first degree and dry in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: being well digested, they yeeld a substantiall thicke <note place="margin">Chestnuts.</note> nourishment; yet for all that, they are not approued for meat, except in the time of penurie, or for strong rusticall
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1906:72"/>
bodies, because they are of hard concoction, and of slow and painfull distribution: they also abundantly ingender winde, binde the belly, and offend the head. Being rosted vnder the hot imbers, or boyled, and so eaten with salt and sugar, they are not so hard of digestion, they more easily descend, and are lesse windie; yet they make the bodie costiue.</p>
               <p>The kernels of this fruict are hot in the first degree, and <note place="margin">Pine-Apple or Nut.</note> moyst in the second: they yeeld to the bodie much good and substantiall nourishment, and are also of a conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, lenifying, and clensing facultie. They diminish and take away the corruption of humors, and also giue vnto the bodie a good restoratiue iuyce; but they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither easie of digestion, and they also offend the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke through their acrimonie, if they be too plentifully eaten. The newest and the whitest are the best. They must be eaten with Honie, or Sugar: they are best for the phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmaticke, and them that be olde, with honie: for them that are young, and that are of a cholericke and hot tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, with sugar; but they must first be macerated the space of an houre in warme water, and then eaten; for by that meanes, they are more easily concocted, and despose all their offensiue acrimonie. They are of much vse in physicall compositions, especially for diseases of the breast; they are of excellent efficacie against an olde cough, the asthmaticke passion, and consumption of the lungs: for they mundifie the lungs from phlegme, represse the vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of them, expectorate the putrilaginous matter, and viscous humors of the same; and repaire the strengths. They are conuenient in cold seasons of the yeare, for the phlegmaticke, and them that be aged; and also for such as are young in affects of the breast, being taken with Sugar.</p>
               <p>Pistach or Fisticke Nuts are of an aromaticall sauour, <note place="margin">Fisticke Nuts.</note> and doe for wholsomnes exceede all other Nuts.

They strengthen the stomacke and liuer, yeeld to the bodie a good impinguating nourishment, by reason whereof they are very good for bodies that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, and haue lost their strengths: they excite Venus, by increasing the geniture, and fortifying the reines. They also open the oppilations of the liuer, and mesataicke veines, mundifie the reines, and asswage their paine. They are good against the shortnes of breath, for they remoue the obstructions of the breast, by clensing forth superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and putrid humors that adhere to the lights &amp; chest: for which cause, as also by reason of their restoratiue force, they are very greatly commended, for those that haue the phthisicke, or consumption of the lungs. They are very wholsome and good for them that be aged, and for such as are of a phlegmaticke temperature; but not so conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, but rather hurtfull to them that be young, and that are of an hot and cholericke temperature, because in such they distemper the bloud, and being much eaten, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times procure the vertiginous euill.</p>
               <p>Sweet Almonds haue in them a good medicinable nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment: <note place="margin">Almonds.</note> they are of an opening, concocting, and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing facultie, whereby they are very medicinable to the breast and lungs.

wherefore it is good to eat not onely these, but also the ripe and dry Almonds with Sugar and Raysous, to cause them more lightly to descend, and with lesse offence to the stomacke. The Almonds that are not fully ripe, are onely conuenient, for them that are young, and that are of an hot and cholericke temperature: those that haue their full ripenes, and reserued all the yeare, so that they waxe not too dry, or in their colour and substance vitiated, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and good for euery season, age, and constitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably giuen in hot feuers to coole and moysten, and to those also that haue the pleuresie, and spet vp filthy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for there is in it also a concocting and lenifying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, by reason whereof, it is very medicinable to the breast and lungs. It is also good for those that are troubled with a cholericke laske, or bloudy flixe, especially being aromatized with a little Cinnamon. To conclude, it is a drinke very profitable, not onely in sicknes, but also in health, for all hot, cholericke and dry bodies, for students, for them that are too vigilant, and all such as are subiect to infirmities of the breast and lungs, to be taken at going to bed, and also at any other time, so the stomacke be empty, especially in hot and drie seasons of the yeare. It is only not conuenient for the phlegmaticke.</p>
               <p>Many phantasticall people doe greatly delight to eat <note place="margin">Mushrums.</note> of the earthly excrescences called Mushrums; whereof some are venemous, and the best of them vnwholsome for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1906:74"/>
meat: for they corrupt the humors, and giue to the bodie a phlegmaticke, earthie, and windie nourishment, or rather detriment. Wherefore they are conuenient for no season, age, or temperature.</p>
               <p>All the kinds of Melons or Pompions are of a cold na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with plenty of moysture: they haue also a certaine <note place="margin">Melons.</note> clensing qualitie, by meanes whereof, they are medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reines; and that clensing qualitie is more in their seede, then in the pulpe: for which cause the seeds are very profitable for them that are troubled with the stone, or strangurie. They are plesant to the taste, but they giue to the bodie litle nourishment, &amp; the same scarsely good, but rather crude, and putrible. They also breede winde, and gripings of the belly: and therefore those that are subiect to the chollicke, and that haue great spleenes, must carefully eschew them. They are conuenient for hot and strong bodies; but very hurtfull to the aged, and to them that are of a phlegmaticke and melancholicke tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</p>
               <p>Cucumbers are of a very cold and moyst temperature, <note place="margin">Cucumbers.</note> euen in the third degree, especially their moyst qualitie. They yeeld vnto the bodie a cold, crude, and waterish nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment: wherefore the vse of them in manner of a sallet with peper and vinegar, notwithstanding that many desire them with a wonderfull delight, is to be reiected, except of them that haue very hot stomacks; for to such the moderate vse of them, by reason of their cooling &amp; moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning qualitie, may be sometimes very good and profitable: for they quench thirst, greatly coole the burning heat of the stomacke and liuer, and represse choler. Those Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers must be chosen, which are greene, and not yet ripe; for when they be ripe and yellow, they are fulsome and vnfit to be eaten. The greene and vnripe Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers preserued in a pickle of vinegar and salt, are much <note place="margin">Pickled Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers.</note> better then those that are eaten greene and vnpickled: for they are of far better taste, and not of so crude and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish substance. They excite the appetite, and are a very
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1906:74"/>
profitable sauce for hot and drie bodies. Cucumbers are onely conuenient for hot and cholericke bodies, and most hurtfull to the phlegmaticke, and them that haue cold and moist stomacks. The seeds are also very medicinable, as those of the Melons: they are cold and also moist, but nothing so much as the fruict: they haue an opening, clensing, and diureticke facultie. Wherefore the emulsion of these seeds, that is, the milkie substance of them, as also of those of the Melon, extracted with some conuenient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as we doe from Almonds, is of singular efficacie against sicknesses proceeding of heat, especially for the breast, lungs, and reines that are inflamed, for the strangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, sharpnes of vrine and exulceration of the bladder.</p>

They are onely conuenient for them that are of an hot and cholericke temperature: for they quench thirst, and coole the immoderate heat of the stomacke and liuer. The seeds of this fruit prouoke vrine, and alay the sharpnes of it: and therefore they may very profitably be vsed with the former seeds in obstructions and distemperatures of the reines and bladder.</p>
               <p>The greene and vnripe Beanes are cold and moist in <note place="margin">Beanes.</note> the first degree: they yeeld to the bodie a crude, grosse, and excrementall nourishment, and fill the stomacke and belly with winde: they cause drowsinesse, and dull the senses, both inward and outward, especially the sight, and make them pursie, that doe often or immoderately eat them. The windie and ill qualitie of them is much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, if they be sodden with Orgaine and Parsely, and afterwards eaten, buttered and seasoned with salt and store

of pepper: for pepper is a speciall correctorie for all grosse and windie meats. They are best agreable for them that haue hot and strong stomacks, and most hurtfull to the phlegmaticke, and such as are troubled with the collicke. Beanes that are almost or fully ripe, are, both by reason of the hardnes of their skins, as also of the grossenes of their substance, by much, of harder concoction, and worse nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, and the drie ones are worst of all. They are meat only for plough-men, and such as are accustomed to an hard and course kinde of foode.</p>
               <p>Pease are in their substance much like vnto Beanes, and eaten after the same manner; but they are far wholsomer <note place="margin">Pease.</note> then Beanes; for they are lesse windie, and by much, of purer iuyce, not breeding so grosse and excrementall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. There are three sorts of Pease common with vs: the white Pease, the gray Pease, and the greene Pease. The two first are vsually eaten greene before they be ripe, being first boyled, then buttered, salted, and peppered: they are very delightsome to the pallat, easily digested, and yeeld a good nourishment to the bodie. Wherefore they are euen at the richest tables, not vnworthily rancked with the best and choisest meats. They are conuenient for all bodies, except for the phlegmaticke, and such as abound with crudities, or are much molested with the winde; but they are most appropriate for the cholericke, and such as are in their youthly and constant age. The drie Pease as they consist of an harder substance, so they are of harder concoction, and of dryer and much worse nourishment; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are a meat somewhat pleasant to the taste, and conuenient enough for them that haue strong stomacks. There is wont to be made of the white Pease boyled a kind of pottage, and also of the greene; but that is not so good, which we call Pease-pottage; this kinde of meat is most vsed in Lent, and in the winter season vpon fasting dayes. That which is made with the husks or skins remayning in it, is not good, but for rusticks, vnto whose stomacks the grossest and hardest kinds of meat are best agreable. But
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1906:75"/>
if the Pease be streined after that they be boyled, and so the husks which are of harder concoction, and hurtfull to the stomacke kept backe, and then seasoned with salt and pepper, and a litle butter also added thereunto, it is a meate of meetly good nourishment, and the more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because it maketh the belly soluble, and deoppilateth or vnstoppeth the veines.</p>
               <p>Artichocks are hot and drie in the height of the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ichocks.</note> if not in the beginning of the second, and full of cholericke iuyce. The best are those that are young, and tender: for when their flowers be out, they are lesse plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in taste, of harder concoction, and of an ill and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke iuyce, especially when their flowers begin to shed. They are vnwholsome to be eaten raw, though some doe accustome so to eat them, being very young, with pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and salt, because they offend the stomacke, hinder the concoction, and breed ill iuyce. But being boyled, and eaten with butter, pepper, and a litle vinegar, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a dainty dish, and restoratiue, being very pleasant to the taste, acceptable to the stomacke, and powerfull for the exciting of Venus. But they are somewhat windie, and oftentimes offensiue to the head especially of such as are of a cholericke temperature: wherefore it is not good for such to eat too liberally of them. They are best agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them that are of a cold temperature; but hurtfull to none, so the vse be moderate.</p>
               <p>Coleworts or Cole are much vsed to be eaten, especially <note place="margin">Coleworts or Cabbage Cole.</note> the Cabbage Cole: there is in the iuyce of Cole a certaine nitrous or salt qualitie, whereby it mightily clenseth; but the whole substance or bodie of Coleworts or Cabbage is of a binding and drying facultie, because it leaueth in the decoction, the salt qualitie, which lyeth in the iuyce and waterie part thereof. Cole or Cabbage is of hard conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and hurtfull to the mouth of the stomacke: it bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a grosse and melancholicke bloud, increaseth winde, hurteth the sight, and causeth troublesome dreames. But if it be boyled a while, and that water cast away, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1906:76"/>
boyled in the broth of fat flesh, it becommeth more acceptable to the stomacke, and farre lesse hurtfull to the bodie. The top leaues and heads of Cole that are but a litle closed, which we commonly call Puffe-cole, are the best and wholsomest: for by reason that they are by the heat of the Sunne better concocted, they are of tenderer substance, of easier concoction, of pleasanter taste, and of better nourishment. But the great, hard, and compacted heads of Cole, commonly called Cabbage, which are most desired of the common sort of people, are, by reason of much indigested matter in them, of hardest concoction, and of worser nourishment. They are onely conuenient for such as haue strong stomacks, and that vse great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: for vnto robustious and rusticke people nothing is hurtfull that filleth the belly. Cole or Cabbage is best to be eaten in the cold seasons of the yeare; but the young leaues or buds of Cole are also in the spring time commendable. The vse of Cole or Cabbage is not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for them that are aged, that lead a studious kinde of life, that haue weake stomacks, that are of a melancholicke temperature, or troubled with winde.</p>
               <p>Carrots are moderately hot, and something moyst: <note place="margin">Carrots and Parseneps.</note> Parseneps temperately hot, and more drie then moyst: they are vsed to be eaten first sodden, then buttered &amp;c, and the Carrots are oftentimes eaten with flesh. They are pleasant to the taste, and somewhat of hard concoction, especially the Parsnep. Parsneps giue to the bodie much good and substantiall nourishment; but the nourishment which commeth of the Carrot is not much, and the same not so thicke and substantiall: they neither binde nor loose the belly, for they are of an indifferent distribution; but the Carrot is somewhat more easily distributed, then the Parsenep: they are both somewhat windie and also venerious, especially the Parsenep. Their flatulent qualitie, and slownesse of concoction is somewhat remoued, if they be well and exquisitely boyled, and afterwards dressed with butter, vinegar, and pepper. They are conuenient
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1906:76"/>
for euery ageand constitution; except for the phlegmatick, and them that are entred within the limits of old age, or are much subiect to the winde-collicke, or obstructions of the stomack and mesarick veines; and to such the Parsnep is more disagreeing then the Carrot.</p>

Being well dressed, they are pleasant to the taste, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the stomacke, easily concocted, and engender meetly good nourishment, somewhat phlegmaticke; but very flatulent. The often and much vse of them is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the stomacke, filleth and puffeth vp the body with crude, pituitous, and flateous humours, which breedeth obstructions in the veines and pores, and annoyeth the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes. But the crude and windie qualitie of them is well corrected, if they be first a while boyled in water, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the broth of fat flesh, and then eaten with plenty of pepper, &amp;c. They are conuenient for euery age and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, except for them that are very phlegmaticke, or often vexed with the winde.</p>

They are moderately hot, and somewhat moyst: they delight the pallate, excite the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and are easily concocted: they comfort the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and giue, though not much, yet commendable nourishment: they also prouoke vrine, open obstructions, and are with all of a venerous windiefacultie. They are good for euery age and constitution.</p>
               <p>Potato roots are of a temperate qualitie, and of strong <note place="margin">Potatoes.</note> nourishing parts: the nutriment which they yeeld is, though somewhat windie, verie substantiall, good and restoratiue, surpassing the nourishment of all other roots or fruits. They are diuersly dressed and prepared, according to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Iringo-roots are hot and dry in the second degree, with <note place="margin">Iringo-roots,</note> a tenuity of substance: they strengthen the stomacke and liuer, discusse winde, and are of excellent efficacie for all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the kidneyes, both cleansing and strengthning them.

They are very greatly auailable for old and aged people, and for such as are weake by nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing and restoring the one, and amending the defects of nature in the other.</p>
               <p>Galicke is hot and dry in the fourth degree: it yeeldeth to the bodie no nourishment at all, it engendereth a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Garlicke,</note> and sharpe cholericke bloud: and therefore such as are of hot complexion, must carefully abstaine from it, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in hot seasons. Yet it is good for them that are colde and moyst by constitution, and that abound with phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, grosse, and clammie humours, for it heateth the bodie exceedingly, helpeth the concoction, digesteth and consumeth crude and raw humours, dissolueth winde, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renuateth and maketh thin, thicke and grosse humors, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth such as are tough and clammie, digesteth and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them.

It is also an enemy to all cold poysons, and to the bitings of venomous beasts, a remedie to such as are constrained to take naughty corrupt drinkes or meats, and a Preseruatiue against contagious and pestilent aire, and therefore not vnfitly termed, <hi>The Country-mans Treacle.</hi> But if it be often or immoderately eaten, it causeth head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1906:77"/>
and hurteth the sight. Being moderately taken, it is conuenient for the phlegmaticke, and such as are past their constant age, especially in cold seasons; but it is altogether hurtfull to young men, and to such as are of hot constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is at all times and seasons, hurtfull to women with childe, and to them that giue sucke,</p>
               <p>Onions are in their temperature and faculties much <note place="margin">Onions.</note> like vnto Garlicke, but not so extreme hot, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so more delightsome to the pallate, and more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the stomacke. They helpe the appetite, extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate grosse and viscous humours, prouoke vrine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue loathsomnesse of the stomacke, and other hurts that come by meats or drinks of euill quality. Being eaten raw, they nourish not at all, and are very hurtfull to those that are cholericke; but good for such as are full of raw and phlegmaticke humours. But if they be sliced and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated a while in water before they be eaten, their acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and hurtfull qualitie is thereby something dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and they become more sweet and pleasant to the taste, and are a sauce good, euen for the cholericke, especially if there be any superfluity of moysture in the stomacke: for they notably stirre vp appetite to meat, comfort the slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and cause good concoction. But being too often, or immoderately eaten raw, they engender ill and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible humours in the stomacke, inflame the bloud, cause drowsinesse and the head ach, hurt the sight, confound the memorie, disturbe and dull the vnderstanding. Being sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, especially in the broth of good flesh, and so eaten with conuenient sauce, as butter, vinegar, and a little pepper, they depose all their hurt, and become somwhat nutritiue, and are accommodate, not onely for phlegmatick persons, but also for all other, so the vse be moderate. Wherefore being vsed in pottage, or othewise boy led for sauces, they are not hurtfull, but wholsome and comfortable to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. Onions are hurtfull to hot temperatures, and to them that be young; but profitable to such as are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary temperament and age.</p>

Scallions and Chibols are much of the nature of Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <note place="margin">Scallions and Chibols.</note> they are delightsome to the pallate, and vsually eaten with vinegar at the beginning of meales, for exciting the appetite, and comforting the stomacke that is deiected by ouer-much heat, they helpe the concoction, correct the euilnesse of bad meats. But the immoderate vse of them is hurtfull, euen as of onions. Such as desire to eat them in Sallads, I aduise, especially if they be of hot constitutions, that they take with them Lettuce, Sorrell, and Purselane, that the heat of them, may by the colde and moysture of these be attempered. They are not good for young bodies, nor the often or much vse, for any that are of hot tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: they are best agreeable for cold constitutions, and for such as vndergoe great labour, and exercise of body.</p>
               <p>Leekes are hot in the third degree, and dry in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <note place="margin">Leekes.</note> and of an attenuating and abstersiue facultie; yet very vnwholsome: for they engender a naughty melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike bloud, breede winde, and replete the head with melancholike fumes, which hurt the sight, and cause trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and fearefull dreames: they are also, by reason of their acrimonie, very hurtfull to the stomacke and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, especially being eaten raw. Being boyled, they are lesse hurtfull, by reason that they lose much of their sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and make the body a little soluble; and yet being so vsed, they yeeld to the body no good nourishment at all. They are not conuenient for any age, season, or tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, especially for the cholericke and melancholike; but are a meat onely allowable for rusticke and robustious persons.</p>
               <p>Ciues, or Chiues, are of a mixt nature betweene the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">Ciues.</note> and the Leeke, participating of them both, as may be gathered, both by their smell and taste: they attenuate, or make thin, open, and prouoke vrine; yet ingender hot and grosse vapours, which are hurtfull to the eyes and braine.

Lettuce is cold and moyst in the second degree: it is of <note place="margin">Lettuce.</note> easie concoction, of meetly good nourishment, and of a soluble faculty, especially if it be boyled. It hath this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that of all hearbs, it breedeth least euill iuyce, and that it is with least offence eaten raw. The nourishment that it yeeldeth, is not much in quantitity; but it notably cooleth a hot stomacke, and helpeth it when it is troubled with choler: it quencheth thirst, preserueth the bloud from distemperature, causeth sleepe, asswageth paine of the head, proceeding of heat, and is very profitable for Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that are of an hot and dry temperature: for whereas, through heat and drinesse, they grow barraine and dry of milke, it increaseth milke, by tempering the heat and sicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their bodies. But in bodies that are naturally cold, it doth not encrease milke at all, but is rather an hinderance thereunto. This hearb is much vsed in Sallads in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, with vinegar and sugar, and that not vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for it procureth appetite to meat, and tempereth the heat of the stomacke and liuer.

It was vsed in ancient times, to be eaten onely at the end of supper, for repressing the vapours that come of intemperate eating and drinking, and for procuring of sleepe: <hi>Moderata enim veterum erant prandia, coenae verò cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulae &amp; ingluuiei dedicatae.</hi> But in these dayes, it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaten at the beginning of meales: In my iudgement, it may well be eaten at both these times, to the health of the body: for being taken at the beginning of meale, it doth stirre vp the appetite, which oftentimes is deiected by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much heat, and eaten after, or at the end of our meales, it defendeth the head from superfluous and offensiue vapors, by reason that it cooleth and inhibiteth the rising vp of them from the stomacke into the head.

But whether it bee eaten raw, or boyled, as the constitution of the body shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require, this is certaine, that there cannot be found any sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple medicinable meat, wherewith sleepe may be procured, and the vnquietnesse of the spirits, and heat of choler ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, as with it.

               <p>Purselane is cold in the third degree, and moyst in the <note place="margin">Purselane.</note> second: it is much vsed to bee eaten raw in sallads in the summer-season: it cooleth an hot stomacke, prouoketh appetite, quencheth thirst, helpeth the inflammations of the liuer and kidneyes, and also of the head and eyes, by extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing the raging heat of choler, and allaying the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the bloud. In a word, being eaten with vinegar, it is of admirable force against the burning heat of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, against cholericke vomitings, and inflammations of all the inward parts. But the often and too much vse of it, weakneth the stomacke, and hurteth the sight.

The white Beete is a common Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearbe, it is colde in the first degree, and moyst in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: the other kinds are somewhat dry, &amp; all of them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stersiue, by reason that they haue a certaine salt &amp; nitrous qualitie ioyned with them; but the white Beete least of all. The white &amp; red Beets being eaten, boyled in the same manner, as Lettuces are, doe quickly descend, open the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the liuer and spleene, and make the belly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble. They yeeld to the body very little nourishment, and being much eaten, they are offensiue to the stomacke; but the red Beete is to bee preferred before the other. The broths or pottage wherein they bee boyled, are good for such as are wont to be costiue, or subiect to obstructions of the liuer and spleene; but the leaues themselues eaten, are onely conuenient for such as haue strong stomacks. The leaues of the great red Beete, or Romane Beet boyled, and eaten with butter, or oyle, vinegar, and pepper is a most <note place="margin">The great red Romane Beet.</note> pleasant and delicate sallad, or meat. But what excellent and dainty meat might bee made of the red and beautifull root, which is to bee preferred before the leaues, aswell in beauty, as in goodnesse; I leaue to such as are expert in Cookery, assuring them that they may make therof many and diuers dishes delightfull to the eye, pleasant to the taste, and wholsome to the body.</p>

Wherefore in the time of pestilence, or any euill constitution of the aire, to preuent infection, it is good oftentimes, especially mornings fasting, to chew the leaues of Sorell, and sucke downe the iuyce. And this proueth that Greene-sauce is not onely good to procure appetite, to coole an hot stomacke, and to temper the heat of the liuer, but also wholsome against contagion.

The iuyce of the Damaske Rose doth moue to stoole, more then of the White; but most effectually of the Muske Rose: yet the Damaske Rose is for goodnes, and pleasantnes of smell fittest for medicine, or meat, and therefore is more commonly vsed. In the Red Roses, earthie parts are predominant, and by reason that they are of a more earthie substance, they are also of a drying and binding qualitie, yet not without certaine moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture adioyned while they be fresh, which they loose when they be dryed: and for this cause their iuyce is of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stersiue and solutiue facultie, and their infusion doth also make the bodie soluble, yet not so much as of the others aforesaid. But all the Roses haue a predominant cold temperature in the first degree: being dryed and their moisture gone, they doe binde and drie, and likewise coole, but not so much as when they are fresh. The sweet and pleasant smell of Roses is very comfortable to all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, spirits, and principall parts of the bodie, and so is the distilled water of them, which doth also gently temper and coolethe inward parts.

They notably strengthen the seminall vessels, incrassate and make fruitfull the geniture, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the red garden Mint: wherefore it is of speciall and singular vse in all seminall fluxes. They are also of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vse in the Stone and Strangury, being boyled in wine, or possets for the purpose, and also in broths: for besides that, they dissolue and consume the crudities of the stomacke, and strengthen the same, they also purge the reines, and vrinall passages, of grosse and slimie humours. The iuyce of Mints, taken with the iuyce of a soure Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granet, or with some other competent thing for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, effectually stayeth vomiting, and scowring in the cholericke passion, and also the effusion of bloud, from the inward parts. Mints boyled in White wine with a little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar added thereto, and the mouth washed therwith, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the ill sauour of the mouth, and putrefaction of the gums. The dry powder of Mints, taken with warme milk, is a very good medicine for wormes in children, or olde folkes. The powder of Mint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As Mints are appropriate to the stomacke: so Bawme <note place="margin">Bawme, and Basill,</note> and Basill are to the heart. Bawme is hot and dry in the

Bawme is also good for a moyst and colde sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, to helpe the concoction, stay vomiting, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the obstructions of the braine. It is an hearbe greatly to bee esteemed of Students, for by a speciall property, it driueth away heauinesse of minde, sharpneth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and encreaseth memory.

Basill I deeme to bee rather fit for medicine, then for meat, because it is of ill iuyce, of hard concoction, offensiue to the stomack, filling both it and the belly with winde: and being much eaten, it is also very hurtfull to the sight. But yet it is worthy to be esteemed for the sweet sauour thereof, which is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the heart, and good also for the head, so the braine be not weake, for it causeth head-ach in such as haue weake braines, by reason of the strong sauour which it hath, especially being often smelled vntc.

strengthen the braine, preuent convulsions, and all infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the sinewes and braine, proceeding of a cold and moyst cause. In a word, it is an hearbe worthy to be much esteemed of all persons, euen for the pleasant smell of it, which to the heart and head is very comfortable. The vse of Marjorame is not good for hot and cholericke bodies; but for the phlegmaticke, and such as haue cold stomacks, and ouer-moyst and weake braines, it is maruellous good and conuenient.</p>
               <p>Betouie is hot and dry in the second degree: it hath a <note place="margin">Betouie.</note> cutting and attenuating facultie: It taketh away obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the inward parts: in a word, the vertues of it are innumerable; but it is cheefly good for the braine and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and all infirmities proceeding from the imbecility of them. The vse of it, in broths, or otherwise, is good for euery age, season, and temperature, but cheefly for such as haue weake and feeble braines.</p>
               <p>Sage is a most wholsome hearbe, hot and dry in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">Sage.</note> of the third degree, and of an astrictiue faculty. It helpeth the concoction, and discusseth winde, singularly comforteth the head and braine, quickneth all the senses, especially the memorie, and strengthneth the sinewes. Wherefore the vse of it is exceeding good for such, as are subiect to the palsie, or trembling of the hands, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affects of the sinewes and braine vpon a moyst cause. It may be eaten in sallads, or any other way vsed; but in sauces with meats of moyst substance, it is of singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for it exciteth the appetite, and correcteth the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moysture of the meat. The often chewing of it in the mouth, is very profitable to the sinewes and teeth, for it strengthneth the one, and preserueth the other from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The vse of Sage is very good for women with childe, especially such as are subiect to abortion. And out of it may be extracted &amp;c, for women that are barren, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of excellent efficacie, to make them fruitfull and apt to conceiue; but yet not conuenient for all that are child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. Sage, especially the much and frequent vse therof, is

hurtfull in hot and dry seasons, and to leane and dry bodies; but very profitable to the phlegmaticke, to the aged, and to such as haue ouer-moyst and weake braines.</p>
               <p>Rosemary, is in vertue and quality, much like vnto <note place="margin">Rosemary.</note> Sage, for it is both hot and dry, and also astringent: the vse thereof is very profitable, for it correcteth the superfluous moysture of meats, corroborateth and raiseth vp a cold and weake stomacke, discusseth winde, sweetneth the breath, comforteth the heart, braine, and sinewes, quickneth the senses and memory, and strengthneth the sinewie parts. Wherefore it is good against the rheume, and all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the head, braine, and sinewes, proceeding of a cold and moyst cause. The Conferue made of the flowers of Rosemarie, and also of Sage, which I wish to bee often vsed of Students, especially mornings fasting, and sometimes after meale, doth greatly delight the braine, reuiue the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, quicken the senses, comfort the heart, and maketh it merry.

               <p>Tansie is hot and dry in the beginning of the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: it strengthneth the sinewes, and is very profitable to <note place="margin">Tansie.</note> the stomacke, for it concocteth and scowreth downwards crude and phlegmaticke humors, which adhere and cleaue thereunto. From hence may be gathered, that Tansies in the spring-time, are very wholsome, and good for the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1906:87"/>
for the clean sing away of phlegme bred therein, by the vse of fish in the Lent-season. And heere many may see their errour detected, that for the making of Tansies, doe confusedly vse to giue onely vnto them a delightfull greene colour, beside the iuyce of Tansie, the iuyce of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearbes, perhaps altogether vnwholsome, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vnfit for the purpose. But if any please to adde to the making of Tansies, the iuyce of Sorrell, they shall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue my assent, especially if they make them for such as are of a cholericke temperature. The seede of Tansie is of singular force against wormes, for in what sort soeuer it bee taken, it killeth and expelleth them. Tansie is conuenient for the phlegmaticke, and the aged; but hurtfull to young and cholericke bodies.</p>

               <p>Rocket and Tarragon are neere of one nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <note place="margin">Rocket and Tarragon.</note> hot and dry in the third degree; but Tarragon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the aromaticall and cardiacall sauour of it, is to bee preferred before Rocket. Among all hearbs of an acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious sauour, and that are vsed insallads, they may haue the preheminence, especially Tarragon, for by reason of its aromaticall and cardiacall quality, it is much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the stomacke, heart and head, then Rocket is. They cut and extenuate phlegme in the stomacke, excite the appetite, and helpe the concoction. They are good in sallads, but not alone, but ioyned with Lettuce, Purselane, and such colde hearbes, for the qualifying of their acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious heat: otherwise being eaten alone, they distemper the liuer, and cause head-ach. Wherefore the best way to makesallads, is to mingle hot hearbes and colde together, except you will make them of purpose to coole or heat, as the nature of the stomacke, and temperature of body shall require. Rocket and Tarragon are conuenient for the aged and phlegmaticke, not not for the chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,

It may not be eaten in sallads, but in small quantitie, and that with Lettuce, and other cold hearbes; for it will quickly offend the stomacke, distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the liuer, inflame the bloud, and annoy the head. Water Cresse or Karsse is altogither of like nature and facultie, as <note place="margin">Water Karsse.</note> Towne-Karsse is, and is also very effectuall against the stone.

The roots of Auens are in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne and Winter very profitable in physicall broths, or other decoctions, for all the purposes aforesaid.

Although this hearbe be in physicall vses cheifely profitable for the stone and strangurie, yet I thought it meete, because it is common in gardens, not here to omit it. Wherefore such as are subiect to the stone

It may be vsed in pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, broths, and sallads &amp;c. In sallads with other hearbs it is most acceptable, by reason that it giueth vnto them a very pleasant and delicate relish; but for sallads, the seeds while they are greene, or the round tufts ór heads which conteine the seede, doe farre excell the leaues, which for pleasantnes of taste, sweetnes of smell, and wholsomnes for euery age and temperature, do also excell all other sallade hearbes. And to be eaten by themselues as a sallade, with Oyle omphacine, vinegar, and pepper, they exceede any other sallade for a cold and feeble stomacke. The roots of Cheruill boyled, and after dressed, as the cunning Cooke best knoweth, or onely eaten in manner of a sallade with <note place="margin">Roots of Cheruill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</note> oyle and vinegar, are singularly good and wholsome for weake and aged people, and for such as are dull and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out courage: for they delight the stomacke, reioyce and comfort the heart, increase strength, excite Venus, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell old age.</p>
               <p>Wormewood is hot and drie in the end of the second <note place="margin">Wormewood.</note> degree: it hath a clensing facultie with some astriction ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned: it is marueilous profitable to a weake stomacke that is troubled with choler; for it clenseth it through its bitternesse, and by reason of the binding qualitie, it also strengthneth, and comforteth the stomacke. Moreouer it is good against windinesse, and griping paines of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke and belly: it strengthneth the liuer, and riddeth it of obstruction, and the bloud of putrefaction, clensing by vrine, naughtie cholericke and superfluous humors. It also helpeth the spleene when it is ouer-charged or filled with grosse feculent bloud, by causing it to passe downeward by the stoole, togither with the excrements. Wherefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great commoditie that Wormewood bringeth
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1906:89"/>
to the stomacke and liuer that are weake and oppressed through the redundancie of choler or melancholy, I aduise all those in whom those humors exceede their limits, to eat oftentimes the young and tender tops, or leaues of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in sallads with other hearbes; but specially to drinke mornings fasting, and sometimes also before meales a draught of Wormewood wine, or Beere, or in want of them, of white wine or stale beere, wherein a few branches of Wormewood haue for certaine houres bin infused: and I assure them that they shall finde great commoditie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; for it will clense the stomàcke, liuer, gall, and spleene, <note place="margin">The whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse of Wormewood wine or beere, and for whom it is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</note> discusse windinesse, cause them to haue a good appetite to meat, to be free from wormes, the laundice, and other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases proceeding of choler. Hence it may appeare, that those, who, being of a phlegmaticke or moist temperature, doe for the weaknesse and windinesse of their stomacks, make often vse of Wormewood beere, or of the hearbe infused therein, as aforesaid, are much deceiued, except that choler or melancholy shall accidentally happen to abound in their stomacks, because Wormewood is first and cheifely good for the cholericke, next for the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke, and is now and then also conuenient for the sanguine, because the sanguine constitution is very apt to grow cholericke; but for the phlegmaticke it is nothing at all auaileable, vnlesse that choler or melancholy shall happen to offend their stomacks through obstructions of the gall or melt: and for such in regard of the weaknesse and windinesse of their stomacks, Wormewood wine, or the hearbe infused in wine, as aforesaid, is far more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient then any Absinthiarie beere.</p>

vsed of Nurses, for it increaseth passing good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some milke. The roots are also very good in broths or other decoctions for the same intents, especially for the obstructions and paines of the kidneyes. But the seeds are of greatest force for breaking of winde, for comforting the stomacke, and asswaging the paines of it, for corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the braine, and preseruing the sight. To conclude, the branches, seeds, and roots of Fennell are very good for the head, the lungs, the liuer, and the kidneyes: for they both open, and corroborate those parts. The young ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der branches are very good in sallads, and they are likewise, being preserued in a pickle of vinegar and salt, very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to be eaten as a sauce with meat in the winter season. The round tufts or heads of Fennell, which containe the seede, are exceeding wholsome to be eaten; but there are commonly bred in them litle wormes of a greenish colour, <note place="margin">A caution concerning the eating of the round tufts or heads of Fennell.</note> which are very venemous to the braine and senses: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aduise: that the said tufts or heads be opened, and the wormes carefully shaken off, and afterwards washed cleane and macerated a while in cold water, and so eaten in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a sallade, either by it felfe, or with other hearbes: they are of an excellent confortatiue nature, and doe nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly discusse winde, and open the obstructions of the liuer, breast, and braine. The greene seeds whilest they be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and of a yellowish colour, are also passing pleasant and wholsome to be eaten in manner of a sallade, or otherwise, for all the purposes aforesaid.

to the stomacke, and more delightsome to the taste.</p>
               <p>Coriander seedes are of many people much vsed for the winde, but with very great error, I doubt not: for the <note place="margin">Coriander seeds.</note> hearbe it selfe, which beareth the seede is of a very noysome and venemous qualitie, whereof the seede in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure doth participate. For if it be indiscreetly vsed, and not well corrected of that filthy and malignant qualitie, which it receiueth from the hearbe, it hurteth the sight, and peruerteth the vnderstanding. The best way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the seedes for correcting their hurtfull qualitie, and so to make them wholsome and fit both for meat and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, is to infuse them 24 houres at the least, in white wine vinegar, then to take them and drie them, and so to keepe them for their vse. Being thus prepared, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse winde, exiccate crude humors, strengthen the mouth of the stomacke, and represse the ascending of vapor's to the head.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1906:91"/>
it is plaine and rude, of no respect or consideration: for they which obserue this kinde of Diet, do make no choise of meats, no set or fixed time of eating: for sometimes they eat liquid meats, sometimes hard, sometimes grosse, sometimes fine, sometimes salt, sometimes fresh, sometimes temperate, sometimes intemperate, sometimes of euill iuyce, and sometimes of good: sometimes they fill and glut themselues, sometimes they rise with an appetite, sometimes they eat twise, sometimes thrise, somtimes foure times or oftner in a day. A Subvulgar Diet is as it were a meane betweene the Accurate, and Vulgar: for it is not so rude and plaine, as the Vulgar, nor so precise and exact, as the Accurate: for they which obserue this Diet doe commonly eat at set and appointed times, and that also with some respect and choise had of the meats. From this distinction of Diet I answer, that a Subvulgar Diet is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for healthy men to obserue; for they accustoming themselues to a meane and an indifferent kinde of Diet, do far more safely, and with much lesse perill sustaine the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and change of aire, meats, drinks &amp;c, which even by an inevitable necessitie are incident vnto vs in this life, then they which obserue a precise and Accurate Diet. Neither doe they with such contrary meats, and peruerse manner of liuing, ouer-charge and oppugne Nature, as those doe that vse a Vulgar Diet, which is only fit for agresticke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for whom I write not these things.</p>

               <head>Whether it be good for the preseruation of health neuer to eat without acertaine appetite and desire?</head>
               <p>SEeing that there is nothing that doth so greatly obtunde and weaken the natiue heat, and extirpate health, as a fastidious fulnes of the stomacke, and that nothing doth so soone cause the same, as when meats are taken without appetite and desire: I therefore aduise all such as are in health, and that are desirous of the continuance of the same, that they eat not vnlesse the appetite be certaine, and the superiour intestines empty of the meats formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1906:91"/>
for it is most hurtfull to the bodie to ingest nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon nourishment not digested; for by such meanes the oeconomie of the stomacke is confounded, and the coucoction, which is the root of life, consequently marred. It is a physicall axiome of perpetuall veritie, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection or fault of a former concoction, cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the next: wherefore if the stomacke performe not his office, there can neuer of crude chyle be made good bloud in the liuer, neither of impure bloud any good assimilation in the parts. And therefore intemperate men, which doe not giue time for the first concoction, doe fill their bodies with vitious humors, and waxe turgide and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, destroying first (by their intemperancle) the force and faculties of the stomacke, next of the liuer, and at length of the whole bodie. Wherefore it shall nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a man to vse meats of good and wholsome iuyce, except they be digested in the stomacke: for euen as ill humors are bred of these, as of contrarie meats, if they obteine not a good concoction in the stomacke. To conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, seeing that a good concoction of the meats is a matter of so great moment for the preseruation of health, I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell all such as are truely respectiue of the same, that they oppressenot their stomacks with vntimely, or immoderate eating, and before all things, that they eschew and abhor a fastidious saturitie, as a thing most iniurious to Nature, and pernicious to the health of the bodie.</p>

               <head>Whether it be good to prouoke with Sauces an appetite to meats, the stomacke being well and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affected?</head>
               <p>IAnswer, that it is better to fast and expect that hunger may excite an appetite, then to irritate the same with sauces: for to a man liuing wisely and soberly, salt with hunger, is the best and wholsomest sauce. But when hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in gluttonous persons excite not the appetite, then the Cooke is put to his shifts by strange mixtures of things to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1906:92"/>
consect a sauce, which may repaire the pallate, please the throat, and excite the appetite. And from hence not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diseases doe spring vp, but inexplicable, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, exceeding oftentimes the Art of Physitions. For I would haue them to know, that dolorous Gouts, graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinie of the head, caliginousnes of the eyes, tortures and dissolutions of the limmes, trembling of the hands, and many worse miseries then these, are not apt to be bred by parsimonie, and a phylosophicall diet, but by an abundant plenitude, occasioned by luxurious excesse. Wherefore my counsell is, that meat expect an appetite, and that the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke be by no meanes vntimely alliciated vnto meate; for, as I haue said in the former question, it is the hurtfullest thing to the bodie, to ingest meat vpon meat vndigested. But if the stomacke be ill affected, as when it is by any distemperature, or debilitie derected, I then aucrre, that it is lawfull, yea very expedient, to excite an appetite with conuenient sauces, so as it be done with this caution, that the stomacke be not by them stirred vp to the taking of more meate, then it can well digest. And here I would haue such also as are healthy to know, that I doe not so straitly restraine them from the vse of sauces, neither that I am against sauces so morose (for although they allure vs to inordinate and immoderate eating, yet the fault is rather to be attributed to our imprudencie, and intemperancie, then to the sauce) as that I doe altogither denie them to such as haue sound stomacks, and appetites naturally good, but affirme rather, that some simple sauces (abandoning all strange and disordered mixtures) according as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature or state of the stomacke, nature of the meate, and time of yeare shall require, so that they be soberly, and not vntimely or gluttonously vsed, may sometimes be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and that profitably, not onely to such as haue weake and foeble stomacks, but also to them that haue both sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke and appetite healthfull and firme enough: for they cause the meats to be taken with greater delight, and such as are eaten with delight, are commonly best concocted.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1906:92"/>
Of which sort are first, as most common, Vinegar, Verjuce, and Mustard, next Orenges and Limmons, and then Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Sampier; for these two last, because they haue greater force to excite the appetite, then to nourish, are also ranked among the sauces. And all these are not only good for exciting the appetite, but oftentimes also very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the stomacke it selfe, and other parts: for vinegar attenuateth and cutteth grosse humours in the stomacke, and represseth choler: Mustard, by reason of the heating, extenuating, and resoluing faculty that it hath, is very good for a cold stomacke and bteast, which commonly are stuft with crude and phlegmaticke humours: Verjuce, and the iuyce of Orenges and Limmons are exceeding profitable for an hot stomacke and liuer, and therefore very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for hot and cholericke bodies: Capers are very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the spleene, and Sampire to the kidneyes. At what time therefore it shall please any one, or that it shall seeme good to helpe his appetite, let him then, according as the condition and constitution of his body shall require, make choyce of one or another of the aforesayd sauces. As if the stomacke shall bee affected with grosse and tough humours, then Vinegar is a good and profitable sauce: If the stomacke be stuft with cold, crude, and slimie humors, Mustard: If the liuer or stomacke be of hot temperature, or disposed to inflammations, Verjuce, the iuyce of Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Citrons, or soure Orenges: If the spleene be subiect to obstructions, Capers: If the kidneyes, Sampire, &amp;c. But all strange and confused sauces, especially such as are not of a comfortable pleasant sharpe relish, which are made to oblectate the pallate, abandon, as hurtfull to the body, and acceptable onely to lurching and deuouring Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods. And heere I cannot but againe admonish all such as are studious of their health, that they doe not, by sauces, or delicate and dainty meats, prouoke their stomacks to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; for meat, by copious quantity, oppressing the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, doth greatly weaken the naturall heat, and subuert the digestiue faculty; and therefore, though it be of good
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1906:93"/>
iuyce, because it cannot be concocted, and euinced of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, filleth the body with crude and flatulent humours. Eat yee therefore without saciety, and vse those meats with great sobriety, that besides the satisfying of hunger, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce appetite and delight.</p>

            <div type="subsection">
               <head>Whether meats much desired, albeit not laudable, are to be preferred and eaten, before such as are better, being not desired?</head>
               <p>I Answer, that the meats, which are most desired, though lesse good, are to be preferred, and rather eaten: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because the meat which is desired, and taken with delectation, is more welcome to the stomacke, more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detained, and consequently, better digested; whereas the meat that is not desired, nor taken with delectation, but rather against stomacke, is, though it be of good and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some substance, seldome well digested. But this is not so generally to be receiued, as that euery kinde of meat desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ought to be preferred before better meat not desired: for if the meat desired be of very ill nature, then it is rather to be eschewed. For example sake: if any of a sound and healthy body, shall more desire Beefe, Porke, or Mutton, then Capon, Veale, or other meats of like goodnesse; Beefe, Porke, or Mutton, are to be granted vnto him. But if there be very much difference betweene the meat, which is desired, and a better that is not desired, that is, if the meat desired, be of a very naughty and ill property, then it is not to be exhibited, because it may bring much hurt to the body, especially if in such case the appetite bee often yeelded vnto, and the body not rustickly strong. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be regarded, whether the appetite be enormous, or too too irregular, as it is, when it desireth meats very hurtfull, and to be rather abhorred, then eaten: for then it is not to bee satisfied, except sometimes in women with childe, for feare of abortion. They therefore that liue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiously, and doenot onely satisfie their appetite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1906:93"/>
any respect had of the meats or drinkes that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but also doe much delight in their dissolute manner of <note place="margin">An admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liuers.</note> liuing, and doe deride others that obserue better order, are heere to be admonished, that they cease to take pleasure in an euill custome: for although they bee lusty and strong for the present, and can for a time well digest, suffer surfet, and beare immoderate diet, either by reason of their age, or by reason of a firme constitution, or by reason of custome, and are not annoyed with any manifest malady; yet let them be sure, that time will hasten their punishment, and that a riotous youth breedeth a miserable age, full of paines and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But it seldom commeth to passe, that those which lead a dissolute and disordered life, all the time of their youth, liue vntill they bee olde: for vnlesse they relinquish their euill manners, and change the course of their life, they are oftentimes vnawares afflicted with some violent disease, and so end their dayes with miserable torture, perhaps in the flower of their age, when they would most gladly liue. Wherefore let all lewd and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons know, that it is farre better for them to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish their euill manners, and change the course of their life, while they bee young, and by sober and temperate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to preserue their health, then by surfet, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of disorder, to make their bodies weake, sickly, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and odious both to God and man.</p>

               <head>How manythings ought such as are studious of their health, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to respect, in electing meats conuenient for their nature and constitution?</head>
               <p>THree, the complexion of the body, the quality or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the meat, and the substance of it. The complexion or temperature of the body, is either tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or intemperate: if it be temperate, then meats of like temperate quality are conuenient, for conseruation of the temperature: If it be lapsed or distempered, then meats of a contrary quality, agreeable to the lapse, that it may bee
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1906:94"/>
reduced to a temperature, are to be assumed. If therefore the lapse bee in heat, meats and drinkes of cold quality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the lapse; if in colde, other in like manner of hot quality, are to bee vsed. The like also is to bee done in lapses of drought and moysture. And if the lapse shall bee of diuers qualities composed, a compound manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction must also be obserued. But in making this redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is to be obserued, that a colde constitution lapsed, requireth a stronger quality reducing it, then an hot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is more remote from the beginnings of life. The like respect also, in reducing a constitution lapsed, is to bee had of the age. And heere it is also to bee noted, that as some bodies are subiect to obstructions, and some to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate fluxions: so are there also some meats, that are of an attenuating and soluble faculty, which are good for the former; and some of an incrassating, and an astringent, conuenient for the latter, so they bee moderately, at times conuenient assumed. But if any shall eat meats, that are not conuenient for his constitution and state of body, by reason of a great desire, that hee hath vnto such, hee ought to take them with their correctories; as vnto moyst and phlegmatick meats, to adde things of contrary quality and substance: for by this means they will be made more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the body, and so taken with lesse offence. Thirdly, the substance of the meats ought to be considered, for some meats are grosse, and of hard substance, some thin, and of tender substance: these are conuenient for a weake sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, those for a strong: for meats that consist of thin parts, are in a strong stomacke, by reason of the great heat of the same, soone corrupted, adusted, and conuerted into choler: as for grosse and hard meats, they doe greatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse a weake stomacke, and infringe the naturall heat. Wherefore the meat, as touching the substance of it, ought to bee correspondent to the concocting heat of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: and therefore to such as haue strong stomacks, meats of strong nourishment, and of slow digestion, are most agreeable; but to them that haue weake stomacks,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1906:94"/>
that liue at rest, and are subiect to obstructions, meats of lighter substance, and of easier concoction, are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate. Besides the complexion of the body, the temperature of the meat, and the substance of it, which are cheefly to be respected in the election of meats, the age of the person, custome of diet, and time of the yeere, ought not to be neglected, in which euery one may easily direct himselfe.</p>

               <head>Whether the ordinary vse of two meales in a day, be best for the preseruation of health?</head>
               <p>I Answer, omitting the precise obseruation of the time, countrey, and custome, that the vse of two competent meales in a day, <hi>viz.</hi> of Dinner and Supper, is generally best for them that are within the limits of 25, &amp; 60 yeeres, leading a studious, or sedentary kinde of life, if they desire to auoyd crudity, the originall of most diseases. But such as vse much exercise, or are of an hot and cholericke tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, may eat oftner, as three times in a day, and that more largely at each meale, for the restitution of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall moysture, which by reason of exercise, and a strong naturall heat, is much exhausted. Wherefore I aduise them, not to bee altogether fasting till dinner, but to breake their fast with this threefold caution, that they finde their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks <note place="margin">A threefold caution to be obserued in the vse of break. fasts.</note> to be cleane and empty, that the breake-fast be slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that of meats of light digestion, and that it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about foure houres before dinner. And heere I may not omit to aduertise all such as haue plethoricke and full bodies, especially liuing at rest, and which are of a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke <note place="margin">The vse som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of one meale in a day, for what bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</note> temperature, that they not onely eschew the vse of breake-fasts, but also oftentimes content themselues with one meale in a day: for by this meanes, nature being for a time disburthened, as it were, of meats, vseth all her power, in digesting and expelling the reliques, whereby it commeth to passe, that the ouer-plus of bloud is abated, raw humours concocted, all manner of excrements expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1906:95"/>
and the whole body consequently, reduced to a sound and healthy mediocrity. Heere it may bee demanded of such, as for the health of their bodies, can oftentimes bee contented with one meale a day, whether it were better to take it at supper, then at dinner. Whereunto I answer, that <note place="margin">Whether in eating one meale a day, were it better to take it at supper, then at dinner?</note> at supper, because in the night season, and in sleep, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are more intense to concoction, being not withdrawne vnto outward and animal actions; yet with this prouiso, that they sup not late, for great and late suppers are very offensiue to the whole body, especially to the head and eyes, by reason of the multitude of vapours, that ascend from the meats that haue been plentifully receiued. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must, after supper, refraine from sleepe, or lying downe, three houres at the least, and bee sometimes walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sometimes standing, and sometimes sitting, that the meats may be the better digested, and passed from the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, the vapours in some measure consumed, the eyes and the whole head consequently lesse annoyed. But if any shall erroniously accustome the vse of one meale in a day, and shall then lurch and deuoure so much, or more, as may well serue for two competent refections, as some, that vsually make but one meale in a day, are wont to doe, I must tell them, that two moderate refections were farre more commendable, and better for their health, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable feeding and glutting of themselues at once, whereby all the powers and faculties of the body are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, the stomacke weakned, crudities and obstructions occasioned.</p>
               <p>Heere also may those demand, that vsually make two <note place="margin">What space of time ought to intercede dinner and supper?</note> meales a day, what space of time ought to intercede the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Our vsuall time for dinner, in all places, is about eleuen of the clocke; and for supper, in most places, about six, according to which rule, wee commonly sup about six houres after we haue dined, allowing an houres space for a meale. I doe well approoue of the distance betweene the meales, and also of the allowance of an houres space for a meale; but if Students, that may command the time,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1906:95"/>
and others also, that lead a generous kinde of life, shall alter the time for refection, as to dine about ten, and to sup a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fiue, or six, according as their appetite, strengths, and disposition of body shall require, they shall haue my better approbation, and that for three reasons. The first is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not good to be so long fasting in the morning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for moyst and phlegmaticke bodies, as aforesayd: for the stomacke being ouer-long empty, attracteth from the intestines, and other parts, naughty fumes, and putrid humours, which doe not a little hurt both it and the head, especially in such as are of a cholericke temperature. The second is, because a larger time may be allowed, as shall be requisite, for the concoction and distribution of the meats receiued at dinner: for we ought not to cat againe, if wee will be diligent obseruers of our health, vntill the meat ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, be first concocted, and well auoyded out of the stomacke, and the appetite thereupon certaine, as it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly demonstrated. The third reason is, that they, who being subiect vnto rheumes, hauing supped by six, which order for Students is very well obserued in our Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will be the freer from nocturnall diseases and rheumes, vnto which Students, and such as liue a delicious, easie, and sitting kinde of life, are most subiect: and others that are free from rheumes, and nocturnall passions, hauing supped by seuen, will afterwards be the better disposed to rest, for it is not requisite, that they, especially hauing dry braines, should refraine lying downe to rest, aboue an houre or two after supper, which is onely conuenient to preuent obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And this order of supping being obserned, there will remaine a competent time, both for one and the other, before they goe to bed, as the space of three or two houres, for the meats in some measure to concoct, and descend from the stomacke: for there is nothing more hurtfull to such as are subiect to rheumes and obstructions, then to sleepe, or lye downe within two or three houres, euen after an ordinary and frugall meale, because the vapours that then arise from the meats, residing and concocting in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1906:96"/>
stomacke, beside the inhibiting of the distribution of them, are very offensiue to the head, being not by conuenient watching, and moderate motion of the body, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure discussed. Thus much concerning the ordinary refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for such as are within the limits of 25, &amp; 60 yeeres, wherof euery one may make vse and application agreeable to his state of body, and course of life. Now concerning the refections of others, that are not within the aforesayd limits of yeeres, a word or two breefly.</p>
               <p>They therefore that are past their declining age, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within the limit of olde age, as those bee, that are past 60, or 63 yeeres of age, may not precisely bee tyed to any fixed times for their refections, but may eat three or foure times a day, or oftner, as their stomackes shall require, a little at a time, by reason of the imbecility of their digestiue faculty. Neither may children by any meanes bee tyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fixed meales, for they, by reason of their great encrease of body, continuall motions, and dissipable substance through the pores, require much and often nourishment. And those also that are in their youthfull age, as from 14, to 25, being of hot and cholericke tempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ature, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue not attained vnto the Acme, or full height of their growing, as also by reason of their strong naturall heat, require much nourishment, and are not alwayes to be limited to two or three meales in a day. But such as are in their youthfull age, hauing grosse bodies, and of a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke temperature, may neuer exceede three meales in a day, but rather oftentimes content themselues with two at the most, that by this meanes, their moyst and crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may be concocted and abated, and their bodies kept within a laudable mediocrity. And heere I aduise all such as are solicitous of their health, to obserue at their meales three things, which I adde as an Appendix to that which hath beene spoken.</p>
               <p>The first is, that putting aside all businesses, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off all serious cogitations, they take their repast quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Three things to be obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1906:96"/>
troubled or meditating minde, for that will peruert the concoction, and cause the meats to corrupt in the stomack, by reason of the retracting of the spirits to the head. The second is, that they giue the meat due preparation for the stomacke, which is the exact chewing of it in the mouth: for the well chewing of the meat is a great furtherance to the well digesting of the same: and therefore they greatly erre, that eat ouer greedily, and snatch vp their meat hastily, because it is both hurtfull and indecent. The third is, that they reside not in the chaire of intemperance, that is, prolong not the time in eating and drinking superfluously, but onely sit so long at meale, as that they may giue vnto Nature a competent refection: for the ingestion of too much meat is burthensome and iniurious to all the bodie. But if they shall at any time exceed in eating and drinking, they must make amends with a following parcitie; as if the dinner shall be larger then ordinarie, let the supper be the lesse, or none at all: for there is no man, albeit very carefull of his health, which doth not in this now and then transcend his limits.</p>

               <head>Whether the eating of one or of diuers sorts of meats at a meale are alike profitable for the health of the bodie?</head>
               <p>IT is a common receiued opinion, that the eating of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sorts of meats at a meale, is for such as desire to liue in health vtterly hurtfull, and to be reiected: for by reason of the disparitie of their nature and substance, they are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at once well concocted, and distributed. Moreouer varietie and change of meats doe greatly please the pallat, and are as it were a spur vnto satietie. The strong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy bodies of agresticke men, which at their meales com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vse but one simple kinde of foode, doe seeme to approue this assertion, and also the weake and valetudinarie
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1906:97"/>
state of many others that vse to feede on diuers dishes at one time. Contrariwise he that will consider and looke <note place="margin">Reasons that make for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of meats at meale.</note> into the diuers constitution and fabricke of the parts of the bodie, shall finde that varietie is much more agreable vnto it, then singlenesse: for which cause doubtles, varietie of meats as it is delightfull, so also naturally to be desired, and therefore more profitable. Wherefore he that in this case condemueth varietie, seemeth also to reproue Nature; especially, because it putteth off a fastidious tendernes of the stomacke, and exciteth the appetite, and is also benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall for costiue bodies. Now from that which hath bin said, it is apparant, that the state of this controuersie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in this, that the vse of one sort of meat at a meale, is in its nature more profitable, and more safe, in so much as concerneth the naturall actions of the stomacke and liuer; but in regard of the variety of the parts and substance of the bodie, varietie of meats is much more agreable, and so on these grounds standeth the controuersie to be decided. In so much as the reasons of both opinions seeme to be of good force, there must a meane and rule be found out, that may direct when, and how the one, or the other, that is, one or d uers sorts of meats at a time, may be in vse, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for neither alwayes, neither to euery one, neither of euery sort, ought variety, or singlenes of meats to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. For the manifestation therefore and solution of <note place="margin">The solution of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie.</note> this matter, it must be obserued, that there are some kinds of meats that in nature and concoction differ litle, and some much: Such as in nature and concoction differ litle, may at one time be eaten of them that are in health, so they be not immoderately ingested: for too much meat, though it be of like nature, of easie concoction, and of good iuyce, is offensiue to the stomacke, and breedeth crudities. I say of them that are in health; for to such as are sickly and infirme, sundry meats at one time, though they differ litle in nature and concoction, are oftentimes troublesome and offensiue, because their digestiue facultie is weake, scarcely able to digest one simple kinde of meat. Wherefore it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1906:97"/>
cannot be granted, that meats, which in substance and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities differ much, may at one time be assumed, esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cially of them that haue weake stomacks, without hurt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the first assertion. But if they shall be neere of one substance, although of differing kinde, nor much disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in qualities, there is no let, but that they may at once be concocted, because the same heat, and same time onely will suffice for the concoction of them. For the reason wherefore varietie in meats is hurtfull, ariseth from the great inequalitie of their substance, or from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of qualities, or from the facilitie of corruption of one, with the disficultie of concoction with another, not verily from varietie. As put the Case: What doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit, but that Veale, Mutton, Capon &amp;c. may be eaten at one time? Neither the inequalitie of their substance, nor contrarietie of qualities, and therefore they are without any offence, with like labour concocted. The conclusion therefore may be, that it is better to eat onely of one sort of meat at a meale, then of sundry sorts, that in substance and qualities differ much; but if they shall be neere of a nature and qualitie, or not much differing, then varietie is to be preferred for the reasons before alleaged. Here I may not by the way ouer-passe without iust reproofe the <note place="margin">The eating of flesh and fish at one meale not wholsome for the bodie.</note> eating of flesh and fish at one and the same meale without any respect: for the most part of fish and flesh doe in no wise accord, but are of a very discrepant nature, not able to be well concocted togither in the stomacke, by reason whereof they daunt and ouerthrow the digestiue heat, and fill the stomacke with discordant humors, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produce strange and dolorous symptoms. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my counsell is to all such as are studious of their health, especially to them that haue weake stomacks, that they, eschew this euill custome, and relinquish it to belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, and them that haue vnbrideled appetites, who rather choose for a momentarie pleasing of their pallats, to liue fettered with Gouts, racked with Feuers, and tormented with stones, then by moderate and discreet feeding, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1906:98"/>
an happy, sound, and healthfull state of bodie. Now to that which is vrged against varietie of meats, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiseth to repletion, and sacietie, conuinceth not this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for that is not the fault of Nature, which is well pleased with a meane, but of ignorance, and indiscretion. Wherefore it was well said of <hi>Plato,</hi> that there is danger in varietie, for no other cause, but for that we easily yeeld to pleasure and sensualitie. The offence therefore, if the matter be rightly weighed, commeth not from the meat, but from our vnbrideled appetite. Neither is the example of agresticke people of any force: for the healthinesse and sound state of their bodies is not to be attributed to their plaine and simple foode, but to their great accustomed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and exercise. Varietie therefore of meats may offend with immoderation, neuer with temperancie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, I aduise all such as are respectiue of their health, especially that are of tender nature, and state of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not to eat at one time meats greatly differing in nature and concoction; for euery inequalitie of concoction, is a <hi>praeludium</hi> of cruditie, and corruption, which the liuer cannot correct. Neither at any time sensually to oppresse and labefie the digestiue facultie of the stomack, with too great varietie of meats, although they differ not much in nature and concoction: for to feede vpon more then foure dishes euen at a geniall meale, is somewhat immodest and excessiue.</p>
               <p>Here some may demaund, whether bread, which is the very ground of our nourishment, be, to be alwayes taken <note place="margin">Whether bread ought to be taken with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meats in any sutable measure and proportion.</note> in any certaine measure or quantitie? Whereunto I breifly answer, that it is, in regard of the meats that are eaten with it, to be taken in a diuers measure and proportion: for the bread that we eat, ought to be double to the flesh, so much and halfe so much as of eggs, and threefold vnto fish, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the moister sort, that the superfluous moisture of it, may by the siccitie of the bread, be attempered. They erre therefore that eat very litle bread with their meats: for you shall finde them to haue tumide bodies, or at least,

            <div type="subsection">
               <head>Whether it be better to suppe more liberally, then to dine?</head>
               <p>IT hath bin a great question, whether the Supper should be greater then the Dinner; or contrariwise, the Dinner greater then the Supper. But this doubt with certaine cautions may easily be discussed; for neither the one, nor the other may without limitation, and distinction be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Wherefore I answer, that it is more expedient for such as are healthy and strong to eat more at Supper, then at Dinner, and that for two reasons. The first, because the coldnes of the night, and sleepe ensuing doe greatly helpe concoction, through the regression of the spirits and heat into the interiour parts. The second is, because the time from Supper to breakfast, or Dinner is much longer, then from Dinner to Supper: and therefore it is very meete, that the Supper should in some congruent measure, be greater then the Dinner, according as the time following, in both respects, is more fit and commodious for conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Great and weighty affaires either publicke or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and also serious meditatious may be a third reason in time of such occasions, to eat more freely at Supper then at Dinner; because men after a full meale, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very vnapt vnto any labour or exercise, either of minde or bodie. And besides that, if they should eat much at Dinner, and afterwards by necessitie of their place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, vndergo any great or weighty businesse, they quickly subuert their state of bodie; and the reason is, because much meat doth first contract to the stomacke the spirits, and almost the whole force of Nature, for the concocting of it, which serious meditations, or businesses of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doe afterwards diuert to the head: whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that the spirits can neither sufficiently assist the braine in contemplation, nor the stomacke in conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but the meats in the stomacke, by reason of this
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1906:99"/>
distraction, being destitute of sufficient heat, become raw, and fill the bodie with grosse, putride, and flatulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. And here I must aduertise them that they erre not in eating more liberally at Supper then at Dinner, as to fill themselues till their bellies strout, and that they can scarce breath; for I minde not, nor in any oase approue such a large Supper, but a frugall rather; yet such in which is eaten more then at Dinner, for the reasons before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But this (as I haue said) is not so generally to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as that it may be expedient for euery man to eat <note place="margin">For whom it is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to sup more liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then to dine.</note> more liberally at Supper, then at Dinner: for it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for grosse and phlegmaticke bodies, for feare of a suddaine suffocation in sleepe, or at least, of troublesome and painefull sleepe, which in them, by reason of the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the passages, may through much phlegme, and a large Supper, often be occasioned. Neither for the same reason is it good for them to sup more liberally, that are very olde, or subiect to obstructions, or nocturnall disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for in such the distribution of then nourishment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly difficile, which alwayes indicateth a slender Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Neither is it conuenient for them to sup more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that are troubled with rheumes, or any infirmitie of the head, except there be a drie distemperature of the braine, because a full Supper repleteth the head with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors. Therefore to conclude this question, in making a larger Dinner or Supper fiue things are remarkeable: the concoction, the space betweene the meales, the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, the distribution, and the condition or state of the head. In respect of the concoction, of the space betweene the meales, and of businesses of great weight, it is better to sup more liberally then to dine, for the reasons before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But in respect of a difficile distribution, it is better to dine more liberally then to sup, because a more easie and better distribution of the nourishment into euery is made by day, when the bodie is in motion, then by night, when it is at rest. In like manner in all infirmities of the head, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be, as I haue said, a drie distemperature of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1906:99"/>
braines, it is better to dine more liberally, then to sup, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the head will be lesse anoyed with the vapors that ascend from the stomacke. And here by the way I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise all such as are subiect to distillations from the head to forbeare liquid meats at Supper, and to sup for the most part on rosted meats, because they are lesse vaporous; but for such as are wont, by reason of a drie braine, to passe the night without sleepe, or competent rest, moist and sorbile meats, because they best refresh the braine, and procure sleepe, are most profitable: and for the same reason, it is best for them to make a larger Supper, then Dinner, that the braine may more plentifully with vapors in the night season be refreshed.</p>

               <head>Whether it be better to begin, and also to end the meale with meat, then with drinke?</head>
               <p>THis is a question worthy of consideration, because an orderly manner of eating and drinking at meales doth much concerne the stomacke, and the good concoction of the meats. And forasmuch as it is not good for all men to begin and end their meales alike, I aduise all such as are respectiue of their health, to search out and consider throughly the nature and disposition of their stomacke, for there is in it humor, or siccitie, which will demonstrate in what manner it is best for them to begin and end their meales. Wherefore he that is studious of his health, ought to consider, whether his stomacke be moist or drie, or of a meane betwixt both. If there be excesse of moisture in the stomack, like as commonly is in them that be phlegmatick, then to begin the meale with drinke, is very hurtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it weakneth the stomacke and liuer, deiecteth the appetite, breedeth much winde and crudities: and it is also no lesse hurtfull to end with drinke, because it subuerteth the concoction, and abundantly filleth the bodie with crude and flatulent humors. But if there be excesse of dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the stomacke, like as commonly is in such as be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1906:100"/>
cholericke, then it is good to begin the meale with drinke, that the present thirst may be asswaged, the stomack moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the appetite, which ouer-much heat and drynes doth deiect, excited: and it is also no lesse auayleable to end with drinke, both because, that whatsoeuer of the meat shall remaine in the mouth of the stomacke, may therewith be carried toward the bottome of the same, where the concoction is perfected; and also that thirst, seeing that they are by nature very thirstie, may be preuented. If the stomacke shall be neither too moyst, nor too drie, but of an indifferent temperature, then, I say, it is best to begin the meale with meat, but to end it with drinke, to the end that no part of the meat may sticke, or be at a stay about the mouth of the stomacke, but may of it be carried into the ventricle, which is the bottome of the stomacke, the very promptuarie for the meats, and place of absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. And here I must aduertise them that shut vp their meale with drinke, that they doe it with a moderate draught, for to end the meale with much drinke doth, by euerting the concoction, cause eructations, and beget much winde and crudities. But those that are subiect <note place="margin">Wherewith it is best for them that be rheumaticke to finish and shut vp their meales.</note> vnto rheumes and distillations from the head, ought not in any wise, hauing not drie and thirstie stomacks, to shut vp the meale with drinke, and then also but with a very litle quantitie, because it increaseth rheumaticke humors; for it is much better for them to take alwayes some stypticke thing after meale (the which is likewise good, and farre better then Beere, for hot and drie bodies, that are rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke) that may inhibit the ascending of vapors, by closing vp the mouth of the stomack, as are, Quince preserued, the iuyce of Pomegranet of a middle fauour, which is neither too soure, nor too sweet, and the Conserue made of Red Roses: the vse of these vpon meales is very profitable for all such as are subiect vnto rheumes; but the Pomegranet is most agreable to them that haue hot, cholericke, and thirstie stomacks. Now whereas it hath bin shewed, that it is expedient for some constitutions to begin their meales
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1906:100"/>
with drinke, I must aduertise the Reader, that he take it with some limitation, as that there be no broths or po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <div type="subsection">
               <head>How many things ought those that are studious of their health, to obserue in the vse of drinke?</head>
               <p>THe necessitie and vse of drinke is first to preserue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall moysture: secondly, to make a good mixture, concoction, and distribution of the meats: all which, that they may be effected without inconueniences, three things must be regarded and obserued in the vse of drinke. The first is, that it be taken moderately at meales, and that not at two or three great draughts, but by sundry litle draughts: <note place="margin">To drinke litle and often at meales, is better, then to drinke much at once.</note> for abundance of drinke at meales, marreth the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both by causing the meats to fluctuate in the stomack, and also by weakning and relaxing the same: whereupon crude and phlegmaticke humors are abundantly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and consequently rheumes, fluxes, and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences to the bodie and members. And the drinke must be mixt with the meats, not by great, but by sundry litle draughts: for great draughts, doe weaken the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, infringe the naturall heat, which then is in conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, driue downe the meat too hastily, and corrupt the whole bodie with ouer much moysture and cruditie. Wherefore my counsaile to them is, that are respectiue of their health, that they drinke at their meales often and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>le at a time, and also that they swallow downe the drinke not hastily, but leasurely: for the drinke being mixt with the meats, by diuers litle draughts leasurely taken, well tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1906:101"/>
them without anoyance, both for concoction, and also for distribution. For examples sake: with vs to whom Beere is more agreable for an ordinarie drinke, then <note place="margin">A generall rule for drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at meales.</note> Wine, let this be a generall rule for taking of drinke at meales. Let the first draught be of an ordinarie Beere for thirst sake: the second also of Beere for mixture of the meats: the third and fourth of wine, or in want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, of stronger Beere, for the better mixture, concoction, and distribution of the meats; and if it be a geniall meale, or much larger then ordinarie, another draught of wine is also allowable. Afterwards vpon meats taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, let there be assumed a draught of ordinarie Beere, and therewith, or a litle meat superassumed, according to the nature of the stomacke, as is demonstrated in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent question, let the meale be concluded. But to this rule euery one may not exactly betake himselfe; for of drinking at meales, no certaine prescript can be constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because the drinke is to be increased, and diminished, according to the temperature and disposition of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack in heat, &amp; coldnes, drinesse, &amp; moysture, loosenes, or stipticknes; and also according to the temperature and substance of the meats. Wherefore you must consider whether the meat be correspondent to the stomacke, or not: As whether a drie meat be taken into a drie sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, or a moyst: for if a drie meat be receiued into a drie stomacke, then the drinke is to be increased; but if it be receiued into a moyst stomacke, then the drinke is to be taken in the same measure, as if both stomack and meat were of an indifferent temperature. In like manner the substance of the meat ought to be considered, whether it be grosse, or thin: if grosse, then a larger quantitie of drinke for the concocting and distributing of it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: if thin, then a lesse portion will susfice. The like Indication may be taken from the disposition of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, which if it be subiect to laxitie, then a lesse por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of drinke; if to stypticitie, then a greater is to be assumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1906:101"/>
The second thing that is to bee obserued in the vse of drinke is, that the drinke be attempered to the temperature of the aire, of the season, of the countrey, of the meats, and of the person receiuing it: for by this meanes, the natiue heat will bee the better moderated, and the body conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preserued in a sound and healthy temperature.</p>
               <p>The third thing which, concerning the vse of drinke, those that are studious of their health ought to obserue, is that they wholly betwixt dinner and supper, abstaine from drinke, excepting onely a Dilutiue draught, whereof I will heereafter speake, because it breedeth crudities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept necessity, as sometime in them that bee cholericke, or custome shall require it: the later of which, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is vicious, and therefore by little and little to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquished.</p>

               <head>Whether the drinking of wine at meales onely, betweene the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and not also before and after meale, bee expedient and profitable for the body?</head>
               <p>THE wholsomnesse of wine, in helping the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nutrition, and exhilarating the spirits and heart, moderately taken at meale, as the temperature of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and time of yeere shall require, is so well and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen, as that it needeth not any demonstration. But whether it bee expedient to drinke wine presently before, and after meale, it is a matter not so euident. In my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the whole determination of this doubt, is to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the nature of the wine, and from the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the stomacke, and disposition of the body that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it. For example sake; The drinking of wine before meale, is not conuenient for them that are young, or for any that haue hot stomacks, because it will distemper the liuer, cause in flammations, and consequently, marre the concoction of the meats. But for olde men, and all such as haue colde stomacks, a little draught of Sacke, or of any other wine of like nature, is very profitable before meales,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1906:102"/>
because it discusseth windy crudities, exciteth the appetite, and fortifieth the naturall heat for concoction; yet with this prouiso, that they euen forthwith goe to their meale, for otherwise it will by euaporation greatly offend the head. But verily I suppose the drinking of White or Rhenish wine, with a Limmon sliced and macerated therein, and a little also of the choycest sugar added thereto, especially if the Drinker bee of a tender pallate, to bee very wholsome and good, as a preparatiue draught before meales, for all bodies (except for such as are subiect to a defluxion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or else abound with much moysture and crudity) especially for such as are subiect to obstructions, because it cleanseth away slimie humours, adhering to the stomacke, openeth the obstructions of the mesaraicke veines, of the milt, of the liuer, and of the reines, exciteth the appetite, and erecteth the digestiue faculty of the stomack. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the drinking of wine immediately after meale, there are some that do altogether prohibit it, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good reason, becauseit hurteth the braine and sinewes, by euaporating from the stomacke; yet by their leaue, a little draught of Sacke, or of any other wine of like nature, may not be hurtfull, but rather oftentimes very profitable to them that haue colde and weake stomacks, so they bee not affected with infirmities of the head and sinewes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it helpeth the concoction, by comforting the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and repairing the naturall heat. But the drinking of a great draught is in no wise expedient, because it subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the concoction, by causing the meat to passe from the stomacke indigested, and greatly also offendeth the head with acute vapours.</p>

               <head>Whether it be profitable, or in any sort necessary for such as are in health, to drinke betweene meales?</head>
               <p>I Answer, that it is very hurtfull to drinke betweene meales, so long as the meats that haue beene taken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vndigested in the stomacke, and not past the first
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1906:102"/>
concoction (except great thirst and siccity of the stomacke and throte shall require it, and then onely a little is to bee taken, that the drinesse may bee somewhat mitigated) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it interrupteth and confoundeth the concoction, by disturbing the naturall heat that is in working, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently maketh the body to abound with crudities. But after that the meat is concocted and descended from the stomacke, which will bee in three or foure houres after the meale, it is good to drinke one meetly large draught, of White or Rhenish Wine, or stale Beere, or of Sacke, so the person that take it, be of a colde constitution, and so much the rather, if hee bee aged, and the season of the yeere also colde, to wash and cleanse out of the stomacke, the reliques of the meats, and to cause a more facile and speedy distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, or passage of the meats concocted through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saraicke veines vnto the liuer. Wherefore, this drinking of Wine or Beere betweene meales, as the constitution of the body shall require, may well bee termed both dilutiue and dilatiue, and is good for all men, especially for such as are subiect to obstructions of the stomacke, and mesaraicke veines, that conueigh the alimentary chyle or iuyce, which commeth of the meats, concocted in the stomacke to the liuer, to be made bloud.</p>

               <head>Whether the custome of drinking fasting in the mornings, and and like wise evenings, even at the time of going to bed, bee to be approoued and consented vnto?</head>
               <p>THE custome of drinking in the mornings fasting, a large draught of White wine, of Rhenish wine, or of Beere, hath almost with all men so farre preuailed, as that they iudge it a principall meanes for the preseruation of their health; whereas in very deede, it is, being without respect had of the state or constitution of the body, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately vsed, the occasion of much hurt and discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. For conuelling therefore of this vaine custome, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the drinking of a large draught fasting of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1906:103"/>
Wines, or of stale Beere, if it shall be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the body, is onely good for them that are of an hot and dry constitution, or subiect to obstructions, so they be not of a very cold and moyst temperature, that the siccity of the stomacke, may bee mitigated, and any slimie or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiue humour residing in it, in the liuer, veines, or reines remooued, and cleansed away: which the taking of a large draught fasting of stale Beere, or of one of the aforesayd wines, especially if a Limmon be macerated in it, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd, doe notably performe. But this may not so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be taken, as that it is allowable for euery one that hath an hot and dry state of body, to drink a large draught mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings fasting, for it is not conuenient for such as are very rheumaticke, though they are of a dry temperature of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, because it will greatly encreaser heumes; but to such, a small draught, to temper onely the siccity of the stomacke, is to be exhibited. And heere it may bee demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it bee good to drinke stronger wines fasting, as Muskadell, Malmsey, or such like: I know that it is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden, as pernicious to the body, which I likewise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre, in respect of the younger sort of people; but for the aged, in whom the radicall moysture and heat is decayed, I deeme it to bee very wholsome, especially in colde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and in the colde times of the yeere, because they are very comfortable and restoratiue: wherefore to drinke mornings fasting, a draught of Muskadell or Malmsey, and also to eat tosts of fine manchet-bread sopped therein, is no bad break fast for olde folkes, as I suppose. Hence it may appeare, that it is not altogether vnwholsome, to drinke strong winenext the heart, so there bee respect had to the age, to the time, and to the countrey. As concerning the vse of drinking, at the time of going to bed, I affirme that it is in no respect allowable, but for hot and cholericke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who commonly haue dry and thirsty stomacks, to whom a little draught of Beere, and that also but of meane strength, for allaying onely the siccity of the stomack, may be admitted. I say a little draught, because a large one may
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1906:103"/>
breede crudities in the stomacke, offend the braine, and make it subiect to distillations.</p>
               <p>The conclusion therefore is, that to drinke mornings fasting, is very hurtfull to the phlegmatick, and at the time of going to bed, for all bodies, except for them that haue dry and thirsty stomacks, because it filleth their stomacks and veines with crudities, and the braine with superfluous vapours. Wherefore the custome of drinking, mornings and euenings, is to be refrained, except of them, for whom it is conuenient, as aforesayd, and with great caution to be vsed of such, as are much subiect vnto rheumes, though the temperature of their body shall require it.</p>
