            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>GOod people all hark to my Call,</l>
               <l>Ile tell you all, what did befall,</l>
               <l>And happend of late;</l>
               <l>Our Noble valiant General <hi>Monk</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Came to the Rump, who lately stunk,</l>
               <l>With their Councel of State,</l>
               <l>Admiring what this man would do,</l>
               <l>His secret mind there's none could know,</l>
               <l>They div'd into him as much as they could,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>George</hi> would not be won with their silver and gold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Another invention then they sought,</l>
               <l>Which long they wrought for to be brought,</l>
               <l>To clasp him with they,</l>
               <l>Quoth <hi>Vane</hi> and <hi>Scot,</hi> Ile tell you what,</l>
               <l>We'l have our Plot, and he shall not,</l>
               <l>We'l carry the sway;</l>
               <l>Let's Vote him a thousand pound a year,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Hampton Court</hi> for he and his Heir,</l>
               <l>Quoth <hi>George</hi> indeed you'r free Parliament men,</l>
               <l>To cut a thong out of another mans skin.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They sent him then with all his hosts,</l>
               <l>To break our Posts, and raise our Ghosts,</l>
               <l>Which was their intent,</l>
               <l>To cut our Gates and Chains all down</l>
               <l>Unto the ground, this trick they found</l>
               <l>To make him be shent,</l>
               <l>This Plot the Rump did so accord,</l>
               <l>To cast an <hi>odium</hi> on my Lord,</l>
               <l>But in this task, he was hard put unto't</l>
               <l>'Twas enough to infect both his horse and his foot.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So when my Lord perceiv'd that night,</l>
               <l>What was their spight, he brought to light</l>
               <l>Their knaveries all.</l>
               <l>The Parliament of forty eight,</l>
               <l>Which long did wait came to him straight</l>
               <l>To give them a Fall,</l>
               <l>And some Phanatical people knew</l>
               <l>That <hi>George</hi> would give 'em their fatal due;</l>
               <l>For indeed he did requite them agen,</l>
               <l>He pull'd the Monster out of his den.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To the House our worthy Parliament,</l>
               <l>With good intent they boldly went</l>
               <l>To Vote home the King,</l>
               <l>And many hundred people more</l>
               <l>Stood at the door which waited for</l>
               <l>Good tidings to bring</l>
               <l>But some in the House whose hands were in blood</l>
               <l>In great opposition like Traitors they stood,</l>
               <l>And yet I believe, 'tis very well known,</l>
               <l>That those that were for him were twenty to one.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They call'd the League and Covenant in,</l>
               <l>To be read again to every man,</l>
               <l>But what comes next,</l>
               <l>All Sequestrations null and void,</l>
               <l>The people said, none should be paid,</l>
               <l>So this was the Text,</l>
               <l>For as I heard all the people say,</l>
               <l>They voted King <hi>Charls</hi> the second of <hi>May,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Bonefires burning, Bells did ring,</l>

               <l>Our General then to <hi>Dover</hi> goes</l>
               <l>In spight of foes or deadly blows,</l>
               <l>Saying, <hi>Vive le Roy,</hi>

               <l>And all the Glories of the Land,</l>
               <l>At his command there they did stand</l>
               <l>In Triumph and Joy.</l>
               <l>Good Lord what a Sumptuous sight 'twas to see</l>
               <l>Our good Lord General fall on his knee,</l>

               <l>Our Soveraign great,</l>
               <l>Lord Mayor in his Scarlet Gown</l>
               <l>With's Chain so long went through the Town</l>

               <l>And my Lord himself the Sword he bore,</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Vive le Roy</hi> the Gentry did sing,</l>
               <l>For General <hi>Monk</hi> rode next to the King,</l>
               <l>With acclamations shouts and cries,</l>
               <l>I thought they would have rend the Skies.</l>

               <l>The Conduits ravished with Joy,</l>
               <l>As I might say, did run all day</l>
               <l>Great plentie of wine,</l>

               <l>In's Velvet coat that could be got,</l>
               <l>In glorie did shine,</l>
               <l>There were all the Peers and Barons bold,</l>
