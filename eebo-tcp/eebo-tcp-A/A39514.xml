            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the PROCEEDINGS OF THE Lords and Commons, In the Parliament-Houſe, upon their firſt Convention; With the ſeveral Debates and Speeches relating thereunto.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſday</hi> being the 22<hi>d.</hi> of this Inſtant <hi>January,</hi> and the time appointed for the <hi>Meeting of the Convention,</hi> the Members, accordingly Elected, met at the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament-Houſe</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; Where, after the uſual Cuſtoms and Ceremonies of the Houſe were over, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers accordingly took their places; and Mr. <hi>Powle</hi> being choſen <hi>Speaker,</hi> made this ſmall Harrangue to the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The Diſtracted conditions of theſe Kingdoms, being now left without a Head or King, requires a ſpeedy and double Care from the Repreſentatives in this Houſe: And ſince there are few here but muſt of neceſſity know the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that attend a large and populous Nation, under no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain form of Government, The great Enormities, as Rapes, Murthers, Robberies, Devaſtations, and Private Pillages, that are very uſual and common in ſuch Caſes; every Man's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt, beſides the care of his Native Country, (a Duty Incumbent upon you all) muſt be ſufficient Motives. But one thing I am Commanded (by His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>) to put you in mind of, <hi>viz.</hi> The preſent Condition of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are now in a deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo vaſt an Army of <hi>Papiſts</hi> being in actual Arms in that Kingdom, and all Sworn Sacramentally Enemies, not only to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> but alſo to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> that unleſs ſome ſpeedy Care be taken for their Relief, they will not only undergo a general Maſſacre, but alſo that Kingdom will be Inevitably loſt to this Crown. I am alſo commanded to put you in mind of the Growth of <hi>France,</hi> and the aſpiring Hopes of their Turbulent Monarch, who, we know, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Enemy to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> but alſo a Sworn Foe to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> We therefore ought to be in ſuch a condition, not only to Defend our ſelves againſt the utmoſt of his Force, but alſo be able to give him ſo Powerful a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his own Country, that our former Conqueſts in <hi>France</hi> may be remembered, and the Provinces formerly belonging to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> recover'd.</p>
            <p>This Speech was received with a general ſatisfaction of the Houſe; and a Worthy Gentleman of the ſame, made this Reply.</p>

            <p>This being the general Opinion of the Houſe, a Committee was choſen out to preſent the Thanks of the Houſe to the Prince, and ſo ended the buſineſs of that Day.</p>

               <p>I do not doubt, but that by ſuch a Full and Free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the Nation, as is now met, the Ends of my Declaration will be attained: And ſince it hath pleaſed God Hitherto to bleſs my good Intentions with ſo great Succeſs, I truſt in him, that he will compleat his own Work, by ſending a Spirit of Peace and Union to influence your Councils, that no interruption may be given to an happy and laſting Settlement.</p>
