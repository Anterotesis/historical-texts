            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, of what Communion soever thou beest, so thou beest within the Communion of the oecumenicall Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in act or in desire, I offer this second Treatise of Schism to thy serious view and unpartiall Iudgment. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was a Vindication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> this later is a Vindication of my self, or rather both are Vindications of both. In vindicating the Church then, I did vindicate my self. And in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my self now, I doe vindicate the Church. What I have performed I doe not say, I dare not judg, the most moderate men are scarcely competent judges of their own works.</p>
            <p>No man can justly blame me for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring my spiritual Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in whose wombe I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, at whose brests I was nourished, and in whose bosome I hope to die. Bees, by
<pb facs="tcp:65027:3"/>
the instict of nature, doe love their hives, and Birds their nests. But God is my witness that, according to my uttermost talent and poor understanding, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to set down the naked truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, without either favor or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the two capital enemies of right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The one of which like a fals mirror doth represent things fairer and straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then they are, the other like the tongue infected with choler makes the sweetest meats to taste bitter. My desire hath been to have truth for my chiefest friend, and no enemy but error, If I have had any by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asse, it hath been desire of peace, which our common Saviour left as a Legacy to his Church, that I might live to see the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of Christendome, for which I shall alwaies bow the knees of my heart to the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ. It is not impossible but that this desire of unity may have produced some unwilling error of love, but certainly I am most free from the willfull love of error. In questions of an inferior natu
re Christ regards a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able intention much more then a right opinion.</p>
            <p>Howsoever it be, I submit my self and my poor indeavors, first, to the judgment
<pb facs="tcp:65027:3"/>
of the Catholick oecumenicall essentiall Church, which if some of late daies have indeavored to hisse out of the Schools as a fancy, I cannot help it. From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not so. And if I should mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the right Catholick Church out of humane frailty or ignorace, (which for my part I have no reason in the World to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, yet it is not impossible, when the Romanists themselves are divided into five or six severall opinions, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And seeing my adherence is fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the infallible rule of Faith, that is, the holy Scriptures, interpreted by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, then to mine own private judgment or opinions, although I should unwittingly fall into an error, yet this cordiall submission is an implicite retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation thereof, and I am confident will be so accepted by t

And then in the name of God let him follow the dictate of right reason. For as that scale must needs settle down whereinto most weight is put, so the minds cannot chuse but yeeld to the weight of perspicuous demonstration.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> Only I cannot but observe his complaint of <hi>extreme want of necessary Books,</hi> having all his own notes by him, and such store of excellent Libraries in <hi>Paris</hi> at his command, then which no City in the World affords more, few so good, certainly the main disadvantage in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half lies on my side.</p>
            <p>Neither will I meddle with his motives to undertake it. I have known him long to have been a Person of great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence among our English Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and doe esteem his undertaking to be an honour to the Treatise. <hi>Bos lassus fortiùs pedem figit,</hi> (said a great Father) <hi>The weary Oxe treadeth deeper.</hi> Yet there is one thing which I cannot reconcile, namely a fear <hi>least if the answer were longer deferred, the poison of the said Treatise might spread fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and become more incurable.</hi> Yet with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65027:5"/>
the same breath he tels us, that <hi>I bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new worth answering.</hi> And in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the first Chapter, that <hi>no other Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Minister (for ought he knows) hath hitherto dared to defend the Church of</hi> England <hi>from Schisme in any especiall Treatise.</hi> Yes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, he may be pleased to inform himself better at his leisure. What, is the Treatise so dangerous and infectious? Is the way so unbeaten? And yet nothing in it but what is triviall? Nothing new that deserves an answer? I hope to let him see the contrary. He who disparageth the work which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to confute, woundeth his own credit through his adversaries sides. But it seemeth that by surveying over hastily, he did quite oversee all our principall evidence, and the chiefest firmaments of our cause. I am sure he hath quite omitted them, I shall make bold now &amp; then to put him in mind of it.</p>
            <p>Hence he proceedeth to five observable points, which he esteemeth so highly, that he beleeveth <hi>they alone may serve for a full refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my Book.</hi> Then he must have very favourable Judges. His first point to be noted is this, that <hi>Schisme is a substantiall division, or a division in some substantiall part of the Church.</hi> And <hi>that the substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all parts of the Church are these three, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, Communion in Sacraments and Lawfull Ministery.</hi> I confesse I am not acquainted with this language, to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, Communion in Sacraments
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65027:5"/>
and lawfull Ministery which are no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be substantiall parts of any thing, either Physicall or Metaphysicall. He defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Church to be a <hi>Society</hi>: can these be substantiall parts of a Society? as much as rationability being but a faculty or specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call quality is a substantiall part of a man, because it is a part of his definition, or his essentiall difference.</p>
            <p>But I suppose that by substantiall parts he means essentialls,<note place="margin">Three Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials of a true Church.</note> as we use to say the same Church in substance, or the same reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in substance, that is in essence. And if so, then he might have spared the labour of proving it, and pressing it over and over. For we maintain that an entire profession of saving truth, a right use of the Word and Sacraments, and an union under lawfull Pastors, being taken joyntly, doe distinguish the Church essentially from all other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties in the World. We have been told heretofore of other notes of the Church which did not please us so well, as Antiquity, and Universality, and Splendour, &amp;c. which may be present or absent, with the Church or without the Church. As if a man should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe money by the weight and colour and sound, or describe a King by his Crown and Scepter, or describe a man as <hi>Plato</hi> did, to be a living creature with two leggs without fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which <hi>Diogenes</hi> easily confuted by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a naked Cock into his School, saying, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Plato's man.</hi> Such separable communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Yet I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell him, that this liberall concession will not promote his cause one hairs breadth: As will appear in the sequell of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

by God, of divine institution, that are not essentiall nor necessary <hi>necessitate medii.</hi> The want of them may be a great defect, it may be a great sinne, and yet if it proceed from invincible necessity or invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ignorance, it doth not absolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from Heaven. The essences of things are unalterable, and therefore the lowest degree of saving Faith, of Ecclesiasticall discipline, of Sacramentall Communion that ever was in the Catholick Church, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preserve the true being of a Church. A reasonable Soul and an humane Body are the essentiall parts of a man. Yet this body may be greater or lesser, weaker or stronger, yea it may lose a legg or an arm, which before they were lost, were subordinate parts of an essentiall part, and yet continue a true humane body though imperfect and maimed, without destroying the essence of that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall man. Sensibility and a locomotive faculty are essentiall to every living creature. Yet some living creatures doe want one sense, some another, as sight, or hearing. Some flie, some runne, some swimme, some creep, some scarcely creep: And yet still the essence is preserved. Naturalists doe write of the Serpent that if there be but two inches of the body left with the head,<note place="margin">Actuall want of essentials not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive to God.</note> the Serpent will live, a true Serpent, but much maimed and very imperfect.</p>
            <p>Much lesse may we conclude from hence that the want of true essentialls in cases of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65027:7"/>
invincible necessity doth utterly exclude from Heaven, or hinder the extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of divine Grace: No more then the actuall want of circumcision in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse did prejudice the Jews. God acts with means, without means, against means. And where the ordinary means are desired and cannot be had, he supplies that defect by extraordinary Grace. So he fed the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites in a barren Wildernesse where they could neither sow nor plant, with <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven. True Faith is an essentiall, yet Infants want actuall Faith. Baptism the laver of regeneration is an essentiall, yet there may be the baptism of the Spirit, or the baptism of Blood, where there is not the Baptism of water. He that desires Baptism and cannot have it, doth not therefore want it. So likewise Ecclesiasticall discipline is an essentiall of a true Church, yet <hi>R. C.</hi> himself will not conclude from thence that actuall subordination to every link in the chain of the hierarchy is so essentially necessary, that without it there can be no salvation. Thus he saith, <hi>We professe that it is necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be under the Pope as Vicar of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ch</hi> 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>But we say not that it is necessary</hi> necessitate medii, <hi>so as none can be saved who doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually beleeve it, unlesse it be sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to them.</hi> What he confesseth, we lay hold on, that subjection to the Pope, is not essentially necessary.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65027:7"/>
by Christ, we doe altogether deny. I urge this only for this purpose, that though Ecclesiasticall discipline be an essentiall of the Church; yet (by his own confession) every particular branch of it may not be essentiall, though otherwise lawfull and necessary by the commandment of God.</p>
            <p>But if by profession of faith he understand particular formes of confession,<note place="margin">Particular Rites, Formes, Opinions, no Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials.</note> often differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in points of an inferiour nature, not comprehended either actually or virtually in the Apostles Creed, or perhaps erroneous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinons: If by communion in Sacraments he understand the necessary use of the same rites, and the same forms of Administration, whereof some may be lawfull, but not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be used; others unlawfull, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be refused: Lastly if by lawfull ministery he understand those links of the Hierarchy, which have either been lawfully established by the church, as Patriarchall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; or unlawfully usurped, as Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power; we are so farre from thinking that these are essentiall to the Church, that we beleeve that some of them are intollerable in the Church.</p>
            <p>The other Branch of this first note, that <hi>Schisme is a division in som substantiall parts of the Church of God,</hi> is true, but not in his sense. All Schisme is either between Patriarchall Churches, or Provinciall Churches, or Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Churches, or some of these respectively, or some of their respective parts. But his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65027:8"/>
sense is, that all Schism is about the essence of Religion.<note place="margin">Schism is not always about es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entials.</note> A strange paradox! Many Schisms have arisen in the Church about Rites and Ceremonies, about Precedency, about Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, about the Rites and Liberties of particular Churches, about matter of Fact. Obstinacy in a small error is enough to make a Schism. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> tel's us of Divisions and Factions and <hi>Schisms</hi> that were in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>; yet these were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the essentialls of Religion, but about a right-handed error, even too much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Pastors. The Schism between the Roman and Asiatick Churches, about the observation of Easter, was farre enough from the heart of Religion. How manny bitter Schisms have been in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, when two or three Popes at a time have challenged Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, and involved all <hi>Europe</hi> in their Schismatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? Yet was there no manner of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about Faith or Sacrements, or holy O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or the Hierarchy of the Church, but meerly about matter of Fact, whose election to the Papacy was right.</p>
            <p>From the former ground, <hi>R. C.</hi> makes two collections, First that <hi>Schism is a most grievous crime, and a greater sinne than Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, because it tendeth to the destruction of the whole Church, whose essence consisteth in the union of all her substantiall parts, and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in the division of them.</hi> What doth this note concern the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65027:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is altogether guiltles both of Schism and Idolatry? I wish the Church and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> may be as able to clear themselves. I am no Advocate for Schism, Yet this see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth strange paradoxicall doctrine to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian eares.<note place="margin">Schism is not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sin than Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</note> What is all Schism a more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious sin than formall Idolatry? who can beleeve it? Schism is a defect of Charity, Idolatry is the height of impiety, and a publick affront put upon Almighty God. Schism is immediately against men, Idolatry is directly against God. And the Fathers hold that <hi>Iudas</hi> sinned more in despairing and hanging himself, than in betraying his Master, because the later was against the humanity, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer against the Divinity of Chriist. Idolatry is a spirituall Adultery, and so stiled every where in holy Scriptures. A scolding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Wife is not so ill as an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress; neither is that Souldier who straggles from his Camp, or deserts his Generall out of passion, so ill as a professed Rebel, who attempts to thrust some base Groom into his Soveraigns Throne.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10.21.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls Idols <hi>Devils,</hi> and their Altars <hi>the tables of Divels.</hi> Can any sinne be more grievous than to give divine honour to the Divel?</p>
            <p>It is true that some Schism in respect of some circumstance is worse than some Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as when the Schism is against the light of a mans knowledge, and the Idolatry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of ignorance: But the learned Surveior knoweth very well, that it is a gross
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65027:9"/>
fallacy to argue <hi>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciser,</hi> to applie that which is spoken respectively, to some one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as if it were spoken absolutely to all intents and purposes: as if one should say that many men were worse than beasts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause each kinde of beasts hath but one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar fault, and that by naturall necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Lion cruelty, the Fox subtilty, the Swine obscenity, the Wolf robbery, the Ape flattery, whereas one may finde an epitome of all these in one man, and that by free election; yet he were a bad disputant who should argue from hence that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is absolutely worse than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of brute beasts.</p>

service of God, to be adjuments to attention and devotion, furtherances of edification, helpes of memory, exercises of Faith, the the leaves that preserve the fruit, the sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll that preserves the kernell of Religion from contempt. And all this with due modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so as neither to render Religion sordid and sluttish, nor yet light and garish, but comely and venerable.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> for communion in Sacraments, we have forsaken no Sacraments either insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Christ, or received by the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians. We refuse no Communion with any catholick Christians at this day, and particularly with those <hi>ancient Churches</hi> which he mentions, though we may be, and have been misrepresented one unto another: yea though the Sacraments may be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in some of them not without manifest imperfection, whilst sinfull duties are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon us as conditions of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Under this caution we still retein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Sacraments with Roman Catholicks. If any person be baptized or admitted into holy Orders in their Church, we baptize them not, we ordain them not again. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then have we forsaken the Communion of the Roman Church in Sacraments? not in their ancient Communion of genuine Sacraments, but in their septinary number, and suppositious Sacraments, which yet we retein for the most part as usefull and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rites, but not under the notion of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65027:14"/>
Sacraments: not in their Sacraments, but in their abuses and sinfull injunctions in the use of the Sacrament. As their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of them in a tongue unknown, where the people cannot say Amen to the prayers and thanksgivings of the Church, contrary to Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> As their deteining the Cup from the Laity, contrary to the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 19 <hi>Math.</hi> 26.27</note> 
               <hi>drink ye all of this,</hi> that is, not all the Apostles only; for the Apostles did not consecrate in the presence of Christ, and (according to the doctrine of their Schools, and practise of their Church) as to the participation of the Sacrament at that time, were but in the condition of Laymen. As their injunction to all Communicants to adore, not only Christ in the use of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to which we doe readily assent, but to adore the Sacrament it self. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as their double matter and form in the ordination of a Priest, never known in the Church for above a thousand years after Christ. These and such like abuses were the only things which we did forsake: so as I may truly say, <hi>non tellus Cymbam, tellurem Cymba, reliquit</hi>: It was not we that did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them in the Communion of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, but it was their Sacraments that did forsake us: And yet we doe not censure them for these innovations in the use of the Sacraments or the like, nor thrust them out of the communion of the Catholick Church, but provide for our selves, advise them as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65027:14"/>
Brethren, and so leave them to stand or fall to their own Master. So on our parts there is a reformation, but no separation.</p>
            <p>His third point is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> that <hi>Protestants vary in giving the pretended just cause, of their separation from the Roman Church. For at the first their only cause was the abuse of some that preached Indulgences. Since some others give the adoration of the blessed Sacrament, or communion in one kind; others give the Oath made by</hi> Pius <hi>the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>which they call a new creed; others other causes. Which variety is a certain sign of their uncertainty of any true just cause of their separation.</hi> That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners and Preachers of Indulgences, and the envy of other Orders, and the passionate heat of the Court of <hi>Rome, (tange montes &amp; fumigabunt,</hi> touch the high mountains and they will smoak,) did contribute much to the breach of this part of Christendome, is conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssedly true.</p>
            <p>But it is not only the abuse of some Preachers of Indulgences,<note place="margin">The true cause of the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> but much more the abuse of Indulgences themselves which we complain of, that a treasury should be composed of the blood of Christ, and the sufferings and supererogatory works of the Saints, to be disposed by the Pope for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. What is this, but to mingle Heaven and Earth together, the imperfect works of man, with the sacrified blood of Christ? Neither was it the Doctrine and abuse of Indulgences alone, but the injunction to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65027:15"/>
adore the Sacrament also and Communion in one kind and the new Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, or the new Articles since comprised in that Creed, and the Monarchy of the Pope by divine right, and sundry other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses and innovations all put together, which gave just cause to some Protestants to separate themselves, so far as they were active in the separation. But we in <hi>England</hi> were first chased away by the Popes Buls. If these abuses were perhaps not discovered, or at least not pleaded all at once, what wonder is it. <hi>Dies diei eructat verbum, &amp; nox nocti indicat scientiam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.</note> day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge.</p>
            <p>His fourth point, which he saith is much to be noted, is reduced by himself to a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism, <hi>Whosoever separate themselves in substance (that is in essentials) from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Catholick and true Church in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, are true Schismaticks. But Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants have separated themselves in substance from the Roman Church, which is a Catholick and true Church in substance, therefore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are true Schismaticks.</hi> His proposition is proved by him, because the substances of things doe consist in <hi>indivisibili</hi> and the changing of them either by addition or by subtraction is not a reformation but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them. And therefore it is a contradiction to say that a Church which hath the substance or the essence of a Church,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65027:15"/>
can give just cause to depart from her in her essentials, and not only a contradiction but plain blasphemy, to say that the true Church of Christ in essence, his mysticall body, his Kingdome, can give just cause to forsake it in essentials. The assumption is proved by him, because we confesse that the Roman Church is a true Church in substance, and yet have forsaken it in the essentials of a true Church, namely the Sacraments, and the publick worship of God.</p>
            <p>His proposition admits little dispute. I doe acknowledge that no Church true or fals, no society of Men or Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, good or bad, can give just or sufficient cause, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the essentials of Christian Religion, or any of them, and that whosoever do so, are either heriticks, or schismaticks, or both, or which is worse then both, down right Infidels and Apostates. For in forsaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any essential of Christian Religion they forsake Christ and their hopes of Salvation in an ordinary way. But here is one thing which it behoveth <hi>R. C.</hi> himself to take notice of, That if the essences of all things be indivisible,<note place="margin">Essences of things are indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied by addition as well as subtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and are destroied as well by the addition as by the subtraction of any essential part, how will the Roman Church or Court make answer to Christ for their addition of so many (not explications of old Articles but) new pretended necessary essentiall Arricles of Faith, under pain of damnation, (which by his own rule is to destroy the Christian
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65027:16"/>
Faith,) who have coined new Sacraments, and added new matter and form, that is, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials to old Sacraments, who have multiplied sacred O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ders, and added new lincks to the chain of the Hierarchy. This will concern him and his Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch more neerly, then all his notes and points doe concern us.</p>
            <p>Concerning his assumption, two questions come to be debated: first, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be a true Church, or not: secondly,<note place="margin">How the Church of Rome is and is not a true Church.</note> whether we have departed from it in essentials. Touching the former point, a Church may be said to be a true Church two waies, metaphysically and morally. Every Church which hath the essentials of a Church, how tainted or corrupted soever it be in other things, is metaphysically a true Church, for <hi>ens &amp; verum convertuntur.</hi> So we say a theef is a true man, that is a reasonable creature, consistng of an humane body and reasonable soul. But speaking morally he is a faulty filching vitious person and so no true man. So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is metaphysically a true Church, that is to say, hath all the essentials of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, but morally it is no true Church, because erroneous; contraries, as truth and errour may be predicated of the same subject, so it be not <hi>ad idem, secundum idem, &amp; codem tempore.</hi> Truth in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls and errour in superstructures may consist together.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</note> The foundation is right but <hi>they have builded much hay and stuble
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65027:16"/>
upon it</hi>: And in respect of this foundation she may, and doubtless doth bring forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true Members of Christ, Children of God, and Inheritors of the Kingdome of Heaven. The Church of the Jews was most erroneous and corrupted in the dayes of our Saviour; yet he doubted not so say <hi>Salvation is of the Iews.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26.</note> I know it is said, that <hi>Christ hath given himself for his Church to sanctifie it, and cleanse it, and present it to himself a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle:</hi> But that is to be understood incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actively in this life; the perfection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation thereof is to be expected in the life to come.</p>
            <p>To the second question, whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Reformation have forsaken the essentials of the Roman Church? I answer negatively, we have not. If weeds be of the essence of a Garden,<note place="margin">We have not left the Roman Church in essentialls.</note> or rupt Humors, or Botches, or Wennes, and Excrescences be of the essence of man: If Errors, and Innovations, and Superstitions and sperfluous Rites, and pecuniary Arts be of the essence of a Church, then indeed we have forsaken the Roman Church in its essentials: otherwise not. We retein the same Creed to a word, and in the same sense by which all the primitive Fathers were saved; which they held to be so sufficient, that in a general Councell they did forbid all persons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Con. eph. p.</hi> 2. <hi>Act</hi> 6 <hi>c</hi> 7.</note> under pain of deposition, to Bishops and Clerks, and anathematisation to Laymen,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65027:17"/>
to compose or obtrude any other upon any Persons converted from Paganisme or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisme. We retein the same Sacraments and Discipline which they reteined; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive our holy Orders by lineall succession from them, we make their doctrine and their practise (under the holy Scriptures, and as best Expositors thereof) a Standard and Seal of truth between the Romanists and us. It is not we who have forsaken the essence of the modern Roman Church by substraction, But they who have forsaken the essence of the ancient Romau Church by addition. Can we not forsake their new Creed unless we forsake their old faith? Can we not reduce the Liturgy into a known tongue, but presently we forsake the publick worship of God? Can we not take away their tradition of the Patine and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and reform their new matter and form in Presbyterian ordination; which antiquity did never know, which no Church in the World besides themselves did ever use, but presently we forsake holy Orders? The truth is, their errours are in the excesse, and these excesses they themselves have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be essentials of true Religion: And so upon pretence of interpreting, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude into the Legislative office of Christ; and being but a Patriarchall Church, doe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe a power which the universal Church did never own, that is, to Constitute new es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials of Christian Religion. Before the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65027:17"/>
determination their excesses might have past for probable Opinions or indifferent Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but after the determination of them as Articles of faith, <hi>extra quam non est salus, without which there is no salvation</hi> (they are the words of the Bull) they became inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable errors. So both <hi>the pretended contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction &amp; the pretended blasphemy</hi> are vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an instant. It is no contradiction to say, that a true humane body in substance may require purgation, nor blasphemy to say, that a particular Church (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is) may erre, and (which is more than we charge them withall) may apostate from Christ. In the mean time we preserve all due respect to the universal Church, and doubt not to say with St. <hi>Austin</hi> that <hi>to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sense thereof,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>is most insolent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>fifth point to be noted</hi> hath little new worth noting in it,<note place="margin">Nor differ in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Roman Church.</note> but tautologies and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of the same things over and over. <hi>Some Protestants</hi> (saith he) <hi>doe impudently deny that they are substantially separated from the Roman Church.</hi> If this be impudence, what is ingenuity? If this be such a gross er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for man to be ashamed of, what is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth? We expected thanks for our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and behold reviling for our good will. He might have been pleased to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what himself hath cited so often out of my vindication, That <hi>our Church since the Reformation is the same in substance that it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65027:18"/>
was before.</hi> If the same in substance, then not substantially separated. Our comfort is that <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> alone were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ino the Land of promise, because they had been Peace-makers in a seditious time, and indeavoured not to enlarge but to make up the breach. He addes that <hi>the chiefest Protestants doe confess that they are substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially separated from the Roman Church.</hi> Who these chiefest Protestants are, he tel's us not, nor what they say, but referrs us to another of his Treatises which I neither know here how to compass, nor, if I could, deem it worth the labor. When these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Protestants come to be viewed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and seriously with indifferent eies, it will appear that either by [<hi>substantially</hi>] they mean really, that is to say that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between us are not meere logomachies, or contentions about words and different formes of expression only, but that there are some reall controversies between us both <hi>in credendis</hi> and <hi>agendis,</hi> and more and more, reall <hi>in agendis,</hi> than <hi>in credendis.</hi> Or secondly that by [substance] they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not the old Essentials or Articles of Christian Religion, wherein we both agree, but the new Essentials or new Articles of Faith lately made by the Romanists, and comprehended, in the Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, about which we doe truly differ. So we differ substantially in the language of the present Romanists: But we differ not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65027:18"/>
in the sense of the primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The generation of these new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is the corruption of the old Creed. Or lastly, if one or two Protestant Authours either bred up in hostility against new <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Hanniball</hi> was against old <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the heat of contention, or without due consideration, or out of prejudice or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or a distempered zeal, have overshot themselves, what is that to us? Or what doth that concern the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>?</p>
            <p>He, saith St. <hi>Austine,</hi> told the Donatists, that <hi>though they were with him in many things yet if they were not with him in few things, the many things wherein they were with him would not profit them.</hi> But what were these few things wherein St. <hi>Austine</hi> required their communion? Were they abuses, or innovations, or new Articles of Faith? No, no, the truth is, St. <hi>Austine</hi> professed to the Donatists, that <hi>many things and great things would profit them nothing</hi> (not only if a few things, but) <hi>if one thing were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: videant quam multa &amp; quam magna nihil prosint,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aust y.</hi> 1. <hi>de hapt. c.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>si unum quidem defu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rit, &amp; videant quid sit ipsum unum. And let them see what this one thing is.</hi> What was it? <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> For the Donatists most uncharitably did limit the Catholick Church to their own party, excluding all others from hope of salvation, just as the Romanists doe now, who are the right successours of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65027:19"/>
in those few things, or rather in that one thing. So often as he produceth St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> against the Donatists, he brings a rod for himself. Furthermore he proveth out of the Creed and the Fathers that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church is necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to what purpose I doe not understand, (unlesse it be to reprove the unchristian and uncharitable censures of the Roman Court.) For neither is the Roman Church, the Catholick Church, nor a communion of Saints a communion in errours.</p>
            <p>His sixth and last point, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to judicious Protestants, is this, that though it were not evident, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church is Schismaticall, but only doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Yet it being evident, that the Roman Church is not schismaticall, because (as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Sutcliff</hi> confesseth) <hi>they never went out of any known Christian Society,</hi> nor can any Protestant prove that they did, it is the most prudent way for a man to doe for his Soul as he would doe for his lands, liberty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or life, that is to chuse the safest way,<note place="margin">It is not lawfull or prudent to leave the English Church and adhere to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for fear of Schism.</note> namely to live and die free from schism in the communion of the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>I answer, first, that he changeth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the question. My proposition was that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is free, from schism: he ever and anon enlargeth it to all Protestant Churches, and what or how many Churches he intendeth; under that name and notion I know not. Not that I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65027:19"/>
censure any forrein Churches, with whose lawes and liberties I am not so well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as with our own. But because I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the case of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be as cleer as the Sun at noon-day, and am not willing for the present to have it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with heterogeneous disputes. So of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he stumbleth upon this mistake I must make bold to tell him that he concludes not the contradictory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I answer, that he disputes <hi>ex non concessis,</hi> laying that for a foundation granted to him, which is altogether denied him, namely that it is a doubtfull case, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>England</hi> be schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or not. Whereas no Church under Heaven is really more free from just suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of schism then the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as not censuring nor excluding uncharitably from her communion; any true Church which retains the essentials of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I answer, that it is so far from being evident that the Roman Church is guiltlesse of schism, that I wish it were not evident that the Roman Court is guilty of formall schism, and all that adhere unto it, and maintain its censures of materiall schism. If it be schism to desert altogether the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of any one true particular Church, what is it not only to desert, but cast out of the Church by the bann of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, so many Christian Churches,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65027:20"/>
over which they have no jurisdiction, three times more numerous then themselves, and notwithstanding some few (perhaps) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper expressions of some of them, as good or better Christians and Catholicks as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; who suffer daily, and are ready to suffer to the last drop of their blood for the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>If contumacy against one lawfull single superiour be schismaticall, what is rebellion against the soveraign Ecclesiasticall Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that is a generall Councell? But I am far from concluding all indistinctly. I know there are many in that Church, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm in the doctrine of the Councels of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile,</hi> attributing no more to the Pope then his <hi>principium unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and subjecting both him and his Court; to the jurisdiction of an Oecumenicall Councell.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I answer that supposing, but not granting, that it was doubtfull, whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> were schismaticall or not, and supposing in like manner that it were evident that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not schismaticall, yet it was not lawfull for a son of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; to quit his spirituall mother. May a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his due obedience to a lawfull Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour upon uncertain suspicions? No. In doubtfull cases it is alwaies presumed <hi>pro Rege &amp; lege,</hi> for the King and for the Law, Neither is it <hi>lawfull</hi> (as a Father said
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65027:20"/>
some Virgins, who cast themselves desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into a River, for fear of being defloured) <hi>to commit a certain crime for fear of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</hi> Yea to rise yet one step higher, though it were lawfull, yet it were not pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but folly, for a man to thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into more, more apparent, more real danger, for fear of one lesser, lesse apparent, and remoter danger. Or for fear of <hi>Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> to run headlong into <hi>Scylla.</hi> He who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes the English Church for fear of Schism, to joyn in a stricter communion with <hi>Rome,</hi> plungeth himself in greater and more reall dangers, both of Schism and Idolatry, and Heresy. A man may live in a schismaticall Church, and yet be no Schismatick, if he erre invincibly, and be ready in the preparation of his mind to receive the truth whensoever God shall reveal it to him, nor want (<hi>R. C.</hi> himself being Judge) either Faith, or Church, or Salvation.</p>
            <p>And to his reason,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> whereby he thinks to free the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from Schism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they never went out of any Christian Society, I answer two waies, first, It is more schismaticall to cast true Churches of Christ out of the communion of the Catholick Church, either without the Keies or Clave errant with an erring Key, then meerly and simply to goe out of a particular Church. This the Romanists have done, although they had not done the other. But they have done the other also. And therefore I add

my second answer by naming that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Society, out of which the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi> departed, even the ancient primitive Roman Church, not locally, but morally, which is worse, by introducing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in Faith, Liturgy, and use of the Sacraments, whereby they did both divide themselves schismatically from the externall communion of the true, primitive, uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Church of Christ, and became the cause of all following separation. So both waies they are guilty of Schism, and a much greater Schism then they object to us.</p>

               <hi>To communicate with Schismaticks is to be guilty of Schism. But the English Church joynes in communion of Sacraments and publick Praiers with Schismaticks, namely Puritans, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants.</hi> This is inculcated over and over again in his book. But because this is the first time that I meet with it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had rather be before hand with him,

And first I deny his proposition. To communicate with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Schismaticks in the same publick Assemblies, and to be present with them at the same divine offices is not alwaies Heresy or Schism, unlesse one communicate with them in their hereticall or schismaticall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

So they communicated with Arrians, but not in Arrianism; with hereticks, but not in Heresy. Take another instance, the Catholicks and Novatians did communicate and meet together in the same Assemblies. <hi>Illo autem tempore parum aberat quin Novatiani &amp; Catholici penitus conspirassent.</hi>

At that time it wanted little that the Novatians and Catholicks did not altogether conspire in one; for having both the same Faith concerning God, suffering the same persecution from the Arrians, and being both involved in the same calamities, they began to love one another, to assemble together, and to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; And they decreed from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to communicate one with another.</hi> The primitive Catholicks thought it no Schism to communicate with Novatians, that is with Schismaticks, so long as they did not communicate with them in their Novatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, that is, in their Schism. Have the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Protestants matriculated themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their congregational Assemblies? Have they justified the unwarrantable intrusion of themselves into sacred Functions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a lawfull calling from Christ or his Church? Or their dispensing the greatest mysteries of religion with unwashen, or it may be, with bloody hands? As for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with them in a schismaticall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, it is impossible; they have no Liturgy at all, but account it a stinting of the Spirit. And for the Sacrament of the blessed body and blood of Christ, it is hard to say whether the use of it among them be rarer in most places, or the congregations thinner. But where the ministers are unqualified, or the form of Administration is erroneous in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65027:23"/>
essentials, or sinfull duties are obtruded as necessary parts of Gods service, the English Protestants know how to abstain from their communion, let the Roman Catholicks look to themselves; for many say (let the Faith be with the authours) that sundry of the Sons of their own Church, have been greater sticklers in their private Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and publick Assemblies, then many Protestants.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I deny his assumption (that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth joyn in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Sacraments and publick Praiers with any Schismaticks. What my thoughts are of those whom he terms <hi>Puritans and Independants,</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d soon after they were generated for want of fit organs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I passe by them, to that which is more materiall. If the Church of <hi>England</hi> have joyned in Sacraments and publick Praiers with Schismaticks, let him shew it out of her Liturgy, or out of her Articles, or out of her Canons and constitutions, for by these she speaks unto us. Or let him shew that any genuine son of hers by her injunction, or direction, or approbation, did ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65027:23"/>
with Schismaticks: or that her principles are such as doe justify or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Schism, or lead men into a communion with Schismaticks: otherwise then thus a nationall Church cannot communicate with Schismaticks. If to make Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions against Schismaticks be to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them: If to punish their Conventicles and clandestine meetings be to frequent them: If to oblige all her sons who enter into holy Orders, or are admitted to care of souls, to have no communion with them, be to communicate with them, then the Church of <hi>England</hi> is guilty of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with Schismaticks, or otherwise not.</p>
            <p>But I conceive that by the English Church he intends particular persons of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. If so, then by his favour he deserts the cause, and alters the state of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let himself be judge whether this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence be good or not. Sundry English Protestants are lately turned Romish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes; therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> is turned Roman Catholick. A Church may be Orthodox and Catholick, and yet sundry within its communion be hereticks or Schismaticks or both.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. 11. <hi>c.</hi> 15: 12.</note> The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a true Church of God, yet there wanted not Schismaticks and hereticks among them. The Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> had many among them, who mixed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and the works of the Law with the faith of Christ. The Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65027:24"/>
was a true Church, yet they had Nicholai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans among them, and those that held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam.</hi> The Church of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi> had a Preaching <hi>Iesabel</hi> that seduced the servants of God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev</hi> 2.14 15.20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But who are these English Protestants that communicate so freely with Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? Nay he names none. We must take it upon his word. Are they peradventure the greater and the sounder part of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Church? Neither the one nor the other. Let him look into our Church, and see how many of our principall Divines have lost their Dignities and Benefices, only because they would not take a schismaticall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without any other relation to the Warres. Let him take a view of our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, and see how few of our old Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, or Rectors and Fellows of Colledges he findes left therein. God said of the Church of Israell, that he had reserved to himself seven thousand that had not bowed their knees unto <hi>Baall.</hi> I hope I may say of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that there are not only seven thousand, but seventy times seven thousand that mourn in secret, and wish their heads were waters and their eies foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of teares, that they might weep day and night for the devastation and desolation of the City of their God.</p>
            <p>And if that hard weapon Necessity have enforced any (perhaps with an intention to doe good or prevent evill) to complie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65027:24"/>
than was meet, I doe not doubt but they pray with <hi>Naman, The Lord be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me in this thing.</hi> Suppose that some Persons of the English Communion doe go sometimes to their meetings, it may be out of conscience to hear a Sermon; it may be out of curiosity as men go to see May games, or Monsters at Faires; it may be that they may be the better able to confute them; As St. <hi>Paul</hi> went into their heathenish Temples at <hi>Athens,</hi> and viewed their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars and read their Inscriptions, yet without any approbation of their Idolatrous devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Is this to communicate with Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, or what doth this concern the Church of <hi>England</hi>?</p>

that <hi>I tell not Why the objection of Schisme seemeth more forcible against the English Church then the objection of Heresie.</hi> And to supply my supposed defect he is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably pleased to set it down himself. <hi>The true reason whereof</hi> (saith he) <hi>is because He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy is a matter of doctrine, which is not so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as the matter of Schisme, which is a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter of fact, namely a visible separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in communion of Sacraments and publick worship of God.</hi> I confess I did not think of producing reasons before the question was stated; but if he will needs have it to be thus, before we inquire why it is so, we ought first to inquire whether it be so;<note place="margin">Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church of <hi>England</hi> in point of Schisme are colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, not forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> for my part I doe not beleeve that either their objections in point of Heresy or in point of Schisme, are so <hi>forcible</hi> against the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So he would have me to give a reason of a non entity, which hath neither reason nor being. All that I said was this, that there is nothing more <hi>colourably</hi> obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at first sight, to Strangers unacquainted with our affaires, or to such Natives as have looked but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially upon the case, then Schisme.

                     </expan> recedunt</hi>; but straightwaies they finde their error, that it is they who leave the shore. <hi>To Strangers, &amp;c.</hi> that is, to unskillfull Judges. A true diamond and a counterfeit doe seem both alike to an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced person. Strangers did beleeve ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily the Athenian fables of Bulls and Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures in <hi>Creete.</hi> But the Crecians knew better that they were but fictitious devises. The seeming strength lyeth not in the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions themselves, but in the incapacity of the Judges.</p>
               <p>But to his reason, the more things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the matter and devested of all circumstances of time and place and persons, the more demonstrable they are; that is the reason why Mathematicians doe boast that their Principles are so evident, that they doe not perswade but compell men to beleeve. Yet in the matter of fact, and in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of these evident rules, where every particular circumstance doth require a new consideration, how easily doe they erre? in so much as let twenty Geometricians mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure over the same plot of ground, hardly two of them shall agree exactly. So it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that an error in point of doctrine may be more easily and more evidently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, than an error in matter of fact. He saith <hi>the separation is visible.</hi> True; but whether the separation be criminous, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party made the first separation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65027:26"/>
there was just cause of separation, whether side gave the cause, whether the Keies did erre in separating, whether there was not a former separation of the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the pure primitive Church, which produced the second separation, whether they who separated themselves or others without just cause, doe erre invincibly, or not, whether they be ready to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the sentence of the Catholick Church, is not so easy to be discerned. How many separations have sprung about electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or jurisdiction, or precedency, all which Rites are most intricate, and yet the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Schisme depends altogether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. This Surveier himself confesseth, That <hi>a Church may be really hereticall or schismaticall, and yet morally a true Church, because she is invincibly ignorant of her Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy or Schisme, in which case it is no Schisme, but a necessary duty to separate from her.</hi> In this very case proposed by himself, I desire to know how it is so easie by the only view of the separation, to judge or conclude of the Schisme.</p>
               <p>But the true ground why Schisme is more probably objected to the Church of <hi>England</hi> than Heresie, is a false but prejudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the right Patriarch of <hi>Britain,</hi> That we deserted him, and that the differences between us are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Patriarchall Rites; all which with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other such like mistaken grounds, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65027:26"/>
cleared to be otherwise in the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This is all that concernes my first Chapter. The rest is voluntary.</p>
               <p>The next thing observable in his Survey is, that <hi>Protestants confesse that they have sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themselves not only from the Roman Church, but also from all other Christian Churches in the communion of the Sacraments and publick worship of God: And that no cause but necessity of salvation can justifie such a separation from the crime of Schisme. And it must needs seem hard to prove that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the salvation of Protestants, to make such a separation from all Churches in the World: As if there had been no Christian Church, in whose communion in Sacraments they could finde salvation, whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that at that time there was no true Church of God upon earth.</hi> For proof of the first point, That Protestants have separated from all Christian Churches, he produceth <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Chillingworth,</hi> and a treatise of his own.</p>
               <p>It were to be wished that Professors of Theology would not cite their testimonies upon trust, where the Authours themselves may easily be had,<note place="margin">Authors ought to be cited fully and faithfully.</note> (only <hi>impossibility is stronger than necessity,</hi> as the spartan Boy once answered the old Senator after the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conicall manner,) and that they would cite their Authors fully and faithfully, not by halves, without adding to or new molding their authorities according to their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65027:27"/>
or interest. It may seem ludicrous, but it was a sad truth of a noble English Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, sent Ambassador into forrein parts, and with him an honorable Espy under the notion of a Companion, by whom he was accused at his return to have spoken such and such things, at such and such times. The Gentleman pleaded ingenuously for himself, that it might be he had spoken some of those things, or it might be all those things, but never any one of them in that order, nor in that sense. I have, said he, several Suits of apparel, of purple cloth, of green Velvet, of white and black Sattin. If one should put my two purple Sleeves to my green velvet Dublet, and make my Hose the one of white Sattin, the other of black, and then swear that it was my apparrell; they who did not know me, might judge me a strange man. To disorder authority, to contract or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them, to misapply them besides the scope, contrary to the sense of the Author, is not more discommendable than common. I have seen large volumes containing some hundreds of controversies (as was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) between Protestants and Papists: And among them all not above five or six that I could owne; as if they desired that the whole woven Coat of Christ should be torn more insunder than it is, or that they might have the honor to conquer so many fictious Monsters of their own making. I have seen authorities mangled and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65027:27"/>
like the Ambassadors clothes, so as the right Authors would hardly have been able to know them. So much prejudice and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and an habit of alteration, is able to doe like a tongue infected with Choler, which makes the sweetest meates to taste bitter, or like coloured glass, which makes every object we see through it to appear of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I doe intreat <hi>R.

And likewise by forbearing to make so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny empty references, to what he beleeves or pretends to have proved in some of his other books. <hi>See the Author of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: See the distinction of fundamentals and not fundamentals: See the sufficient proposer of faith: See the Protestants plain confession: See the Flowers of the English Church: See the Epistle to King</hi> James: <hi>See the pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Ballance: See the collation of Scripture.</hi> To what end can this serve, but either to divert us from the question we have in hand? or to amuse the Reader and put him into a

beliefe of some great atchievements which he hath made elsewhere, or to excuse his present defects, upon pretense of large sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and recruits which he hath ready in another place, but where the Reader can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to see them? And what if the Reader have them not to see, as it is my condition in present? What am I or he the worse? If he see no more in some of them, then I have seen heretofore, he will see a great many of mistated and mistaken questions, a great many of Logomachies or contentions about words, a great many of private errours produced as common principles of Protestants, a great many of authours cited contrary to their genuine sense and meaning, and very little that is materiall towards the discussion of this or any other question.</p>

The former then was done by Protestants, the later was not

Nay not only not from the Catholick Church, but not so much as from the Roman, did they separate</hi> per omnia, <hi>but only in those practises which they conceived superstitious or impious.</hi> Not only from the Roman Church, but from also all other Christian Churches in the world,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But because there is no question wherein they studdy more to blunder and trouble the water, and to involve themselves in dark Clouds of obscure generalities; I will doe my endeavour to distinguish that which is deceitfull and confused, and represent the naked truth to the eies of the Reader.<note place="margin">Nor from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but only in her errors.</note> First I acknowledge that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Christian Church in that sense that I have declared, that is metaphysically, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it still reteins all the essentialls of a true Church. To have separated from it in any of these, had been either formall Heresie, or formall Schisme, or both. But we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined all these as much as themselves, and much more purely than themselves: For it may seem doubtfull whether some of their superstitious additions, doe not virtually overthrow some of the fundamentalls of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65027:29"/>
Religion. But with us there is no such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I acknowledge that, besides the Essentials of Christian Religion, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reteins many other truths of an inferior nature, in Doctrine, in Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in Sacraments, and many lawfull and laudable Practises and Observations. To have separated from these, had been at least materiall Schisme, unless the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should obtrude them upon other Churches as necessary and fundamentall Articles of Christian Religion, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to change the ancient Creed, which was deposited with the Church by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as the common Badge and Cognisance of all Christians for all suceeding Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is agreed that one may not, one must not separate himself from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a true Christian Church, for the vices or faults of particular Persons in point of manners. We may not leave the Lords Field because there are Tares, nor his Floare because there is Chaff, nor his House because there are Vessels of dishonor, nor his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege because there was a <hi>Iudas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some errors and abuses are not simply sinfull in themselves, but to those that did first introduce them, to those who maintain and practise them for ambitious or avaritious ends they are sinfull. These are pressures and grievances to the Christian
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65027:29"/>
Flock, rather than sins. They suffer under the burthen of them, but they are innocent from the guilt of them. And so <hi>reum facit Superiorem iniquitas imperandi, innocentem subditum ordo serviendi.</hi> A Superior may sin in his commands, and yet his Subject be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in his obedience. These are no just cause of separation to a private Christian, <hi>Charity covers a multitude of sinnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t</hi> 4. 8.</note> But they are just cause of Reformation to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church or a Synod.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, There are some errors in disputable points, and some abuses are meer excesses without guilt, rather blemishes than sinnes: And for these alone no man ought to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himself from a Christian Society; or abandon a true Church for triviall dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Our duty in such a case is to pray and perswade, without troubling the peace of the Church, and to leave the rest to God. <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil</hi> 3 15.</note> 
                  <hi>be thus minded; and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, We affirm that in the superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Christian Religion, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath added and mixed sundry errors and abuses of greater consequence, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full innovations, in point of Doctrine, and Discipline, and administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Feasts, and Fasts, &amp;c. This we are ready to maintain. Neither doth she on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profess and practise these errors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65027:30"/>
which perhaps by some persons at some times might be separated without a separation; but she obtrudes them upon all others as essential Truths and necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. She injoins sundry of them as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her Communion. She commands all Christians to beleeve and practise them under pain of damnation; and whosoever refuseth, she casteth them out of her society. Such is their new Creed in point of Faith, directly contrary to the Canon of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Such is the Popes Supremacy of power in point of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, expressly contrary to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Councells of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile.</hi> Such is the adoration of the species of Bread and Wine, the detention of the Cup from the People, their unknown lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, &amp;c. in the administration of the Sacraments, and in the publick service of God. From these sinfull duties thus injoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as necessary, all men ought to separate. Lawfull authority of man may oblige one to suffer, but no authority of man can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or oblige one to doe sinfull duties. Such a cause justifies a separation, untill the abuse be reformed for which the separation was made. And being thus separated from sinfull Innovations, it may be lawfull or convenient to reform lesser errors, which were not of such dangerous consequence, nor had been a sufficient cause of separation of themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65027:30"/>But here I must advertise the Reader of a double manner of expression, used by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Protestants concerning this separation. They agree that the Roman Church retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Essentials of a true Church. They agree that she hath introduced errors and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses into Christian Religion. They agree that she obtrudes sinfull Innovations as necessary conditions of her Communion. They agree that the separation is only from these errors and abuses, and are ready to return to a Communion, when these errors and abuses are removed. So in effect they say the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same thing, neither more nor less. But because these errors and abuses are inherent in their Confessions. Liturgy, and forms of administration of holy Sacraments; therefore some say that they are separated from the externall communion of the Roman Church. And because these errors and abuses are but adventicious &amp; accidently inherent, and may be, and ought to be removed; therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say that their separation is not from the Communion of the Roman Church, as it was, and may be, and ought to be, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>errors and abuses.</hi> The one speaks simply and absolutely from <hi>the errors and abuses</hi>: The others speak respectively, and <hi>secundum quid, from the externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Roman Church,</hi> that is, so far as it is corrupted by <hi>these errors and abuses,</hi> and not further, and so in sense they say the very same thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:65027:31"/>And therefore it is meer sophistry and a groundlesse cavill to argue from their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from errours, to their separation from truths, and from their separation in abuses, to their separation in the Sacraments themselves. Suppose one who is appointed to minister diet to another, will give him nothing but poisonous meats, And he knowing it, will not receive it; tell me who is the refuser, he that will not eate poison, or he that will not give him healthfull food? The Roman Catholicks doe professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be as loyall to their Soveraign, as any of his best Subjects. And that they are as ready as any others to give assurance of it by oath. Yet they say there are some clauses inserted in the form prescribed, which they may not, they dare not take. If any man should accuse them hereupon, to have deserted the communion of the English Monarchy in point of loyalty, they would be angry, and they had good reason for it. Upon the same equity let them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to accuse us of leaving the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Church in Sacraments, when we only left their abuses. Distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween old institutions and new errours, and the case is cleer.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Not the separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, but the cause makes the Schism.</note>Likewise supposing, but not granting, that we were not chased away by the censures of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but had out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science separated our selves from their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in such manner as I have declared, yet
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65027:31"/>
the crime or guilt of the Schism sticks close to them. A conscientious Christian is as much chased away by imposing upon him the performance of sinfull duties, as by the thunderbolt of excommunication. Schism is a voluntary separation, but our separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was no more voluntary on our parts, then the three children were willing to be cast into the fiery furnace, that is, they did chuse rather to die Innocents then to live Nocents, to suffer burning rather then to commit Idolatry. To be separated, might be our consequent will, because we could not help it. But it was farr enough from our antecedent will, or that we did desire it. If we should see one pushed and thrust out of an house with Swords and Whips and Clubs, would any man in his right wits, call this man a Fugitive and a Runaway, or accuse him to have forsaken the House? Sin is a more dangerous Edge-tool then a Sword, and the wrath of God heavier then the weight of Clubs, and the secret lashes of a guilty Conscience sharper then Whips. If they did impose upon us a necessity of doing sinfull duties and offending God, and wounding our own Consciences, whilest we staied among them, then we did not leave them, but they did drive us from them. <hi>Ioseph</hi> came into his Masters house to doe his duty, his Mistrisse tempts him to Sinne. <hi>Ioseph</hi> flies away. What? From his duty? No. But from the offence of God, and she that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65027:32"/>
thought to hold him, was the person that did drive him away.</p>

                  </gap> He might have spared his Authours in the margent to prove it. His defect lies on the other side. Doth not he think it necessary to Salvation for every man so farre as he can to escheu deadly sinne? Or thinks he that a man may live securely in known errours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the dictate of his Conscience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to Salvation? This was our condition. But yet <hi>there was Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be had in the Church of</hi> Rome. <hi>So it was not necessary to Salvation to make such a separation.</hi> A strange consequence, just like this other, God hath mercy in store for sinners, therefore it is not necessary to Salvation to forsake sinne.

Because his compassion is great, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his poor Creatures that offend out of invincible ignorance, is it therefore not necessary to Salvation for those who are convinced of their errours, to follow the commandement of God, and the light of their own Conscience? This is so evident that it admits no doubt.</p>
               <p>He adds, That <hi>we separated our selves not only from the Roman Church, but from all Christian Churches in the World, as if there
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65027:32"/>
had been no Christian Church in the World, in whose communion we could finde Salvation, whence it will follow that at that time in their conceits, there was no true Church upon Earth.</hi> This he inculcates over and over in severall places, according to his manner.

For they doe neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Catholick or universall Church, as the Roman doth, nor challenge any jurisdiction over the Britannick Churches, as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we deny them the right of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, or the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. In coordinate Churches,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Gal</hi> 9.</note> whereof one is

not subordinate to another, some Churches reforming themselves, and not censuring or condemning others which are unreform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whilest they preserve their duty entire to the Oecumenicall Church, and its repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative a generall Councell, doe not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from other Churches, but from their own errours. In a large garden suppose there should be many quarters, some weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, some unweeded, there is indeed a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Plants from the Weeds in the same quarters, but no separation of one quarter from another. Or if a man shall purge out of himself corrupted humours, he doth not thereby separate himself from other persons, whose bodies are unpurged. It is true, that such weeding and purging doth produce a distinction, between the quarters weeded, and the quarters unweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and between Bodies purged and Bodies unpurged. But either they stand in no such need of weeding or purging, or it is their own fault who doe not weed or purge when they have occasion. If they will needs misconstrue our lawfull reformation, to be an unlawfull and uncharitable separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how can we help it?

But for these Grecian, Russi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Armenian, and Abissine Churches, I finde grosse superstitions objected to some of them, but not proved. I finde some inusitate expressions about some myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are scarcely intelligible or expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, as the procession of the holy Ghost, and the Union of the two natures in Christ, which are not frequently used among us, but I beleive their sense to be the same with ours. The Grecians doe acknowledge the holy Ghost to be the Spirit of the Son. And all the other Churches are ready to accurse the errours both of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But that which satisfies me is this, that they exact of no man, nor obtrude upon him any other Creed, or new Articles of Faith then the Apostolicall, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds, with the explications, of the generall Councels of <hi>Ephesiu, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65027:34"/>
and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> all which we readily admit, and use daily in our Liturgy. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would rest where they doe, we might well have disputable questions between us, but no breach of unity in point of Faith. Likewise in point of discipline, all these Churches ascribe no more to the Pope then a primacy of Order, no supremacy of Power or universal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. They make a generall Councel, with or without the Popes suffrage, to be the highest Ecclesiasticall tribunall. Let the Romanists rest where they doe rest, and all our controversies concerning Ecclesiasticall discipline will fall to the ground. Thirdly, they have their Liturgy in a language under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, they administer the Sacrament in both kinds to all Christians. They doe not themselves adore, much lesse compell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to adore the species of Bread and Wine. Howsoever they have a kind of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. They have no new matter and form, no tradition of the paten and chalice in Presbyterian ordination, but only impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands. They know no new Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but the commemoration, representation, and application of the Sacrifice of the Crosse. Just as we believe. Let the Romanists but imitate their moderation, and we shall strait come to joyn in Communion, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and Sacramentals also.

forsaking the externall communion of the corrupted Church, could not but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the externall communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.

                  <hi>Indeed that</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers, left off the practice of those corruptions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole visible Church did communicate formerly, (which I meant, when I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged above that they forsooke the externall communion of the visible Church) or that they left that part of the visible Church in her corruption, which would not be reformed. These things if you desire, I shall be willing to grant; and that by a Synechdoche of the whole for the part, he might be said to forsake the visible Church, that is, a part of it, and the greater part. But that properly speaking, he forsooke the whole visible Church, I hope you will excuse me if I grant not this.</hi> And he gives this reason, because a great part of the Church joyned with <hi>Luther.</hi> He might have added a stronger reason as I think, that <hi>Luthers</hi> first quarrell with the Pope was about Indulgences, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, &amp;c. wherein <hi>Luther</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65027:38"/>
but joyn in communion with the much greater part of the visible Church. If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Luther</hi> fell upon other questions, not so agreeable to the Eastern Church, yet they were no Articles of the Creed, nor necessary points of Christian Religion. The same interpretation he gives elswhere, <hi>The first reformers as well as the Donatists,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly I answer, that what is said of the universall corruption of the visible Church, is not delivered positively, but doubtfully, and upon supposition, not grounded upon any matter of fact,<note place="margin">

I doe also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Episcopacy was comprehended in the Apostolick office <hi>tanquam trigonus in tetragono,</hi> and that the distinction was made by the Apostles with the approbation of Christ. That the Angels of the seven Churches in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> were seven Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; that it is the most silly rediculous thing in the World to calumni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e that for a papall innovation, which was established in the Church before there was a Pope at <hi>Rome</hi>; which hath been received and approved in all ages since the very Cradle of Christianity, by all sorts of Christians, Europeans, Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, Asiaticks, Indians, many of which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any intercourse with <hi>Rome,</hi> nor scarcely ever heard of the name of <hi>Rome.</hi> If <hi>semper ubique &amp; ab omnibus</hi> be not a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient plea, I know not what is.</p>
               <p>But because I esteem them Churches not <hi>completely</hi> formed, doe I therefore exclude them from all hope of salvation? or esteem them aliens and strangers from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi>? or account them formall Schismaticks? No such thing. First, I know there are many learned Persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who doe passionately affect Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie; some of which have acknowledged
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65027:40"/>
to my self, that their Church would never be rightly setled untill it was new moulded. Baptisme is a Sacrament, the door of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, a matriculation into the Church of Christ: Yet the very desire of it in case of necessity, is sufficient to excuse from the want of actuall Baptisme. And is not the desire of Episcopacy sufficient to excuse from the actuall want of Episcopacy in like case of necessity? Or should I censure these as Schismaticks?</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are others who though they doe not long so much for Episcopacy, yet they approve it, and want it only out of invincible necessity. In some places the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince is of another Communion; the Episcopall Chaires are filled with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Bishops. If they should petition for Bishops of their own, it would not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In other places the Magistrats have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away Bishops, whether out of pollicy, because they thought that Regiment not so proper for their Republicks, or because they were ashamed to take away the Revenues, and preserve the Order, or out of a blinde Zeal, they have given an account to God: they owe none to me. Should I condemn all these as Schismaticks for want of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, who want it out of invincible neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are others who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same desires, nor the same esteem of Episcopacy, but condemn it as an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65027:40"/>
Innovation, and a Ragge of Popery. I conceive this to be most grosse Schism ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially. It is ten times more schismaticall to desert; nay to take away (so much as lies in them) the whole order of Bishops, than to substract obedience from one lawfull Bishop. All that can be said to mittigate this fault is, that they doe it ignorantly, as they have been mistaught and misinformed. And I hope that many of them are free from obstinacy, and hold the truth impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely in the preparation of their minds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to receive it, when God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to them. How far this may excuse (not the crime but) their persons from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Schisme, either <hi>a toto</hi> or <hi>a tanto,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine not, but leave them to stand or fall before their own Master.</p>
               <p>But though these Protestants were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this contumely,<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists no fit persons to object Schism to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note> yet surely the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists are no fit persons to object it, whose <hi>opiniastrety</hi> did hinder an uniform Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the western Church.

These avaritious practises of that Court, (though it be not commonly observed) were the first source of these present controversies about Episcopacy and ecclesiasticall Discipline, which doe now so much disturb the peace of the Church.</p>
               <p>The second fault which he imputeth to me is, That <hi>I endeavor to clear the English Church from Schisme only in relation to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>not to all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> It was altogether needless to have troubled his own head or his Readers with this.

               <p>My third fault is,<note place="margin">The Church of <hi>England</hi> had better grounds than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall faults of Popes.</note> That <hi>I endeavour prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to justifie our separation from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, for the personall faults of Popes.</hi> And my fourth fault is, That <hi>I justifie our separation from the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>for their evill manners.</hi> That this is not lawfull to doe, he proves by sundry authorities and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I think the rather because no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it, or doubts of it, or because he would insinuate to his Reader that we doe deny it. If he had pleased, he might have contracted these two faults into one. The Pope and his Court make but one consistory, and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall faults, and evill manners are the same thing. It had been needfull to have joyned them together, to give them a little more weight: for being twisted they weigh not half a graine. First, I deny that we hold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal faults or evil manners a sufficient cause of separation. Secondly, that separation which was made, was made by themselves, not by us. Thirdly, I deny that the Pope, or Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ever had right to any Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over us: And if they ever had any pretence of right, we had other manner of grounds for separation than evill manners. As new Articles of faith, obtruding of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, superstitions, and sinfull duties, gross
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65027:42"/>
usurpation of the rights of the soveraign Prince, and all orders and degrees of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the overthrow or endangering of the publick peace and tranquillity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, unlawfull oaths contrary to our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to our King, contrary to that duty which all Christians doe owe to generall Councells, and lastly, the Popes quitting of his Patriarchall power. Yet by his leave, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and oppression, and rapine are somewhat more than personall faults, and may be just grounds to Princes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths to substract obedience, untill there be a reformation of exorbitant abuses. Some personall faults, as Simony aud Schism, may give just occasion to Christians to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from pretended Popes. But there are other faults inherent in the Office of the Pope, not his Episcopall Office, which was instituted by Christ or his Apostles, nor his Patriarchall Office, which was instituted by the Church, but his pretended Monarchicall Office, whereby he hath usurped a power paramount over the highest Tribunall of the Church; that is, a generall Councell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more shall be said in due place.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> first to shew what Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Separations were not Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. As first, those Separations which proceed out of a sudden passionate heat, without attempting to make any parties, as those between St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius.</hi> Secondly, premeditated clashings of Bishops or Churches long maintained; if they forbear to censure one another, and be ready to submit to the determination of a generall Councell, are not schismaticall; as those between the Roman and African Bishops about appeals and rebaptization, Thirdly, where just cause of separation is given, for there the Separaters are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and they who give the cause, are Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. Fourthly, separation, from an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Church, or Pastor in their errors.

               <p>The first Exception that he takes, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65027:43"/>
my two supposed definitions of Schisme;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 8.</note> the former is, <hi>Schisme is a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous scissure, rent, or division in the Church, an ecclesiasticall sedition, like to a mutiny in an Army, or a faction in a Sate.</hi> The second, <hi>meer Schisme is a culpable rupture or breach of the Catholick Communion.</hi>

                  <hi>True Schisme is a voluntary divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in some substantiall part of the true Church.</hi> Really, I doe not wonder if my definitions be not complete. I doe not take my self to have so happy a vein, that all that I utter should be a definition. I did not hold it needfull, nor had any purpose to define Schisme, but only to explane it, which my very words might have taught him. <hi>Schisme signifies a criminous scissure,</hi> not <hi>is, but signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</hi> And those two similitudes added to the foot of my pretended definition, <hi>like a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny in an Army, or faction in a State.</hi> Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are apt to illustrate, but not to define. The definition and the thing defined are ever the same. Those things which are like one another, are never the same. But let us view his grand exceptions to my supposed defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">All Schisme is not in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials.</note>My first <hi>great fault</hi> is, That <hi>I doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it thus in some substantiall part or parts of the Church. For all Schisme is in essentials, otherwise division in ecclesiasticall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or scholasticall Opinions should be Schism.</hi> Here is nothing new but his reason, to which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65027:43"/>
I answer, that all differences in Rites and Ceremonies are not schismaticall; but if unlawfull or sinfull Rites be obtruded by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church, as a condition of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and a separation ensue thereupon; the Obtruders of sinfull Rites, and they who break the unity of the Church, for difference in indifferent Rites, are guilty of Schism. So likewise scholasticall Opinions are free, and may be defended both waies scholastically; but if they be obtruded Magisterialy upon Christians as necessary Articles of faith, they render the Obtruders truly schismaticall. This is the case of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in both these particular instances: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not true, that all Schism is a division in the essentialls of Religion, or its <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts.</hi> When Pope <hi>Victor</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Eastern Churches about the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Easter, the difference was but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Rite, <hi>aut Ritus potius tempore</hi> (saith a Roman Catholick) <hi>or rather the time of a Rite.</hi> Yet it occasioned a Schisme, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Victors Key did erre,</hi> and then he was the Schismatick, or it did not erre, and then they were the Schismaticks. What the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ireneus</hi> and the Fathers of that age was, <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, that their letters were extant, wherein they chid <hi>Victor</hi> sharply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. There was much and long conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Sees of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinople,</hi> concerning the Ecclesiasticall Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> a meere humane Rite,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65027:44"/>
nothing to the substance of the Church.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. an.</hi> 878.</note> And <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> excommunicated <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Patriarch about it. Here was a Schisme, but no essentiall of Religion concerned. How many gross Schismes have been in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> meerly about the due ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Popes, a matter of humane right, which was sometimes in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, sometimes in the People, sometimes in the whole Roman Clergy, and now in the Colledge of Cardinals: Essentialls of Religion use not to be so mutable.</p>
               <p>Nay, I beleeve that if we search narrowly into the first source and originall of all the famous Schismes that have been in the Church, as Novatianisme, and Donatisme, &amp;c. we shall finde that it was about the Canons of the Church, no substantialls of Religion. Novatians first separation from <hi>Cornelius,</hi> was upon pretense that he himself was more duely elected Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> not about any essentiall of Religion. The first originall of the Schism of the Donatists, was because the Catholick Church would not excommunicate them who were accused to have been <hi>traditores.</hi> On the other side, <hi>Felicissimus</hi> raised a Schism in the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and set up Altar against Altar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>lapsi</hi> or those who had fallen in time of persecution might not presently be restored, upon the mediation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, or as they then stiled them, Martyrs. What Schismes have been raised in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65027:44"/>
Church of <hi>England</hi> about round or square, white or black, about a Cup, or a Surpless, or the signe of the Cross, or kneeling at the receiving of the blessed Sacrament, or the use of the Ring in marriage? What bitter contentions have been among the Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans in former times about their habits, what colour they should be, white, or black, or gray; and what fashion, long or short, to make them more conformable to the rule of St. <hi>Francis</hi>? with what violence have these petty quarrells been prosecuted, in so much as two succeeding Popes, upon two solemn hearings durst not determine them. And nothing was wanting to a complete Schism but a sentence.<note place="margin">

               <p>He might have spared his second proofs of his three substantiall parts he meaneth es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall properties of the Church, untill it had been once denyed. Yet I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how he makes Heresie now worse than Schism, because <hi>Heresie denyeth the truth of God, which simple Schism doth not,</hi> whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he made Schisme worse than Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The second fault which he imputeth to me is, That <hi>I confound meer Schism with Schism mixed with Heresie, and bring in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith to justifie our division from the Roman Church.</hi> This second fault is like the former, both begotten in his own brain. Let him read my supposed definition over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, and he shall not finde the least trace of any such confusion in it. To bring in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65027:45"/>
their errours in matters of faith,<note place="margin">Errours in faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, justifie a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, not only from Heresie, but from meer Schism, is very proper. He himself hath already confessed it: I hope he will stand to his word, for it is too evident a truth to be denyed; that supposing they hold errours in matters of faith, and make these their errours a condition of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; <hi>it is not only lawfull, but necessary, and a virtue to separate from them.</hi> Their very errours in matters of faith, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them upon us as necessary Articles, doth justifie a separation from them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit us before God and man from all crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Schism, whether meer or mixed. The sinne of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiran</hi> was not meer Schism, but ambition, treason, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. <hi>Korah</hi> would have had the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priesthood from <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiran</hi> would have been soveraign Princes in the place of <hi>Moses,</hi> by right of the Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture of <hi>Ruben.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So he proceeds to my other definition. <hi>Meer Shcism is a culpable rupture or breach of the Catholick Communion,</hi> to which he saith I add in the next page <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient ground,</hi> and should have added also <hi>in Sacraments or lawfull ministry,</hi> and lastly have shewed what is a <hi>sufficent ground.</hi> But he mistakes throughout: for first to have added without sufficient grounds, had been a needless tautology, which is not toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a definition. To say that it is cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65027:45"/>
implies that it wants sufficient grounds. For if it had sufficient grounds, it were not culpable. Secondly, to have added in Sacraments or lawfull Ministry, had been to spoil the definition, or description rather, and to make it not convertible with the thing defined or described. I have shewed that there are many meer Schismes, that are neither in Sacraments nor lawfull Ministry. Lastly, I have shewed what are sufficient grounds, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gave sufficient cause of separation, if he please to take it into consideration.<note place="margin">

I am far from supposing that none but Saints are within the communion of a true visible Church: But I am sure it is a good caution both for them and us. There is a mentall Schisme as well as a mentall Murther.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 15.</note>

                  </gap>scipline. These obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations about the parts of the Catholick Communion, are so innocent, so indifferent, and so unsubserviant to either party, that I hoped they might pass without any censure. But behold there is not one of them can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape an exception. To the first part of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick communion in the same Creeds, he takes two exceptions; first, That <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in faith is pretended a sufficient excuse from true Schism.</hi> Fear it not; no man dreameth that communion with the Church in her Creed doth acquit from Schism; but not communicating with the Church in her Creed, doth make both Schism and Heresie. The having of faith doth not supplie the want of Charity; but the want of one necessary requisite, renders the having of another insufficient. <hi>Bonum ex singulis circumstantiis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all points of faith not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</note> 
                  <hi>malum ex quolibet defectu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His second Exception is, That <hi>true saving faith requireth not only a communion in the Creed, but in all Gods words cleerly revealed to him, and sufficiently proposed.</hi> I answer.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65027:46"/>
What is necessary for this man, at this time, in this place, is one thing; what is necessary for all Christians, at all times, in all places, is another thing. Though all revealed truths be alike necessary to be beleeved, when they are known, yet all revealed truths are not alike necessary to be known. And they who know them not, are not obliged to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in the beleefe of them, untill they know them. So to beleeve them when they are revealed to us, is a necessary duty of all Christians: And yet the explicite beliefe of them is no necessary part of Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. He that holds fast the old Creed of the Church, hath all things that are absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary in point of Faith. Perhaps he thinks that the determination of the Roman Church is a sufficient proposall: we know no such thing. Let him first win the privilige and then enjoy it.</p>
               <p>To the second and third parts of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion he objects, That <hi>it is not sufficient to participate in Catholick Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unless it be done with Catholicks.</hi> This is true. How can they be parts of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion,<note place="margin">Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purely and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred the same Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> if no Catholicks doe participate of them? But here are two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements necessary: the one, that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purely administred, and Sacraments corruptly administred, so long as the abuses doe not destroy the essence, are the same Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. As Baptisme administred in pure water, and Baptisme administred with salt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65027:47"/>
and spittle, also is the same Baptisme. The other, that it is not any Church of one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whatsoever, either Roman or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that either is the Catholick Church, or is to judge under Christ who are true Catholicks. There are many more Catholicks without the Roman Communion, than within it. Our Separatists in <hi>England</hi> having first laid their own drowsie conceits for infallable grounds, that their Discipline is the Scepter of Christ, that they alone are <hi>Zion,</hi> and all other societies <hi>Babilon</hi>; then they apply all the power, and priviledges, and prerogatives of the Church unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it self into an opinion, that she alone is the Catholick Church, and all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches divided from her, hereticall or schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Conventicles, though they be three or four times larger than her self; presently laies hold on the keies of the Church, opens and shuts, lets in and thrusts out, makes Catholicks and unmakes Catholicks at her pleasure.</p>
               <p>He tels us That <hi>the Communion of the Church doth not necessarily imply the same Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> I know it right well. The Queens Daughter was arraied in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wrought about with divers colours. No men have been so much too blame as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in obtruding indifferent Rites as necessary duties upon other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But yet the more harmony and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65027:47"/>
that there is in Rites, the greater is the Communion. The Church is compared to an Army with banners. What a disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Army would it be, if every Souldier was left free to wear his own <hi>colours,</hi> and to give his own words?</p>
               <p>I know the Communion of the Church did not consist in communicatory Letters, but they were both expressions, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent helpes and adjuments of unity, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes against Schism. What he saith now the third time of our communicating with Schismaticks, hath been answered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (saith he) <hi>since I. D. hath failed so many waies in defining Schism,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>let us define it better.</hi> And then he brings in his definition triumphantly; <hi>True Schism is a voluntary division in some substantiall part of the true Church,</hi> that is, in some essentiall of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. Where lies the difference? I call it a separation, and he calles it a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; I say culpable, and he saith voluntary; <hi>omnis culpa est voluntaria.</hi> My expressions are more significant and emphaticall. All the difference lies in these words, <hi>in some substantiall part of the true Church.</hi> Which for the form of expression is improper, to make essentiall properties to be substantiall parts; and for the matter is most untrue: for there have been, are, and may be many Schismes, which doe not concern any essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls of Christian Religion. I would borrow
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65027:48"/>

The English Church hath been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, (but we will suppose that it had seperated it self) from the Roman. In this case, by his own confession the Schism lies at the dore of the Roman Church, from which the separation was made, if they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated first, from the pure primitive Church which was before them, not locally, but morally. Yet saith he, this erroneous Church is still <hi>morally a true particular Church</hi>; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Church hath not all the essentials of a Christian Church, and then how doth it still continue a <hi>true</hi> Church? Or it hath all the essentials, and then a true Church in substance may give just ground to separate from her in materiall Heresie and Schism. I will be as free with him concerning the universall Church. If any man or Society of Christians separate themselves from the united communion of the whole Catholick Church, dispersed throughout the World, I cannot excuse him from Schism. For whether the Catholick Church of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age may erre or not, this is certain she cannot erre universally in any thing that is necessary to Salvation, nor with obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.

But for the divided parts of the Catholick Church, a man may differ from all of them in inferiour points, some in one thing, some in another, wherein they differ one from another, and separate from some of them in their errors without criminous Schism; And yet maintain a perfect union with the Catholick Church united.</p>
               <p>I must not here forget to put <hi>R.

That there is not the like necessity of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in all externals. That Catholick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion implies not unity in all opinions. That inferiours in some cases may lawfully substract communion from their Superiours, and in speciall the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in tract of time, abuses will creep into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches, and ought to be reformed.</p>

But that they had differences also of lesser moment in points of Doctrine and Discipline, and forms of Administration of the holy Sacraments, and Liturgies, no man can doubt that hath his eies in his head.

The reason of their agreement was plainly this, because all Churches received the primitive Creed, and no Church exacted more in point of Faith then the primitive Creed.

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. 4 Waies to incurre hereticall pravity.</note>I said, that a man might render himself guilty of hereticall pravity four waies; first, by disbelieving any fundamentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, or necessary part of saving Truth. For though fundamentals only be simply necessary to be known of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet there are many other truths revealed by God, which being known, are as necessary to be believed as the fundamentals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And to discredit any one of these lesser truths, after it is known that God hath revealed it, is as much as to deny the truth of God, or to deny all the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals put together. Against this he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that <hi>Heresie is incurred by disbelieving any point of Faith whatsoever, if it be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proposed.</hi> Right, if it be so proposed that a man knows it to be a revealed truth, or might know it, if he did not obstinately shut his eies against evident light. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no such sufficient or infallible proposer, that every man is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65027:54"/>
its determinations as Oracles. But <hi>R C.</hi> leaves these words out of my discourse, [<hi>or necessary part of saving truth,</hi>] that is necessary to some persons, in some places, at sometimes, to whom they are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed. Is this fair dealing?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I said that Heresie was incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by believing superstitious errours or additions, which doe virtually and by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent consequence, overthrow a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall truth. This is denied by <hi>R. C. because Faith is an assent to divine Revelations upon the authority of the revealer, and therefore is neither gotten nor lost, nor Heresie incurred by consequence.</hi> Doth he not know that whosoever believeth a revealed truth, doth of necessity believe all the evident conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it? As he that believes that Christ is God, doth of necessity believe that he is eternall. And if he maintain that <hi>erat quando non erat, There was a time when he was not,</hi> he doth implicitly deny his De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty, and incur the crime of Heresie. Hath he forgotten what their own Doctors doe teach,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell. de Eccles. milit. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> that <hi>a conclusion of Faith may be grounded upon one proposition inevident</hi> (that is revealed) <hi>and another proposition evident,</hi> (that is not revealed) but evident in it self? The hypostaticall union of the two natures divine and humane in Christ, is a fundamentall truth, that the blessed Virgin is the mother of God, that Christ had both a divine and humane will, are evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65027:55"/>
of this truth, not expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Yet for denying the former <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> for denying the later, the <hi>Manothelites</hi> were condemned as hereticks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Heresie may be incurred by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate persisting in lesser errours, after a man is convicted in his conscience, that they are errours, either out of animosity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he scornes to yeeld, or out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, ambitous, or other sinister ends. And lastly, Heresie is incurred by a froward and peevish opposition, to the Decrees of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel, to the disturbing of the peace and tranquility of the Church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these two last waies of incurring He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, <hi>R. C.</hi> saith nothing directly, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the by, he taxeth me of two errours. First,<note place="margin">The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls.</note> that I say, <hi>No Councel can make that a point of Faith, which was not ever such.</hi> We agree in this, That no Councel can make that a fundamentall, which was not a fundamentall, nor make that a revealed truth, which was not a revealed truth. I acknoledge further that a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, may make that revealed truth necessary to be believed, by a Christian as a point of Faith, which formerly was not necessary to be believed, that is whensoever the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and grounds produced by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, or the authority of the Councel, (which is and alwaies ought to be very great, with all sober, discreet Christians,) doe convince a man in his conscience of the truth of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65027:55"/>
Councels definition. In doubtful questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if there be no miscarriage, no pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Votes, no fraud used in the Councel, like that in the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> for receiving Christ and rejecting <hi>homo-ousios,</hi> and if the determination be not contrary to the tradition of the Church, who would not rather suspect his own judgement, then a general Councels? I confesse yet further, that when a generall Councel hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined any controversie, no man may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose its determination, but every one is bound to acquiesce, and possesse his Soul in patience, though he be not convicted in his conscience of the truth of their sentence. And if any man out of pevishnesse, or stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse shall oppose their definition, to the disturbance of the peace and tranquility of the Church, he deserves to be punished as an Heretick.</p>
               <p>Then wherein lies the difference? First, in <hi>R. C.</hi> his misreciting my words accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ordinary custome. I said only this, that a Councel could not make that proposition hereticall in it self, which was not ever hereticall, nor increase the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Articles of the Christian Faith, either in number or substance. What I said is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable true. [First, <hi>in it self</hi>] That is in its own nature, without any reference to the authority of a Councel. And [<hi>necessary Articles of the Christian Faith</hi>] that is, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and simply necessary for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65027:56"/>
If the proposition were hereticall in it self, then they that held it before the Councel were Hereticks, as well as they who hold it after the Councel. And that is a necessary Article of the Christian Faith, without the actuall belief, whereof Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could never be saved.</p>

But with the concurrence and confirmation of the Pope, they make the determination of a generall Councel to be infallible. On the other side we know no such infallibility of the Pope, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. After <hi>Stephen</hi> had taken up the body of <hi>Formosus</hi> his predecessor out of his grave, spoiled him of his pontificall Attire, cut off his two Fingers, and cast his body into <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur,</hi>

Neither was this act of <hi>Stephen</hi> an errour meerly in matter of fact, but principally in matter of Faith, that the Episcopall character is deleble.

single Vote of a prime Bishop of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall Church. And therefore we give the same priviledges to a Councell unconfirmed (which they acknowledge to be fallible) and to a Councell confirmed by the Pope. We have no assurance that all generall Councells were, and ever shall be so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>mesnaged,</hi> and their proceedings all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies so orderly and upright, that we dare make all their sentences a sufficient convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all Christians, which they are bound to beleeve under pain of damnation. If <hi>R C.</hi> be not of my mind, others of his own Church have been, and are at this day. When I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to cite, because I presume it will not be denyed. In summe I know no such virtuall Church as they fancy. Antiquity never knew it. I owe obedience (at least of acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence) to the representative Church; and I resolve for ever to adhere (to the best of my understanding) to the united Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the whole essentiall Church, which I beleeve to be so far infallable, as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for atteining that end, for which Christ bestowed this priviledge, that is, salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Neither let him think that I use this as an artifice, or subterfuge to decline the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of generall Councells. I know none we need to fear. And I doe freely promise to reject the authority of none that was truly generall, which he shall produce in this question. As for occidentall Councels,

Even now when they opposed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they were the best Bishops: and now when they oppose the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, they are Schismaticks and Hereticks. Let them be what they were, or whatsoever he would have them to be, certainly they were no Protestants. And if they were not Roman Catholicks, they were of no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Communion. They professed to live Roman Catholicks; and they died Roman Catholicks. The six bloody Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by them, and executed by them in the reign of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Bonefires which they made of poor Protestants in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> doe demonstrate both that they were no Protestants, and that they were Zelots of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>But (saith he) <hi>the essence of the Roman Religion doth consist in the primacy of the Pope.</hi> If it be so, then whereas the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath twelve Articles, the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath but one Article, and that none

of the twelve, namely, <hi>the supremacy of the Pope.</hi> But this needs makes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: For they denyed not the Popes <hi>Primacy,</hi> that is, of order, but his Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of power. Neither is his Supremacy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the essence. or so essentiall a part of the Roman Catholick Beleef, but that many of the Roman Catholick Communion have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it of old, as the Councells of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile,</hi> and many doe deny it, and more doubt of it at this day.

               <p>But for the suppression of Religious Houses, it is not improbable.

                  </note> he was neither Courtier nor Councelor, nor Convocation man, nor Parliament man.

               <p>But now supposing all <hi>R.

               <p>Therefore not confiding to these broken Reeds at length he admits that Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks were the Authors of the saparation, <hi>Be it so that Roman Catholicks were the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the division, that is worse for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, because then Protestants continue a wicked Schism, wicked begun, against consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, against known truth, and consequently a sin against the holy Ghost.</hi> And to make his assertion good, he produceth the authority of <hi>Optatus,</hi>

The Catholicks owned the Donatists for their brethren, but the Donatists refused to own the Catholicks for their brethren, <hi>quamvie &amp; illi non negent &amp; omnibus not um sit, &amp;c.

Secondly, the Donatists separated the whole Catholick Church from their communion, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted themselves, being but a small part of the Christian World in the place of the Catholick Church.

Secondly, they separated from the Roman Court only in its innovations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out criminous Schism. Thirdly, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, we dare not be so uncharitable as to judge that the whole Kingdome, and all the Pastors of the Church, did sinne against their conscience, but we believe firmly that it was the clear light and evidence of truth, that made them so unanimous in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Fourthly, though they had sinned against the known truth, not being done of malice, it was not the sinne against the holy Ghost. St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not sinne against the holy Ghost when he denied Christ. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they had sinned against consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in separating, yet the fault being not in the thing done, but in the conscience of the doer, we being better informed may with a good conscience hold, what they with a bad conscience did take away. Lastly, though they had sinned, not only in sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating against conscience, but also in the very act of separation.

him out in generall, <hi>If there was any man in the Citie that never laught, and hated all Mankinde, let him depart before Sun-set.</hi> Thinking vainly to hide the nakedness of their Law with a few figg-leaves of generall expressions. So universally was this received throughout the World, that Laws should not be made for the ruine of particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We must Take notice that many things are lawfull in publick Justice, that is, in Warre, or Legislation, or the like, which are not lawfull in particular Justice between Subject and Subject. As it is lawfull to pull down any Citizens house, to save the whole Citie from fire. It is lawfull to make use of any mans land, to make a bank to save the whole Country from inundation; in which cases nevertheless the publick is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to repaire the Subjects damage. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the greater part of a Citie should force the honester part to submit to their pleasure, and contribute to their rebellious courses, or force them to it, the party forced is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Yet in the recoverie of the Towne, the honestest Citizens are as subject to be slain, their houses to be burned, their goods to be plundered, as the most disloyall: And justly. For it being lawfull to reduce the Citie to obedience by warre, this justifies all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie means of reduction. And the honest party who suffer without fault, cannot blame the Magistrates for their sufferings, nor the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65027:70"/>
Souldiers who doe their commands, but their fellow Citizens. But when this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity is over, and the Citie is reduced, and distinction can be made, particular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice must take place again, and then none ought to suffer but Delinquents, according to the degree of their Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To proceed one step neerer to the case in question. The same necessity doth justifie those Lawes which are enacted for the common safety and tranquillity of the whole body politick, under whatsoever penalties they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they find cause to banish a citizen, either for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed terme, or for ever, under pain of death, or forfeiture of all their goods, if there be a necessity in it to secure the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, they may doe it.

In summe, it is cleer that whensoever a Prince or a Republick, out of just necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for the preservation of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,

And if the Subject will not obey, his blood is upon his own head. The only question is, whether there was at that time not only a pretended, but a reall necessity to make those Laws, which they call sanguinary or bloody, for the preservation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. This is the case between the Romanists and us, upon these two hinges this controversy is moved.</p>
               <p>Then to leave the Thesis, and come unto the Hypothesis, and to shew that at that time there was a reall necessity for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of those Laws. First, let it be observed, that after the secession of the English Church from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Popes have for the most part looked upon <hi>England</hi> with a very ill eye.<note place="margin">

               <p>This is not all.

And that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome hath supreme authority and most full power over the whole World, yea even in temporall matters.

Yea, that all things whatsoever done by the Queens authority from the time that the Bull declaratory of</hi> Pius quintus <hi>was published, were by the Laws of God and Man altogether void, and to be esteemed nothing. And some of them dissembled not that they were returned into</hi> England <hi>with no other intent, then, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling in confession, to absolve every one in particular from all oathes of allegiance and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Queen.</hi> Judg how such Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deserved to be welcomed into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

               <p>Lay all these together, their disloyall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, their seditious tenets, so many trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous attempts, so many open Rebellions, so many depositions and deprivations and exclusions, so many Books brim-full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious treason. At such a time when the seditious opinions of that party were in their Zenith; when seditious persons crowded over daily in such numbers; when the Heir apparent of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was a Roman Catholick. And let any reasonable man judge, whether the Kingdome of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had not just cause of feare; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were not necessitated to provide <hi>nequid detrimenti caperet Respublica, that the Commonwealth should sustain no loss</hi>; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Statesmen who did then sit at the sterne, were not obliged to their Prince and to their Countrie, to provide by all means possible for the security of their Prince and tranquility of their Countrie, which could not be done at that time, without the exclusion of such Bigots and Bowtifeus from among them, nor they be possibly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65027:73"/>
excluded but by such severe Lawes.</p>
               <p>These are the very reasons given in the Edict it self,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apr.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; El.</hi> 23. <hi>ex Apol. Mart.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>it did plainly appear to her Majesty and her Councell, by many examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by their own Letters and confessions, and by the actuall conspiracies of the like persons sent into</hi> Ireland <hi>by the Pope, that the end and scope of sending them into her Majesties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, was to prepare the Subjects to assist forrein invaders, to excite the People to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and to deprive her Majesty of her Crown and dignity, and life it self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet may we not accuse all for the faults of some. Though many of them who were bred in those Seminaries were Pensioners of the Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> all which at that time were in open hostility with the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> (Is it not lawfull to forbid Subjects to be bred in an enemies Countrie, or to turn their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners? or if they doe goe out of themselves, to exclude them from their native Soyle?) Yet in other places, and it may be in those Colleges also, many others preserved their principles of loyalty. At the same time Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Bishopp,</hi> one of the Roman communion, writ a Book to prove that the constitution obtruded upon the world under the name of the Lateran Councell, upon which the Popes authority of deposing Princes and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving Subjects from their allegiance is founded, was not decreed by the Fathers, nor ever admitted in <hi>England,</hi> but was a private
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65027:74"/>
Decree of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third. If all his Fellowes had held the same moderation, there had been no need of such Lawes. But it is a remediless misery of Societies, that when distinction cannot be made between the guilty and the Innocent, publick Justice (which seeks to prevent the common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) looks upon the whole Society with one eie. And if any innocent persons suffer, they must not blame the Law, but their own Fellowes, who gave just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for the making of such severe Lawes.</p>
               <p>So we see how many things here were of their own election. First they were warned by an Edict not to study in those Seminaries, which were founded and maintained by such as were at that time in publick hostility with the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Nevertheless they would not doe it. They were commannded to return home by a prefixed time. They would not doe it. This alone had been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to punish them as Traitors by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lawes of the Land. Yet further they were commanded upon pain of death not to return into <hi>England,</hi> nor to exercise their priestly Functions there. Yet they did it. And one of them writ a letter to the Lords of the Councel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edm. Camp. epist. ad Conc. R. Aug.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>he was come over, and would not desist untill he had either turned them to be Roman Catholicks, or died upon their Lances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude if we view the particular
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65027:74"/>
Lawes, we shall finde that they looked more upon the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> then the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Act and Oath of Supremacy were framed in the daies of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth by Roman Catholicks themselves. The first penall Lawes of this nature that I finde made by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were in the sixth year of her reign, against those who should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the authority of the Pope thrice by word or writing, or refuse the Oath of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>upre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may twice. The second in the fourteenth year of her reign, against those who should pronounce the Queen to be an Heretick, Schismatick, or Infidell. And likewise those who brought over Bulls from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to reconcile any of the Queens Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or Indulgences, or <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> or the like. Yet was this never put in execution for six years, untill the execution of it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted. All this either concerned the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or such Acts as were not necessary to a Roman Catholick for the injoyment of his conscience. A man might beleeve freely what his conscience dictated to him, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise his own religion, so he prated not too much, nor medled with others. Afterwards in the twenty third year of her reign, issued out the Proclamation against the English Seminaries, wherein her Subjects were bred Pensioners to the enemies of her Crown. The last Lawes of this kinde were made in the twenty fourth year of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eign, against those who should diswade English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65027:75"/>
from their obedience to their Prince, or from the Religion established, or should reconcile them to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all these Lawes, though extorted from the Queen by so many rebellions, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and deprivations, and extremest neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, there was nothing that did reflect upon an old quiet Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> Priest, or any that were ordained within the land by the Romish Bishops then surviving, so they were not over busie, and medled with others. These might have sufficed or officiating to Roman Catholicks if the Pope had pleased: But he preferred his own ends before their safty, <hi>Non his juvenius orta parentibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecit aequor sanguine.</hi> These were not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled for his purpose, nor of that temper that his affaires required. And therefore he erected new Seminaries, and placed new Readers according to his own minde. And in conclusion forced the Queen to use neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary remedies so save her selfe and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. These things being premised, it will not be difficult to answer to all which <hi>R. C.</hi> saith.</p>
               <p>First, he saith that in all the pretended cases of treason, <hi>there is no election but of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and that they suffer meerly for matters of Religion, without any shew of true Treason.</hi> I confess that Treason is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with Religion in it. But I deny that they suffer meerly for Religion, any
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65027:75"/>
more then he that poisoned an Emperour or a Prior in the Sacrament, could have been said to suffer for administring the Sacrament, and not rather for mixing poison with the Sacrament; or then he, who out of blinde obedience to his Superior kills a man, can be said to suffer death for his conscience; or he who being infected with the Plague, and seeking to infect others; if he be shot dead in the attempt, can be said to suffer for his sickness. In so many designs to take away the Queens life, in so many rebellions, in so many seditious tenets, in so many traitorous books, and lastly in adhering unto, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Pensioner to a publick professed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their Prince and native Country, can he see no treason? nothing but matters of Religion? If he cannot, or will not; yet they who were more nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, had reason to look better about them.</p>
               <p>He asks <hi>how I can tearm that politicall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, which is Supremacy in all causes, to wit, Ecclesiasticall or Religious?</hi> I answer, very well; As the King is the Keeper of both Tables, to see that every one of his Subjects doe his duty in his place, whether Clergy-man or Lay-man, and to infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall punishment upon them who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. And where he saith that <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>challenged more,</hi> he doth her wrong. She Challenged no more. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in her first Parliament tooke order to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65027:76"/>
have <hi>the head of the English Church</hi> left out of her Title.</p>
               <p>He demands further, whether Nero <hi>by the same right might not have condemned St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>of Treason, for coming to</hi> Rome <hi>with forbidden Orders, and seeking to seduce his Subjects from the Religion estabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</hi> No, for no Orders were forbidden in <hi>Rome</hi> by law, true or false: Neither did those blessed Apostles seduce Subjects when they converted them from vanities to serve the living God. Let him shew that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by his declaratory Bull did deprive <hi>Nero</hi> of his Empire, and absolve his Subjects from their allegiance, or had his Emissaries to incite them to rebellion, or sent hollowed banners, and Phenix plumes, and plenarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, to those who were in Arms against him, or plotted how to take away his life, or that Christians in those dayes did publish any such seditions books, or broach Opinions so pernicious to all civil government. And then his question will deserve a further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Untill then it may suffice to tell him the case is not the same. Still he confounds politicall Supremacy with ecclesiasticall, and the accidentall abuses of holy Orders, with holy Orders themselves.</p>
               <p>Upon this mistake, he urgeth an Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme against us, <hi>Popish Priesthood and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Ministry are the same in substance: Therefore if the one be treasonable, the other is treasonable also.</hi> His consequence is just
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65027:76"/>
such another as this; <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> are both the same creatures in substance, that is, men; therefore if <hi>Thomas</hi> be a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Nicholas</hi> is another. How often must he be told, that their Treason did not lie in the substance of their holy Orders, but in the abuses, and in the treasonable crimes of the persons constituted in holy Orders, in their disobedience to the Lawes in being Pensioners to publick enemies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he presseth this Argument yet further. <hi>If Popish Priests can be lawfully forbidden by Protestants to return into</hi> England, <hi>contrary to the Lawes under pain of Treason, then Protestant Ministers may be also forbidden by Puritans and Independents to return into</hi> England, <hi>contrary to their Lawes, upon pain of Treason.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Hoc <hi>Ithacus</hi> velit, &amp; magno mercentur Achivi.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This is that which many of them desire. They doubt not at long running to deal well enough with the rest, but the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants are a beam in their eie. To his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I answer by denying his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which halts downright upon all fower. First, Let him shew that those whom he tearms Puritans and Independents have the same just power. Secondly, That there is such a Law in force. Thirdly, That there
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65027:77"/>
are as just grounds now for such a Law as there were then, That the Protestant Clergy on this side the Seas are so formidable, either for their number, or for their dependency upon the Pope or forrein Princes. Let him shew that they left the Kingdome contrary to Law, and have been bred here in such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries contrary to Law, and are so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled with seditious opinions, which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten such imminent a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d unavoydable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ruin to the Kingdome. If he fail in any one of these, as he will doe in every one of them, his consequence falls flat to to the ground.</p>
               <p>In the close of this Chapter, he produceth two testimonies beyond exception, to prove that <hi>Popish Priests in</hi> England <hi>died for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> The one of King <hi>Iames</hi> in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Oath of Allegiance.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly maintain that which I have said in my Apology, that no man either in my time or in the late Queens, ever died here for his conscience, Priests, and Popish Church-men only excepted, that receive Orders beyond Seas.</hi> The other of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that <hi>she did think that most of the poor Priests,</hi>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65027:77"/>
and disjointed sentences, and likewise by cutting off his sentence in the middest. For evident proof whereof, I will here lay down the sentence word for word, as they are in the French edition, for I have neither the Latine nor the English by me. <hi>I maintain constantly and it is most true which I said in my Apology, that never, neither in the time of the late Queen, nor in my time, any man whatsoever hath been executed simply for Religion.</hi> Here is a full truth without any exception in the World. Then followes immediately, <hi>For let a man be as much a Papist as he will, let him publish it abroad with as much constancy and zeal as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, his life never was, nor is in danger for it: Provided that he attempt not some fact, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly contrary to the Lawes, nor have an hand in some dangerous and unlawfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.</hi> Then followes the exception, <hi>Priests and Popish Church-men excepted which receive their Orders beyond the Seas.</hi> Which exception is not referred to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer clause, <hi>never hath been executed simply for Religion,</hi> but to the later clause, <hi>his life never was nor is in danger for it.</hi> Their lives were in danger indeed, being forfeited to the Law, but they were never executed, by the grace and favour of the Prince. The words following, which he hath altogether clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, doe make the fraud most apparent: <hi>who</hi> (which Priests) <hi>for many and many treasons and attempts which they have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

and devised against this estate, being once departed out of the Kingdome, are prohibited to return, render pain of being reputed, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted and convicted of the crime of treason.

                     </gap>ir simple return into</hi> England, <hi>never any of them were executed.</hi> We see plainly that these penall Lawes were not made in Order to Religion, but out of necessary reason of Estate to prevent treason. Nor was any man executed for disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to those penall Lawes, unlesse it was complicated with some other crime.</p>
               <p>To come to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> If that which he saith here be true, then that flower of Queens was a tyrant worse then <hi>Nero,</hi> to thirst not only after humane blood, but after innocent blood, yea after the blood of those who were designed to the service of God.

When all these unanimously have declared that there is a necessity, and have prescribed the best means that possibly they could devise to prevent the danger, shall a forrein Prelate, and he not only interessed, but the very source of all the danger, have power to contradict it, and to send his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected Emissaries more frequently then ever into the Kingdome? A Pit is digged, true, but the Authors of these seditious opinions and practises, are they who digged it. The Queen did what she could to cover it, by her Proclamations and Acts of Parliament, to premonish every one of the danger. If the Pope and their Superiors would be so cruell to thrust out their Emissaries upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate attempts, upon their vow of blinde obedience, and a promise of Celestiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, their blood is upon their heads. The Queen said further, That <hi>for the most part

Those who were executed in her long reign of above fourty four yeers were not so many. This expression would have fitted the short reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> much better. Secondly, he adds these words, [<hi>were guilty of treason</hi>] whereas the Queen said no such thing, but [were guilty <hi>of practising the destruction of their Country.</hi>] Can none have an hand in the destruction of their Country, but only they who are practisers and plotters and contrivers of it?

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65027:80"/>
necessary remedies for its own conservation. That which I said, I spake indifferently both of their Lawes and ours. That Law which was justly enacted, may be over-rigorously executed, when that necessity which was the only ground of the Law is abated. I wish the necessity had not been then so great as to require Lawes written in blood, and that a lesser coercion would have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed then for a remedy. The necessity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abated I wish the rigor may be likewise abated. To divide their Lawes and our Lawes, or the necessity and the remedy is a fallacy and contrary to what I said, when I wished all seditious opinions and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigorous Statutes were buried in oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> then Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did commit much to my hands the politicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of that Church, for the space of eight yeers. In all that time let him name one Roman Catholick, that suffered either death or imprisonment, or so much as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary mulct of twelve pence for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon any penall Statute. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as I am sure he cannot, then it is not my present persecution that taught me that lenity. I remember not one Roman Catholick that suffered in all that time,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65027:80"/>
but only the titular Archbishop of <hi>Cashells,</hi> who was indeed imprisoned for three or four daies, not only upon suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, but upon information out of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he was a pensioner of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Kings, and being found to be no such dangerous person upon my representation was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Let no man hence imagine that we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected our duties.

I shewed how they endeavored to convert this honorable Presidency into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall power; But that the power which they endeavored to usurpe, was in it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of prescription. And if it had been capable, yet they had no prescription for it. That the British, Saxon, Danish, and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kings, successively were the onely Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Protectors of the Church within their Dominions, and disposed of all things concerning the externall regiment thereof, by the advise of their Prelats, called ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Synods, made ecclesiasticall Laws, punished ecclesiasticall persons, prohibited ecclesiasticall Judges, received Appeales from ecclesiasticall Courts, rejected the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Laws of the Popes at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, gave legislative interpretations of other of their ecclesiasticall Laws, as they thought good, in order to their own Dominions;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65027:81"/>
made ecclesiasticall Corporations, appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ecclesiasticall Benefices, translated epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Sees, forbid Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Popes Bulls, protested against his Legats, questioned both the Legates and all those who acknowledged them in the Kings Bench, condemned the Excommunications and other sentences of the Roman Court, enlarged or restrained the priviledges of the Clergy, prescribed the endowment of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars, set down the wages of Priests, and made Acts to remedy the oppressions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Court. And all this was shewed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, not out of the single testimonies of some obscure Authors, but out of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and Common Law of the Realm, out of the Reports of our Judges and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Lawyers, out of the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, the Statutes of <hi>Clarendon</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> the Articles of the Clergy, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of Provisors, and many other Statutes made with the generall consent of the whole Kingdome. It is not possible in any cause to produce more authenticall proofs then these are: To all which in particular <hi>R. C.</hi> answers not one word. So as once more I take it for granted, that <hi>Henry</hi> the eight did nothing in his separation from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but what his most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Ancestors had chalked forth unto him.</p>
               <p>All that he saith, with any shew of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this, is first, That <hi>whatsoever Kings
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65027:82"/>
doe is not lawfull,</hi> Whereas I spake not of any single Kings, but of the whole succession of British E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h proves irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably, that what they did, was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and common fundamentall Law of the Kingdome. And that there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, nor can be, against it. That they did it <hi>de facto,</hi> is enough to make good my assertion, that <hi>Henry</hi> the eight did no new thing, but what his Predecessors in all ages had done before him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he saith, That <hi>Kings may resist the exercise or Acts of Papall power sometimes, and yet acknowledge the power</hi> Whereas the Laws and testimonies which I produced,<note place="margin">Not only acts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but the Power it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Laws.</note> doe not only speak against some acts of Papall power, but against the power it self, against the Popes power to make Laws, to send Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, or Bulls, or Excommunications with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out license, the power to receive Appeals, the power to make ecclesiasticall Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>porati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the power to dispose of ecclesiasticall Benefices, &amp;c. What lawfull power had the Pope in the eye of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> who by the Law of <hi>England</hi> could neither send a Legate thither to doe Justice there, nor call the Delinquents or Litigants to <hi>Rome</hi> to doe Justice there, without license? Our Laws speak not only against <hi>Pandulphus,</hi> or this or that Legate, but against all Legates that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65027:82"/>
come without license; nor against the Bull or Excommunication of <hi>Paul</hi> the third alone, but against all Bulls and Excommunications which were brought from <hi>Rome</hi> into the Kingdome, without license. <hi>Frustranea est ea potentia quae nunquam deduci potest in actum,</hi> In vain is an absolute power given to a single person to execute that which he cannot execute without another mans license. Lastly, our Laws do ascribe this very power to the King which the Pope doth challenge, The Patronage of the Church, the power to make ecclesiasticall Laws, the power to call ecclesiasticall Synods, the power to dispose of all things which concern the externall regiment of the Church, by the advise of his Clergy and Councell, within his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. In vain doth he distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the acts or exercise of Papall power and the power it self, seeing our ancient Law doth not only forbid the exercise of Papall power, but deny the power it self.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>If I would indeed prove that</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the eight did but vindicate his ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I should prove that English Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him did challenge to be heads of the Church immediatly under Christ, by which headship, as it was expressed in King</hi> Edwards <hi>time, all Iurisdiction both in spirituall and temporall causes descended from the Crown.</hi> To prove that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth did but vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his ancient Liberty, it is not necessary
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65027:83"/>
that I should justifie all the extravagant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, or oylie insinuations of parasiticall flatterers. Our Kings neither doe challenge, nor ever did challenge all Jurisdiction in spirituall causes, nor any part of the power of the Keyes, either to their own use, or to derive it to others. Great Pallaces seldome want their Moths, or great Princes their Flatterers, who are ready to blow the coals of ambition, and adorn their Masters with stollen plumes, such as the Canonists were of old to the Popes. It is not much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, if some Protestants did overshoot themselves in some expressions upon this subject, having learned that language from a Roman Catholick before them. Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> being the Kings Embassador with <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh, did so boldly and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set forth his Masters Supremacy in the Assembly of the Cardinalls, that they thought of burning him, or casting him into a vessell of scalding lead, if he had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his own safety by flight. <hi>Acworth contra Monarch. Sanderi, l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 195. It would better become him and me, if any such thing had beene, to give unto <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is <hi>Caesars,</hi> and unto God that which is Gods. It is enough to my purpose to have shewed that all King <hi>Henries</hi> Predecessors did both challenge and enjoy this politicall headship of the Church, as I have shewed throughout all the parts &amp; branches thereof, if he could see wood for trees. These very
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65027:83"/>
flowers and jewels of the Crown enumerated by me in this Chapter, and demonstrated out of our Laws in my vindication, doe make up that politique headship, that is, a power paramount, to see that all persons doe their duties in their callings, and that all things be acted by fit Agents, which are necessary to that great and Architectonicall end, that is, the safety and tranquility of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. This is that title which <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confessor did enjoy before the Conquest, namely, <hi>The Vicar of God to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Church within his own Dominions,</hi> which is neither more nor lesse then the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall head of the Church. In a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily there are severall offices, as a Divine, a Physitian, a Schoolmaster, and every one of these is supreme in his own way; yet the Master of the Family hath an oeconomicall power over them all, to see that none of them doe abuse their trust to the disturbance of the Family. Our Parliament Rolles, our ecclesiasticall Registers, the Records of the Kings Bench and Common Pleas doe all prove, that it is no innovation for our Kings to interpose in ecclesiasticall affairs. I doe confesse that some of these flowers which were peculiar to the King, as the Patronage and investitures of Bishops, in later dayes were snatched from the Crown by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Popes; but for many of the rest, and especially for that which did virtually include them all, that is, the Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>slative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65027:84"/>
in ecclesiasticall causes, wherein the whole body of the Kingdome did claim a neerer interest, in respect of that receptive Power which they have ever injoyed, to admit or not admit such new Laws whereby they were to be governed, it had been folly and madness in the Popes to have attempted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>One doubt still remains, How ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Jurisdiction could be said <hi>to be derived from</hi> the Crown. (For they might be apt enough in those dayes to use such improper expressions.<note place="margin">Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Princes apply the matter.</note>) First, with the Romanists themselves I distinguish between habituall and actuall Jurisdiction. Habituall Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is derived only by ordination. Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Jurisdiction, is a right to exercise that habit, arising from the lawfull application of the matter or subject. In this later the Lay Patron, and much more the Soveraign Prince, have their respective Interests and concurrence. Diocesses and Parishes were not of divine but humane institution. And the same persons were born Subjects before they were made Christians. The ordinary gives a School master a license or habituall power to teach, but it is the Parents of the Children who apply or substract the matter, and furnish him with Scholars, or afford him a fit subject whereupon to exercise this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must also distinguish between the interior and exterior Court, between the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65027:84"/>
Court of Conscience and the Court of the Church. For in both these Courts the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keies hath place, but not in both after the same manner. That power which is exercised in the Court of Conscience, for binding and loosing of sinnes, is soly from Ordination.<note place="margin">Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and fortified with coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power by Princes</note> But that power which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the Court of the Church, is partly from the Soveraign Magistrate, especially in <hi>England</hi> where Ecclesiasticall Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is enlarged and fortified with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power, and the bounds thereof have been much dilated by the favour and piety of Christian Princes, by whom many causes have been made of Ecclesiasticall cognisance which formerly were not, &amp; from whom the coercive or compulsory power of summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Kings Subjects by processes and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations was derived. It is not then the power of the Keies, or any part or branch thereof in the exercise of Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction, even in the exterior Court of the Church which is derived from the Crown: But it is coercive and compulsory and corobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory power, it is the application of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is the regulating of the exercise of actuall Ecclesiasticall Jurisdicton in the Court of the Church, to prevent the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of their Subjects, and to provide for the tranquillity of the Common-wealth, which belongs to Sovereign Princes.</p>
               <p>As to his corollary that never any King of <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, did <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

                     <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth not exempt from the power of the Keyes.</note> it is as gross a mistake as all the rest. For neither did <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth challenge any such exemption in the Court of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Among the six bloody Articles esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by himself, that of auricular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was one.

The Pope himself is under his Confessor, who hath power to binde him or loose him in the Court of Conscience. The Master of a Family is under his own Chaplain for the regiment of his Soul, and under his Physitian for the government of his Body. What should hinder it, that a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall Head may not be under an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Pastor. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> are not only under the forrein Jurisdiction of a generall Councell, but also under their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Pastors though their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Only they are exempted from all coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive and compulsory power.</p>
               <p>Let us trie whether he be more fortunate in opposing, then he hath been in answering. <hi>The Kings of England</hi> (saith he) <hi>permitted Appeales to</hi> Rome <hi>in ecclesiasticall causes, as is evident in St.</hi> Wilfrides <hi>case,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Saint <hi>Wilfrid.</hi>

                  <hi>who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reproved nor disliked for appealing twice to</hi> Rome: not so, but the clear contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth evidently in Saint <hi>Wilfrides</hi> case. Though he was an Archbishop, and if an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal had been proper in any case, it had been in that case.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spel. conc An.</hi> 705.</note> This pretended Appeal was not only much disliked but rejected, by two Kings successively, by the other Archbishop, and by the body of the English Clergy, as appeareth by the event. For <hi>Wilfride</hi> had no benefit of the Popes sentences, but was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after all his strugling, to quit the two Monasteries which were in question, whether he would or not, and to sit down with his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65027:86"/>
Archbishoprick, which he might allwnies have held peaceably if he would. This agrees with his supposed Vision in <hi>France,</hi> that at his return into his Country, he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greatest part of his possessions that had been taken from him,<note place="margin">

The King told them further, That <hi>he could not give any assent to their legation.</hi> So that which <hi>R. C.</hi> calles permitting, was in truth downright dissenting and rejecting. The reason followes, <hi>because it was against reason, that a person twice condemned by the whole Councel of the English, should be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Popes Letter.</hi> Is not this disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king?

We acknowledge that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the beginning of unity; why then might he not have the first place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his primacy of Order? But the question between them and us is of another nature, concerning a supremacy of Power. When St. <hi>Peters</hi> Nets were full, he did but beckon and his fellows came to partake: But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> use him more hardly.

To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to erect new Bishopricks had been a power paramount indeed, This was more then to execute the Canons. The history is recited not in the ninth chapter, but in the fifth chapter of the second Book of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesburie, de Gestis Regum Anglorum,</hi> not as his own relation, but transcribed out of a nameless Writer, <hi>verbis eisdem quibus inveni scripta interseram.</hi> In the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the elder, the Region of the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Saxons had wanted Bishops (upon what ground doth not appear) <hi>per septem annos plenos,</hi> seven whole years. And it may be that some of the Bishopricks had been lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vacant, perhaps ingrossed by the Bishops of <hi>Winchester</hi> and <hi>Shireborne,</hi> which two I finde to have been alwaies of great note in the Court of the West-Saxon Kings. The ground of my conjecture is the words of the Author, <hi>Quod olim duo habuerunt in quinque diviserunt, What two for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:65027:91"/>
remembers what tragicall stirres he made at <hi>Rome</hi>; but as to this particular a better man might have done a worse deed. <hi>He sent his Letters into</hi> England, <hi>misit in</hi> Angliam <hi>Epistolas,</hi> and it seemeth that they were very high, <hi>quid a Papa</hi> Formoso <hi>praeceptum sit,</hi> but <hi>praeceptum</hi> signifies a lesson or instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as a commandement. And again, <hi>dabat excommunicationem &amp; maledictionem Regi</hi> Edwardo <hi>&amp; omnibus Subjectis ejus, he bestowed an excommunication and a curse upon King</hi> Edward <hi>and all his Subjects.</hi> Why what had the poor Subjects offended? or King <hi>Edward</hi> for any thing that appeareth? This was sharp work indeed, the first sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons an excommunication with a curse: A man of <hi>Formosus</hi> his temper, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Bishop of an Apostolicall Church, though he violated his oath to obtain it; and who supposed himself to be not only the Patriarch of <hi>Britaine,</hi> but a Master (of misrule) in the Church, might adventure farre: But to doe him right, I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that this was any formall sentence; that had been too palpably unjust before a citation, I remember not that any other Author mentions it, which they would have done, if it had been a solemn interdict, in those dayes. And this nameless Author calls it but an Epistle. Moreover he tells us of honourable presents sent to the Pope, but not a word of any absolution, which had been more to his purpose, if this had been an
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65027:91"/>
excommunication. It could be nothing but a threatning, That unless this abuse were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed he would hold no communion with them: As <hi>Victor</hi> a much better Pope, and in much better times dealt with the Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, over whom he had no Jurisdiction. There is a vast difference between formall excommunication and withholding of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; as also between imposing eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall punishment, and only representing what is incurred by the Canons.</p>

And if they be understood simply and absolutely of an universall communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> both present and future, they are unfound in the judgment of <hi>Bellarraine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

for our not communicating with them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in all things, are either sprung up since <hi>Ealreds</hi> time or at least, since that time, made or declared necessarie conditions of their communion. Lastly, I desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take notice, that these words of <hi>Eal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> doe contain nothing against the politicall Supremacy of Kings, nor against the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the English Church, nor for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> over <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and so might have been passed by as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>

There cannot be imagined a weaker or a poorer argument then that which is drawn from the superscription or subscription of a Letter. He that enrolls every man in the catalogue of his friends and servants, who subscribe themselves <hi>his loving or obliged friends,</hi> or <hi>his faithfull and obedient servants,</hi> will finde his friends and servants sooner at a feast then at a fray. Titles are given in Letters more out of custome and formality then out of judgment and truth. The Pope will not stick to endite his Letter
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65027:95"/>
To the King of the Romans, and yet suffer him to have nothing to doe in <hi>Rome.</hi> Every one who endited their Letters to the high and mighty Lords the States Generall, did not presently beleeve that was their just Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the King of <hi>Spains</hi> resignation. Titles are given sometimes out of curtesie, sometimes out of necessity, because men will not lose their business for want of a complement. He that will write to the great Duke of <hi>Muscovia</hi> must stile him Emperour of <hi>Russia.</hi> How many have lost their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and their labours for want of a <hi>mon Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> or <hi>mon Confine, my Brother</hi> or <hi>my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were best for him to quit his argument from superscriptions, otherwise he will be shewed Popes calling Princes their Lords, and themselves their Subjects and Servants, yea Princes most glorious and most excellent Lords, and themselves Servants of Servants, that is, Servants in the snperlative degree. They will finde Cyprian <hi>to his brother</hi> Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius <hi>health,</hi> and Justinian <hi>to</hi> John <hi>the most holy Archbishop of the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp; Patriarch.</hi> Did St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> beleeve <hi>Cornelius</hi> to be his Master and stile him Brother, or owe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and service and send but health? Had is been comely to stile an ecclesiasticall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch plaine Archbishop and Patriarch, and for the Christian World to set down only the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi>?</p>
               <p>But what doth he take hold on in this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65027:95"/>
to their advantage? Is it the word <hi>summo</hi>? That cannot be, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed generally that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had priority of order among the Patriarchs. Or is it the word <hi>universali</hi>? Neither can that be, all the Patriarchs were stiled oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall or universall, not in respect of an universall power, but their universall care,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The care of all the Churches did lie upon him,</hi> and their presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in generall Councels. It cannot be the word <hi>Pastori,</hi> all Bishops were anciently called Pastors. Where then lies the strength of this Argument? In the words <hi>due sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>? No. There is subjection to good advise, as well as to just commands. The principall Patriarchs bore the greatest sway in a generall Councell, in that respect there was subjection due unto them. The last words <hi>all forts of service,</hi> are not in some Copies, and if they were, <hi>verborum ut num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum,</hi> as they are commonly used, as well from Superiors to their Inferiors, as from Inferiors to their Superiors, they signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

The King gives fair words in generall, but notwithstanding all that the Pope could doe to the contrary proceeds, renews his league with the Emperor, and his Commission for the Lieutenancy, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted more to his own judgement then co the <hi>supereminent judgement of the Pope.</hi>

Even all the power that is in controversie between us and them. He challenged the politicall headship of the English Church, under pretence of an Ecclesiasticall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. He challenged a Legislative power in Ecclesiasticall causes. He challenged a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensative power above the Lawes, against the Lawes of the Church, whensoever, wheresoever, over whomsoever. He chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged liberty to send Legates, and hold legantine Courts in <hi>England</hi> without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. He challenged the right of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the last Appeals of the Kings Subjects. He challenged the Patronage of the English Church, and investitures of Bishops, with power to impose a new Oath upon them, contrary to their Oath of Allegiance. He challenged the first Fruits and Tenths of Ecclesiasticall livings, and a power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon them what pensions or other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens he pleased. He challenged the Goods of Clergy-men dying intestate, &amp;c. All which are expresly contrary to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Lawes and Customes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He confesseth, That <hi>it is Lawfull to resist the Pope, invading either the Bodies or the Souls of men, or troubling the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or indeavoring to destroy the Church.</hi>

I aske no more, Yea <hi>forsooth, saith he, if I may be judge, what doth invade the Soul</hi>? No I confesse I am no fit Judge. No more is he. The main question is who shall be Judge, what are the Liberties and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of a nationall Church, and what are the grievances which they sustain from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Is it equall that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> themselves should be the Judges? Who are the persons that doe the wrong. Nothing can be more absurd. In vain is any mans sentence expected against himself. The most proper and the highest judicature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth in this case, is a generall Councell, as it was in the case of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishops and their pretended Patriarch. And untill that remedy can be had, it is lawfull and behooveth every Kingdome or nationall Church, who know best their own rights, and have the most feeling where their Shoe wrings them, to be their own Judges, I mean only by a judgment of discretion, to preserve their own rights inviolated, and their persons free from wrong, <hi>sub modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine inculpatae tutelae.</hi> And especially Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes, are bound both by their Office and by their Oaths to provide for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and indemnity of their Subjects, as all Roman Catholicks Princes doe when they have occasion.</p>

               <p>THe scope of my fifth Chapter, was to shew that the Britannick Churches were free from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein jurisdiction for the first six hundred yeers, and so ought to continue. For the clearing of which point, I shewed that there was a parity of power among the Apostles. And that the Sovereignty did not rest in any single Apostle, but in the Apostolicall college. I shewed that in the age of the Apostles, and the age next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the highest Order in the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apostles, were nationall Protarchs or Patriarchs. And by what means, and upon what grounds in after ages some of these Patriarchs came to be exalted above the rest, and to obscure their fellowes. But each of these within their own Patriarchates,<note place="margin">Patriarchs ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

at <hi>Antioch,</hi> they accused <hi>Iulius</hi> sharply, and shewed that he had nothing to doe to contradict them, more then they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him when he thrust <hi>Novatus</hi> out of the Church. Neither did the great Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriarchs challeng this independency only, but other lesser Patriarchs also, as Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi> When <hi>Fortunatus Faelicissimus</hi> and others being sentenced and excommunicated in <hi>Africk,</hi> addressed their complaint to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us hear what Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> said of it,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>What cause had they to come and relate the making of a false Bishop against true Bishops? Either that which they have done pleaseth them and they persevere in their wickednesse, or if it displease them and they fall from it, they know whether to return: for whereas it is decreed by us all, and it is equall and just, that every ones cause should be heard there where the crime was committed, and a certain portion of the Lords flock is assigned to each Pastor, which he is to govern, and to give an account of his actions to the Lord. Therefore it behooveth those whom we are over not to run up and down, nor to break the firm concord of Bishops by their subtle and deceitfull rashnesse. But to plead their cause there where they may have both accusers and witnesses of their crimes, unlesse the authority of the</hi> African <hi>Bishops, who have sentenced them already, seem to a few desperate cast awaies to be inferior, &amp;c.</hi> To say, with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>

               <p>Then I shewed the bounds of the ancient Roman Patriarchate out of <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> The rest of the Chapter may be reduced to a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme.

Power that mortall men were capable of. And if he say not more then I did, I am sure he saith no less.

               <p>Secondly, this answer is altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65027:102"/>
The question is not between us, what the Apostles were in respect of their perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall actions among themselves one towards another, though even this were absurd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to say that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had Power to suspend his fellow Apostles, either in their offices or in their Persons: But the question between us is, what the Apostles were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the government of the Christian World, wherein by this distinction he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them all to be equall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by his leave he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had any Power and Jurisdiction over the rest of the Apostles, and they had none mutually over him; then it was not <hi>par Potestas,</hi> an equall Power, for <hi>par in parem non habet Potestatem.</hi> If his Power was fuller then theirs, then theirs was not <hi>plenissima Potestas:</hi> If his Power was higher then theirs, then theirs was not <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Potestas</hi>: If there was some ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Power which they had not, then all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Power was not comprehended in Apostolicall Authority, then the Power of opening and shutting is larger then the Power of binding and loosing; and <hi>to feed Christ's Sheep,</hi> is more then <hi>to be sent as his Father sent him</hi>; all which is contrary both to the truth, and to what himself hath taught us.</p>

And if there be a judiciary Power and Authority in the body of the Society, it is a sufficient remedy against Schisme.

Neither was Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sole Pastor of the Church, nor his universal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority necessary to a true Pastor, neither were the Apostles meer Delegates, for then they could have had no Successors, which yet he acknowledgeth that they had.<note place="margin">

At other times he makes the Pope an Apostolicall Bishop, his See to be an Apostolicall See, and his Office to be an Apostleship. It is strange the Spirit of God should be so silent in a piece of Doctrine which they assert to be necessary, and that the blessed Apostles, and the Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and holy <hi>Athanasius</hi> should be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, as not to insert it into their Creeds. But that the whole Church should be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of such a mystery for fifteen hundred years, is not credible.</p>
               <p>I passe by their comparison of a Bishop who is Pastor and ordinary of his Diocesse, whose Office descends to his Successors, and a Frier licenced by the Pope to Preach throughout the same Diocesse, whose Office determineth with his Life. So what they can not prove they endeavour to illustrate. Before they told us that the Apostles were the Vicars of Christ, are they now become
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65027:105"/>
the Vicars of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?

No, the Apostles had more then licences to Preach, even as ample power to govern, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himself. The Pope having insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted one man into a Bishoprick, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not during his incumbency give the joint government of his Church to another.

Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality an incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostles. 9</note>I confesse, that which <hi>R. C.</hi> saith, is in part a truth, That the rest of the Apostles did not leave an universall and Apostolicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and jurisdiction to their successors. But it is not the whole truth, for no more did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himself. The Apostles had diverse things peculiar to their persons, and proper for the first planters of the Gospel. Which were not communicated to any of their successors. As universality of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for which their successors have assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to particular charges. Immediate or extraordinary vocation, for which their Successors have episcopall Ordination. The gift of strange Tongues and infallibility of Judgment, for which we have Christian Schools and Universities. The grace of doing miracles and giving the holy Ghost, by Imposition of Hands. If the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> will take upon them to be Saint
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65027:105"/>
                  <hi>Peters</hi> Heirs <hi>ex asse,</hi> and pretend that their Office is an Apostleship, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are truely <hi>Apostolici,</hi> excluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from that priviledge, let us see them doe some Miracles, or speak strange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which were Apostolicall qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If they cannot, certainly they are not Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Heirs <hi>ex asse,</hi> and though their See be Apostolicall, yet their Office is no Apostleship. Nor may they challenge more then they shew good evidence for, or then the Church is pleased to conferre upon them. The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend to none of these Priviledges, but only this of universall jurisdiction, for though they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge besides this an infallibility of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it is not an Apostolicall infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, because they challenge no infallibility by immediate revelation from God, but from the diligent use of the means, neither doe they challenge an infallibility in their Sermons and writings as the Apostles did, but only in the conclusions of matters of Faith. And why doe they pretend to this Apostolicall qualification more then any of the rest? Either because that if they should pretend to any of the rest, the deceit would presently be discovered, for all men know that they can work no Miracles, nor speak strange Languages, nor have their calling immediately from Heaven, but are elected by their Conclave of Cardinals, many times not without good tugging for it. Or else
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65027:106"/>
because this claim of universall power and authority doth bring more moliture to their mill, and more advantage to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is certain, that when the Pope is first elected Bishop, it may be of some other See, before he be elected Pope, he is ordained after the ordinary form of all other Bishops, he receives no other, no larger character, no more authority and power, either of order or of jurisdiction, then other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bishops doe. Well after this he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Pope, but he is ordeined no more. Then seeing the power of the Keies and all habituall jurisdiction is derived by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every Bishop receiveth as much habituall jurisdiction at his Ordination as the Pope himself, tell me first, how the Pope comes to be the root of all Spirituall juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? Which though it be not the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Tenet of the Roman Church, as <hi>R. C.</hi> saith truely, yet it is the common Doctrin of the Roman Court.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>s.</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, tell me, how comes this dilatation of his power, and this Apostolicall Universality? Since all men doe confesse that the same power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is necessary to the extension of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or Grace given by Ordination, which is required to the institution of a Sacrament, that is, not Humane but Divine. But the election of the Cardinals is a meer Humane policy, without all manner of Sacramentall virtue, and therefore can neither render his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65027:106"/>
Judgment infallible, nor his Jurisdiction u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal. What can the new election doe? Only apply the new matter, that is, make him Bishop of that See whereunto he is elected. They who elect him are the Bishops of the Roman Province, and the Presbyters and Deacons of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons indeed, to chuse a Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but no fit persons to chuse an universall Bishop for the whole Church. It were too much honor for one Nation to have the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Regiment of Christs Church throughout all ages. And whom doe the Conclave chuse? An universall Pastor? No, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely a Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have a third novelty as ill as either of these which I touched even now, that the Regiment of the Church being monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall, as in a Kingdome, all Civill authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is derived from the King, so in the Church all ordinary jurisdiction of Bishops descends immediately from the Pope.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>4.</note> If all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall jurisdiction be derived from the Pope, as all Civil Authority is from the King, then as Civill Magistrates doe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Civil authority in the name of the King;<note place="margin">All Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Pope.</note> so Bishops ought to exercise their Spirituall jurisdiction in the name of the Pope. But this they doe not, this they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did.</p>
               <p>Again if Spirituall jurisdiction be derived to Bishops from the Pope, by what way, by what means, by what channell doth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend?
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65027:107"/>
Either it must be by Commission, or by Ordination. But it is not by Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No Bishops did ever need or expect any Commission from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction within his Diocesse. Neither is it by Ordination, they are very few indeed, that receive Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Pope. How many thousand Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have been and are still in the World, that never received any Ordination from any Pope, either mediately or immediately? But derive the line of their Succession from the other Apostles? If Ecclesiasticall juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction be conveied by Ordination, then it is a part of the character or Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, which is Divine and Sacramentall. I hope the Pope will be wiser then to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to himself the conferring of Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Grace.</p>

we attribute much to their expositions of the holy Text: but in those things which they had upon the credit of a supposititious Author, the conclusion alwaies followes the weaker part. How common a thing hath it been for credulous piety to beleeve, and to record rumors and uncertain relations? If they see no hurt in them, and if they tended to piety. But in a case of this moment to give an infallible Judge to the Church, and a spirituall Prince to the Christian World, to whom all are bound to submit under pain of damnation, we ought to have had better Authority then such a blinde History.

               <p>It is an old artifice of the Romanists, when any Papall priviledge is controverted, to question whether the Pope hold it by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right or humane right, when in truth he holds it by neither, so diverting them from searching into the right question, whether he have any right at all, taking that for granted which is denyed.</p>

S.</hi> Peter <hi>himself left the Bishoprick of</hi> Antioch, <hi>but continued Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>untill his death.</hi> This will afford them no more helpe then the other. When the Apostles did descend and deign to take upon them the charge of a particular Church, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Antioch</hi>; they did not take it by instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as we doe. They had a generall institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Christ for all the Churches of the World. When they did leave the charge of a particular Church to another, they did not quit it by a formall resignation, as we doe. This had beene to limit their Apostolicall Power, which Christ had not limited. But all they did was to depute a Bishop to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cure of Soules during their absence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining still an habituall cure to themselves. And if they returned to the same Citie after such a deputation, they were as much Bishops as formerly. Thus a Bishop of a Diocess so disposeth the actuall cure of Soules of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parish to a Rector, that he himself remains the principall Rector when he is present. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> left <hi>Rome</hi> as much as he left <hi>Antioch,</hi> and dyed Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> as much as he dyed Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> He left <hi>Antioch</hi> and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and returned to <hi>Antioch</hi> again, and governed that Church as formerly he had done. He left <hi>Rome</hi> after he first sate as Bishop there, and went to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and returned to <hi>Rome</hi> again, and still continued the principall Rector of that Church. <hi>Linus</hi> &amp; <hi>Clemens</hi> or the one of them
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65027:110"/>
were as much the Bishop or Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> during the life of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Evodius</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> or the one of them were the Bishop or Bishops of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Rector having two Benefices dies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the one of them, yet he dies the Rector of the other as much as that. I confesse an Apostle was not capable of pluralities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Commission was illimited, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shop is Rector of all the Churches within his Diocess. And though he can die but in one Parish, yet he dies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of all the rest as much as that. If we may believe their History, St. <hi>Peter</hi> at his death was leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> in probability to weather out that storme (which did hang then over his head) in <hi>Antioch,</hi> as he had done in a former persecution. If this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose had taken effect, then by their Doctrine <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>had left the Bishoprick of</hi> Rome, <hi>and dyed Bishop of</hi> Antioch. Thus much for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For matter of right, I doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely denie that Saint <hi>Peters</hi> death at <hi>Rome</hi> doth entitle the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> as his Successor to all or any of those priviledges and prerogatives which he held in another capacitie, and not as he was Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Suppose a Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> dies Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>England,</hi> another Bishop dies Chancellor of the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford</hi>; must their respective Successors therefore of necessity be Chancellors of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65027:110"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> or of that University? No, the right of donation devolves either to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron or to the Society. So supposing, but not granting, that one who was by speciall priviledge the Rector of the Catholick Church died Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> it belongs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Christ or his Vicegerent or Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, invested with Imperiall power, to name, or to the Church it self to choose a Successor. If they could shew out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Christ appointed the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> to succeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> in a spirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, it would strike the question dead: Or that St. <hi>Peter</hi> did designe the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be his Successor in his Apostolicall power: Or lastly that the Catholick Church did ever elect the Roman Bishops to be their ecclesiasticall Sovereigns, it were something. But they doe not so much as pretend to any such thing. The truth is this, that after the death of St. <hi>Peter</hi> that preheminence (I doe not say Sovereingty) which he had by the connivence or custome of the Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to his Successors in his Chaire, the Patriarchs of <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> (for I look upon Saint <hi>Marke</hi> as St. <hi>Peters</hi> Disciple) and <hi>Antioch,</hi> among whom the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had priority of Order, not of Power; to which very primacy of Order great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were due. Yet not so but that the Church did afterwards add two new Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriarchs to them, of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and equalled the Patriarch of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65027:111"/>
                  <hi>Constantinople</hi> in all priviledges to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Rome:</hi> which they would never have done, nor have proposed the honor which they gave to <hi>Rome</hi> with a <hi>placet? Doth it please you that we honor the memory of St.</hi> Peter? If they had beleeved that Saint <hi>Peters</hi> death at <hi>Rome</hi> had already setled a spirituall Monarchy of that See, which had been altogether as ridiculous, as if the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the House of Commons should have moved the House in favour of the King, <hi>Doth it please you that we honour the King with a judiciary power throughout his own Kingdome?</hi>

               <p>He saith Saint <hi>Peter</hi> came into <hi>Britain,</hi> converted many, made Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.

That St. <hi>Victor</hi> sent Legates into <hi>Scotland,</hi> (it seemeth they had no names) who baptized the King, Queen, and his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. That Saint <hi>Ninian</hi> was sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to convert the southern Picts. That Pope <hi>Caelestine</hi> consecrated <hi>Palladius</hi> and sent him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where as yet was no

Bishop. And Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Saint <hi>Germane</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> to confute the Pelagian Heresie. And in the year 596 St. <hi>Gregory</hi> sent over St. <hi>Austin</hi> and his Companions, to convert the Saxons, and gave him power over all the Bishops in <hi>Britain,</hi> and gave him power to erect two Archiepilcopall Sees, and twenty four Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall: And moreover that <hi>Dubritius,</hi> Primate of <hi>Britannie,</hi> was Legate to the See Apostolick. And lastly, That Saint <hi>Samson</hi> had a Pall from <hi>Rome.</hi> I confesse here are store of instances for Preaching, and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and ordeining, and Converting: but if every word he saith was true, it is not at all materiall to the question. Our question is concerning exterior Jurisdiction <hi>in foro Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae.</hi> But the Acts mentioned by him are all Acts of the Key of Order, not of the Key of Jurisdiction.

               <p>I shewed clearly that that Power which the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> doe challenge aud usurp at this day, is incompatible and inconsistent with true Patriarchall Power, &amp; that thereby they themselves have implicitly quitted and disclaimed that true Power which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them by the Catholick Church.

If they have lost their Patriarchall Power it is their own fault who quitted it; it is his fault who doth no better defend it. With as much reason he might plead, that he who saith that a Rector of a Church by accepting of a new incompatible Benefice, had quitted his old, doth deprive him of his former Benefice. Or that he who saith the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath quitted his Title to the united Provinces, doth thereby depose him from his Monarchy. O intollerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake!</p>

the British (I will adde also the Scotish Church) for many hundred years sided with the Eastern Church in the observation of Easter.

                  <note place="margin">A King hath all power needfull for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Kingdome</note>But let us follow his steps. First, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I alledge their own Authors to prove that to whom a Kingdome is granted all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power is granted, without which a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot be governed, he distinguisheth between <hi>the necessity of the Kingdome, and the benefit of the Kingdome, a King hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to doe whatsoever is necessary for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Kingdome, but not whatsoever is for the benefit of his Kingdome.</hi> To this I answer first, That he confounds <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>the exercise of Power,</hi> or the necessity of the one with the necessity of the other. Power is the necessary qualification of a King. But the act or exercise of that power may be free, and sufficiently grounded not only upon the necessity, but upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Kingdome. A Legislative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65027:119"/>
is necessary to a King, but this doth not imply that he cannot make a Law except only in cases of absolute necessity. Power to administer an Oath, or to commit a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor is a necessary qualification of a Judg, yet he may administer an Oath upon discretion, or commit a man npon suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. If a King or a Judg invested with such a power should misapply it, or erre in the exercise of it, he owes an account to God and the Prince from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the power, but the Subject is bound at least to passive obedience. Now let him see his own mistake. The question between us is whether a power to reform abuses and inconveniences be necessary to a King, to which all his Subjects owe at least passive obedience. He answers, concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of this power, in what cases a King may lawfully use it, but if the King mistake the case, yet the Subject owes passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">A respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> I answer that there is a double necessity, first, a simple or absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Secondly, a respective necessity <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid,</hi> which we may call a necessity of convenience, which is a true necessity, and a sufficient ground of a Christian Law, that is, rather to make such a Law, then to sustein such indignities, or to run such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hazards, or lose such great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, As <hi>it seemeth good to the holy Ghost and to us,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, I answer that our Reformation in <hi>England</hi> was not only beneficiall and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Kingdome,<note place="margin">Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</note> but necessary, to avoid intolerable extortions, and grosse unjust and generall usurpations of all mens rights.

They found that they were dayly exposed to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of Idolatry, and in danger dayly to have new Articles of Faith obtruded upon them, they see that the Pope had implicitly quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Patriarchall right, and challenged a Sovereignty over the Church by Divine right. Lastly, they see that this forrein Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction was become not only uselesse, but destructive to those ends for which Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall authority was first instituted.</p>
               <p>As the Hangings are fitted to the House,<note place="margin">The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church conformed to that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> so was the externall Regiment of the Church, fitted and adopted to the then State of the Empire, when these Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call dignities were first erected, for the ease and benefit of the Subject, to the end that no man should be necessitated to seek further for Ecclesiasticall Justice, then he did for Civil, nor to travell without the bounds of his own Province for a finall sentence. Therefore wheresoever there was a Civil Metropolis, there was placed an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Metropolitan also.

This is plain out of the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that whereas some ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons, contrary to the Laws Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, had multiplied Metropoliticall Sees, making two in one Province, where there was but one mother City or one Civil Metropolis, the Councell defined that no man should attempt any such thing for the future,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>for the most part. And afterwards that division was renued by the Apostles and Saint</hi> Clement <hi>our predecessor, so that in the chief Cities of all Provinces, where long since were primates of the Secular Law, and the highest judiciary Power, &amp;c. There the Divine and Ecclesiasticall Lawes commanded Patriarchs or Primates to be placed and to be, which two, though they be different in names, yet retein the same sense.</hi> This was well so long as the Empire conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the same State, and the Provinces kept their ancient bounds. But now when the State of the Empire is altogether chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the Provinces confounded and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions divided among lesser Kings, who are sometimes in hostility one with another, and the Subjects of one Prince, cannot free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor securely repair for Justice into the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65027:121"/>
Dominions of a forrein Prince, without prejudice to themselves, and danger to their native Country. It is very meet that the Subjects of every Soveraign Prince should have finall Justice within the Dominions of their own Soveraign, as well in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall causes as Politicall. And this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with the fundamentall Lawes and Customes of <hi>England,</hi> which neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Subject in such cases to goe out of the Kingdome, nor any forrein Commissioner to enter into the Kingdome, without the Kings license.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65027:123"/>
a generall Councell, in this case, that on the contrary we crave the benefit of their Decrees, and submit all our differences to their decision. No generall Councell did ever give to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> Jurisdiction over <hi>Britain.</hi> And though they had, yet the state of things being quite changed, it were no disobedience to vary from them in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, whilest we persist in their grounds.</p>
               <p>To make my word good I will suppose the case to have been quite otherwise then it was, That Protestants had made the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That they had had no ancient Laws for presidents, That the Britannick Churches had not enjoyed the Cyprian priviledge for the first six hundred years: Yea I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for the present, That our Primates were no Primates or Patriarchs, And that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannick Churches had been subjected to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by generall Councells: Yet all this supposed upon the great mutation of the state of the Empire, and the great varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs since that time, it had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawfull for the King and Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to substract their obedience from the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> (though they had not quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Patriarchate) and to have erected a new Primate at home among themselves. Provided that what I write only upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, he doe not hereafter allege as spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by way of concession.</p>
               <p>We have seen formerly in this chapter that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65027:123"/>
the establishment of Primates or Patriarchs and Metropolitans in such and such Sees, was meerly to comply and conforme themselves to the Edicts and civill constitutions of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes, for the ease and advantage of Christians, and to avoid confusion and clashing of Jurisdiction That where there was a civill Exarch and Protarch established by the Emperour, there should be an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Primate or Patriarch: And where a Citie was honoured with the name and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of a Metropolis or mother Citie, there should be a Metropolitan Bishop. The practise of Bishops could not multiply these dignities, but the Edicts of Emperors could. And this was in a time when the Emperors were Pagans and Infidells.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when the Emperours were become Christians, if they newly founded or newly dignified an Imperiall Citie or a Metropolis, they gave the Bishop thereof a proportionable ecclesiasticall preheminence at their good pleasure. Either with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as the Councels of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> with the consent and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Martian</hi> Emperours) did advance the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> from being a mean Suffragan under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> to be equall in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, power and all sorts of priviledges to the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this very ground is assigned by the Fathers, <hi>because that Citie</hi> (Constantinople) <hi>was become the seat of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65027:124"/>
Empire.</hi> So great a desire had the Fathers to conform the Ecclesiasticall Regiment to the Politicall. Or without a Councell, as <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour by his sole Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power erected the Patriarchate of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niana prima,</hi> and endowed it with a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince substracted from other Bishops, freeing it from all Appeals. The like prerogatives he gave to the Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the pretensions of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Novell.</hi> 11 &amp; 131.</note> And this was not done in a corner, but inserted into the publick Laws of the Empire, for all the world to take notice of it. So unquestionable was the power of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes in things concerning the Order and externall Regiment of the Church in those dayes, that neither the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any other Patriarch or Bishop did ever complain against it. Shall the presence of an Exarch or Lieutenant be able to dignifie the Citie or place of his residence with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall Rites, and shall not the presence and authority of the Sovereign himself be much more able to doe it? Is so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect due to the Servants, and is not more due to the Master?</p>
               <p>That the British and the English Kings had the same Imperiall Authority to alter Patriarchates within their own Dominions, to exempt their Subjects from the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one Primate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 127.</note> and transferre them to another, I shewed in the vindication by the examples of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who translated the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65027:124"/>
Primacy from <hi>Caer-Leon</hi> to St. <hi>Davids</hi> above eleven hundred years since, And <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the first who subjected St. <hi>Davids</hi> to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> above five hundred years since, for the benefit of his Subjects. Neither did any man then complain that they usurped more Power then of right did belong unto them.</p>
               <p>This is not to alter the Institutions of the universall Church or of generall Councells (supposing they had made any such particular establishment) but on the contrarie to tread in their stepps,<note place="margin">But in pur suance of them.</note> and to pursue their grounds, and to doe that (with all due submission to their authority) which they would have done themselves in this present exigence of Affairs. Make all things the same they were, and we are the same. To persist in an old observation when the grounds of it are quite cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ged, and the end for which the observation was made, calleth upon us for an alteration, is not obedience but obstinacie. Generall Councells did never so fixe Patriarchall Power to particular Churches, as that their establishment should be like a Law of the Medes and Persians, never to be altered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any change of the Christian world what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. But to be changed by themselves (as we see they did establish first three Protopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchates, then four, then five.) Or when generall Councells cannot be had (which is the miserable condition of these times) by such as have the Supreme Authority Civill and Ecclesiasticall in those places where the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65027:125"/>
change is to be made. Suppose a Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall See should be utterly ruined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by warre or other accidents, as some have been; or should change the Bible into the Alchoran, and turn Turks as others have done; suppose a succession of Patriarchs should quit or resigne their Patriarchall power explicitly or implicitly, or forfeit it by disufe or abuse, Or should obtrude here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall errors and Idolatrous practises upon the Churches under their Jurisdiction, so as to leave no hope of remedy from their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> should goe about to enforce them by new Laws and Oaths to maintain their usurpations over generall Councells, to which all Christians are more obliged then to any Patriarch: Lastly, suppose a Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Citie shall lie in the Dominions of one Prince, and the Province in the Dominions of another, who are in continuall warre and hostility the one with the other, so as the Subjects can neither have licence nor security to make use of their Patriarch, ought notthe respective Provinces in all these cases to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themselves? Put the case that a King going to warre in the holy Land should commit the Regencie to his Councell, and they constitute a Governor of a principall Citie, who failes in his trust, and makes the Citizens swear allegiance to himself, and to maintain him against the Councell; all men will judge that the Citizens should doe well, if he were incorrigible, to turne him out of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65027:125"/>
their Gates. Christ was this King, who ascending into the holy of holies, left the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of his Church with the Apostolicall College and their Successors, a generall Councell. They made the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> a principall Governor, and he rebells against them. There needs no further application.</p>
               <p>Now to close up this point, the end is more excellent then the means. The end of the primitive Fathers in establishing the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Regiment of the Church in a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the civill Government was <hi>salus Populi Christiani,</hi> the ease and advantage of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, the avoyding of confusion, and the clashing of Jurisdictions. We pursue the same ends with them, we approve of their means in particular, as most excellent for those times, and in generall for all times, that is, the conforming of the one Regiment to the other. But God alone is <hi>without any shadow of turning by change.</hi> It is not in our power to prevent the conversion of sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie things. Empires and Cities have their diseases and their deaths as well as men. One is, another was, a third shall be. Mother Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties become Villages, and poor Villages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Mother Cities. The places of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of the greatest Kings and Emperors are turned to desarts for Owles to screech in and Satyrs to dance in. Then as a good Pilate must move his rudder according to the variable face of the heavens. So if we will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the prudent grounds of the primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65027:126"/>
we must change our externall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the change of the Empire. This is better then by adhering too strictly to the private interest of particular places, to destroy that publick end for which externall Regiment at first was so established. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that this is most proper for a generall Councell to redress. Every thing is best loosed by the same authority by which it was bound. But in case of necessity, where there can be no recourse to a generall Councell, every Sovereign Prince within his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, with the advise and concurrence of his Clergy, and due submission to a future oecumenicall Councell, is obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide remedies for growing inconveniences, and to take order that externall Discipline be so administred, as may most conduce to the glorie of God, and the benefit of his Christian Subjects.</p>
               <p>I made three conditions of a lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, just grounds, due moderation, and sufficient authority.<note place="margin">King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but no ground of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> He faith, <hi>Henry the eight had none of these:</hi> First, <hi>no just ground, because his ground was, that the Pope would not give him leave to forsake his lawfull wife and take another.</hi> Perhaps the Popes in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice might, by Gods just disposition, be an occasion, but it was no ground of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: And if it had, yet neither this nor his other exceptions doe concern the cause at all.

Either <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> did write according to his conscience, and then he was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; or else he dissembled, and then his second testimonie is of no value.

               </p>
               <p>To the third condition he faith only, that <hi>Henry</hi> the eight had not sufficient authority to reforme, first, <hi>because it was the power of a small part of the Church against the whole.</hi> I have shewed the contrarie, that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was not made in opposition, but in pursuance of the acts of generall Councells, neither did our Reformers meddle without

their own spheres.

It were an hard condition to put me to prove against my conscience, that the universall Regency of the Pope is of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane right, who doe absolutely deny both his divine right and his humane right.</p>
               <p>His next exception is, that <hi>it is no sufficient warrant for Princes to meddle in spirituall matters, because some Princes have done so.</hi> If he think the externall Regiment of the Church to be a matter meerly spirituall, he is much mistaken. I cite not the exorbitant acts of some single Prince or Princes, but a whole succession of Kings, with their convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and Parliaments, proceeding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fundamentall Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

Neither will this uncharitable censure, if it were true, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage his cause the black of a bean.

Certainly the breach must goe before the reconcilement, in order of time. Secondly, in the Subject; this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not about the Jurisdiction of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> over the English Church, but about the divorce of King <hi>Henry</hi> and Queen <hi>Katherine.</hi> The words are these, That <hi>if the Pope would supersede from executing his sentence, untill he</hi> (the King) had indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65027:130"/>
Judges who <hi>might hear the business, he would also supersede of what he was delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to doe in withdrawing his obedience from the Roman See.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this proposition from the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it at <hi>Rome.</hi> It was not accepted. The Kings answer came not within the time limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thereupon the Pope published his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the Separation followed. So this was about the change of a Wife, not of Religion, before either King <hi>Henrys</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction of obedience, or the Popes fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>In the next place he distinguisheth between the Pope and the Papacy, acknowledging That <hi>it may be lawfull in some cases to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract obedience from the Pope, but in no case from the Papacy,</hi> which he presumeth but doth not prove to be of divine institution, <hi>whereas Protestants</hi> (saith he) <hi>for the faults of some Popes, have separated themselves both from Pope, Papacy, and Roman Church.</hi> And here again he falls upon his former needless Theme, That <hi>personall faults are no sufficient ground of a revolt from a good institution.</hi> If he had been pleased to observe it, I took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this distinction before it was made,<note place="margin">

First, that sovereign Princes not only may, but in justice are obliged to repress the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany of ecclesiasticall Judges, and protect their Subjects from their violence, and free them from their oppressed Yoke. To this he answereth nothing. Secondly, that Princes may be inabled either by grant or by prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (I added by their sovereign authority over the whole Body politick) to exercise all externall ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction by themselves or by fit Delegates, and to

make ecclesiasticall Lawes for the externall Regiment of the Church, to which their Subjects owe obedience. This alone were sufficient to free us from Schism. But to all this likewise he saith not one word good or bad. Thirdly, that it is lawfull in severall cases to substract obedience from the Pope.

Kings may inherit by the Law of man, or be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the Suffrages of men. But the Regall Office, and Regall Power is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God. No man can give that which he himself hath not. The People have not power of Life and Death. That must come from God. By the Law of nature Fathers of Families were Princes, and when Fathers of Families did conjoyn their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make one Father of a Country, to whom doth he owe his power but to God, from whom Fathers of Families had their

And so I proceeded to the grounds of their separation: first, the intolerable rapine and extortions of the Roman Court in <hi>England:</hi> Secondly, their unjust usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the undoubted rights of all orders of men, and particularly how they made our Kings to be their vassals and the Succession to the Crown arbitrary at their pleasures. Thirdly, because our Ancestors found by experience that such forrein jurisdiction was destructive to the right ends of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discipline. Fourthly, sundry other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, to have been dayly subject to the imposition of new Articles of Faith, to be exposed to manifest perill of Idolatry, to have forsaken the Communion of three parts of Christendome, to have approved

the Popes rebellion against generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and to have their Bishops swear to maintain him in his rebellious usurpations. Lastly, the priviledge of the Britannick Churches, the Popes disclaiming all his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall authority, and their challenging of all this by Div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne right, which made their sufferings irremediable from <hi>Rome.</hi> Lastly, I shewed that our Ancestors from time to time, had made more addresses to <hi>Rome</hi> for remedy then either in duty or in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they ought to have done. All this he passeth by in silence, as if it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the cause at all. Only he repeats his former distinction <hi>between the Pope, the Papacy, and the Roman Church,</hi> which hath been so often confuted already, and blameth Protestants <hi>for revolting from the Roman Church for the faults of some few Popes.</hi> As if all these things which are mentioned here, and set down at large in the vindication, were but some infirmitives, or some petty faults of some few Popes. I have shewed him clearly, that the most of our grounds are not the faults of the Popes, but the faults of the Papacy it self. And as for <hi>forsaking the Church of</hi> Rome, he doth us wrong. I shewed him out of our Canons in this very place,<note place="margin">

Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that in his choise he hath swerved from the rules of prudence,<note place="margin">The Popes new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith a just cause of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and hath not sought to leap over the Hedge where it was lowest. First (saith he) <hi>The new Creed could not be the cause of the separation, because the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was made before the Creed.</hi> He saith true, if it had been only the reduction of these new mysteries into the form of a Creed, that did offend us. But he knoweth right well that these very points which <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> comprehended in a new Symball or Creed, were obtruded upon us before by his predecess
ors as necessary Articles of the Roman Faith, and required as necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Communion. So as we must either receive these, or utterly lose them. This is the only difference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> dealt in grosse, his predecessors by retaile. They fashioned the severall rods, and he bound them up into a bundle. He saith, That <hi>the new Creed is nothing but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain points of Catholick Faith proposed to be sworn of some Ecclesiasticall Catholick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65027:136"/>
as the 39 Articles were in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants new Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proposed by them to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. Pius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> did not only injoyn all Ecclesiasticks, Seculars, and Regulars, to swear to his new Creed, but he imposed it upon all Christians, as <hi>veram fidem Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam extra quam nemo salvus esse potest,</hi> (they are the very words of the Bull,) as <hi>the true Catholick Faith without believing of which no man can be saved.</hi> This is a greater Obligation then an Oath, and as much as the Apostles did impose for the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apostolicall Creed. We doe not hold our 39 Articles to be such necessary truths, <hi>extra quam non est salus, without which there is no Salvation,</hi> nor injoin Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick persons to swear unto them, but only to subscribe them, as theologicall truths, for the preservation of unity among us, and the extirpation of some growing er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>

                     </gap>ining of the Cup in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament a just cause of separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>Secondly, He adds that the deteyning of the Cup, could be no sufficient grounds of separation, because Protestants doe confesse, That <hi>it is an indifferent matter of it self, and no just cause to seperate Communion.</hi> Doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> confesse it to be an indifferent matter? No, nor any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church. All their publick confessions doe testifie the contrary. Nay more, I doe not believe that any one Protestant in his right wits did ever confesse any such thing. But this it is to nible at Authors, and to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65027:136"/>
stretch and tenter their words by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences quite beyond their sense. It may be that <hi>Luther</hi> at some time said some such thing, but it was before he was a formed Protestant, whilest he was half sleeping half waking. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> stiles it <hi>in initio Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae.</hi> But after his eies were well opened, he never confessed any such thing, but the just contrary. Suppose that <hi>Brentius</hi> saith, that abstemious persons, such whose nature doth abhorre wine, may receive under one kinde; what a pittifull argument is this drawn from a particular rare case of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible necessity, to the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary use of the Sacrament? The Elephant was exempted from doing obeisance to the Lion, because he had no knees. But it is the height of injustice to withhold his right from one man, because another cannot make use of it. Suppose that <hi>Melancthon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his own particular opinion, that those Countries where Wine is not to be had should doe well to make use of honied water in the Sacrament. What doth this signifie as to the cause he hath in hand, whether they use some other liquor in the place of Wine, or use no liquor at all? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible necessity doth not only excuse from one kinde but from both kindes. And where the Sacrament cannot be had as it ought, the desire to have it sufficeth before God. We read of some Christians in <hi>India</hi> where they had no Wine, that they took
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65027:137"/>
drie Raisons and steeped them in water a whole night,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Odoardus Barlosa forma Celebrandi &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and used that liquor which they squeesed out of them in the place of Wine for the Sacrament. It would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one as much in many parts of the World to finde right Bread, as Wine. That nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Indians eat in the place of Bread, being made of the roots of Plants, doth differ more from our Bread made of Wheat, then Cyder or Perry or honnied water doe differ from the juice of the Grape, which are such many times, as are able to deceive a good tast. If Wine were as rare and precious in the World as right Balm, which they make to be the matter of a Sacrament, there were more to be said in it. They themselves doe teach that it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, that the Sacrament be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated in Wine, and that it be consumed by the Priest. They who can procure Wine for the Priest, may procure it for the People also, if they will. The truth is, all these are but made Dragons. No man ever was so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemious but that he might taste so much Wine tempered with water, as they use it, as might serve for the Sacrament, where the least imaginable particle conveieth Christ to the receiver, as well as the whole Chalice full. Neither is there any Christian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the World,<note place="margin">Papists right, Heirs of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</note> where they may not have Wine enough for this use, if they please.</p>
               <p>So notwithstanding any thing he saith, to the contrary their dayly obtruding new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65027:137"/>
of Faith, and their deteining the Cup in the Sacrament were just grounds of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but not our only grounds. We had twenty other grounds besides them. And therefore he had little reason to say, That <hi>at least the first Protestants were Schismaticks,</hi> and in this respect to urge the authority of <hi>Optatus</hi> against us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Optat. l.</hi> 2.</note> to prove us to be the Heirs of Schismaticks. <hi>Optatus</hi> in the place by him cited, speaks against the <hi>traditors,</hi> with whom we have nothing common, and the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists their own Ancestors, not ours, whose case is thus described there by <hi>Optatus, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus in Cathedra tenet, quae ante ipsum</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorinum <hi>originem non habebat, whose Chair thou possessest, which had no originall before</hi> Majorinus, a schismaticall Donatist. This is not our case. We have set up no new Chairs nor new Altars, nor new Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but continued those which were from the beginning. There is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the erecting of a Chair against a Chair, or an Altar against an Altar, which we have not done, and the repairing of a Church or an Altar wherein it was decayed, which we were obliged to doe.</p>
               <p>In the next place he endeavoreth to prove by <hi>the generall Doctrine of Protestants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whether Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants and Papists differ in Essentials.</note> 
                  <hi>that they differ from Papists in fundamentall points necessarie to salvation.</hi> If they doe, it is the worse for the Romanists. In the mean time the charitie of Protestants is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. We hope better of them. And for
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65027:138"/>
any thing he saith to the contrarie we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that they doe not differ from us in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls. But let us see what it is that the Protestants say. Some say that <hi>Popish errors are damnable.</hi> Let it be admitted many errors are damnable which are not in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls. Errors which are damnable in themselves, are often pardoned by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, who looks upon his Creatures with all their prejudices. Others say, that <hi>Popish and Protestant opinions are diametrally opposite.</hi> That is certain, they are not all lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomachies. But can there be no diametrall opposition except it be in fundamentalls? There are an hundred diametrall oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in opinion among the Romanists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet he will not confess that they differ in fundamentalls. Lastly, others say that <hi>the Religion of Protestants, and the Religion of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are not all one for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> I answer first, that the word <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> is taken sometimes strictly, for the essentialls of any thing, which cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated without the destruction of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Thus a man is said to be the same man in substance, while his soul and body are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though he have lost a legg or an arme, or be reduced to skin and bone. And in this sense the Protestant and Popish Church and Religion are the same in substance. At other times the word substance is taken more larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for all reall parts, although they be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated without the destruction, and sometimes
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65027:138"/>
with the advantage of the subject. And so all the members, yea even the flesh and blood and other humors are of the substance of a man.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.16.</note> So we read, <hi>Thine eyes did see my substance being yet unperfect, and in thy books were all my members written.</hi> And in this sense the Protestant and Popish Religion are not the same in substance. Secondly, the word substantialls may either signifie old substantialls, beleeved and practised by all Churches in all ages, at all times, which are contained in the Apostles Creed. And thus our Religion and the Roman Religion are the same in substance. Or new substantialls lately coyned and obtruded upon the Chrurch; as those Articles which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth: And in this sense our Religion and theirs are not the same in substance. The former sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialls were made by God, the later sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialls devised by man.</p>
               <p>I pleaded that when all things were sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the bottome,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> Roman Catholicks doe acknowledge the same possibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Protestants,<note place="margin">Papists ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge possibility of our salvation as much as we of theirs.</note> which Protestants doe afford to Roman Catholicks: And for proof thereof I produced two testimonies of his own. To this he answers first, that <hi>Protestants doe allow saving faith and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Roman Church and to formall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. But Roman Catholicks doe denie saving faith and salvation to the Protestant Church and to formall Prrtestants, and grant it only to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65027:139"/>
such Protestants as are invincibly ignorant of their errours, who are not formall Protestants, but rather</hi> Protestantibus credentes, <hi>persons deceived by giving too much trust to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi> We say the very same, that we allow not saving faith or salvation to the Popish Church, as it is corrupted, but as it reteins with Protestants, the same common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of saving truth, and is still jointed in part to the Catholick Church. Nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Papists, but to such as erre invincibly, and are prepared in their mindes to receive the truth when God shall reveal it. Such are not formall Papists, but <hi>Papist is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes,</hi> such as give too much trust to Papists.</p>
               <p>His second answer is a second errour, grounded only upon those imaginarie ideas which he hath framed to himself in his own head, of the opinions of particular Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and laboured much to little purpose, to prove by conjecturall consequences, which hang together like a roap of sand, That <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants affirm that such as erre in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Articles, and such as erre sinfully in not fundamentalls may be saved.</hi> Neither the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against which he ought to bend his forces in this question, nor any genuine sonne of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any other Protestant Church ever said, that Papists might be saved, though they held not the fundamentalls of saving truth, or though they held lesser errors pertinaciously
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65027:139"/>
without repentance. If any particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants were ever so mad to maintain any such thing in an ordinarie way, for we speak not now of the extraordinarie dispensations of Gods grace, in case of invincible necessity, we disclaime them in it. Let him not spare them. But I beleeve that when all is done, about which he makes such a stirre, it will prove but Moonshine in the water.</p>
               <p>To what I said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note> that our separation is from their errours, not from their Church, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth,<note place="margin">Our sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from errors.</note> that <hi>it shews my ignorance what their Church is, For their Church is a society partly in their pretended errors; and therefore they who separate from them, separate from their Church.</hi> In my life I never heard a weaker plea: But I desire no other advantage then what the cause it self affords. Doth he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self beleeve in earnest, that any errors are essentialls of a Church? Or would he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us that weeds are essentials of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; or ulcers and wenns and such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous excrescences essentials of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body? Or doe weeds become no weeds, aud errors no errors, because they are called pretended weeds or pretended errors, or because they are affirmed to be essentials? This is enough to justifie my distinction. So it was not my ignorance but their obstinacy thus to incorporate their errors into their Creeds, and matriculate their abuses among their sacred Rites. <hi>In vain doe they worship

And suppose the Arrian or Pelagian should plead as he doth, that their <hi>Church is a society partly in their pretended errors,</hi> or that their pretended er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are essentials of their Church and of their Religion. This might well aggravate their own faults, but not infringe the truth of his answer. Errors continue errors though they they be called essentials. There was a time before Arrianism did infest the Church, and there succeeded a time when it was cast out of the Church. Their old essentials which were made essentials by Christ, we doe readily receive: Their new essentials, which were lately devised by themselves, we doe as utterly reject; and so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because they have made them essentials.

But we finde no negatives in the rule of Faith: For the rule of Faith consists of such supernaturall truths, as are necessary to be known of every Christian, not only <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate praecepti,</hi> because God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to beleeve them, but also <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> because without the knowledge of them in some tollerable degree, according to the measure of our capacities, we cannot in an ordinary way attain to salvation. How can a negative be a means. <hi>Non entis nulla est efficacia.</hi> In the Apostles Creed, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end, we finde not the least ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Particle: And if one or two nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were added in the subsequent ages, as that, <hi>begotten not made,</hi> in the Nicene Creed; they were added not as new Articles, but as explanations of the old, to meet with some emergent errors, or difficulties, just as our negatives were.</p>
               <p>Yea though perhaps some of our negatives were revealed truths, and consequently were as necessary to be beleeved when they are known as affirmatives; yet they doe not therefore become such necessary truths or
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65027:143"/>
Articles of Religion, as make up the rule of Faith. I suppose yet further, that though some of our negatives can be deduced from the positive fundamentall Articles of the Creed, some evidently some probably, as the necessity of the consequence is more or less manifest: For it is with consequences as it was with <hi>Philo</hi>'s row of iron Rings; the first that touched the Load-stone did hang more firmely; the rest which were more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote still more loosly. I say in such a case that no man was bound to receive them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Articles, or as Consequences, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that hath the light to see them, nor he further then the evidence doth invite him. And howsover they are no new Articles, but Corollaries or deductions from the old. So grossly is he mistaken on all sides, when he saith that <hi>Protestants</hi> (he should say the English Church if he would speak to the purpose,) <hi>have a positive beleefe, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not the body of Christ.</hi> Which were to contradict the words of Christ, <hi>this is my body.</hi> He knowes better, that Protestants doe not deny the thing, but their bold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the manner by transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; themselve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay they have not only denied to the Pope that which he cals Papall Authority, to Convocate Synods, to confirm Synods, to make Ecclesiasticall Laws, to dispose of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall preferments, to receive the last Appeals in Ecclesiasticall causes, but they have exercised it themselves: They have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of the Papacy, they have deposed the Popes, they have shut out his Legates, they have Appealed from his sentences, they have not suffered their Subjects to goe upon his Summons, they have caused his Decrees to be torn in pieces most disgracefully, and made Edicts and Statutes, and pragmaticall san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against his usurpations, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated the Clergy, and reformed the Churches within their Dominions. And when they thought fit during their pleasures they have stopped all entercouse with <hi>Rome.</hi>

him in minde of some things which I have formerly demonstrated to him touching this particular, which he hath been pleased to pass by in silence. First,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:65027:149"/>These things being premised to dull the edge of his argument, now I proceed to a direct answer: and first I charge him with chopping and changing the words of the Oath. The words of the Oath are these, That <hi>the Kings Highness is the only supreme Governor in this Realm:</hi> But in paraphrasing upon them, and pressing them, he renders them thus, <hi>not only Governor, but only and supreme Governor.</hi> There is a vast difference between these two, to say the King is the only supreme Governor of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> which signifies no more but this, that there is no other supreme Governor of the Realm but he, which is most true: and to say that he is the only and supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which implies that there is no other Governor but he, which is most false: There are both spirituall and civill Governors in <hi>England</hi> besides him. To say the Pope is the only supreme Bishop in his own Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate, is most true, but to say that he is the only and supreme Bishop in his Patriarchate, is most false: this were to degrade all his Suffragans, and allow no Bishop in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince but himself.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answer that there is no Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy ascribed to the King in this Oath, but meerly politicall, which is essentially annexed to the Imperiall Crown of every sovereign Prince. The Oath saith, that the Kings Highness is the only supreme Governor of his Highness Realms and Dominions. What
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65027:149"/>
doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himself say less to his own Successors as well as others?<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as supreme.</hi> How often doth Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> acknowledge the Emperor to be his supreme Governor, or sovereign Lord? and profess obedience and Subjection unto him, and execute his commands in ecclesiasticall things? That Common-wealth is miserable and subject to the clashing of Jurisdictions, where there are two Supremes, like a Serpent with two heads at either end one.</p>
               <p>The Oath addeth <hi>in all spirituall or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall things or causes.</hi> This is true with some limitations; as first either by himself or by fit Substitutes, who are ecclesiasticall Persons. For our Kings cannot excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate or absolve in their own persons. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is to be understood of those causes which are handled <hi>in foro contentioso,</hi> in the exterior Court, not in the inner Court of Conscience. Thirdly, either in the first or in the second instance, by receiving the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales and redressing the wrongs of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Subjects. Some things are so purely spirituall that Kings have nothing to doe in them in their own persons, as the preaching of the Word, the administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the binding and loosing of Sinners. Yet the persons to whom the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of these Duties doth belong, and the persons towards whom these Duties ought
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65027:150"/>
to be discharged being their Subjects, they have a Power paramount to see that each of them doe their duties in their severall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The causes indeed are ecclesiasticall, but the power of governing is politicall. This is the true sense of the Oath, neither more nor less, as appeareth plainly by our thirty seventh Article.<note place="margin">

               <p>Now I have said my minde concerning the Oath of Allegiance, who they were that first contrived it, and in what sense we doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, I hope agreably to the sense of the Christian World, except such as are prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with prejudice for the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> As our Kings out of Reverence to Christ did freely lay by the title of Supreme heads
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65027:151"/>
of the English Church, so though it bee not meet for me to prevent their maturer deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, I should not be displeased if out of a tender consideration of the consciences of Subjects, who may erre out of invincible ignorance, they would be pleased to lay by the oath also. God looks upon his Creatures with all their prejudices, why should not man doe the same? It seemeth to be hard measure to destroy men for meer speculative opinions, which it may be are not in their own power, so long as there is neither bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy nor sedition in the case. It is often easier to secure a mans actions, then to cure the errors of his judgment.</p>
               <p>In the next place he chargeth me with contradicting of my self,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> because I say, <hi>the Emperors and other Princes of the Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion have done the same things in effect,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in my words.</note> 
                  <hi>with the King of</hi> England; and in another place I confess, that <hi>the Kings of</hi> England <hi>have abolished the Iurisdiction of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>but the Emperors have not.</hi> This, he faith, <hi>is to give myself the lie.</hi> Certainly he was in some heat or passion when this word of disgrace dropped from his penne, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly disputers are, when they finde that they have gotten the wrong end of the staff. If he had advisedly read over my assertion it is this, that either they have done the same thing in effect, or at least have pleaded for it. If either part of the disjunction be true, my assertion is a truth, and no contradiction,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65027:152"/>
much less a lie, which implyeth that it is both against truth and against conscience. Now I have shewed clearly in the vindication, that they have not only pleaded it, but sworn it, that they would maintain the Rites, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Customes of the Empire inviolated, against the Pope and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that they have protested that they would not have his Holiness to be ignorant that they neither could nor would indure his intollerable pressures any longer, but would vindicate themselves.</p>
               <p>Further, to doe the same thing in effect, doth not signifie to doe the same individuall action, nor alwaies the same specificall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only that which argueth the same power, or implyeth the same consequences. If an ordinary doe suspend a Clerke from his Benefice, or degrade him from his holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so long as the question is only whether he be under Jurisdiction of the ordinary, it is all one in effect, whilest the one proveth the intention as well as the other. If a theefe st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ale a shilling or a pound, it is not the same thing in effect, because the Theef pretendeth no right to what he taketh; But if a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate impose a tribute of a shilling or a pound, where the question is only whether he have power to impose tribute or not, it is all one in effect; for his title is as just to the one as to the other, and as he imposeth a shilling to day, so he may, if he have occasion, impose a pound to morrow. The whole
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65027:152"/>
and all the parts are the same in effect: The Emperors have done all the particular Acts which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Patronage, Investitures, Legislation, Reformation, Legates, Appeals, Tenths, first Fruits, &amp;c. And moreover have depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Popes, which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted to doe, though they have not made one generall Act of abolition. Why is not this the same in effect? He that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a debt in Pistols and he who satisfieth it in cracked Groats, doe both the same thing in effect. To conclude, they who assume the right to be the last Judges of their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Priviledges, in all differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> doe the same thing in effect, whether the respective Priviledges of the one or the other be more or less; But the Emperors and the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did assume to themselves the right to be the last Judges of their own Liberties and Priviledges, in all differences between them and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the one might take or mistake himself to be within the old Roman Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate, which the other was not, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever other differences there might be in the extent of their Liberties, or in their claims, yet they did the same thing in effect. The only difference between the Emperors and <hi>Henry</hi> the eight is this, that they denyed the Papacy in parcells, and he denyed it in gross; They denyed his Sovereign Legislative power
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65027:153"/>
they denyed his Patronage of Churches, they denyed his Investitures of Bishops, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed his Superiority above generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, they denyed his Tenths, and first Fruits, and Pardons, and Indulgences, and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations. So they pulled away his stolen feathers one by one, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth uncased him all at once, but except some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall Rites, (which <hi>Britain</hi> never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, which are no parts of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,) they left him as naked the one as the other. This I might well call the same thing in effect.</p>

                     <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi>
                  </note> but which <hi>Valentinian,</hi> which <hi>Theodosius,</hi> where this Epistle is to be found, he is silent, and leaveth us, if it were worth the labour, to seek for a needle in a bottle of hay. But the truth is, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it which concerneth this question, nothing which we deny. The words, as they be alleged by him, are these: <hi>All anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hath given the Principality of Priesthood over all to the Bishop of the City of</hi> Rome. Our question is concerning the Politicall Principality of Kings and Emperours, and his answer is concerning the Principality of Priesthood. Let them retain their Principality of Priesthood, so they leave to Sovereign Princes their just Principality of Power. We are ready to give them a principality of Priesthood if that would content them. And neither all antiquity nor any antiquity did ever give them a principality of Power: Or at least such a Supremacy of single, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, monarchichall Power, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, about which our controversie now is. A Lord chief Justice hath a principality of Order among his brother Judges of the same Coyfe and Bench, and in some circumstantiall respects a kinde of eminency or principality of Power, but no single supremacy, so as to be able to crosse their votes with a <hi>non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante.</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:65027:155"/>
Such a supremacy of sovereing, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, universall power of Priesthood the Church of God did never know, either at <hi>Rome</hi> or elsewhere. The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were so farre from having power over gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells, that they had no single pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over their fellow Patriarchs. So farre from having power over Emperours, that they have been delegated by Emperours as their Commissioners in Ecclesiasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, have been convened before Emperors, and deposed by Emperors. Primitive Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops use to stile Popes their brethren, their collegues, their fellows, but never Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Princes. If he mean the second <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> his authority weighs nothing; he was a young Novice mis-led by his Arrian Mother, a wilfull ill-advised woman. If he mean another <hi>Valentinian,</hi> I shall shew him that he exercised this politicall Supremacy in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall affaies, it may be to the question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Prince of Priests.</p>

We command</hi> Candidianus <hi>to goe to this holy Synod, but upon this condition, that he should have nothing to doe with questions and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies which concern Doctrines of faith, for it is unlawfull for one not registred in the catalogue of Bishops, to thrust himself into ecclesiasticall affairs and consultations.</hi> This is as much as to say that <hi>Candidianus</hi> was not sent by the Emperour to dispute in the Councell about Theologicall questions, which it is probable he did not understanding, nor to overawe the Bishops or controlle their votes. We are of the same minde with <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and say as much as he, that it is not fit for every man promiscuously to dispute of Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call questions: And though we give the severeign Regiment of the Church in some sense to Princes within their own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

yet we would not have them to govern it upon their own heads, but upon mature advise of free Synods of Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are their proper Counsellors in Church affairs.

So we would not have Princes meddle with the Keyes of the Church, either the Key of Knowledge or the Key of Order. We confesse that some causes in the first instance belong properly to Bishops, yet the last Appeal may be to the King. We say there are many things which Kings cannot doe in their own persons, and yet may be done by fit Delegates by their Royall authority.</p>

It was concerning the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, in so sublime a question, concerning the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, in this exigence of affairs, being in his voyage, in the presence of his Brother and fellow Emperor, who was an Arrian, and a great persecutor of all those who held the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, whose Subjects these Bishops were, as they found to their cost presently after his return from accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Brother some part of his way; what more prudent or more plausible answer could so moderate a Prince have given, then that he did give?

               <head>CHAP. 8. That the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> are most guilty of the Schism.</head>
               <p>WE are come now to my sixth and last ground that the guilt of the Schism rests upon the Pope and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The first thing which I meet with is his marginall note out of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>L</hi> 2. <hi>Cont. Petili. c.</hi> 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Cathedra quid tibi fecit Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae</hi> Romanae? <hi>What hurt hath the See of</hi> Rome <hi>done thee?</hi> But first, <hi>Petilians</hi> case to whom those words were spoken, is not our case. He called all the Catholick Sees thoughout the World, <hi>Chairs of Pestilence,</hi> so doe not we. Neither doth Saint <hi>Austin</hi> attribute any thing singular to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in this place, more then to the See of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or any other Catholick See. <hi>Si omnes per totum orbem tales essent quales vanissime criminaris, Cathedra tibi quid fecit Ecclesiae</hi> Romanae, <hi>in qua</hi> Petrus <hi>sedit, &amp; in qua hodie</hi> Anastatius <hi>sedet, vel Ecclesiae</hi> Hierosolymitanae <hi>in qua</hi> Jacobus <hi>sedit, &amp; in qua hodie</hi> Joannes <hi>sedet? Quibus nos in Catholica unitate connectimur, &amp; a quibus vos nefario furore separastis.</hi> It is not we that have furiously separated our selves from
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65027:161"/>
either of these Sees. But it is the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> which hath made the separation both from <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and from us.</p>
               <p>In the next place he inquireth <hi>what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by this present Schism, whether the Schism of Protestants in generall, or of English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in particular? and whether by causu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I understand a sufficient cause that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from sinne</hi>? Doubtless I must understand a sufficient cause that freeth the innocent party from sinne, or understand nothing: For an unsufficient cause is no cause: But his induction is imperfect. I doe neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Schism of the Protestant Church in generall, nor the Schism of the English Church in particular, but directly the Schism of the Roman Church, which did first give just cause of separation, not only to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches, but to all the Eastern Churches; and then did make the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their unjust and uncharitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snres. But he saith <hi>there can be no just cause of Schisms.</hi> The greater is their fault who are the true Schismaticks; first, by giving just cause of separation from their errors, and then making the separation by their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. It is true, there can be no just cause of criminous Schism, because there can be no just cause of sinne: <hi>It is not lawfull to doe evill that good may come of it.</hi> But there may be both just cause of separation, and just se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration without any crime or sinne, yea vertuous and necessary, as is confessed by
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65027:161"/>
themselves.<note place="margin">

               <p>Before he come to answer my arguments he proposeth an objection of his own, that neither the Church, nor Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did give any sufficient cause of separation either to <hi>Luther</hi> or to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution whereof he supposeth that <hi>Luther</hi> had no cause of separation but <hi>the abuse of some Preachers of indulgences,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                  <hi>whom the Pope of that time rebuked severely.</hi> Nor <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth but <hi>the excommunication of</hi> Clement <hi>the seventh.</hi> That of <hi>Luther</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without the compass of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion between him and me, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth only the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I shall only make bold to tell him that whensoever it comes to be examined, it will be found that <hi>Luther</hi> had many other causes of what he did, then <hi>the abuse of some Preachers of Indulgences.</hi> If he will not give me credit, let him cousult the hundred grievances of the German Nation. That the Pope rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked those Preachers of Indulgences severely, is more then I have read: only this I have read, that <hi>Carolus Militius</hi> did so chide <hi>Tecelius</hi> the Popes Pardoner about it, that shortly after he died of grief.<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh was so
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65027:162"/>
far from being a totall adequate cause of his separation, that it was no more but a single occasion. The originall priviledges of the British Churches, the ancient liberties and immunities of the English Church, daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the just Rites and Flowers of his own Crown, the otherwise remediles oppression of his Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ts, and the examples of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Predecessors were the chief grounds of his proceedings against the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He asketh, <hi>could not</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth have been saved though he was excommunicate?</hi> yes, why not? Justice looseth unjust bonds. But I see that this question is grounded upon a double dangerous error. First, that all reformation of our selves is a sinfull sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from other Churches. Whereas he himself confesseth that it is sometimes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and necessary. Nay every reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our selves is so far from being a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full separation from others, that it is no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration at all, except it be joyned with cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring and condemning of others.</p>
               <p>The second error intimated in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is this, that so long as there is possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of salvation in any Church, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or at least not necessary to separate from the abuses and corruptions thereof. A Church may continue a true particular Church and bring forth Children to God, and yet out of invincible ignorance maintain
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65027:162"/>
materiall Heresie, and require the profession of that Heresie as a condition of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with her, in which case it is lawfull, nay necessary after conviction to separate from her errors. Those errors and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are pardonable by the goodness of God to them who erre out of invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which are not pardonable in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to them who sinne contrary to the light of their own conscience.</p>
               <p>He addeth, that <hi>this excommunication was not the fault of the Roman Church, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caused it nor approved it.</hi> Yea saith he, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them disliked it both then and since, not as unjust but as imprudent,</hi> and some have declared themselves positively that <hi>a Prince and a multitude are not to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> It were to be wished for the good of both parties, that all men were so moderate. To his argument I give two answers: First, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did not approve the excommunication of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; So neither did <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Cchurch of <hi>Rome,</hi> but only from the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what are we the better that some in the Roman Church are moderate, so long as they have no power to help us, or hinder the acts of the Roman Court. They teach that a Prince or a multitude are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. But in the mean time the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> doth excommunicate both Princes and multitudes, and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65027:163"/>
and give them away to strangers. Whereof there are few Kingdomes or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks in <hi>Europe</hi> that have not been sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble more or less: and particularly <hi>England</hi> hath felt by wofull experience in sundry ages. <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh excommunicated King <hi>Henry,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> the third both excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and interdicted him and the whole Kingdome; and this was the first separation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the originall of the Schism, wherin the Church of <hi>England</hi> was meerly passive. So the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was the first cause of the Schism.</p>

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:65027:165"/>
Churches, being three times more in number then themselves, for not receiving these new Articles, or some of them, and especially for not acknowledging the Sovereign Power and Jurisdiction of the Roman Bishop and his Court appeareth undeniably by the famous Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth,<note place="margin">

               <p>In way of answer to this, he asketh <hi>how this was any cause of King</hi> Henry's <hi>revolt?</hi> I reply first, that though <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had not thought of this, &amp; so it had not been <hi>causa procreans,</hi> a productive cause of the separation, yet to us it is a most just cause to condemn them of Schism. Secondly, the revolt, or more truly the separation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not made by <hi>Henry</hi> the eight or the English Church, but by the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who excommunicated him and his Kingdome for not enduring their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments and usurpations. He and his Kingdome were passive in it, only the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was doubly active, first in revolting from the right Discipline of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and secondly in excluding the party wronged from their communion. But in the separation of <hi>England</hi> from the oppessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> I confesse that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and the Kingdom were active. And this very ground to avoid the

tyranny,<note place="margin">The Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a cause of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and ambition, and avarice of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Court was the chief impulsive cause, both to the English and Eastern Christians. For though the Sovereignty of the Roman Bishop was not obtruded upon them in form of a Creed, yet it was obtruded upon them as a necessarie point of Faith. If <hi>Henry</hi> the eight had any other private sinistre grounds known only to himself, they doe not render the Reformation one jod the worse in it self, but only prove that he proceeded not uprightly, which concerneth him, not us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he answereth, that though <hi>they profess that it is necessary to salvation to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pope as Vicar of Christ,</hi> yet <hi>they say not that it is necessary</hi> necessitate medii, <hi>so as none can be saved who doe not actually beleeve it.</hi> If all this were true, yet it were too much to oblige the whole Christian world to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Pope as the Vicar of Christ, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the commandement of God. But I fear that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> by his Bull, and all they by their swearing in obedience thereunto, doe make it to be necessary <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> so as none can be saved who doe not actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it. And then there was little hope of salvation throughout the whole Christian World in the times of the Councells of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> and <hi>Basile,</hi> out of the Popes own Court, which was then the only <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke.

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The Pope excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates the Eastern Churches.</note> he answereth, that <hi>the Roman Church</hi> (he should say the Roman Court) <hi>doth not excommunicate all the Christians of</hi> Africk, Asia, Greece, <hi>and</hi> Russia, <hi>but only such as do erre vincibly or sinfully, such as are formall or obstinate Hereticks or Schismaticks. There are innumerable in those Churches who are but</hi> credentes Hereticis &amp; Schismaticis, <hi>because the Catholick Faith was never suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently preached to them. And these the Pope doth not excommunicate.</hi> I wish he did not: But his own Bull speaks the contrary, that he excommunicates them all solemnly, anniversarily, with the greater excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The Bull makes no such distinction between Hereticks or Schismaticks, and those who give credit to Hereticks or Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. The Bull hath no such exception
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65027:167"/>
of those who erre out of invicible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. If the Grecians be not all excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, then by the same reason the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are not all excommunicated, there is no difference. Yet he seemeth to extenuate their fault, because the Faith was never suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently preached to them, whereas in truth they hold the Popes declaration to be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proposall. I doe not say that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of this rash censure doth extend either to them all, or to any of them all. But they owe no thanks to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for sparing them, but to Christ for annulling their sentence. So much as lyeth in them they exclude them all from the communion of Christians and all hope of salvation. How cometh it to pass that he who pleaded but even now, that a multitude ought not to be excommunicated on a sodain, is contented to give way to the solemn annuall excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of such innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Christians? to whom himself confesseth that the catholick Faith (he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eththeir newly coyned Articles) was never sufficiently preached.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he answereth, that <hi>the Pope doth not exclude them by his excommunication, but only declares that they are excluded by their own Heresie or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hism.</hi> It is a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in the Schools, whether any sentence of binding and loosing be more then decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorie. But this is certain, that as to this case now in question between him and me
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65027:167"/>
it is all one whether the sentence of the Pope doe cut them off from the communion of the Catholick Church, or only declare them to be cut off. For still the same rupture or schismaticall separation of one part of the catholick Church from another, doth follow thereupon. If the Pope doe justly exclude them, or declare them to be excluded, the Schism lyeth at their own dores. If the Pope doe either unjustly exclude them, or declare them to be excluded, the Schism lieth at his dore. I know Ecclesiasticall Canons doe sometimes inflict penalties upon Delinquents <hi>ipso facto,</hi> or by the sentence of he Law: Sometimes they doe moreover require the sentence of the Judge. The sentence of the Law takes place sooner then the sentence of the Judge: But the Delinquent stands not legally convicted, untill a juridicall decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And in all such cases the Law must be confessed, the fact notorious. But in this case of the Eastern Churches, there is no Law, there is no Canon that inflicteth any penalty of Heresy or Schism upon them, their Delinquency is not notorious, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is evident that they are no Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. They have no competent Judge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a general Councel, whereof they make the greatest part themselves. Finally, the proceeding against them was illegall, teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious, and <hi>coram non Iudice.</hi>

Neither is that account Mr. <hi>Camdens</hi> account, but the account of the Roman Catholicks themselves. His words are these, <hi>The number if these, according to their own account, throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Which account Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> doth in part correct and contradict. For he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth there of three popish Bishops that changed their Religion of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, the Bishops of <hi>Chester, Worcester,</hi> and St. <hi>Asaph.</hi> But suppose this account were true, what great matter was it for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety at the most, of all ranks and conditions, high or low, to suffer deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Religion throughout the whole Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> wherein, without his Abbats and his Abbesses, which he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons among the rest to make up the number, there are above nine thousand Parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65027:169"/>
besides all Dignitaries and Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches, and Masters and Fellows of Colledges. It was a very small inconsiderable proportion. He will not vouchsafe our present sufferings the name of persecution; yet there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> nor either of our Universities, wherein more of us have not suffered for our Consciences, then of Papists in those dayes throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England.</hi> In the Citie of <hi>London</hi> alone we finde an hundred and twenty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of Parish Churches, whereof fourty were Doctors in Theologie, turned out of their Benefices and homes, plundred, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and many of them dead under the burthen of their grievous pressures, besides all the numerous Dignitaries, Prebends, and inferior Clergy men belonging to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Quires. I could say more touching your Romish Confessors at that time, That they refused the Oath of Supremacy more out of compact then Conscience, hoping by their unanimity, and for fear of wanting means of ordination, to necessitate the State to continue them all. But when they see how miserably they were deceived, and their Churches filled with such as were returned from banishment, of whom they dreamed not, <hi>conjurationis eos poenituit, they repented of their foolish plot.</hi> And when it was too

               <p>To my third Argument he giveth no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in his Survey,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4</note> but what was taken away in the vindication before it was made. The sum of my Argument was this: That Court which rebelleth against the highest tribunall of the Church, &amp; assumeth a sovereign Power over it to it self, is schismaticall; but the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> rebelleth against the supreme Tribunall or Judicatory of the Militant Church, that is, the Representative Church, or a general Councel. The Reader will excuse me if I doe sometimes complicate two or three <hi>medios terminos</hi> together for brevity sake.</p>
               <p>His first exception is, That <hi>whereas I should prove that the Papacy is the cause of Schism: I doe seek to prove that the Papacy is Schism.</hi> To say the Papacy is Schism is non sense. I hope I may have leave to write common sense. But I did say, and I doe say that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is in Schism, or Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall. To say it is in Schism, and to say it is the cause of Schism, is the same thing; for it is not the separation but the cause that makes the Schism. They who give just cause of separation are Schismaticall,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65027:170"/>
and they who take it are innocent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he demandeth, <hi>how the Papacy, as it is now maintained by many, could be a sufficient ground of separation to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> especially of separation <hi>from the whole Roman Church</hi>? I answer very well, because it was then and two or three ages before that, maintained in the same manner, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an higher degree, by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and some others of the Roman Church, though not so many as at this day. Our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is totall and absolute, because we know no legall Subjection which we owe to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I know no such absolute sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on our parts from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but only a difference from them in their erroneous Opinions, and a forbearance to practise some other things, which are made by them conditions of their externall Communion, wherein we cannot joyn with them with a good conscience. The making of their errors to be essentialls and necessary conditions of Catholick Communion, makes the breach appear greater then it is. That this is clearly the sense of our Church I have shewed out of the thirtieth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>So he comes to his main answer, That <hi>to rebell against a complete generall Councell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A generall Councell complete without the Pope.</note> 
                  <hi>joyned with the Pope as Head thereof, is gross Schism: But not to resist an incomplete ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell without the Pope.</hi> This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65027:170"/>
is sufficiently confuted in the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; first, by the authority of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> who makes it to be schismaticall in the Pope to challenge such an universall headship of Power. Secondly, by the Popes own Laws, and by their professions of obedience to the Canons. Thirdly, by the Appeales made by Princes, and Prelates, and Universities from the Popes to generall Councells. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the express Decrees of the Councells of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile</hi> in the point. To which I adde, that those very Decrees of generall Councells which have been not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ratified but opposed by the Popes, have nevertheless been evermore received and obeyed as Lawes in the Catholick Church, for the authority of the Councell. As the Decree of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for equalling the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to the Patriarch of <hi>Rome,</hi> was protested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by the Popes Legates in the name and on the behalf of their Master, and yet was ever held and practised as an authentick Rule by the Catholick Church, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> as a part of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperor called the fifth generall Councell, at which <hi>Vigilius</hi> the then Pope refused to be present, or to give any consent unto it, for which his frowardness he was banished by the Emperor. This in <hi>R. C.</hi> his judgement was an incomplete ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell: Yet in all succeeding ages and by the Popes themselves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg l.</hi> 1. <hi>epist.</hi> 24</note> it was honored
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65027:171"/>
and esteemed as a true general Councell.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bron. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Conc.</hi> 5.</note> I confess a generall Councell was not held complete in the primitive times, when such an assembly might be had, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the five Protopatriarchs by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their Deputies. But to think that any one of these, either the Roman Patriarch or any other had an Headship of Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Councell, or a negative voice against the Councell, is a most groundless fancy, whereof we finde not the least footstep in all antiquity. And therefore <hi>R. C.</hi> might well have forborn his comparison of King and Parliament as altogether impertinent. The King was confessedly an Head of Power over the Parliament, so was not the Pope over a generall Councell. The King had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore a negative voice in Parliament, so had the Pope never in a generall Councell. When the Parliament had made up their Billes they preferred them alwaies to the King by way of petition, but the Bishops in a generall Councell by way of definition. <hi>Ego A. definiens subscripsi.</hi> In a generall Councell the President (who is no more then a Prolocutor or Speaker in Parliament) makes his last address to the body of the Councell in this sort, <hi>placet? aut non placet?</hi> doth it please you, or not? But in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the Members have voted <hi>content,</hi> or <hi>not content,</hi> the last address must be to the King; and he is free to say <hi>the King will have it,</hi> or <hi>the King will advise.</hi> If a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65027:171"/>
Councell have not the Rites and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a generall Councell, unless the Pope be present as the Head thereof, and concurre with it, to what purpose were those questions so canvased in the Western Church, whether a generall Councell be above the Pope? and whether a generall Councell can depose the Pope? Doth any man think that our Ancestors were so simple as to question whether the Body be above the Head? or to hope that the Pope would concurre willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own deposition? This we know for certain, that the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the presence or concurrence of the Pope, did Decree themselves to be a lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete generall Councell, superior to the Pope, and that he was subject to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. And deposed three Popes at a time. And their acts were confirmed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Basile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Decree of the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> he giveth two answers:<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Councel of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> for its superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority above the Pope law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fail.</note> First, That <hi>it is probable that the Councell meant only of doubtfull Popes.</hi> But I did take away this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in the vindication two waies. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is contrary to the text. The words of the Councell are these [<hi>the Pope</hi>] that is, a Pope truely elected and lawfully admitted: It is uncertain whether a doubtfull Pope be Pope or no [<hi>is subject to a generall Councel</hi>] that is, a generall Councel without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or concurrence of the Pope, such as the Councel of <hi>Constance</hi> was, [<hi>As well in
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65027:172"/>
matter of faith as of manners.</hi>] This is more then doubtfull titles, [<hi>so as he may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be corrected, but if he be incorrigible be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</hi>] So a Councell may correct the Pope, and if they please continue him, or if they finde him incorrigible depose him. Men are not corrected for weak and litigious titles, but for faults in faith or manners. Neither can they be said to be deposed, who are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to have been usurpers. Secondly, I confuted this answer by the execution of the Decree. The Councell did not only declare who was the right Pope, which is a judiciary act, and may be done by an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or towards his Superior, but they turned out three Popes together, whereof one without controversie was the right Pope. And so made right to be no right for the publick good of the Church, which is a badge of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and legislative Authority.</p>
               <p>His second answer, is, That <hi>this Decree was not conciliarly made, and consequently not confirmed by</hi> Martine <hi>the fifth.</hi> This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was likewise taken away in the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. First, because the Popes confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but a novelty, never practised in the ancient Church, and signifieth nothing. The Pope and his Legates did subscribe in the same manner and form that other Bishops and their Legates did. And that was all. Secondly, because Pope <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> title to the Papacy did depend meerly upon the Authority of the Decree. If this
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65027:172"/>
Decree were not a lawfull Decree of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full generall Councell, and such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell as had power to depose the former Pope, then Pope <hi>Martine</hi> was no Pope, but an usurper, and then his confirmation signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing also in that respect. Last I shewed that it was conciliarly made. And what the word conciliarly there signifieth out of the Acts of the Councell. And that passage was not intended for a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but an occasionall Speech after the end of the Councell, after the Fathers were dismissed, in answer to an unseasonable proposition made to the Pope, by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Lituania,</hi> about a seditious Book, which they alleging to have been condemned by the Deputies of the Nations, but not being able to affirm that it was condemned in the publick Acts of the Session, the Pope answered, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved what had been conciliarly done. To all this he answereth nothing, but that <hi>the word</hi> [conciliariter <hi>or conciliarly</hi>] <hi>signifieth rather the manner of a Councel, then of a Councell.</hi> Let it be so. Is not the decreeing of any thing publickly in the Session the manner of the Councels Acting? The Duputies of the Nations were like a Committee of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who have no power to Decree, though they be a Committe of the whole House, but only to prepare things for the House. Now suppose the King at the close of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being requested to confirm some
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65027:173"/>
Acts of a Committe, should use the very same expression which <hi>Martine</hi> the fifth did, That he would hold and observe inviolably all things determined and concluded by that Parliament, <hi>Parliamentariter</hi> or Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily. Doth not this evidently confirm all the Acts and conclusions of the Parliament? Or what can this in reason exclude but only the Acts of the Committees. To say as <hi>R. C.</hi> saith, That <hi>he confirmeth only those Acts which were done with due liberation,</hi> is as much as to say, that he confirmeth just nothing at all. How shall it be known, or who shall be Judg, what was done with due deliberation, and what was not? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it weigh any thing at all to say (as he doth) that the word <hi>concilium</hi> doth exclude the Deputies of the Nations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding <hi>conciliariter,</hi> for first, it is a rule in Law that <hi>abundans non vitiat, A word or two too much doe no hurt.</hi> Secondly, the Deputies of the Nations did sit and Act by the Authority of the Councell, and consequently their Acts were mediatly and in some sort the Acts of the Councel. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether the Decree of the Councel were confirmed or not, to me seemeth all one. The end of Convocating so many Bishops is to represent the consent of all those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Churches from which they are sent, and to witnesse the received belief. We see by their Votes what was the received opinion of the Occidentall Church. And we see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

                  </gap>ently what was the received opinion of the Eastern, Southern, and Northern Churches. So as the Roman Court will not be able to finde one natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church of that age throughout the World, to maintain their exorbitant claimes.</p>
               <p>To my fourth argument drawn from the Popes challenge of all Episcopall Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consequently the breaking of all the lines of Apostolicall Succession except his own, and to my two additionall arguments concerning the infallibility of the Popes judgment and his power over Princes, he answereth nothing, but that <hi>they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Roman Church, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a cause of departing from her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> Neither have I indevoured to charge the crime of Schism upon the Roman Church in generall, but upon the Roman Court, and the violent propugners thereof, whose Tenets these are. I wish the Roman Church restored to its ancient splendor of an Apostolicall Church, and the principall Protropatriarchate, and its beginning of unity.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the weaknesse of his answers, yet he laies down this for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, That <hi>whatsoever I now pretend, our separation was schismatically begun.</hi> And thence inferres upon a ground brought by me, <hi>Quod ab initio fuit invalidum tract is temporis non convalescit, That it is schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall still.</hi> First, I denie his ground, the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65027:174"/>
separation was not made by us, but by them. what we did was not schismaticall but just and necessary. Secondly, his inference is grossely mistaken, and the rule which I brought altogether misapplyed. That which was invalid from the beginning, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come valid prescription or tract of time, but it may become valid by subsequent Acts of Parties interessed. And that which was uncharitably begun and schismatically, may be charitably, piously, and necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as by many reasons and instances may be made appear, but that it is besides our question.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note>IN the first place he observeth a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Protestants and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, <note place="margin">Some Rom. Cath. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</note> That <hi>Protestants doe not charge Roman Catholicks with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Schism, but only with causall Schism, whereas Roman Catholicks doe charge Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants with formall Schism.</hi> To which I give three answers. First, if Protestants doe not charge them with formall Schism, their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the greater, and the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are the more obliged to them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65027:174"/>
we have better grounds to charge them with formall Schism then they have to charge us. But indeed Protestants doe charge the Roman Court, and all Roman Catholicks who maintain it, and adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it out of ambitious, avaritious, or other sinister ends, and not out of simplicity of heart and invincible or at least probable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, with formall Schism.</p>
               <p>Secondly, causall Schism may be, and in this case of the Romanists is as well formall, nay sometimes more formall then actuall Schism, or to speak more properly then actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all separation. Whosoever give just cause of separation to others, contrary to the light of their knowledge, out of unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or other sinister ends, are causall and formall Schismaticks. Whereas they who seperate actually and locally upon just cause, are no criminous Schismaticks at all, and they who separate actually without just cause, may doe it out of invincible ignorance, and consequently they are not formall but only materiall Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the case comes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly weighed, it is here just as it is in the case of possibility of Salvation, that is to say, the very same. Protestants doe not charge all Roman Catholicks with formall Schism, but only such as break the bond of unity sinfully, whether it be by separating themselves, or others, unduely from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, or giving just cause of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65027:175"/>
separation to others. Nor doth <hi>R. C.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self charge all Protestants with formall Schism. For he confesseth that all those Protestants who erre invincibly doe <hi>want neither Church nor Salvation.</hi> Formall Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, whilest they continue formall Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, want both Church and Salvation; therefore whosoever want neither Church nor Salvation are no formall Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>The reason of his former assertion is this, because <hi>Protestants can name no Church out of whose communion the present Church of</hi> Rome <hi>departed.</hi> His reason shewes that he confounds materiall and formall Schism, with causall and actuall Schism. Whereas actuall Schism may sometimes be only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, and causall Schism may also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be formall. To his reason I give two clear answers.<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>parted out of the ancient Roman Church;</note> First, Protestants can name a particular Church out of whose Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the present Roman Church departed, even the pure and uncorrupted Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which was before it, by introducing errors, abuses, and corruptions into it. There is a morall departure out of a Church as well as a locall, and acknowledged by themselves to be culpable and criminous Schism. Secondly, That Church which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts out of the Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or universall Church, is more schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall then that which departs only out of the Communion of a particular Church,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65027:175"/>
both because our Obligation is greater to the Catholick Church then to any particular Church,<note place="margin">And, which is worse, out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note> and because the Catholick or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church doth comprehend all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches of one denomination in it. When the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> by their censures did separate three or four parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World, who were as Catholick or more Catholick then themselves, then they departed out of the Communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as the Donatists did of old. There is but this difference between the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists and them, that the Donatists did it only by their uncharitable opinions, and verball censures, but the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did it moreover by a solemn Juridicall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which is much the greater degree of Schism.</p>
               <p>He telleth us, That <hi>it is vain to liken them to the Donatists, because the Donatists said that the Catholick Church of that time, was but a part of the Church, (as Protestants say now of the Roman,) for which Saint</hi> Austine <hi>laughed at them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib</hi> 2. <hi>Gent. Pet. c.</hi> 38.</note> The truth is, the Donatists said, that they being but a small part of the catholick Church, (if any part,) were the true catholick Church,<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists.</note> and that the true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church was no catholick Church, nor any part of it, which is expresly contrary to what he saith here. Just as the Romanists say now, that they themselves being with all their dependents not a fourth part of the Christian World, are the catholick
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65027:176"/>
Church, and that the Patriarchate of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staentinople</hi> which is as large as theirs, and the Patriarchate of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the seventeen Kingdomes of <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> all Christians, and dependents upon that Patriarchate, is likewise as large, and the Patriarchates of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and all the lesser Patriarchates in the East, and the whole Empire of <hi>Russia,</hi> and all the Protestants in <hi>Europe,</hi> are no parts of the catholick Church. Is not this to make the part to be the whole, and the whole to be nothing beyond that part, as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists did. <hi>Ovum ovo non similius.</hi> And therefore Saint <hi>Austine</hi> might well laugh at them or rather pitty them as indeed he did, for speaking such evident absurdities. <hi>Si mihi diceres quod Ego sim</hi> Petilianus, <hi>non invenirem quomodo te refellerem, nisi aut jocantem riderem, aut insanientem dolerem.

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. &amp; 2.</note>Their first objection is, that we have sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated our selves from the Communion of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65027:176"/>
the Catholick Church; to which I gave this answer, that we had not separated our selves from the Communion of the Catholick Church, for we are ready to beleeve and practise whatsoever the Catholick Church doth unanimously beleeve and practise. No, nor yet from the Roman Church in the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentialls of Christian Religion, or any of them, but only in their errors and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that it was the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> that made the separtion. To this answer he takes great exception, but as it seemeth to me in a most confused manner. For method sake I will reduce all which he saith to four heads. First, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the true Catholick Church.</hi> Secondly, That <hi>we have separated our selves from it in essentialls.</hi> Thirdly, That <hi>all the other Patriarchates (except the Roman) are no parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi> Fourthly, That <hi>we hold no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them.</hi> To all these I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered formerly in this Treatise, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I shall touch them more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>That the Roman Church is the Catholick Church he proveth thus,<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church not the Catholick Church.</note> because <hi>it is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Christians, instituted by Christ, spread over the World, and intirely united in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, and communion of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under his Officers.</hi> And therefore he bids us out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>L. de unit. c.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>either give or take,</hi> either receive their Church, or shew one of our own as good. This Argument is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65027:177"/>
upon a wrong supposition, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is a Church of one denoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as Roman, or Grecian, &amp;c. which we doe altogether deny as implying an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent contradiction. Secondly, we deny that the Roman Church, including the Papacy, in respect of which it challengeth this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality, and to be the Foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and the Mistris of all other Churches, is instituted by Christ, or by his Church; this is their own usurpation. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we deny that the Roman Church is spread over the World. Divide Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into five parts, and in four of them they have very little or nothing to doe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they have here a Monastery, or there a finall handfull of Proselytes. But what are five or six persons to so many millions of Christian soules, that they should be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and not all the others? This was not the meaning of Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged. <hi>Date ni hi hanc Ecclesiam si apud vos est, ostendite vos ommunicare omnibus Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, quas jam videmus in hoc semine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici. Date hanc, aut furore deposito accipite, non a me, sed ab illo ipso in quo benedicuntur omnes Gentes. Give me this Church if it be with you: Shew that you communicate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Nations which we see to be blessed in this seed.</hi> It is not a few particular persons, nor some hand-fulls of Proselites, but multitudes of Christian Nations that make the catholick Church. The Romanists are so farre from
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65027:177"/>
communicating with all these Nations, that they excommunicate the far greater part of them. Fourthly, we deny that such an exact entire union in all points and opinions which are not essentialls of Christian Religion, is necessary to the being of the catholick Church, or that the Romanists have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unity among themselves or with others, then sundry of those Churches which they have excommunicated. Fiftly, I deny that the Officers of the Conrt of <hi>Rome</hi> or any of them (<hi>qua tales</hi>) are either the Officers of Christ or of his Church. And lastly, if all this were true, well might it prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a catholick Church, that is, a part of the catholick Church, but not the catholick or universall Church. Still there would want universality. To be spread through the Christian World is one thing, and to be the common faith of the Christian World another thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">If de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy maketh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, the World is full of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanns.</note> he proveth that they did not exclude us, but that we did separate our selves, because England <hi>denyed the Popes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty by divine right, before the Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated them. And so though it was not perfectly Protestant, yet it was substantially Protestant.</hi> I take him at his word. Then all the Eastern, Northern, and Ethiopick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are substantially Protestants as well as we: for they all deny the Popes sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either by divine or humane right. Then all the world were substantially Protestants
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65027:178"/>
in the time of the Councells of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile,</hi> except the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, the Pope and his Officers. Then we want not bretheren that are substantially Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants as well as we, in the bosome of the Roman Church at this day. To seek to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude this spirituall Monarchy upon us was causall Schism, to excommunicate us for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it was actuall Schism.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Our sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not in essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls.</note>To prove that we have departed from them in essentialls, he only saith, that we have left them simply, absolutely, nay wholy in the communion of Sacraments, and publick worship of God, and the entire profession of faith, which are essentialls to a Church. How often hath this been answered already? That every Opinion which a particular Church doth profess to be essentiall, is either an essentiall or a truth, or that every abuse crept into the administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is of the essence of the Sacraments, is that to which we can never give as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent. Let them keep themselves to the ancient Creed of the Church, as they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Councell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and we shall quickly join with them in profession of faith. Let them use the ancient formes of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, which the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Roman Church did use, and we shall not forbear their communion in Sacraments. Did the ancient Roman Church want any essentialls: Or are the primitive Roman and the present Roman Church divided in essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65027:178"/>
If they differ in essentialls then we ought not to joyn in Communion with the present Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> If they differ not in essentialls, no more doe we.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he proveth that the other Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archates are not the Catholick Church, not true parts thereof, because they are divided in profession of faith, in communion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and in Church Officers. Yea (saith he) <hi>it were dotage to think that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church can consist of hereticall and schismaticall Churches, as I cannot deny but they are, except I will deny the thirty nine Articles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to which I have sworn.</hi> I answer that those Churches which he is pleased to undervalue so much, doe agree better both among themselves and with other Churches, then the Roman Church it self,<note place="margin">The Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Churches true parts of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note> both in professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, for they and we doe generally acknowledge the same ancient Creeds, and no other; and in inferior questions, being free from the intricate and perplexed diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Roman Schools. In point of Discipline they have no complaint against them, saving that they &amp; we doe unanimously refuse to acknowledge the spiritual Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of the Roman Bishop. And concerning the administration of the Sacraments I know no objection of any great moment which they produce against them. How should they, when the Pope allowed the Russians the exercise of the Greek Religion? It is
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65027:179"/>
true, that they use many Rites which we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; But difference in Rites is no breach of communion, nor needeth to be, for any thing that I know, if distance of place and difference of Language were not a greater impediment to our actuall communion, so long as the Sacraments are not mutilated, nor sinfull duties injoined, nor an unknown tongue purposely used. How are they then schismaticall Churches? only because they deny the Popes Supremacie. Or how are they hereticall Churches? Some of them are called Nestorians, but most injuriously, who have nothing of <hi>Nestorius</hi> but the name. Others have been suspected of Eutychianism, and yet in truth orthodox enough. They doe not add the word [<hi>filioque, and from the son</hi>] to the Creed, and yet they acknowledge that the holy Ghost is the Spirit of the Son, which is the very same thing in sense. It is no new thing for great quarrels to arise from meer mistakes. He would perswade the World that there is something in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Articles which reflects sadly upon the Greek Church, to declare them guilty of Heresie or Schism. Either he is deceived himself, or he would deceive others. There is no such thing, nor the least insinuation against them, either directly or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But he is fallible, and may erre in this as well as he doth in saying that <hi>I have been sworn to them:</hi> we doe use to subscribe unto them indeed, not as Articles of Faith,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65027:179"/>
but as Theologicall verities, for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of unity among our selves; but never any Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to swear unto them, or punished for dissenting from them in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so he did not publish it by word or writing.</p>
               <p>Secondly they charge us with schismaticall disobedience to the determinations of the generall Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that that Councell was neither gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent</hi> not general.</note> nor free, nor lawfull. First, not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, because there was not one Bishop pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent out of all the other Patriarchates, and but a part of the occidentall Church: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of those who were present, two parts were Italians, and many of them the Popes Pensioners: Thirdly, at the definition of some of the weightiest controversies there were not so many Bishops as the King of <hi>England</hi> could have called together in a moneth within his own Realms: Fourthly, it was not generally received by the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists. To this he answers that <hi>there were some Grecian Bishops there.</hi> Perhaps one or two titular Bishops without Bishopricks, not impowred by commission, nor sent with instructions from any Patriarch: These were no Grecian Bishops. He addeth that <hi>it is not necessarie to summon hereticall or schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Bishops.</hi> Yes the rather before they be lawfully condemned, as these never were. Besides this is begging of the question. When
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65027:180"/>
or where were they convicted of Heresie or Schism? This is but the opinion of the lesser and unsounder part of the Church, against the greater and sounder part. Upon this ground the Donatists might have called a Councel in <hi>Africk,</hi> and nicknamed it a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel. He saith, <hi>it is obeyed by all Catholicks for matters of faith, though not for matters of fact.</hi> He meaneth by all Roman Catholicks. But if it were the supreme Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of the militant Church, it ought to be obeyed for matters of fact also, so farre as they are Ecclesiastical. Break ice in one place and it will crack in more. He saith, <hi>Pius the fourth sent most loving letters to Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>but his messenger was not admitted into</hi> England. As we have in horror the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and tyrannicall proceedings of <hi>Paul</hi> the third and <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth against our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Realms: So we acknowledge, with gratitude, the civilities of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth. Certainly he took the more prudent way for a Christian Prelate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Nor free:</note>Secondly, The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> was not free, First, because the place afforded no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to Protestants. Secondly, the accuser was the Judge. Thirdly, any one who spake a free word, was either silenced or thrust out of the Councel. Fourthly, the Protestants who came on purpose to dispute, were not admitted. Fifthly, the Legates gave auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar votes, and some of the Councel did not stick to confess that it was guided by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65027:180"/>
Ghost sent from <hi>Rome</hi> in a male. Sixthly, new Bishopricks were created during the Session, to make the Papalins able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote the Tramontains. To all these exceptions he answereth, That if the Pope had been their Judge, <hi>it had been no more unjust then for a King to judge his own notorious Rebells; but the Pope, out of his abundant favour, made the Councel their Iudge, which he needed not, their Heresies having been formerly lawfully condemned.</hi> He supposeth, without any proof, that the Pope is an absolute Monarch of the Church, which all the Christian World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept themselves doth denie. He should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that these are their own objections, and that he is now to prove, not to dictate. Whether the Pope did judge the Protestants by himself, or by a Councel consisting for the most part of his own Clients and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who knew no motion but by his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is all one in effect. He knew that he had made his game sure enough under-hand, whilest the Italian Episcopalls were so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and partial: If the Pope did rather choose to referre the Protestants to the Councel, it was not out of favour to them, as a more equall and indifferent way, but to take the envie off from himself. If Christian Princes desire to have a free Councel, they must reduce it to the form of the Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi> and revive the Deputies of the Nations. Whereas he saith, that <hi>the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants were formerly lawfully condemned,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65027:181"/>
they were strange phantasms of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, or it was a strange propheticall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. Lastly, he demands <hi>how I can say that it was not a free Councel, where two or three safe conducts were granted, where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel bound it self to determine the controversie by holy Scripture, Apostolicall tradition, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Councels, consent of the catholick Church, and authority of holy Fathers?</hi> Yes I can say well enough for all this, that the Councell was not free, <hi>fistula dulce canit volucrem dum decipit auceps,</hi> the pipe playes sweetly whilest the Fowler is about his prey.

But God delivered him out of their hands.</p>
               <p>He pleadeth moreover, That <hi>the Bishops assembled in</hi> Trent <hi>were not the Popes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> Yet he knoweth right well that they had all taken an Oath of obedience to the Pope, for maintenance of the Papacy.

               <p>But in the place of this he proposeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objection which he calleth <hi>their most forcible argument against us.</hi> which in brief is this. <hi>No Church is to be left in which sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be had, but we confess that the Roman Church is a true Church in substance, the true Church, &amp;c.</hi> I cannot but observe what difference there is in the judgements of men, for of all their objections I take this to be the weakest. And so would he also if he would cease to confound <hi>the Catholick Church,</hi> with <hi>a Catholick Church,</hi> that is, the universall Church with a particular Church, and distinguish the essentialls of a Church, from the corruptions of a Church, and make a difference between a just refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our selves, and a causless separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from others. But be the argument what it will, forcible or weak, it hath been answered abundantly in this Treatise over and over again.<note place="margin">

I confess I have answered many impertinences in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, but a man would not willingly go so far out of his way to seek an impertinence. When I did read some of his Treatises, I pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the mispending of so much time, in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and wresting of Authors, of severall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, who writ in the beginning of the Controversie between sleeping and waking. Sometimes he condemneth us of Schism for communicating with them; some other times he citeth them as our Classicall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and at other times from the different Opinions of the Sons of the same Church, he impugneth the conclusion wherein they doe all accord.

If I had omitted any testimonies of weight cited by him in this Treatise, as he hath done the most of all my grounds, then with better reason he might have called it <hi>dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi>

               <p>He seemeth to me to take this course, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make his credulous Reader beleeve that there is more in his books then there is.

He knoweth better if he please, that the first
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65027:187"/>
Protestant Bishops were not in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> time, but in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths time. If they were not Protestants they did them the more wrong to burn them for it. The Ecclesiasticall Registers doe make their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination so plain,<note place="margin">Our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination justified.</note> that no man who will but open his eies can be in doubt of it. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that <hi>Father</hi> Oldcorne <hi>did say our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters were authenticall.</hi> So must every one say or think that seeth them, and every one is free to see them that will. But <hi>Father</hi> Oldcorne <hi>was a prisoner, and judged others by himself.</hi> Yet neither his imprisonment nor his charity did make him swerve in any other point from his Roman Catholick opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Why did he change in this more then in any of the rest? Because there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against a Flaile, no resisting evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, which doth not perswade but compell men to believe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>wherefore were not these Registers shewed before King</hi> James <hi>his time</hi>? They were alwaies shewed to every man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see them. Registers are publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, the sight whereof can be refused to no man. The Officers hand is known, the Office is secured from all supposititious writings, both by the Oath and by the honesty of him that keepeth the Register, and by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all others, who view the Records from time to time. He might as well ask why a Proclamation is not shewed? Which is first publickly promulged, and after that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65027:188"/>
affixed to the gates of the City, and of the Common-Hall, and all other publick places. If he could have excepted against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, either consecraters or consecrated, as that there were not such persons, or not so qualified, or not present at that time, he had had some reason for himself. But Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Ordination in <hi>England</hi> was too solemn and too publick an Act to be counterfeited. And moreover the Proceedings were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in print, to the view of the World, whilest there were very many living, who were eie witnesses of the Ordination.</p>
               <p>And yet by his favour, if there had not been so many Protestant Bishops there, as there were, it might have made the Ordination illegall, but not invalid, for which I will give him a president and a witnesse beyond exception. The president is <hi>Austine</hi> the first converter of the English, the witnesse Saint <hi>Gregory.</hi>

And truely in the English Church, wherein there is no other Bishop but thy self, thou canst not ordein a Bishop otherwise then alone, &amp;c. But when by the grace of God, Bishops are ordeined throughout all places, Ordination ought not to be made without three or four Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He asketh <hi>why Bishop</hi> Jewell <hi>or Bishop</hi> Horne <hi>did not allege these Registers when they were charged by Doctor</hi> Harding <hi>and Doctor</hi> Stapleton <hi>to be no consecrated Bishops</hi>? I might even as well ask him when he citeth an
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65027:188"/>
authority out of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> why such or such an Author that writ before him upon that Subject, did not cite it? and thereupon conclude that it was counterfeit. An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from authority negatively is worth nothing. Perhaps, for I can but guesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he cite the places, Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> or <hi>Harding</hi> did not except against the number or qualification of the Ordeiners, but against the matter or form of their Episcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Perhaps judging them to be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, they thought they had lost their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which yet he himself will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to be indeleble: Perhaps the accusation was general against all Protestants, and they gave a general answer. Perhaps they were better versed in the Schools then in Records: or lastly perhaps, or indeed without perhaps, they insisted upon the illegality of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, in respect of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> not upon the invalidity of it, as shall clearly appear in my next answer. In all these cases there was no occasion to allege the Registers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why were they not shewed</hi> (saith he) <hi>when Bishop</hi> Bonner <hi>excepted against the said</hi> Horne <hi>at the barre? What need had the Bishops to desire that their ordination should be judged sufficient by Parliament eight yeers after</hi>? Now let him take one answer for all. There was an Act passed for authorizing the Book of Common-Prayer, and the Book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as an appendix to it, to be used throughout <hi>England,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:65027:189"/>
the sixth. This Act was repealed in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and afterwards revived by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as to the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, intending, but not expresly mentioning the Book of Ordination, which was an appendix to it. So it was restored again, either expresly under the name of the Book of Common Prayer, as containing the publick Prayers of the Church for that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; or at least implicitly, as being print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Book of Common Prayer from the beginning, as an appendix to it. Upon this pretended omission Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> excepts against Bishop <hi>Horne's</hi> Ordination, nor against the validitie of it, what have Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to doe with the essentials of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? but against the legality of it as to the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> by reason of the former pretended omission. So to take away scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Parliament enacted that it should be deemed good in the eye of our English Law. The Parliament knew well that they had no power to make that Ordination valid in it self which was invalid in it self, nor to make that invalid which was valid. This had been to alter the essentials of Ordination. But they had power, for more abundant caution, which never doth hurt, to take away that scruple which was occasioned by a Statute of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which in truth was sufficiently removed before. What is this now to our Registers, whether they be authentick or not? No, we beg no help from any civil
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65027:189"/>
Acts or Sanctions to maintain our Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either for matter, or form. But we are ready to justifie them by those very rules which he saith the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> offered to the Protestants, namely Scripture, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Councels, Fathers, and especially the practice of the catholick Church.</p>
               <p>But he saith, <hi>we are not ordered to offer true substantial sacrifice,</hi> Not expresly indeed. No more were they themselves for eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Christ, and God knows how much longer. No more are the Greek Church, or any other Christian Church in the World (except the Roman) at this day. Yet they acknowledg them to be rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, and admit them to exercise all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Priestly Function in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, which was alleged by me in the <hi>vindication,</hi> and is passed over in silence by <hi>R. C.</hi> in this survey. The Greeks have no more mention of a Sacrifice in their Ordination then we. <hi>The grace of God promotes such a venerable Deacon to be a Presbyter,</hi> yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> approveth their Ordination and all their other Rites, so they will but only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Popes spiritual Monarchy, as we have seen in the case of the Patriarch of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zall,</hi> and the Russians subject to the Crown of <hi>Polonia</hi>; and the like favour was offered to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not so long since <hi>Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>erected a Greek College at</hi> Rome, <hi>to breed up the youth of that Nation where they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65027:190"/>

               <p>But though we have not express words for offering of Sacrifice, nor the tradition of the Patine and the Chalice (no more had their own Ancestors for a thousand yeers) yet we have these words,<note place="margin">No diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</note>

We acknowledge an Eucharistical Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative Sacrifice, or a memorial of the Sacrifice of the Cross; a representative Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or a representation of the Passion of Christ before the eies of his heavenly Father; an impetrative Sacrifice, or an impetration of the fruit and benefit of his Passion, by way of reall Prayer; and lastly an applicative Sacrifice, or an application of his merits unto our soules. Let him that dare goe one step further then we doe, and say that it is a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletorie Sacrifice, to supply the defects of the Sacrifice of the Cross. Or else let them hold their peace and speak no more against us in this point of Sacrifice for ever.</p>
               <p>Yet in his margent he hath placed a cloud of our Doctors, <hi>Whitakers, Morton, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,

               </p>
               <p>In the conclusion of my Treatise I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed three ready meanes for the uniting of all Christian Churches, which seemed to me very reasonable. One of them was, That whereas some Sects have contracted the Christian Faith over much, by reviving some Heresies condemned by the primitive
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65027:191"/>
Church, and on the other side, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had enlarged the Christian Faith o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much, by making or declaring new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith in this last age of the World, the Creed or Belief of the Church contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all points of Faith necessary to be known of all Christians, should be reduced to what it was in the time of the first four generall Councells (I might adde) and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages after. No man dare say that the Faith of the primitive Fathers was imperfect or insufficient. Against this he maketh three objections;<note place="margin">There are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls.</note> first, That <hi>there are no such fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of faith as Protestants ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, sufficient to salvation, though other points of faith sufficiently proposed be not beleeved.</hi> This objection is compounded of truth and falsehood. That there are such fundamentals he himself confesseth elsewhere, which are necessary not only <hi>necessiate paecepti,</hi> but <hi>necessitate medii</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.12 <hi>and c.</hi> 6.1 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> And if he did not confess it, the authority of the Apostle would evince it, That the belief of these alone is sufficient for the salvation of them to whom no more is revealed, he dare not denie: And that the beleef of these is sufficient to them who doe not beleeve other truths which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled unto them, no Protestants did ever imagine. Observe how cunningly he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the state of the question. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not, what is necessarie for a man to beleeve for himself: This is as different as the degrees of mens knowledg, but what
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65027:191"/>
may lawfully be imposed upon all men, or what may be exacted upon other men to whom it is not revealed, or to whom we doe not know whether it be revealed or not. Then if he would have objected any thing materiall to the purpose, he should have said, That the beleef of all fundamentals is not sufficient to salvation, unless other points of Faith be imposed or obtruded upon all men, whether they be revealed or not revealed to them. And this had been directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the plain Decree of the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> That no new Creeds nor new points of faith should be imposed upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, more then the Creed then received.</p>
               <p>His second objection is this, <hi>though there were such fundamentals, yet seeing Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant confess they know not which they are, one cannot know by them who hold so much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to a true Church.</hi> I doe not blame either Protestants or others, especially pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and particular persons;<note place="margin">How much is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be beleeved to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> if they be very tender in setting down precisely what points of faith are absolutely necessary to salvation, the rather because it is a curious, needless, and unprofitable salvation. Since the blesed Apostles have been so provident for the Church, as to deposite and commit to the custody thereof the Creed, as a perfect Rule and Canon of Faith, which comprehendeth all doctrinall points which are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for all Christians to salvation, it were great folly and ingratitude in us to wrangle
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65027:192"/>
about circumstances, or about some substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall points of lesser concernment, whether they be so necessary as others. This is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to let us know, who hold so much as is necessary to a true Church, in point of faith, even all those Churches which hold the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Creed, as it is expounded in the four first generall Councels.</p>
               <p>His third and last objection followeth:<note place="margin">All revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led truths not ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls.</note> 
                  <hi>All points of faith sufficiently proposed are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall and fundamentall, nor can any such point be disbeleeved without infidelity, and giving the lie to God, as Protestants sometimes confess.</hi> If by sufficient proposall he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the proposall of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I deny both parts of his assertion: Many things may be proposed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which are neither fundamentall truths, nor inferior truths, but errors which may be disbeleeved without either infidelity or sin. Other men are no more satisfied that there is such an infallible proponent, then they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie one another what this infallible propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is. If either a man be not assured that there is an infallible proponent, or be not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured who this infallible proponent is, the proposition may be disbeleeved without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God the lie. But if by sufficient propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall he understand Gods actuall revelation of the truth, and the conviction of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, then this third objection is like the first, partly true, and party false. The later part of it is true, that whatsoever is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65027:192"/>
that God hath revealed any thing, and doth not beleeve it, giveth God the lie; and this the Protestants doe alwaies affirm. But the former part of it is still false. All truths that are revealed are not therefore presently fundamentalls or essentialls of faith, no more then it is a fundamentall point of faith that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had a Cloak. That which was once an essentiall part of the Christian faith, is alwaies an essentiall part of the Christian faith, that which was once no essentiall is never an essentiall. How is that an essentiall part of saving faith, whithout which Christians may ordinarily be saved? But many inferior truths are revealed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, without the actuall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof many others have been saved, and they themselves might have been saved, though those truths had never been proposed or revealed to them. Those things which may <hi>adesse</hi> or <hi>abesse,</hi> be present or absent, known or not known, beleeved or not beleeved, without the destruction of saving faith, are no essentialls of saving faith. In a word, some things are necessary to be beleeved when they are known, only because they are revealed, otherwise conducing little, or it may be nothing, to salvation. Some other things are necessary to be beleeved, not only because they are revealed, but because beleef of them is appointed by God a necessary means of salvation. These are, those are not, essentialls or fundamentalls of saving faith.</p>

                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:65027:193"/>Another means of reunion proposed by me in the vindication, was the reduction of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> from his universality of soveregin Jurisdiction <hi>jure divino,</hi>

ion over over all Christians. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I answer that the Epistles of many of those ancient Popes, upon which their claim of universall Sovereignty <hi>jure divino</hi> is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally grounded, are confessed by themselves to be counterfeits. Thirdly, I answer that ancient Popes in their genuine Writings doe not claim, nor did practise monarchicall Power over the catholick Church, much less did they claim it <hi>jure divino,</hi> but what Powet they held they held by prescription, and by the Canons of the Fathers, who gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sundry priviledges to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in honor to the memory of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:65027:193"/>
and the Imperiall City of <hi>Rome.</hi> And some of those ancient Popes have challenged their Authority from the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> though without ground, which they would never have done, if they had held it <hi>jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino.</hi>

And that either these are none of his words, or that they were written before he was a formed Protestant, or that he intended only the Roman Patriarchate, is most evident from his later and undoubted writings, wherein he doth utterly and constantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Papall universall Monarchy of the Roman Bishop.<note place="margin">A mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy might prove use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, what <hi>Melancthon</hi> faith, is only in point of prudence or discretion, [<hi>he thinks no wise man ought to dislike it.</hi>] We are not so stupid as not to see but that some
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65027:194"/>
good use might be made of an <hi>exordium uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis Ecclesiasticae,</hi> especially at this time when the Civill Power is so much divided and distracted. But the quere is even in point of prudence, whether more good or hurt might proceed from it. We have been taught by experience to fear three dangers, First, when we give an Inch, they are apt to take an Ell, Tyrants are not often born with their teeth, as <hi>Richard</hi> the the third was, but grow up to their excesse in processe of time. Secondly, when we give a free Alms, (as Peterpence were of old) they streight-way interpret it to be a tribute and duty. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what we give by humane right, they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge by Divine Right to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And so will not leave us free to move our rudder according to the variable face of the Heavens, and the vicissitude of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>

For Faith, her rule was, that the Doctrines which had been inherited from their forefathers as the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Christ and his Apostles, were solely to be acknowledged for obligatory, and nothing in them to be changed. For Governement, her principle was, that Christ had made S. Peter first, or chiefe, or Prince of his Apostles, who was to be the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver under him in the Churth after his departure
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65027:197"/>
out of this world, and that the Bishops of Rome as successeours of S. Peter inherited from him this priviledge, &amp;c.</hi> A little after he acknowledgeth that <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he first principle includeth the truth of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And that there is this manifest evidence for it, that still the latter age could not be ignorant of what the former believed, and that as long as it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to that method, nothing could be altered in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we come to his applicarion of this to the Church of England, or his inference from hence in favour of the Church of Rome, it will not be amisse to examine his two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and shew what truth there is in them, and how falshood is hidden under the vizard of truth. In the first place, I desire the Reader to observe with what subtlety this case is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the Church of England agreed <hi>with the Church of Rome &amp; all the rest of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> And again, that <hi>the Bishop of Rome exercised this power in all those Countries which kept commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church of Rome.</hi> So seeking to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon us the Church of Rome with its dependents for the Catholick Church. We owe respect to the Church of Rome as an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Church, but we owe not that conformity &amp; subjection to it, which we owe to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of Christ. Before this pretened seperation, the Court of Rome by their teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious censures had excluded two third parts of the Catholick Church from their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and thereby had made themselves Schismaticall. The world is greater then the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65027:198"/>
City, all these Christian Churches which are excommunicated by the Court of Rome, onely because they would never (no more then their Ancestours) acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves subjects to the Bishop of Rome, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Doctrine of saving Faith from their forefathers, as the Legacy of Christ and his Apostles, and have been as faithfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positaries of it as they. And their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what this Legacy was, is as much to be regarded as the Testimony of the Church of Rome, and so much more, by how much they are a greater part of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I observe how he makes two principles, the one in doctrine, the other in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; though he confess that the truth of the latter is included in the former, and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its evidence from it; onely that he might gaine themoreopportunity to shuffle the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter usurpations of the Popes into the ancient discipline of the Church; and make these up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start novelties to be a part of that ancient Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per paucio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>; It is in vaine to make two rules, where oue will serve the turne. I do readily admit both his first and his second rule reduced into one, in this subsequent forme: That those doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and that discipline which we inherited from our forefathers, as the Legacy of Christ and his Apostles, ought solely to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65027:198"/>
for obligatory, and nothing in them to be changed, that is substantiall or essential.</p>
               <p>So the Church of England maintaines this rule now as well as they. The question onely is, who have changed that Doctrine or this Discipline, we or they? we by substraction, or they by addition? The case is clear, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles contracted this Doctrine into a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, that is, the Creed; the primitive Fathers expounded it where it did stand in need of clearer explication. The Generall Councell of Ephesus did forbid all men to exact any more of a Christian at his baptismal profession. Into this Faith were we baptized, unto this Faith do we adhere; whereas they have changed &amp; enlarged their Creed by the addition of new Articles, as is to be seen in the new Creed or Confession of Faith made by Pius the fourth: so for Doctrine. Then for discipline, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and avow that discipline which the whole Christian world practised for the first six hundred years, &amp; all the Eastern, Sowthern and Northern Churches untill this day. They have changed the beginning of unity into an universality of Jurisdiction, and Soveraignty of power above General Councels, which the Christian world for the first six hundred years did never know, nor the greatest part of it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acknowledge until this day. Let S. Peter be the first, or chiefe, or in a right sense the Prince of the Apostles, or the first mover in the Church, all this extends but to a primacy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65027:199"/>
of order, the Soveraignty of Ecclesiasticall power was in the Apostolicall Colledge, to which a generall Councell now succeedeth. It is evident enough whether they or we doe hold our selves better to the legacy of Christ and his Apostles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he addeth, that <hi>The Bishops of Rome as successours of S. Peter inherited his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and actually excercised this power in all those countries which kept Communion with the Church of Rome, that very year wherein this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy separation began</hi>; as it commeth much short of the truth in one respect, for the Popes exercised much more power in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which gave them leave, then ever S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pretended unto; so it is much more short of that Universall Monarchy which the Pope did then, and doth still claime. For, as I have already said, two third parts of the Christian world were not at that time of his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but excommunicated by him, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not submit their necks to his yoke. And those other Countries which yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more obedience to him, or were not so well able to contest against him, yet when they were overmuch pinched, and his oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and usurpations did grow intolerable, did oppose him, and make themselves the last jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their own liberties and grievancies, and of the limits of Papall authority, and set bounds unto it, as I have demonstrated in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>indication. So whereas this refuter doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65027:199"/>
to state the case clearly, he commeth not neer the true question at all, which is not, whether the Bishop of Rome had any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Catholick Church; he had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his Diocesse as a Bishop; in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince as a Metropolitan; in his Patriarchate, as the chief of the five Protopatriarchs; and all over, as the Bishop of an Apostolicall Church, or successour of S. Peter. But the true questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what are the right limits and bounds of his authority? whether he have a legi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lative power over all Christians? whether the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage aud disposition of all Churches doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him? whether he may convocate Synods, and exercise Jurisdiction, and sell palles, pardons and indulgences, and send Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and set up Legantine Courts, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose pensions at his pleasure, in all kingdomes without consent of Soveraigne Princes, and call all Ecclesiasticall causes to Rome, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict whole nations, and infringe their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and customes, and excommunicate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and deprive them of their Realms, and absolve their subjects from their allegiance? Let these pretended branches of Papall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be lopped off, and all things restored to the primitiye forme, and then the Papacy will be no more like that <hi>insana Laurus,</hi> the cause of contention or division in all places. In the mean time, if they want that respect which is due unto them, they may blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seves, who will not accept what is their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65027:200"/>
just right, unlesse they may have more.</p>
               <p>Fourthly 'that which followes is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, that <hi>it was and is the constant beliefe of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thelick world, that these principles are Christs owne ordination recorded in Scripture.</hi> What? that S. Peter had any power over his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Apostles? or that the Bishop of Rome, succeeds him in that power? It doth not appear out of the holy text that S. Peter was at Rome, except we understand Rome by the name of Babylon. If it be <hi>Christs own ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nation</hi> recorded in the; scriptures, that S. Peter should have all these priviledges, and the Bishop of Rome inherit themashis successour, thenthe great generall Councel of Chalcedon was much to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to give equal prviledges to the Patriarch of Constantinople, with the Patriarch of Rome, and to esteem the Imperial City more then the ordination of Christ. Then the whole Catholick Church was much to be blamed, to receive such an unjust coustirution not approved by the then Bishop of Rome. Lastly, this is so farre from the constant belief of the Catholick world, that it is not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Roman Church it self at this day. The greatest defenders of the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy dare not say that the Bishop of Rome succedeth S. Peter <hi>by Christs owne ordination,</hi> but onely by S. Peters dying Bishop of Rome. They acknowledge that S. Peter might have dyed Bishop of Antioch, and then they say the Bishop of Antioch had succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65027:200"/>
him, or he might have died Bishop of no place, and then the Papacy had been in the disposition of the Catholick Church, though he died at Rome, as without doubt it is, and may be contracted, or enlarged, or translated from one See to another, for the advantage of Christian Religion. His <hi>manifest evidence</hi> which he stileth <hi>so ample a memory and successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is stronger then the stock of humane govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and action</hi>; That is, <hi>that still the latter age could not be ignorant of what the former believed, and as long as it adhered to that method, nothing could be altered in it,</hi> is so far from a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it scarcely deserveth the name of a Topicall argument. For as an universall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted tradition of the whole Christian world of all ages united, is a convinclng and undeniable evidence, (such a tradition is the Apostles Creed comprehending in it all the necessary points of saving Faith, repeated daily in our Churches, every Christian stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up at it, both to expresse his assent unto it, and readinesse to maintaine it, professed by every Christian at his Baptisme, either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally when he is of age sufficient, or by his sureties, when he is an infant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the tradition of the universall Church of this age a proof not to be opposed nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by us.) So the tradition of some particular persons, or some particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in particular points or opinions of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour nature, which are neither so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65027:201"/>
to be knowne, nor so firmely beleeved, nor, so publiquely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d universally professed nor derived downwards from the Apostolicalages by such uninterrupted succession, doth produce no such certainty either of evidence or adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. When the Christian world is either not united, or divided about particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or inferiour points of faith, it proveth most probably that there was no Apostolical tradition at first, but that particular persons or places have assumed their respective opinions in succeeding ages. Or otherwise there is a fault in the conduit-pipe, or an errour and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the derivatton of the tradition. And both these do take much away from assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, more or less according to the degree of the opposition. In such questionable and controverted points as these, which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so universally received, nor so publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professed, his assertion is groundless and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, that <hi>the latter age cannot be ignorant what the former believed.</hi> Yes, in such contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted points this present age may not know, yea, doth not know what it self beleeveth, or rather opiniateth, untill it come to be voted in a Synod. The most current opinions in the Schoos are not alwaies the most generaly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church, &amp; those which are most pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sible in one place, are often hissed out of another. And though it were possible for a man to know what opinion is universally most current, yet how shall he know that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65027:201"/>
greater part is the sounder part? or if he did how shall he know that what he beleeveth in such points is more then an indifferent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or that it was deposited by the Apostles with the Church, and delivered from age to age by an uninterrupted succession? No waies, but by universall tradition of the Christian world united, either written or unwritten: but this is all the evibence which they can expect, who confound universall tradition with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tradition, the Roman Church with the Catholick Church, the Christian world uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Christian world divided, and Scholasticall opinions with Articles of Faith.</p>
               <p>Yet from these two principles he maketh two inferences, the one against the Church of England, that since the reformation <hi>neither the former rule of unity of Faith, nor the second of unity of governement have had any power in the English Church.</hi> Whilest he himself knoweth no better what we beleeve, who live in the same age, how doth he presume, that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age cannot be ignorant of what the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer beleeved? I have shewed him already how we do willingly admit this principle, wherein both his rules are comprehended, that the doctrines and discipline inherited from our Forefathers as the legacies of Christ and his Apostles, are solely to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for obligatory, and nothing in them to be changed. This is as much as any person disinteressed can or will require. And upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65027:202"/>
this principle we are willing to proceed to a triall with them. There is a fallacy in Logick, called <hi>of more interrogations then one,</hi> that is, when severall questions of different natures, to which one uniforme answer cannot be given, yea, or no, are mixed &amp; confounded together. So he doth not onely set down this second rule concerning governement ambiguously, that a man cannot tell whether he make S. Peter onely an head of order among the Apostles, or an head of single power and Jurisdiction also over the Apostles, but also he shuffles the Bishop of Rome into S. Peters place <hi>by Christs own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> and confounds S. Peters <hi>Ex o dium V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis</hi> with the usurped power of Popes, as it was actually exercised by them in latter ages.</p>
               <p>His second inference is in favour of the Church of Rome, that <hi>the Roman Church with those Churches which continue in communion with it, are the onely Churches which have true doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine in vertue of the first principle above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the right governement in virtue of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and consequently are the entire Catholick or Vniversall Church of Christians, all others by misbelief or Schisme being excluded.</hi> Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is ready, that the Church of Rome, or the Court of Rome have sophisticated the true doctrine of Faith by their supplementall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and erroneous additions, contrary to the first principle, and have introduced into the Church a tyrannical and unlawfull govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contrary to the second principle, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65027:202"/>
are so far from being the entire Catholick Church, that by them both, they are convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have made themselves guilty of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio n and Schisme.</p>
               <p>And lastly, where he saith, that <hi>my onely way to clear our Church from Schisme, is either by disproving the former to be the necessary rule of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Faith; or the latter the necessary bond of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,</hi> he is doubly mistaken.

               <p>So his Prologue is ended, now we come to his animadversions upon my arguments. My first ground was, because not Protestants, but Roman Catholicks themselves did make the first separation. To which his first answer is,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65027:203"/>
                  <hi>If it were so, how doth that acquit us since conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in a breach of this nature is as culpable as the beginning?</hi> Many waies. First, it is a violent presumption of their guilt and our innocence, when their best friends and best able to judge, who preached for them, and writ for them, who acted for them, and suffered for them, who in all other things were great ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of the Roman Religion, and persecuted the poor Protestants with fire and Fagot, did yet condemn th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, and justify this separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, though it doth not alwaies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse <hi>a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>to,</hi> from all guilt and punishment, to be misled by others into errour, <hi>If the blind llead the blind, both fall into the ditch,</hi> yet it doth alwaies excuse <hi>a tanto,</hi> it lesseneth the sin, and extenuateth the guilt. Persons misled by the example and authority of others are not so cuipable as the first authors and ringleaders in Schisme. If this separation be an Errour in Protestants, the Roman Catholicks do owe an account to God both for themselves and us, did they find cause to turne the Pope out of England, as an intruder and usurper, and could Protestants, who had no relation to Rome, imagine that it was their duties to bring him in again?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in this case it doth acquit us not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>a tanto,</hi> but <hi>a toto,</hi> not onely from such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of guilt but from all criminus Schisme, so longas we seek carefuly after truth, and do not violate the dictates of our Consciences. If he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65027:203"/>
will not believe me let himbeleeve S. Austin. <hi>He that defends not his false opinion with pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious animosity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 161.</note> 
                  <hi>having not invented it himself, but learned it from his erring parents, if he enquire carefully after the truth, and be ready to embrace it, and to correct his errours when he finds them, he is not to be reputed an hereticke.</hi> If this be true in the case of heresy, it is more true in the case of Schisme. Thus if it had been a crime in them, yer it is none in us; but in truth it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime in them, nor us, but a just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he answereth, that <hi>it is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof that they were no Protestants, because they persecuted Protestants. For Protestants perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Protestants; Lutherans, Calvinists; Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Puritans; and Beownists persecute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> VVhat then were VVarham and Heath, aud Thureleby, Tunscall, and Stokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Gardiner, and Bonner, &amp;c. all Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants? did Protestants enjoy Arch-Bishopricks and Bishopricks i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thus much whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest they were living, they would have been very angry with him. Yet at the least if they were Protestants, let him tell me which of these Sects they were of, Lutheran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. But he telleth us, that <hi>the reouncing of the Pope is the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65027:204"/>
most essentiall part of our reformation, and so they had in them the quintessence of a Protestant.</hi> He is mistaken. This part of the reformation was done to our hands; it was their reformation, not ours. But if he will needs have the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Churches of England and Ireland to have been all Protestants in Henry the eighths daies, onely for renouncing the Popes absolute universall Monarchy, I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, we shall not lose by the bargain. Then the Primitive Church were all Protestants, then all the Grecian, Russian, Armenian, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byssen Christians are Protestants at this day, then we want not store of Protestants even in the besome of the Roman Church it self.</p>

and impudence doth rest, between him and me. I acknowledge this was the Title of my fourth Chapter, that <hi>the King and Kingdom of England in the separation from Rome, did make no now law, but vindicate their ancient Liberties.</hi> It seemeth he confureth the Titles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking into the Chapters: did I say, they made no new statutes? No, I cited all the new statutes which they did make, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly this very statute which he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth here. Yet I said, they made no new law, because it was the law of the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that statute was made. The Customs and liberties of England are the ancient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of the land; when soever these were infringed, or an attempt made to destroy them, (as the liberties of the Crowne and Church of England had then been invaded by the Pope) it was the manner to restore them, or to declare them by a statute, which was not operative to make or create new law, but declarative to manifest or to restore ancient law. This I told him expressely in the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,<note place="margin">

This appeareth undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the statute it self. That <hi>England is an Empire, and that the King as head of the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke consisting of the spirituality and temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hath plenary power to render finall Iustice for

               <p>He demandeth first, <hi>were not those bawes in force in the beginning of Henry the eighths raign</hi>?

Lastly, he enquireth <hi>whether there be not equivolent laws to these in France, Spaine, Germany, and Italy it self, and yet they are Catholicks, and hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Pope</hi>?

               <p>The scope of my fifth Chapter was to shew that the Britannique Churches (that is, the Churches of the Britannique Ilands) were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exempted from Forreigne Jurisdiction for the first six hundred years, and so ought to continue. His first exception to this is, <hi>How the Britannique priviledges do belong to us? Have we any Title from the Britannique Churches, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then by the Saxon Christians, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were our Ancestors? &amp;c.</hi> Yes, well enough. First VVales and Cornwall have not onely a locall, but a personall succession. No man can doubt of their right to the priviledges of the Britannique Churches. Secondly, there is the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65027:207"/>
same reason for the Scots and Picts, who were no more subjected to Forreign Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then the Britons themselves. All these put together, Britons, Scots and Picts, did pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess about two third parts of the Britannique Ilands after the Saxon Conquests were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated. Thirdly among the Saxons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the great kingdomes of Mercia and North umberland were converted by the ancient Scots, and had their Religion &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination first from them, afterwards among themselves, without any forreign dependance, and so were as free as either Britons or Scots, and ought to continue so. Fourthly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the rest of England a world of British Christians after the Conquest did still live mixed with the Saxons, such as they had no need to fear, such as might be serviceable to them, as it commonly falle h out in all Conquests, otherwise the Saxons had not been able to people the sixth part of the Land. Who can deny these poor conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Christians, and their Christian posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though mixed with Saxons, the just pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of their Ancestours. Lastly, the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conquest gave unto them as good Title to the priviledges, as to the lands of the Brittons, so soon as they were capable of them. And so at their first conversion they were free, and continued free, &amp; further then themselvs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to consent ought to continue free for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly he objecteth that this <hi>pretended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65027:208"/>
execution of the British Churches is false.</hi> For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>is more evident in History, then that the British Churches admitted appellation to Rome at the Councell of Sardica.</hi> Before he can alledge the authority of the Councell of Sardica, he must renounce his divine institution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. For that Canon submitteth it to the good pleasure of the Fathers; and groundeth it upon the memory of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> not the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ. Further, how doth it appear, that the Brittish Bishops did assent to that Canon? This is meerly presumption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proofe. The Councell of Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca was no generall Councell after all the Eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne Bishops were departed, as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of that Canon. Neither were the Canons of the Councell of Sardica ever received in England, or incorporated into the English laws, and without such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation they did not bind English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Lastly, this Canon is contradicted by the great generall councell of Chalcidon, which our Church receiveth. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not the least footstep of any Papal Jurisdiction exercised in England by Eluthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ns, but the contrary, for he referred the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative part to king Leucius, and the British Bishops. And if Pope Coelestin had sent S. Germain into Britain, to free the Brittains from Pelagianisme, or converted some of the Scots by Paladius, as we have very little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe either the one or the other, yet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65027:208"/>
it maketh nothing at all for the exercise of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papall Jurisdiction in Britain, Preaching and Converting, &amp; Baptizing, &amp; Ordaining, are acts of the key of order, not of Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>But (saith he) <hi>that which is mainly to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is, that since this priviledge</hi> (he meaneth the Supremacy) <hi>descends upon the Pope as suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour to S. Peter, how far it was executed may be unknowne, but, that it was due, none can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi> Words are but wind, when they are utterly destitute of all manner of proofe. We acknowledge the Pope to be successour of S. Peter, and (if he do not forfeit it by his own fault) we are ready to pay him such respect as is due to the Bishop of an Apostolical Church; but for any spiritual Monarchy, or Universal Jurisdiction, we know no manner of Title that he hath. His pretence is more from <hi>Phocas</hi> the Usurper, then from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And here though I know not this hereditary priviledge of the Pope descended from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (there is no knowledge of that which hath no being) and the burthen of proving it lyes upon him; yet he taxeth me for <hi>leaving it, and spending my time about the Popes Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal power.</hi> I observe how ready they are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65027:209"/>
all to decline all manner of discourse concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Popes Patriarchal power; And yet for a long time, it was the fairest flower in their Garland, I know not what is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but we may well conjecture, because they find that their spiritual Monarchy, and this Patriarchal dignity, are inconsistent the one with the other, in the same subject. They might as well make a King to be a Sheriffe of a Shiere, or a President of a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince within his own Kingdom, as make a spiritual Monarch to be a Patriarch. And yet a Patriarch he was, and so alwayes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be, and they cannot deny it.</p>

               <p>In my sixth Chapter, I proved three things: First, that the King and Church of <hi>England,</hi> had sufficient authority, to withdraw their obedience from the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they had just grounds to do it. And thirdly, that they did it with due moderation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65027:211"/>Concerning the first point, he chargeth me the second time, for insisting upon a wrong Plea; that is, their Patriarchal Authority, which he confesseth to be humane and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I have formerly intimated, why they are so loath to entertaine any discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes Patriarchate: because they know not how to reconcile a Monarchy of divine institution, with an Aristocracy of humane Institution. When I first undertook this subject, I conceived, that the great strength of the Roman <hi>Sampson</hi> did lye in his Patriarchate; But since this Refuter quitteth it, as the Pope himself hath done, not for six hundred years onely, (he speaks too sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) but for a thousand years, ever since <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> made <hi>Boniface</hi> universal Bishop, I am well contented to give over that subject, upon these two conditions; First, that he do not presume that the Pope is a spiritual Monarch, without proving it. Secondly, that he do not attempt to make Patriarchal Priviledges to be Royal Prerogatives.</p>
               <p>Yet he will not leave this humane Right before we have resolved him three questions. <hi>First,</hi> (saith he) <hi>suppose the Christian world had chosen to themselves one head for the preservation of unity in Religion; What wrongs must that head do, to be sufficient grounds, both for the deposition of the person, and abolition of the Government</hi>? Nay, put the case right, Suppose the Christian World should chuse one for order sake, to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65027:211"/>
their President, or Prolocuter in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly, and he should endeavour to make himself their Prince, upon some fained Title, Did not he deserve to be turned out of his employment, &amp; if they found it expedient to have another chosen in his place?</p>
               <p>Secondly, He supposeth, that <hi>this alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be made by some one party of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Commonwealth, which must separate it self from the communion of the rest of Christianity; Ought not far weightier causes then these to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi>? One mistake begets another, as one circle in the water doth produce another<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> We have made no such separation from any just Authority, instituted by the Catholick Church: We nourish a more Catholick Communion then themselves. But if our Steward will forsake us, because we will not give him leave to become our Master, who can help it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He supposeth, that <hi>by setting aside this Supreme Head, eternal dissentions will inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow in the whole Church of Christ</hi>; and then demandeth, <hi>Whether the refusal to comply with the humours of a lustful Prince, be ground enough to renounce so necessary an Authority</hi>? How should the refusal to comply be any such ground? Certainly he means, <hi>the compliance with the humors of a lustful Prince.</hi> I pass by the extravagancy of the expression. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they have said, or can say concerning <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, so far as it may reflect upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65027:212"/>
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is cleared in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to <hi>R.C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, He begs the question, Christ never instituted the Apostles, never constituted the Catholicke Church, never acknowledged any such Supreme Head of Power and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Church and Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> had more lawful, just and noble grounds for their separation from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> then any base parasitical compliance with the humours of any Prince whatsoever, as he cannot chuse but see in this very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But who is so blind as he that will not see?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We do confess, that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Papacy, that is, an <hi>Exordium unitatis,</hi> a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of unity; was an excellent meanes of Concord. We do not envy the Bishop of <hi>Rome, or any</hi> Honour which the Catholick Church did allow him; But moderne Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which they seek to obtrude upon us, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as <hi>Nilus</hi> saith) the cause of all dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and Controversies of the Christian World.</p>
               <p>Lastly, To his demand concerning the <hi>English</hi> Court and Church, Whether <hi>I would condescend to the rejection of Monarchy, and to the extirpation of Episcopacy; for the misgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Princes, or abuses of Prelats</hi>? I answer, No; But this will not advantage his cause at all, for three Reasons;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65027:212"/>
First, never were any such abuses as these objected, either to Princes or Prelates in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we seek not the extirpation of the Papacy, but the reduction of it to the primitive constitution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Monarchy and Episcopacie are of divine institution, so is not a papall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of Jurisdiction. His parliamentary Prelacie hath more sound then weight. We need not be beholden to Parliament for the Justification of our Prelacie, as he will finde that undertakes it.</p>

               <p>We are now come to the grounds of our separation from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Reader, observe and wonder! All this while they have been calling to us for our grounds: they have declaimed, that there can be no just grounds of such a separation. They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Hypothesis, that we had no grounds, but to comply with the Humours of a lustful Prince. Now we present our grounds being reduced to five Heads.</p>
               <p>First, The most intolerable extortions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, committed from age to age without hope of Remedy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their most unjust usurpations of all Rights, Civil, Ecclesiastical, sacred and prophane of all orders of men, Kings, Nobles, Bishops, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65027:213"/>Thirdly, the malignant influence, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this forreign jurisdiction, destructive to the right ends of Ecclesiastical Discipline, producing dis-union in the Realm, factions &amp; animosities between the Crown and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, intestine discord between the King and his Barons, bad intelligence with neighbour Princes, and forreign wars.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a list of other inconveniences, or rather mischiefs that did flow from thence: as to be daily subject to have new Articles of faith obtruded upon them, exposed to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest perill of Idolatry, to forsake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of three parts of Christendome, to approve the Popes rebellion against gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councels, and to have their Bishops take an Oath contrary to their oath of Allegeance, to maintaine the Pope in his rebellious usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The weakness of the Popes preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the exemption of the Brittannique Church from forreign jurisdiction by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the General Councel of <hi>Ephesus</hi>: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he ought to have shewed, either that these grounds conjoyned were not sufficient, or that they were not true, or that there were other remedies; But he is well contented to pass by them all in silence, which is as mueh as yeeld the Cause.</p>
               <p>Thus he, <hi>It is then of little concernment to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether his complaints be true or false, since he does not shew there was no other remedy but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65027:213"/>
division</hi>? What? is it of little concernment to examine whether the grounds be sufficient or no? It belongs not to me to shew that there was no other remedy, that is, to prove a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; but if he will answer my grounds, it belongs to him to shew that there was other remedy; yet so far as a negative is capable of proof, I have shewed even in this Chapter, that there was no other remedy: I shewed that the Pope and his Court were not under the Jurisdiction of the King or Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> so as to call them to a personal account, I shewed that the English Nation had made their addresses to the Pope, in Councel, out of Councel, for ease from their oppressions, in diversages, and never found any but what they carved out to themselves at home after this manner. He adds, <hi>And much more since it is known, if the authority be of Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no just cause can possibly be given for its abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment.</hi> This is a very euthumematical kinde of arguing, If the sky fall, we shall have larks. He knows right well, that it is his assumption which is latent, that we deny, that we have abolished any thing which either Christ or his Church did institute.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth, <hi>But most, because all other Catholick Countries might have made the same exception which</hi> England <hi>pretends; yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine still in communion with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and after we have broke the Ice, do not hold it reasonable to follow our example.</hi> Few or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65027:214"/>
no Catholick Countries have sustained so great oppression from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>England</hi> hath, which the Pope himself called his Garden of delight, a Well that could not be drawn dry. All other Countries have not right to the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Priviledge to be exempt from forreign jurisdiction, as <hi>Brittaine</hi> hath. Yet all other Catholick Countries, do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their owne Priviledges inviolated, and make themselves the last Judge of their grievances from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholick Countries know how to make better use of the Papacy then <hi>England</hi> doth; yet <hi>England</hi> is not alone in the separation, so long as all the Easterne, Southerne, Northern, and so great a part of the Westerne Churches have separated themselves from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are separated by them from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as we; yet if it were otherwise, we must live by precepts, not by examples.</p>
               <p>Nay, (saith he) <hi>The former ages of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey had the same cause to cast the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy out of the Land: yet rather preferred to continue in the peace of the Church, then attempt so destructive an innovation,</hi> Mistake not us so much, we desire to live in the peaceable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholick Church, as well as our Ancestors, at far as the <hi>Roman</hi> Court will give us leave: neither were our Ancestors so stupid to see themselves so fleeced and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, and abused by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65027:214"/>
to sit still in the mean time, and blow their noses. They did by their lawes exclude the Popes supremacy out of England, so farre as they judged it necessary for the tranquility of the Kingdome, that is, his patronage of Churches, his Legates and Legantine Courts, his buls and sentences, and excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his legislative power, his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive appeals, except onely in cases where the Kingdome did give consent. They threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him further to make a <hi>wall of separation</hi> between him and them. We have more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience then our Ancestours had, that their remedies were not Soveraigne or sufficient enough; that if we give him leave to thrust in his head, he will never rest untill he have drawne in all his body after, whilest there are no bonds to hold him but nationall lawes.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he pleads that <hi>the pretences on which the English Schism was originally made, were farre different from those which I now take up to defend it.</hi> What inward motives or impulsives our Reformers had to separate from the Court of Rome, God knoweth, not I, that concerneth themselves not me. But that there were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds of separation, I demonstrate, that concerneth the cause, that concerneth me. Their inanimadvertence might make the separation lesse Justifiable to them, but no lesse lawfull in it self, or to us. These causes are as just grounds to us, now to continue the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65027:215"/>
separation, as they could have bin to them, then if they had been observed, to make the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and most certainly they were then observed, or the greatest part of them, as the liberty of the English Church, the weakness of the Popes pretences, the extortions of the Court of Rome, their gross usurpation of all mens rights, and the inconsistency of such a forreigne discipline with the right ends of Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction. These things he ought to have answered in particular, if he would have said any thing at all, but it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he chose rather to follow the counsell of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to his Uncle, when he found him busie about his accounts, that he should study rather how to give no account.</p>

                     </gap>cquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis.</hi> The saddest Subjects were very pleasant Topicks to <hi>Democritus.</hi> The first part of our moderation was this, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not to other Churches, the true being of Churches, nor possibility of Salvation, nor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Churches, but from their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall errours, and this I shewed to have been S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> moderation whereby he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himselfe and his party from Schisme, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem judicantis, &amp;c. judging no man, removing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65027:215"/>
no man from our Communion, for difference in opinion. This is,</hi> saith <hi>he, to declare men Idolaters, and wicked, and neverthelesse to communicate with them, reconciling thus, light to darkenesse, and making Christ and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist to be of the same Society.</hi> I spake of our forbearing to censure other Churches, and he answers of communicating with them. That is one aberration from the purpose. But I may give him more advantage then that in this case. It is one thing to communicate with materiall Idolaters, Hereticks, or Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in their Idolatry, Heresy, or Schisme, which is altogether unlawfull: and it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to communicate with them in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offices, and religious duties, which may in some cases be very lawfull. The orthodox Christians did sometimes communicate with the Hereticall Arreans. And the primitive Catholicks with the Schismaticall novations, in the same publick divine offices, as I have formerly shewed in this treatise. But they communicated with them in nothing that did favour the Heresie of the one, or the Schisme of the other. The Catholicks called the Donatists their brethren, and professed that they were obliged to call them brethren, as we read in <hi>Optatus.</hi> But the Donatists would not vouchsafe to acknowledge the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks for their brethren, upon this refuters principles, that <hi>a man cannot say his owne Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is true, but he must say the opposite is false, nor
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65027:216"/>
hold his owne certain, without censuring another mans.</hi> Yet it was not the Catholicks, but the Donatists that did mingle light and darkness together. These following princlples, are so evident and so undeniable, that no man can question the truth of them, without questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his owne judgement. That particular Churches may fall into errours. 2. That all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are not essentials, or fundamentals, 3. That those errours which are not in essentials do not destroy the true being of a Church, 4. That neverthelesse every one is bound accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the just extent of his power, to free himself from them. To dote so upon the body as to cherish the Ulcers, and out of hatred to the Ulcers to destroy the being of the body, are both extreams. That is, so to dote upon the name of the Church as to cherish the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of it, or to hate the errours so much as to deny the being of the Church</p>
               <p>Preposterous zeal which is like Hell, hot without light, maketh errours to be essentials, and different opinious different Religions,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.</note> because it will not distinguish between the good foundation which is Christ, and the hay and stubble that is builded thereupon.</p>
               <p>The second proofe of our moderation is our inward Charity; we leave them unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, as a man would leave his fathers or his brothers house infected with the Plague, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to returne so soone as it is cleansed. His answer is, that <hi>if we did manifest it by our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65027:216"/>
works, they might have occasion to believe it.</hi> I did prove it by our externall works, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our daily prayers for them in our Letany, and especially our solemn aniversary prayer for their conversion every good Friday, though we are not ignorant how they do as solemnly anathematise us the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
               <p>The third proof of our moderation was this, that we do not challenge a new Church, a new Religion, or new holy orders; we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude no innovation upon others, nor desire to have any obtruded upon our selves; we pluck up the weeds, but retaine all the plants of saving truth. To this he objects two things:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>to take away goodnesse is the greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> and <hi>nothing is more mischievous then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate good lawes and good practises.</hi> This is not to fight with us, but with his owne sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: I speake of taking away errours, and he speaketh against taking away goodnesse: I speak of plucking up weeds, and he speaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst abrogating good lawes and practises, yea, <hi>of taking away the new Testament.</hi> Where is the contradiction between us? These are no weeds but good plants. We retain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the primitive Fathers judged to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or the Catholick Church of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age doth unanimously retaine, which is sufficient. We retaine other opinions also and practises, but not as necessary Articles
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65027:217"/>
or Essentials. Let him not tell us of the Scots reformation, who have no better an opinion of it then it deservs.</p>
               <p>His second Ojection is, <hi>that he who positively denies, over addes the contrary to what he takes away, he that makes it an article that there is no Purgatory, no Masse, no prayer to Saints, has as many Articles as he who holds the contrary. Therefore this kind of moderation is a pure folly.</hi> It may be he thinketh so in earnest, but we know the contrary. We do not hold our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives to be Articles of Faith. How should a negative, that is, a <hi>non em,</hi> be a fundamentall? This is a true proposition, ether there is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, or there is not a purgatory. But this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a fals proposition; either it is an Article of Faith that there is a purgatory, or it is an article of Faith, that there is no purgatory. Faith is a certain assent grounded upon the truth and authority of the revealer, opinion is an uncertain inclining of the mind more to the one part of the contradiction then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There are an hundred contradictions in Theologicall opinions between the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists themselves, much grearer then some of these three controversies, wherin he instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth. Yet they dare not say, that either the affirmatives or negatives are articles of Faith.</p>
               <p>In things not necessary a man may fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate safely between two opinions indifferently, or incline to the one more then the other without certain adherence, or adhere cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65027:217"/>
without Faith. We know no other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Articles of Faith, but those which are comprehended in the Apostles creed.</p>
               <p>The last proof of our moderation was our readinesse in the preparation of our minds to beleeve and practise whatsoever the Catholick Church, even of this present age doth universally believe and practise. <hi>This</hi> he saith <hi>is the greatest mock foole proposition of all the rest.</hi> Wherefore? For two reasons. First <hi>we say there is no universall Church.</hi> Then we have not onely renounced our Creed, that is, the badge of our Christianity, whereof this is an expresse Article, but our reason also. If there be many particular churches: wherefore not one universall Church, whereof Christ himselfe is head and king? His onely ground of this calumny, is because we will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Roman Church, that is, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church to be the universall Church.</p>
               <p>The second reason is because we say <hi>if there be a Catholick Church, it is indetermined, that is, no man knows which it is.</hi> Then it is all one as if it were not. <hi>Non existentis &amp; non apparentis eadem est ratio.</hi> It is a brave thing to calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate boldly, that something may stick. We know no virtuall Church indeed, that is, one person who hath in himself eminently, and virtually as much certainty of truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of judgement, as the universall Church; but we acknowledge the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Church, that is, a generall councell, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65027:218"/>
the essentiall Church, that is, the multitude, or multitudes of believers, either of all ages which make the Symbolicall Church, or of this age which make the present Catholick Church; but <hi>mala mens, malus animus.</hi> He knoweth right well that they themselves are divided into five or six severall opinions what that Catholick Church is, into the authority whereof they make the last resolution of their Faith. So it is not true of us, but of themselves it is true, that their <hi>Catholick Church is indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,</hi> that is, they know not certainly what it is.</p>

               <head>Sect. 8.</head>
               <p>My fifth ground was, that what the king and Church of England did, in the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themselves from the Court of Rome, is no more then all other Princes and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of the Roman communion have done in effect, or pleaded for, that is, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the last Judges of their owne liberties and grievances. For proof whereof I instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Emperors, the Kings of France, and the liberties of the <hi>Sallicane</hi> Church, the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> in their Kingdomes and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of <hi>Sicily, Castile, Flanders,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Portugall,</hi> the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and in all these particular cases which were in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Popes and us, concerning the calling of Ecclesiasticall Synods, making of Ecclesiasticall lawes, disposing Benefices,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65027:218"/>
reforming the Churches within their owne dominions, rejecting the Popes sentences, buls, Legates, Nuncios, shutting up their Courts, forbidding appeals, taking away their tenths, first fruits, pensions, impositions, &amp;c. To all which neither <hi>R. C.</hi> nor <hi>S. W.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers one word in particular. Yet he paies me in generals. <hi>Vir dolofus versatur in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus.</hi> If his cause would have borne it, we had had a more particular answer.</p>
               <p>First he asketh <hi>what nonsense will not an ill cause bring a desperate man to? Concedo omnia.</hi> I grant all saving onely the application. He must seek for the nonsense, and the ill cause, and the desperate man nearer home. But what is the ground of his exception? nothing but a contradiction, first <hi>I would perswade the world that Papists are most injurious to Princes, perjudicing their Crowne, and subjecting their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions to the will of the Pope, and when I have scarce done saying so, with a contrary blast I drive as far back again, confessing all I said to be false, and that the same Papists hold the Doctrine of the Protestants in effect.</hi> If he will accuse other men of contradiction, he must not overshoot himself so in his expressions, but keep himself to the rules of opposition, <hi>ad idem, secundum idem, &amp; eodem tempore.</hi> Papists may be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Princes in one respect, and do them right in another. They may be disloyall at one time, and loyall at another. Here is no shadow of contradiction. But his greatest
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65027:219"/>
fault is to change the subject of the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I did not plead either that Papists were injurious to Princes, or that the same Papists did hold the very doctrine of the Protestants, nor so much as mention Papists in generall, either to justifie them or to accuse them. But I said, that the Pope and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had been injurious to Roman Catholick Princes, and that Roman Catholick Princes with their party had done themselves right against Popes and their Court. Here is no contrary blast, nor contradiction, any more then it is a contradiction to say, that the Gnelphes maintained the Popes cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Emperour, and the Gibilines main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Emperours cause against the Pope, because both factions were Roman Catholicks, both Italians.</p>
               <p>He urgeth, that <hi>the Popes did not cast out of their Communion those Cotholick divines who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them, which argueth, that it is not the Roman Religion, nor any publick tenet in their Church that binds any to these rigorous assertions which the protestants condemne.</hi> I know it is not their religion. Our Religion and theirs is the same. I know it is not the generall tenet of their Church. But it is the tenet of the Court of Rome, and the governing party amongst them. It is but a poor comfort to one that is oppressed by their Court, to know that there are particular Doctors which hold that he is wronged. But to his question. Did the Pope
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65027:219"/>
never excommunicate those Doctors that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him? Yes, sundry times, both Princes and Doctors, and whole Nations. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he spared them, perhaps he did not take notice of them whilest they were living, the Pope and his Court have somewhat else to do then to inquire after the tenets of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctors. perhaps they lived about the time of the councels of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile,</hi> when it had been easier for the Pope to have cast himselfe out of his throne, then them out of the Church; or perhaps they lived in places without his reach: he knows who it was that said, <hi>my Lord the Emperour</hi> defend me with the sword, and I will defend thee with my pen. What did the Sorban Doctours in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages value the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>? Now of late the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> have learned another method to purge their Doctours, when they displease them. It is a shrewd signe when men are glad to cut out the tongues of their owne witnesses.</p>
               <p>Here he fals into a bitter invective against our <hi>bloody lawes, and bloodier execution.</hi> It is hard when they come to accuse us of blood guiltiness, I could require him with a black list of murthers and Massacres to the purpose indeed: the Waldenses alone might furnish me with overmuch store of matter, whose first beginning is so ancient, that it seemeth to me like the Spring head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> scarcely to be searched out, but innocent blood crieth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65027:220"/>
lowde enough of it selfe, without help. I chuse rather at this time to use the buckler then the sword: the accusation of them is no acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of us; whatsoever he saith here against the Church or State of England for cruelty, is clearly and satisfactorily answered in my Reply to the Bishop of Chalcedon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> whither I refer him.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he telleth <hi>how unlucky I am in this Chapter, that do absolutely clear their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Calumny, which Protestants most injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously charge upon them, that their Vassalage to the Pope destroyes their subjection to their Prince, by citing so many instances, where Catholicks remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such, have disobeyed the Pope.</hi> Their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the same with ours, that is, Christian, and needeth not to be cleared from being a source of sedition, or an incentive to rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is not accused by us, but the envious man hath sowed tares among the wheate. No man can deny but that seditious opinions have been devised and dispersed and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this last age, which were destructive to Loyalty, and due subjection to Princes; and how some of our own countrey men came to be seasoned, with these pernicious principles more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations,<note place="margin">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65027:220"/>
urgeth them. They prove that those <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks at that time were loyal Subjects: they do not prove that all <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n from particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, or to argue <hi>àminore ad majus affirmativè,</hi> which is mere Sophistry. But I shall readily grant more then he proveth, and as much as he can seek with reason, that those sediti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us doctrines were never generally received, nor yet by the greater and sounder part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that at this day I hope they are almost buried. If ever God be so gracious unto us, as to suffer us to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Councel or Assembly, either of the Christian world, or of the Western Church; the first thing to be done were to weed out all seditious opinions, both among them and us, which are scandalous to Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to all civil societies.</p>
               <p>In the next place he fancieth to himself a platforme of the Christian Church. <hi>That Christ being to build his spiritual Kingdom upon the Basis of a multitude of earthly Kingdoms, saw it necessary, to make a bond of unity betwixt the Churches; that for this reason he gave the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality among his Apostles to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to his Successors the Bishops of</hi> Rome, <hi>which one See m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to all the Apostolical Sees. Hence</hi> Rome <hi>is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with the priviledge of Mother and Mistris of the Church, and the hinge upon which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon government and unity of the Church depends, which being removed the Church vanisheth into a pure Anarchy.</hi> Excellently well contrived. Sr. <hi>Thomas Moores Eutopia,</hi> or my Lord <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams</hi> new <hi>Atlantis</hi> may give place unto it: What great pitty it was that he had not been one of Christs Counsellers when he first formed his Church; Only it seemeth a little too saucy with Christ. Christians should argue thus, Christ formed his Church thus, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the best form: Not thus, this is the best forme; therefore Christ formed his Church after this manner.</p>

               <p>Now let us take his frame in pieces, and look upon it in parcels. St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up, not one but seven bands of unity among
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65027:221"/>
Christians, <hi>one body, one spirit, one hope of our calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>one God and father of all.</hi> First, <hi>one body,</hi> What can be more prodigious then for the members of the same body to warre one w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th another? <hi>One Spirit,</hi> that is, the Holy-Ghost, which is the soul that enliveth the Church; Can there be a better bond of unity to the body, then the soul? <hi>One hope of our Calling,</hi> we must be all friends in Heaven, Why do we bite and kick one another in the way thither? <hi>One Lord,</hi> by whose blood we are redeemed, Should they pursue one another as mortal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, who serve the same Lord? <hi>One faith</hi> delivered by the Apostles, do not adulterate it with new devises, to raise contentions. <hi>One Baptism,</hi> we are marked with the same cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscance, we use the same word, we fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Standard, why do we mistake one another for enemies? Lastly, <hi>One God and Father of all, who is above all</hi> by his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <hi>through all</hi> by his providence, and <hi>in all</hi> by the inhabitation of his grace; <hi>Above all</hi> as Father, <hi>through all</hi> as Son, <hi>in all</hi> as Holy-Ghost; for Christian to fight against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is to divide this one God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte him against himself. Among all these bands of unity, why did St. <hi>Paul</hi> forget (<hi>unus Papa</hi>) one Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or spiritual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. If there had been any such thing, here had been the proper place for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will not dispute with him about
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65027:222"/>
this, whether <hi>Christ did give St.</hi> Peter <hi>a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality among the Apostles,</hi> so he do not rob <hi>Paul</hi> to cloath <hi>Peter,</hi> but likew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se consent to me, that this was but a principality of order; and that the principality of power, did r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st in the Colledge of the Apostles there: and now in their Successors a General Councel, which is a sufficient band of unity, as I have formerly demonstrated. I wish this Refuter had expressed himself more clearly, whether he be for a beginning of order &amp; unity, or for a single head of Power &amp; Jurisdiction; for to me he seemeth to hover between two, as if he would gladly say more for the Pope if he could.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it followeth, <hi>and consequently to his Successors</hi>; I like the general proposition well enough, <hi>and consequently to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours.</hi> For the reason of the first instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being of perpetual necessity, seemeth to imply strongly, that such an headship of order ought to continue in the Church, or at least may lawfully be continued in the Church. But I like not his application <hi>to the Bishops of Rome,</hi> or his Successors in the See of <hi>Rome</hi>; That consequence is but like a Rope of sand. There is no necessity at all, that he who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth a man in a particular Bishoprick, should succeed him in a higher office, which is not annexed to that Bishoprick. As if a man should argue thus, Such a Bishop of such a See dyed Lord Chancellour of <hi>England</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all succeeding Bishops of the same See,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65027:222"/>
must succeed him likewise in the Chancellor ship of <hi>England.</hi> If the Catholick Church do nominate the Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Protestants do not attempt to make themselves a distinct body from the rest of the Christian world, much less do they arrogate to themselves alone the name of the true Church, as the <hi>Romanists</hi> do; but they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be part of the Catholick Church.

               <p>In the eighth chapter, I proved that the Pope and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were most guilty of the Schisme, and shall not need to repeat or fortifie any thing; that which he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth being of so little consequence.</p>
               <p>To the first argument, he denieth that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is but a sister or a mother, and not a Mistris to other Churches: It is their saying it, and our denying it (saith he) till they have proved what they affirme.</hi> To gratifie him, I will do it though it be needless. Let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his fourth Book of consideration, to his most loving friend <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Pope, so he stiles him, <hi>Amantissime Eugeni.</hi> If they would listen to St. <hi>Bernards</hi> honest advice, it would tend much to the peace of <hi>Christendome.</hi> Si auderem dicere, <hi>If I durst say it, these are the pastures of devils ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of sheep.</hi> And, Exi de Hur Caldeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, or, <hi>Go out of this Hur of the Caldeans,</hi> (Rome) <hi>It will not repent thee of thy banishment, to have changed the City for the world.</hi> But to satisfie his demand.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He denieth that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>obtrudeth any new Creeds,</hi> whereas I accused not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for it, but the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; for proof produced the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth in the point, as it is set down at the end of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>; wherein he sets forth a new form of confession of faith, containing many new Articles, which he enjoyneth all the Clergy, and all Religious persons to swear unto: and that they will teach it to all others under their charge, that there may be an uniforme confession of faith among Christians, <hi>Extra quam non est salus,</hi> without which there is no salvation; If he deny this authority, he and I are nearer an union then the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and he.</p>
               <p>My third argument was, because they maintaine the Pope in his rebellion against a general Councel. To this argument he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers not a word, so as I am confirmed more and more in my suspition, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his specious pretences for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, he himself is one of those, who prefer the Councel before the Pope, and attribute to the Pope only an <hi>Exordium unitatis.</hi> But he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65027:226"/>
spareth me not upon the by, telling the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>I lay the axe not to the roote of Schisme, but to mine own legs, &amp; bids me good night, my wits are in the dark.</hi> If it were so that I should steal a nap, it is neither fellony nor treason, <hi>Aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do bonus dormit at Homerus.</hi> But what is it that raiseth this great wind of words? forsooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I say, that (the Papacy) (<hi>qua talis</hi>) as it is now maintained by many, with Superiority above General Councels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the cause, either procteant, or conservant, or both, of all, or the most part of the Schisms in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome. <hi>To say as it is maintained by many, doth imply that it is not so maintained by all, and therefore not the Papacy</hi> qua talis; <hi>for so Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have not the least difference among them.</hi> He might as well tell us, that wherein they all agree, they have no difference. But do not some <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks subject the Pope to a General Councel? and other subject a General Councel to the Pope? Do not the greater part of them, both for number, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power, who sit at the sterne, who hold the bridle, (that he spoke of even now) in their hands, to govern the Church, subject a General Councel to the Pope? And then might not I say well [the Papacy <hi>qua talis</hi>] my conclusion was not against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in general; but against the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were guilty of Schism. And now to let him see that I did not sleep, I will reduce mine argument into
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65027:226"/>
forme, without a [<hi>qua talis.</hi>] They who subject a General Councel, which is the highest Tribunal of Christians to the Pope, are guilty of Schisme; but the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all their maintainers, that is, the much greater part of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, do subject a General Councel to the Pope; therefore they are guilty of Schism. Of the same nature is his exception to my fourth charge, They who take away the line of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical succession throughout the world, except in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> who make all Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Jurisdiction to flow from the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be founded in his Lawes, to be imparted to other Bishops, as the Popes Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars and Coadjutors, assumed by them into part of their charge, are Schismaticks; but the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers do thus. To which his onely answer is, <hi>that this is a more grosse and false imputation then any of the rest.</hi> Because it is not their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tenet, neither did I urge it against them all in general.</p>
               <p>But because he takes no notice of these te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, but as private opinions, <hi>If you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute against private opinions, cite your Authors, and argue against them, not the Church.</hi> Let him know, that these are the most common, &amp; most current opinions of their writers.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>that it is almost</hi> de fide <hi>a point of faith.</hi> He saith that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Florence</hi> seemed to have defined it,

But where were they heard, or tried, or condemned of heresy, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Councel or person that had Jurisdiction over them?

some of his owne party do confesse, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them: And <hi>Alphonsus á castro</hi> taketh his information upon trust from him. The plaine truth is, their onely crime is, that they will not submit to the Popes spirituall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and so were no fit company for an Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Councell.</p>
               <p>His demand. <hi>(Is not a Parliament the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall representative of the nation, unlesse every Lord though a knowne and condemned Rebell be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned? or unlesse every member that hath a right to sit there be present?)</hi> is altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Neither hath the Pope that power over a generall Councell that the king hath over the Parliament; Neither are the Protopatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs knowne condemned Rebels; Neither is this the case, whether the necessary or neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive absence of some particular members, but whether the absence of whole Provinces, and the much greater part of the Provinces of <hi>Christendome</hi> for want of due summons, do disable a Councell from being a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative of the whole Christian world. And as it is impertinent, so it makes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against himselfe. Never was there a ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a nationall Parliament in England, wherein so few members were present, as were in the pretended generall Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> at the deciding of the most weighty controversy concerning the rule of Faith. Never was there lawfull Parliament in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land wherein there were more Knights and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65027:229"/>
Burgesses out of one Province, then out of all the rest of the Kingdome; Never was there lawfull Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> the acts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of either of one kind or of another might be questioned by any single Province, as the acts of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in point of discipline are questioned by the Church of France. The question is not, whether Ecclesiasticall superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours may forbear to execute, but whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours may renounce and protest against the execution. One of the prime priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is to speak freely; but this was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi>

               <p>He excepteth against <hi>some angry expressions of mine,</hi> Where I call the Bishops of <hi>Italy hungry parasiticall pensioners, not foreseeing it might be retorted upon mine owne condition.</hi> And here he addeth in a scoffing manner, <hi>It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, my Lord, you keep a good table, speak the truth boldly, and have great revenues independent of any.</hi> I spake not there out of passion against them, nor of ancient Italian Bishops, but meer Episcopelles, a great part of which were Italians; nor all of them, but onely such as were the Popes creatures, raised and maintained by him for his owne ends: whether these were <hi>his hungry parasitical pensioners,</hi> they know best, who know most. As for my self, I never rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my self by any insinuations: I was never parasiticall pentioner to any man, nor much frequented any mans table. If mine owne be not so good as it hath been, yet contentment
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65027:230"/>
and a good conscience is a continuall feast, and a golden bed of rest. And I thank God, I can say heartily with holy <hi>Iob, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> What was this to his cause?</p>
               <p>To proove the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> was not free, I cited somethings out of the history of that Councell, and somethings out of <hi>Sleidan.</hi> To which he answereth nothing but this, That <hi>it is a false injurious calumny, taken out of</hi> Sleidan, <hi>accounted by their party a starke liar and forger.</hi> This is a very easy kind of refuting, as good as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thou liest.</p>
               <p>To the plea of the Patriarchal authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over Brittaine, I gave three solutions.</p>
               <p>First that Brittaine was no part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Patriarchate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that although it had been, yet the Popes have both quitted, and forfeited their Patriarchall power, and though they had not, yet it is lawfully transferred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the difference between them and us is not concerning any Patriarchall rights. To none of these doth he offer to give any answer, but onely to one passage, where I indeavour to proove that a spirituall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy from <hi>Christ,</hi> and a Patriarchall authority from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>se the Pope was undoubtedly constituted a Patriarch by the Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65027:230"/>
as undoubtedly he was not instituted a spirituall Prince by <hi>Christ.</hi> And all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that he giveth to this is, that I argue <hi>weakly &amp; sillily, Satis pro imperio.</hi> This is magisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call enough: as if he were another <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that we must receive his dictates for oracles. I wil set down the argument for the Readers sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. It may be at the second reading, this Refuter wil not find it altogether <hi>so weak &amp; silly. To bea Patriarch, &amp; to be an universal Bishop in that sense, are inconsistent, and implie a contradiction</hi> in adjecto. <hi>The one professeth human, the other</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth divine institution; the one hath a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Jurisdiction over a certain province; the other pretendeth to an unlimited jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the whole world: the one is subject to the Canons of the Fathers, &amp; a meer execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, &amp; can do nothing either against them or besides them; the other challengeth an absolute Soveraignity above the Canons, besides the Canons, against the Canons. To make them, to abbrogate them, to suspend their influence by a <hi>non obstante,</hi> to dispense with them in such cases wherein the Canons give no dispensative power, at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, when he will, where he will, to whom he will. Therefore to claime a power Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, and Sovereigne Monarchical regality over the Church, is implicitely and in effect to disclaime a Patriarchall Aristocraticall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and on the other side, the donation and acceptance of such a Patriarchall Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65027:231"/>
dignity, is a convincing proof that he was not formerly possessed of a Sovereigne Monarchicall Royalty.</p>
               <p>To the point of sacrifice, he saith, that <hi>I hide it in obscure terms, and shuffle certain common words. In answer,</hi> I believe his meaning is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that I have set it downe over distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If I shuffle any thing, I must shuffle my owne words, for I see no answer of his to shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle among them. His exception against our Registers, that <hi>he could never hear that any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick esteemed indications was ever admitted to a free perusall of them,</hi> Shewes only, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth not what our Registers are. They are publick offices, whither every man may repair at his pleasure, And if he wil be at the charge of a search &amp; a transcription, may not onely peruse them freely, but have an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick copy of any act that is there recorded</p>
               <p>Towards the conclusion of his treatise he inveigheth against our uncharitablenesse, that <hi>it is not enough to satisfie our uncharitable eyes, that so many of them have been hanged, drawn and quartered for their Religion</hi>; telling us, that <hi>on all occasions we are still upbraiding the liberty given to Papists.</hi> And adviseth us, never hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>to be so impertinent as to repine at their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Doubtlesse, he found this in his owne fancy: for in my discourse there is nothing either of repining or upbraiding: but this point of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws hath been formerly handled at large.</p>
               <p>Lastly; to his expedient to procure peace and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65027:231"/>
unity, that is, <hi>To receive the root of Christianity, that is a practicall infallibility in the Church</hi>: We do readily acknowledge that the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church is so far infallible, as is necessary to the salvation of Christians, that is the end of the Church. But the greater difficulty will be, what this Catholick Church is, wherein they are not onely divided from us, but more among themselves.</p>

The words are not <hi>potestatem tuam recognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> we acknowledge thy just power, yet even <hi>potestas</hi> is taken sometimes in the worser sense: as, <hi>potestas tenebrarum, the power of darknesse</hi>: but <hi>potentiam tuam recognoscimus,</hi> we acknowledge thy might; which words might be used by a true man to an high way robber. The Greeks accounted the Latins Hereticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and principally upon this ground of the Popes claim of a spiritual Monarchy, And that Gerson apprehended their words in this sense,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65027:232"/>
it may appear by the context. His position is this, <hi>that men ought not generally to be bound by the positive determinations of Popes, to hold and beleeve one and the same forme of government in things that do not immediately concerne the truth of our Faith, and the Gospel.</hi> From thence he proceedeth to set down some different Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the Greek &amp; Latine Churches, both which he doth justifie, citing S. <hi>Austin</hi> to proove that in all such things the custome of the country is to be observed.
