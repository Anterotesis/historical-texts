            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>In which his tongue extrauagant would range,</l>

               <l>That when the quarter day was two daies past,</l>
               <l>Went presently to gather rents in hast.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4032:27"/>And if, as oft it hapt, he brake good manner,</l>
               <l>He straight would plead the custome of the Mannor,</l>
               <l>Swearing he might distraine all goods and chattell,</l>
               <l>Were it in moueables, or else quick cattell.</l>
               <l>This Bayliffe, comming to a tenement,</l>
               <l>In the Tenants absence, straynd his wife for rent;</l>

               <l>The Tenant, by intelligence, did ghesse,</l>
               <l>The Bayliffe taken had a wrong distresse:</l>
               <l>And to the Bayliffes wife he went complaining,</l>
               <l>Of this her husbands vsage in distraining;</l>
               <l>Requesting her like curtesies to render,</l>
               <l>And to accept such rent as he would tender.</l>
               <l>She, whether moued with some strange compassion,</l>
               <l>Or that his tale did put her in new passion,</l>
               <l>Accepts his payment like a gentle wench;</l>

               <l>Actions of Battery, actions in the Case,</l>

               <l>Much bloud, much money had been spilt and spent,</l>

               <l>He sets not till he nine and fortie is.</l>
               <l>And thinking now his rest would sure be doubled,</l>
               <l>He lost it by the hand, with which sore troubled,</l>
               <l>He ioynes now all his stocke, vnto his stake,</l>
               <l>That of his fortune, he full proofe may make.</l>
               <l>At last both eldest hand and fiue and fifty,</l>
               <l>He thinketh now or neuer (thriue vnthrifty.)</l>
               <l>Now for the greatest rest he hath the push:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Crassus</hi> stopt a Club, and so was flush:</l>
               <l>And thus what with the stop, and with the packe,</l>
               <l>Poore <hi>Marcus,</hi> and his rest goes still to wracke.</l>
               <l>Now must he seeke new spoile to set his rest,</l>
               <l>For here his seeds turne weeds, his rest, vnrest.</l>
               <l>His land, his plate he pawnes, he sels his leases,</l>
               <l>To patch, to borrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shift, he neuer ceases.</l>
               <l>Till at the last, two Catch-poles him encounter,</l>
               <l>And by arrest, they beate him to the Counter.</l>
               <l>Now <hi>Marcus</hi> may set vp, all rests securely:</l>
               <l>For now he's sure to be encountred surely.</l>

               <l>A Certaine Mountebanke, or paltry Leach,</l>
               <l>Finding his Physick furdred not his thrift,</l>
               <l>Thought with himselfe to find some further drift.</l>
               <l>And though the skill were farre aboue his reach,</l>
               <l>He needs would proue a Priest, and falls to preach.</l>
               <l>But patching Sermons with a sorry shift,</l>
               <l>As needs they must that ere they learne will teach:</l>
               <l>At last, some foes so neerely doe him sift,</l>
               <l>And of such words and deeds did him appeach,</l>
               <l>As from his Liuing quite they did him lift,</l>
               <l>And of the Patron straight they begd the gift:</l>
               <l>And so the Mountebanke did ouer-reach.</l>

               <l>Gaue place vnto so sharpe and fierce a breach:</l>
               <l>Shutting vp all with this shrewd muttering speach,</l>

               <l>Bread hath beene made of straw in time of famine,</l>
               <l>In cutting off the tender knotted ioynts:</l>
               <l>But yet remaines one praise of straw to tell,</l>
               <l>Which all the other praise doth farre excell.</l>
               <l>That straw, which men, &amp; beasts, &amp; fowles haue scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</l>
               <l>Hath beene by curious Art, and hand industrious</l>
               <l>So wrought, that it hath shadowed, yea adorned</l>
               <l>A head and face of beauty and birth illustrious.</l>
               <l>Now praise I? No, I enuy now thy blisse,</l>
               <l>Ambitious straw, that so high placed is.</l>
               <l>What Architect this worke so strangely matcht?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4032:93"/>An yuory house, dores, rubies, windowes touch</l>
               <l>A gilded roofe, with straw all ouerthatcht.</l>
               <l>Where shall pearle bide, when place of straw is such?</l>
               <l>Now could I wish, alas, I wish too much,</l>
               <l>I might be straw-drawne to that liuely Tuch.</l>
               <l>But herein we may learne a good example,</l>
               <l>That vertuous Industry their worth can raise,</l>
               <l>Whom slanderous tongs tread vnder foot &amp; trample.</l>
               <l>This told my Muse; and straight she went her waies:</l>
               <l>Which (Lady) if you seriously allow,</l>
               <l>It is no toy, nor haue I broke my vow.</l>
